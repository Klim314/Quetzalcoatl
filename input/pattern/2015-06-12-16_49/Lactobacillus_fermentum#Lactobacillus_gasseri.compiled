TI  - Screening of Probiotic Candidates in Human Oral Bacteria for the Prevention of Dental Disease.
AB  - The oral cavity in healthy subjects has a well-balanced microbiota that consists  of more than 700 species. However, a disturbance of this balance, with an increase of harmful microbes and a decrease of beneficial microbes, causes oral disorders such as periodontal disease or dental caries. Nowadays, probiotics are expected to confer oral health benefits by modulating the oral microbiota. This study screened new probiotic candidates with potential oral health benefits and no harmful effects on the oral cavity. We screened 14 lactobacillus strains and 36 streptococcus strains out of 896 oral isolates derived from healthy subjects. These bacteria did not produce volatile sulfur compounds or water-insoluble glucan, had higher antibacterial activity against periodontal bacteria, and had higher adherence activity to oral epithelial cells or salivary-coated hydroxyapatite in vitro. We then evaluated the risk of primary cariogenicity and infective endocarditis of the selected oral isolates. As a result, Lactobacillus crispatus YIT 12319, Lactobacillus fermentum YIT 12320, Lactobacillus gasseri YIT 12321, and Streptococcus mitis YIT 12322 were selected because they showed no cariogenic potential in an artificial mouth system and a lower risk of experimental infective endocarditis in a rat model. These candidates are expected as new probiotics with potential oral health benefits and no adverse effects on general health.
TI  - Dietary Maillard reaction products and their fermented products reduce cardiovascular risk in an animal model.
AB  - This study examined the effects of Maillard reaction products (MRP) and MRP fermented by lactic acid bacteria on antioxidants and their enhancement of cardiovascular health in ICR mouse and rat models. In previous in vitro studies, the selected lactic acid bacteria were shown to significantly affect the activity of MRP. The expression of genes (e.g., superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) related to antioxidant activity was upregulated by Maillard-reacted sodium caseinate (cMRP), and cMRP fermented by Lactobacillus fermentum H9 (F-cMRP) synergistically increased the expression of catalase and superoxide dismutase when compared with the high-cholesterol-diet group. Bleeding time, the assay for determination of antithrombotic activity, was significantly prolonged by Maillard-reacted whey protein concentration (wMRP) and wMRP fermented by Lactobacillus gasseri H10 (F-wMRP), similar to the bleeding time of the aspirin group (positive control). In addition, the acute pulmonary thromboembolism-induced mice overcame severe body paralysis or death in both the wMRP and the F-wMRP groups. In the serum-level experiment, cMRP and F-cMRP significantly reduced the serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and triglycerides but had only a slight effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase also declined in the cMRP and F-cMRP intake groups compared with the high-cholesterol-diet group. In particular, F-cMRP showed the highest reducing effects on triglycerides, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase. Moreover, the expression of cholesterol-related genes in the F-cMRP group demonstrated greater effects than for the cMRP group in the level of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), and low-density lipoprotein receptors compared with the high-cholesterol-diet group. The protective role of cMRP and F-cMRP in the high-cholesterol group may have been the result of an antioxidative defense mechanism that regulated cholesterol synthesis and metabolism. Therefore, F-cMRP and cMRP have the potential to play preventive and therapeutic roles in the management of cardiovascular disease.
TI  - An assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of Lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.
AB  - There is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. In this study, the adhesion of 10 Lactobacillus species was investigated using H357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. Coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. The results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). All strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity. All strains, except Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl acetate. There was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0.883, P < 0.001). The highest mean for autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the Lact. gasseri strains. Correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. This study indicated that the Lact. gasseri, Lact. fermentum, and Lact. paracasei strains might be potential probiotics for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. It should also be emphasized that a selective process for probiotic strains is required. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. These abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. This is the first study to investigate the oral Lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. Significant results were found for the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for aggregation among certain strains of Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus paracasei. This observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use in oral health.
TI  - The use of PFGE method in genotyping of selected bacteria species of the Lactobacillus genus.
AB  - Bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus are a group of microorganisms in which there are numerous strains with high probiotic potential. In recent years, interest in probiotics as nutritional supplements and as drugs has significantly increased. In order to carry out research on probiotic bacterial strains, their beneficial effects on the human body should be confirmed and molecular typing should be carried out with the aim of marking a specific strain. Pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) is the reference method employed for bacterial genotyping, but it is commonly used for typing mainly pathogenic bacteria. The following study describes a way of performing PFGE analysis in genotyping of bacteria species belonging to the genus Lactobacillus: L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. plantarum and L. rhamnosus.
TI  - Probiotic and technological properties of Lactobacillus spp. strains from the human stomach in the search for potential candidates against gastric microbial dysbiosis.
AB  - This work characterizes a set of lactobacilli strains isolated from the stomach of healthy humans that might serve as probiotic cultures. Ten different strains were recognized by rep-PCR and PFGE fingerprinting among 19 isolates from gastric biopsies and stomach juice samples. These strains belonged to five species, Lactobacillus gasseri (3), Lactobacillus reuteri (2), Lactobacillus vaginalis (2), Lactobacillus fermentum (2) and Lactobacillus casei (1). All ten strains were subjected to a series of in vitro tests to assess their functional and technological properties, including acid resistance, bile tolerance, adhesion to epithelial gastric cells, production of antimicrobial compounds, inhibition of Helicobacter pylori, antioxidative activity, antibiotic resistance, carbohydrate fermentation, glycosidic activities, and ability to grow in milk. As expected, given their origin, all strains showed good resistance to low pH (3.0), with small reductions in counts after 90 min exposition to this pH. Species- and strain-specific differences were detected in terms of the production of antimicrobials, antagonistic effects toward H. pylori, antioxidative activity and adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. None of the strains showed atypical resistance to a series of 16 antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. Two L. reuteri strains were deemed as the most appropriate candidates to be used as potential probiotics against microbial gastric disorders; these showed good survival under gastrointestinal conditions reproduced in vitro, along with strong anti-Helicobacter and antioxidative activities. The two L. reuteri strains further displayed appropriated technological traits for their inclusion as adjunct functional cultures in fermented dairy products.
TI  - Diversity and functional characterization of Lactobacillus spp. isolated throughout the ripening of a hard cheese.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the Lactobacillus spp. intra- and inter- species diversity in a Piedmont hard cheese made of raw milk without thermal treatment and without addition of industrial starter, and to perform a first screening for potential functional properties. A total of 586 isolates were collected during the cheese production and identified by means of molecular methods: three hundred and four were identified as Lactobacillus rhamnosus, two hundred and forty as Lactobacillus helveticus, twenty six as Lactobacillus fermentum, eleven as Lactobacillus delbrueckii, three as Lactobacillus pontis, and two as Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus reuteri, respectively. A high genetic heterogeneity was detected by using the repetitive bacterial DNA element fingerprinting (rep-PCR) with the use of (GTG)5 primer resulting in eight clusters of L. helveticus and sixteen clusters in the case of L. rhamnosus. Most of isolates showed a high auto-aggregation property, low hydrophobicity values, and a general low survival to simulated digestion process. However, sixteen isolates showed promising functional characteristics.
TI  - Preventive effect of fermented Maillard reaction products from milk proteins in cardiovascular health.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the dual effect of Maillard reaction and fermentation on the preventive cardiovascular effects of milk proteins. Maillard reaction products (MRP) were prepared from the reaction between milk proteins, such as whey protein concentrates (WPC) and sodium caseinate (SC), and lactose. The hydrolysates of MRP were obtained from fermentation by lactic acid bacteria (LAB; i.e., Lactobacillus gasseri H10, L. gasseri H11, Lactobacillus fermentum H4, and L. fermentum H9, where human-isolated strains were designated H1 to H15), which had excellent proteolytic and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activities (>20%). The antioxidant activity of MRP was greater than that of intact proteins in assays of the reaction with 2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt and trivalent ferric ions; moreover, the effect of MRP was synergistically improved by fermentation. The Maillard reaction dramatically increased the level of antithrombotic activity and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) inhibitory effect of milk proteins, but did not change the level of activity for micellar cholesterol solubility. Furthermore, specific biological properties were enhanced by fermentation. Lactobacillus gasseri H11 demonstrated the greatest activity for thrombin and HMGR inhibition in Maillard-reacted WPC, by 42 and 33%, respectively, whereas hydrolysates of Maillard-reacted SC fermented by L. fermentum H9 demonstrated the highest reduction rate for micellar cholesterol solubility, at 52%. In addition, the small compounds that were likely released by fermentation of MRP were identified by size-exclusion chromatography. Therefore, MRP and hydrolysates of fermented MRP could be used to reduce cardiovascular risks.
TI  - Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in human breast milk: influence of antibiotherapy and other host and clinical factors.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to study the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria population in human milk of healthy women, and to investigate the influence that several factors (including antibioteraphy during pregnancy and lactation, country and date of birth, delivery mode, or infant age) may exert on such population. METHODS: A total of 160 women living in Germany or Austria provided the breast milk samples. Initially, 66 samples were randomly selected and cultured on MRS-Cys agar plates. Then, the presence of DNA from the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, and from most of the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species that were isolated, was assessed by qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using genus- and species-specific primers. RESULTS: Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could be isolated from the milk of 27 (40.91%) and 7 (10.61%), respectively, of the 66 cultured samples. On the contrary, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium sequences were detected by PCR in 108 (67.50%) and 41 (25.62%), respectively, of the 160 samples analyzed. The Lactobacillus species most frequently isolated and detected was L salivarius (35.00%), followed by L fermentum (25.00%) and L gasseri (21.88%), whereas B breve (13.75%) was the bifidobacterial species most commonly recovered and whose DNA was most regularly found. The number of lactobacilli- or bifidobacteria-positive samples was significantly lower in women who had received antibiotherapy during pregnancy or lactation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that either the presence of lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria or their DNA may constitute good markers of a healthy human milk microbiota that has not been altered by the use of antibiotics.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces as potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages.
AB  - A total of 109 lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces were identified by partial 16S rRNA, cpn60 and/or pheS sequencing. Lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by Enterococcus (38%). Lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and Enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. A further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on Lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant genus in this type of product. Lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. The best strains according to the results obtained were Lactobacillus casei/paracasei CTC1677, L. casei/paracasei CTC1678, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CTC1679, L. gasseri CTC1700, L. gasseri CTC1704, Lactobacillus fermentum CTC1693. Those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. L. casei/paracasei CTC1677, L. casei/paracasei CTC1678 and L. rhamnosus CTC1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) CFU/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.
TI  - Molecular identification of Lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a Brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  - Puba or carima is a Brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. A total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar (MRS); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. In all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 CFU/g). 16S-23S rRNA ARDRA pattern assigned 116 isolates to the Lactobacillus genus, represented by the species Lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), Lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), Lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), Lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), Lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), Lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), Lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and Lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). recA gene-multiplex PCR analysis revealed that L. plantarum group isolates belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). Genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based PCR using the primer ERIC2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). The Lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. All the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. This antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. This study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of Lactobacillus spp. of puba.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate Mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus jensenii, L. iners, L. crispatus and L. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. However, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. The present study was performed to genetically determine the identity of Lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (BV) intermediate Mexican women. METHODS: In a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant Mexican women. The samples were classified into groups according to the Nugent score criteria proposed for detection of BV: normal (N), intermediate (I) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). We examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. RESULTS: Clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene: L. acidophilus (14/25), L. reuteri (6/25), L. casei (4/25) and L. buchneri (1/25). The remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as Enterococcus species. Within the L. acidophilus group, L. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by L. jensenii and L. crispatus. L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the L. reuteri, L. casei and L. buchneri groups, respectively. ERIC profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the L. gasseri and L. fermentum species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree with previous studies showing that L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. Additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant Mexican (Hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.
TI  - Inhibition of HIV and HSV infection by vaginal lactobacilli in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: The cervico-vaginal mucosa which is populated with microflora (mostly includes lactobacilli) is the portal of entry for sexually transmitted pathogens. METHODS: The in vitro anti-viral effect of vaginal and non-vaginal lactobacillus was evaluated using single cycle HIV-1 replication and HSV-2 plaque reduction assays. The XTT proliferation assay was used to monitor the cellular toxicity. The in vivo anti-HSV-1 activity was evaluated in BALB/c mouse model by monitoring skin lesion and immune response development. RESULTS AND MAJOR CONCLUSION: DMEM culture supernatant of L. Gasseri and L. fermentum (PH 7.3) did not show toxic effect but inhibited 50% of HIV replication at 12 and 31% concentrations, respectively. Co-culture of L. gasseri (1000 CFU/ target cell) showed mild cytotoxicity but inhibited 68% of HIV replication. The supernatant of L. crispatus inhibited 50% of HSV replication at 4% and also co-culture of L. gasseri, L. rhamnosus and L. crispatus revokes almost all of the HSV multiplication. Culture supernatants of L. gasseri and L. crispatus had significant virucidal effect against the HIV and HSV and inhibited HSV infection in a stage before viral entry to the target cells. Alive L. gasseri cells showed high potential for inhibiting HSV-1 infection in vivo condition. Current data indicates that lactobacilli supernatant encompasses components with neutralizing activity against HIV and HSV and it would be a determinant factor for viral diseases transmission and promising lead for anti-viral probiotic design.
TI  - Bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy Ethiopian infants.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from faecal samples of healthy Ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. One hundred fifty LAB were obtained from 28 healthy Ethiopian infants. The isolates belonged to Lactobacillus (81/150), Enterococcus (54/150) and Streptococcus (15/150) genera. Lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while Enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. Bacteriocin-producing LAB species were isolated from eight of the infants. Many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from Streptococcus salivarius, avicin A (class IIa) from Enterococcus avium, one class IIa bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from E. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from Lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri isolate. Susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. The streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. All enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. Only one E. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. Tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to E. faecalis (47 %) and Enterococcus faecium (33 %). Screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. The structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being E. faecalis and Enterococcus raffinosus. This study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal LAB of Ethiopian infants while virulence factors occur at low levels.
TI  - The application of genetics methods to differentiation of three Lactobacillus species of human origin.
AB  - In recent decades, the interest in probiotics as diet supplements or drugs has increased. In order to determine a specific bacterial isolate to be probiotic, it is necessary to describe precisely its probiotic characteristics and taxonomic properties, including the strain level. Most of the well-known genotyping methods were designed for the commonly-found pathogenic bacteria. The objective of this study is to undertake an attempt at standardization of FISH, RAPD and PFGE methods to genotype and identify the bacteria belonging to Lactobacillus fermentum, L. gasseri and L. plantarum species. The FISH probes have been designed and tested for Lactobacillus fermentum, L. gasseri and L. plantarum species and an endeavor has been made at standardization of RAPD and PFGE methods for these bacterial species. Moreover, the MLST method was applied to differentiate Lactobacillus plantarum strains. L. plantarum isolated from humans could not be genetically diversified with the use of RAPD, PFGE or MLST methods; only the strains originating from plants have displayed diversification among themselves and have been different from the strains of human origin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo assessment of cytochrome P450-mediated herb-drug interaction of Ssang-hwa-tang.
AB  - We have evaluated the herb-drug interaction potential of Ssang-hwa-tang (SHT) mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition/induction. Further, the effects of fermentation on the CYP-mediated herb-drug interaction potential were determined. SHT showed inhibitory activity toward CYP1A2, but not 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4 in human liver microsomes. The results of the enzyme kinetic study suggested that the SHT-induced CYP1A2 inhibition is mixed reversible inhibition. The hepatic CYP expression and activity in rats treated with SHT were examined. The expression/activity of CYP2E1 increased as a result of SHT extract treatment (P<0.005 or P<0.001, respectively), which raises the possibility that SHT may increase the toxicity of environmental toxicants through the elevation of CYP2E1-mediated metabolic activation. SHT fermentation using Lactobacillus fermentum or Lactobacillus gasseri resulted in attenuation of the SHT-induced CYP1A2 inhibition, but not CYP2E1 induction, suggesting that changes in the chemical composition of SHT through fermentation can affect the inhibition of CYP1A2 activity.
TI  - Studies on the effects of probiotic Lactobacillus mixture given orally on vaginal and rectal colonization and on parameters of vaginal health in women with intermediate vaginal flora.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The vaginal microflora is composed of many bacterial species and plays a major role in maintaining the balance of this complex environment. This study was conducted in order to assess the degree and persistence of the colonization of vaginal epithelium by strains from an orally administered mixture of lactobacilli, containing Lactobacillus fermentum 57A, Lactobacillus plantarum 57B and Lactobacillus gasseri 57C. We also monitored its effects on parameters of vaginal health, especially total lactobacilli counts, vaginal pH and Nugent score. STUDY DESIGN: The patient group in this open study consisted of clinically healthy women with intermediate vaginal flora. Altogether 37 women were included in the study; 25 finished the full cycle consisting of 8 visits during 70 days. Lactobacillus mixture was administered as 1x10(8) c.f.u. once a day for 60 days. Lactobacillus isolates collected from vaginal and rectal samples from studied women during all visits were typed using molecular methods (PFGE for L. fermentum and L. gasseri and MLST for L. plantarum). Total lactobacilli counts, vaginal pH and Nugent score were also determined during the visits. RESULTS: We confirmed that the ingested strains were able to reach and colonize both sites within the third and eighth visits, i.e. between the 20th and 70th days of the study. Maximal colonization was recorded between the fifth and seventh visits (31st-60th days). Moreover, ingestion of the Lactobacillus mixture was related to normalization of vaginal parameters (within 28-60 days after the initiation of the treatment). This was demonstrated by a decrease of vaginal pH and Nugent score together with an increase of total numbers of lactobacilli in the vagina and rectum. No adverse events were noted during the course of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Oral application of the combination of the three probiotic strains derived from vaginal microbiota of healthy woman with high adherence abilities to both vaginal and colonic epithelium in vitro shows that both individual strains and their mixture can colonize vagina for some weeks, the effect of which is correlated with significant improvement of such parameters like pH and Nugent score values and total numbers of vaginal lactobacilli. This indicates that the mixture may be a good candidate for the planned double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized studies involving larger numbers of women.
TI  - Comparative meta-analysis of the effect of Lactobacillus species on weight gain in humans and animals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity is associated with alteration of the gut microbiota. In order to clarify the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics (LCP) on weight we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies and experimental models. We intended to assess effects by Lactobacillus species. METHODS: A broad search with no date or language restriction was performed. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and comparative clinical studies in humans and animals or experimental models assessing the effect of Lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight. We primarily attempted to extract and use change from baseline values. Data were extracted independently by two authors. Results were pooled by host and by Lactobacillus species and are summarized in a meta-analysis of standardized difference in means (SMDs). RESULTS: We identified and included 17 RCTs in humans, 51 studies on farm animals and 14 experimental models. Lactobacillus acidophilus administration resulted in significant weight gain in humans and in animals (SMD 0.15; 95% confidence intervals 0.05-0.25). Results were consistent in humans and animals. Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus ingluviei were associated with weight gain in animals. Lactobacillus plantarum was associated with weight loss in animals and Lactobacillus gasseri was associated with weight loss both in obese humans and in animals. CONCLUSIONS: Different Lactobacillus species are associated different effects on weight change that are host-specific. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of Lactobacillus species in the human energy harvest and weight regulation. Attention should be drawn to the potential effects of commonly marketed lactobacillus-containing probiotics on weight gain.
TI  - Qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal Chinese women.
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of Lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy Chinese women. Vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy Chinese women were analysed using a 16S rRNA gene clone library and species-specific PCR followed by sequencing and real-time PCR. A total of 13 different Lactobacillus species were detected. Species-specific PCR showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. Among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of Lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. In the fertile women, L. iners (82.61%), L. crispatus (70.65%) and L. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than L. jensenii (40.22%), L. acidophilus (39.13%), L. brevis (23.91%), L. plantarum (5.43%), L. johnsonii (3.26%), L. fermentum (2.17%), L. salivarius (2.17%), L. rhamnosus (1.09%), L. reuteri (1.09%) and L. paracasei (1.09%); L. delbrueckii was not detected. In the postmenopausal women, L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, L. reuteri and L. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just a few samples. The prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific PCR. According to the semiquantitative analysis, the total Lactobacillus DNA concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. Sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by L. iners, 35% by L. crispatus, and 2% by L. gasseri. Associations between pairs of Lactobacillus species in fertile women were significant (P<0.05) between the following pairs: L. iners and L. gasseri, L. iners and L. jensenii, L. iners and L. acidophilus, L. gasseri and L. acidophilus, and L. gasseri and L. jensenii. In conclusion, this study provided detailed information on Lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy Chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. The study also showed that the diversity of Lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. According to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific PCR and comparison against a 16S rRNA gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. These findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of bacterial communities. According to our findings regarding species associations, L. iners and L. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of other vaginal Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Acid production and growth by oral Lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral Lactobacillus species. METHODS: Thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of Lactobacillus, representing nine species, including Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. Anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (pH 7.0). Acid production and growth were measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. RESULTS: Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and Lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species. They also produced more acid than the others. Lactobacillus vaginalis showed the lowest rate of growth and acid production. These findings demonstrated that the different species of Lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. CONCLUSION: There was variation in acid production and growth between the Lactobacillus species. The strongest acid producers were Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. It seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.
TI  - Differential targeting of the E-Cadherin/beta-Catenin complex by gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli improves epithelial barrier function.
AB  - The intestinal ecosystem is balanced by dynamic interactions between resident and incoming microbes, the gastrointestinal barrier, and the mucosal immune system. However, in the context of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), where the integrity of the gastrointestinal barrier is compromised, resident microbes contribute to the development and perpetuation of inflammation and disease. Probiotic bacteria have been shown to exert beneficial effects, e.g., enhancing epithelial barrier integrity. However, the mechanisms underlying these beneficial effects are only poorly understood. Here, we comparatively investigated the effects of four probiotic lactobacilli, namely, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, and L. rhamnosus, in a T84 cell epithelial barrier model. Results of DNA microarray experiments indicating that lactobacilli modulate the regulation of genes encoding in particular adherence junction proteins such as E-cadherin and beta-catenin were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Furthermore, we show that epithelial barrier function is modulated by Gram-positive probiotic lactobacilli via their effect on adherence junction protein expression and complex formation. In addition, incubation with lactobacilli differentially influences the phosphorylation of adherence junction proteins and the abundance of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms such as PKCdelta that thereby positively modulates epithelial barrier function. Further insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms triggered by these probiotics might also foster the development of novel strategies for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases (e.g., IBD).
TI  - Oral and faecal lactobacilli and their expression of mannose-specific adhesins in individuals with and without IgA deficiency.
AB  - Lactobacilli are present in the intestine and oral cavity of most adults. Secretory IgA in mucosal secretions may provide carbohydrate receptors for bacterial adhesins. Here, oral and faecal samples from 33 IgA-deficient individuals and 34 controls were cultured for lactobacilli, which were identified using species-specific PCR or partial 16S rDNA sequencing and tested for expression of mannose-specific adhesins. Lactobacilli were found in the oral cavity of 76% of IgA-deficient and 85% of control individuals. Lactobacillus paracasei and Lactobacillus gasseri dominated in both groups. Lactobacillus fermentum was less common in IgA-deficient individuals than in controls (p=0.0055) and Lactobacillus salivarius was less common in symptomatic than in healthy IgA-deficient individuals (p=0.0051). Faecal samples yielded lactobacilli in most individuals. L. paracasei was most frequent, followed by L. gasseri and Lactobacillus plantarum. Mannose-specific adhesins were expressed more frequently by oral than by faecal isolates (p=0.032) and oral isolates adhered in higher numbers than faecal isolates (46 vs. 14 bacteria/cell, p=0.0038). Faecal isolates from IgA-deficient individuals more frequently expressed mannose-specific adhesins than faecal isolates from controls (p=0.039). Mannose-specific adhesins may be a colonisation factor in the oral cavity, and the presence of secretory IgA may modify adhesin expression. However, secretory IgA seems to have little influence on Lactobacillus species distribution.
TI  - Safety and persistence of orally administered human Lactobacillus sp. strains in  healthy adults.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the safety and persistence of selected Lactobacillus strains in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of healthy adult volunteers after oral consumption of high doses of lactobacilli to identify potential candidates for probiotic and biotechnological applications. In the first phase of the study, nine individuals consumed capsules containing Lactobacillus gasseri 177 and E16B7, Lactobacillus acidophilus 821-3, Lactobacillus paracasei 317 and Lactobacillus fermentum 338-1-1 (each daily dose 1x1010 cfu) for 5 consecutive days. Data on gut health, blood parameters, and liver and kidney function were collected. The persistence of Lactobacillus strains was assessed by culturing combined with arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) on days 0, 5, 8, 10 and 20 from faecal samples. All strains survived gastrointestinal passage and were detected on the 5th day. L. acidophilus 821-3 was detected in four volunteers on the 8th day (4.3 to 7.0 log10 cfu/g) and in two on the 10th day (8.3 and 3.9 log10 cfu/g, respectively). In the second phase of the study, five additional volunteers consumed L. acidophilus 821-3 (daily 1x1010 cfu) for 5 consecutive days. The strain was subsequently detected in faeces of all individuals using real-time PCR on the 10th day (range 4.6-6.7; median 6.0 log10 cell/g) in both phases of the study for at least 5 days after discontinuation of consumption. The administration of high doses of different Lactobacillus strains did not result in any severe adverse effects in GIT and/or abnormal values of blood indices. Thus, the strain L. acidophilus 821-3 is a promising candidate for probiotic and biotechnological applications. Further studies will be performed to confirm the strain persistence and safety in a larger number of individuals.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - Enhanced growth of lactobacilli and bioconversion of isoflavones in biotin-supplemented soymilk upon ultrasound-treatment.
AB  - This study aimed at utilizing ultrasound treatment to further enhance the growth  of lactobacilli and their isoflavone bioconversion activities in biotin-supplemented soymilk. Strains of lactobacilli (Lactobacillus acidophilus BT 1088, L. fermentum BT 8219, L. acidophilus FTDC 8633, L. gasseri FTDC 8131) were treated with ultrasound (30 kHz, 100 W) at different amplitudes (20%, 60% and 100%) for 60, 120 and 180 s prior to inoculation and fermentation in biotin-soymilk. The treatment affected the fatty acids chain of the cellular membrane lipid bilayer, as shown by an increased lipid peroxidation (P<0.05). This led to increased membrane fluidity and subsequently, membrane permeability (P<0.05). The permeabilized cellular membranes had facilitated nutrient internalization and subsequent growth enhancement (P<0.05). Higher amplitudes and longer durations of the treatment promoted growth of lactobacilli in soymilk, with viable counts exceeding 9 log CFU/mL. The intracellular and extracellular beta-glucosidase specific activities of lactobacilli were also enhanced (P<0.05) upon ultrasound treatment, leading to increased bioconversion of isoflavones in soymilk, particularly genistin and malonyl genistin to genistein. Results from this study show that ultrasound treatment on lactobacilli cells promotes (P<0.05) the beta-glucosidase activity of cells for the benefit of enhanced (P<0.05) isoflavone glucosides bioconversion to bioactive aglycones in soymilk.
TI  - Evaluation of probiotic characteristics of newly isolated Lactobacillus spp.: immune modulation and longevity.
AB  - In the current study, the probiotic potential of approximately 350 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Korean infant feces and Kimchi was investigated. Common probiotic properties of the bacterial strains, such as acid tolerance, bile tolerance and adhesion to human intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29 cells), were examined. Some strains were found to have immune modulatory and antimicrobial properties. Antagonistic activity against a panel of pathogenic bacteria was found to be strain dependent. To evaluate the immune modulatory activity of the strains, lymphocyte interferon (IFN)-gamma secretion was determined in conjunction with cell proliferation. Some strains of Lactobacillus gasseri, L. fermentum and L. plantarum exhibited increased IFN-gamma levels and lymphocyte proliferation. To evaluate the effects of these immune modulating lactobacilli on host life span, Caenorhabditis elegans was used as an in vivo model. Nematodes that were supplied heat-killed lactobacilli as a food source exhibited obvious differences in life span compared with those fed Escherichia coli OP50. The mean life span (determined as mean percent survival) of worms fed L. plantarum CJLP133 and L. fermentum LA12 was 13.89% and 13.69% greater, respectively, than that of control nematodes after 21 days (P=0.036 and 0.043, respectively). In addition, some of safety profiles, including hemolytic type, gelatin hydration and degradation of urea, were found to be positive. These newly identified lactobacilli hold promise for use as probiotic agents, feed additives and/or in food applications.
TI  - Screening for lactobacilli with probiotic properties in the infant gut microbiota.
AB  - Lactobacilli are believed to be beneficial for the human hosts and are currently  being evaluated as potentially probiotic bacteria. In this study, Lactobacillus strains were isolated from infant faeces and were examined in vitro for potential probiotic properties. Faecal specimens from 63 healthy, full-term infants were collected at 4, 30 and 90 days after delivery. Seventy-four Lactobacillus strains were isolated and one or more different phenotypes from each infant (n = 44) were selected for further testing. The bacterial isolates were identified mainly as L. gasseri, L. crispatus, Lactobacillus paracasei, L. salivarius, L. fermentum after amplification and sequencing of 16s rRNA gene. The strains were examined for acid and bile tolerance, adhesion to Caco-2 cells, antibiotic susceptibility and antimicrobial activity against selected enteric pathogens. The great majority of the isolated lactobacilli were susceptible to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tetracycline, erythromycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol and rifampicin. Resistance to vancomycin or bacitracin was detected to 34% of the strains. Twenty strains out of forty-four exhibited significant tolerance to bile salts. Those strains were subsequently tested for resistance to low pH conditions (pH 2 and 3). Interestingly, 85% (17 strains) of the tested lactobacilli remained unaffected at pH 3 after 3 h of incubation, 6 strains were found resistant at pH 2 after 1.5 h and only 2 strains found resistant after 3 h of incubation. Two of the strains were able to adhere to Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, two isolates fulfilled the in vitro probiotic criteria and are good candidates for further in vivo evaluation.
TI  - (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting of lactobacilli isolated from cervix of healthy women.
AB  - A group of lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of 31 healthy women was characterized by (GTG)(5)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting in order to evaluate this method for identification of vaginal lactobacilli. Obtained fingerprints were compared with profiles available in an in-house database of the CCM bacteria collection covering type and reference strains of multiple lactic acid bacteria including lactobacilli. Selected strains representing individual clusters were further identified by pheS gene sequencing. In total, six lactobacillus species were found among lactobacilli isolated from the cervix of healthy women. The (GTG)(5)-PCR method identified Lactobacillus gasseri (11 strains), Lactobacillus fermentum (one), and some of the Lactobacillus jensenii strains (eight out of 11), but failed to identify the remaining strains, including the Lactobacillus crispatus (18), Lactobacillus mucosae (one), and Lactobacillus vaginalis (one) species. L. jensenii strains were distributed over two fingerprint clusters. The majority of samples was dominated by one (GTG)(5)-PCR type. The rep-PCR fingerprinting using the (GTG)(5) primer allowed straightforward identification of many, but not all, isolates. This method has been shown to be a useful tool for fast screening and grouping of vaginal lactobacilli, but its combination with another identification method is needed to obtain reliable identification results. In addition, Lactobacillus acidophilus was not shown to be the most common inhabitant of the female genital tract as generally assumed.
TI  - An in vitro protocol for direct isolation of potential probiotic lactobacilli from raw bovine milk and traditional fermented milks.
AB  - A method for isolating potential probiotic lactobacilli directly from traditional milk-based foods was developed. The novel digestion/enrichment protocol was set up taking care to minimize the protective effect of milk proteins and fats and was validated testing three commercial fermented milks containing well-known probiotic Lactobacillus strains. Only probiotic bacteria claimed in the label were isolated from two out of three commercial fermented milks. The application of the new protocol to 15 raw milk samples and 6 traditional fermented milk samples made it feasible to isolate 11 potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains belonging to Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus johnsonii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Lactobacillus vaginalis species. Even though further analyses need to ascertain functional properties of these lactobacilli, the novel protocol set-up makes it feasible to isolate quickly potential probiotic strains from traditional milk-based foods reducing the amount of time required by traditional procedures that, in addition, do not allow to isolate microorganisms occurring as sub-dominant populations.
TI  - Predominant genera of fecal microbiota in children with atopic dermatitis are not altered by intake of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bi-07.
AB  - The effect of probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM and Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07 on the composition of the Lactobacillus group, Bifidobacterium and the total bacterial population in feces from young children with atopic dermatitis was investigated. The study included 50 children randomized to intake of one of the probiotic strain or placebo. Microbial composition was characterized by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, quantitative PCR and, in a subset of subjects, by pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The core population of the Lactobacillus group was identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus oris, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, while the bifidobacterial community included Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum and Bifidobacterium catenulatum. The fecal numbers of L. acidophilus and B. lactis increased significantly after intervention, indicating survival of the ingested bacteria. The levels of Bifidobacterium correlated positively (P=0.03), while the levels of the Lactobacillus group negatively (P=0.01) with improvement of atopic eczema evaluated by the Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis index. This correlation was observed across the whole study cohort and not attributed to the probiotic intake. The main conclusion of the study is that administration of L. acidophilus NCFM and B. lactis Bi-07 does not affect the composition and diversity of the main bacterial populations in feces.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Correlation between api 50 ch and multiplex polymerase chain reaction for the identification of vaginal lactobacilli in isolates.
AB  - Identification of Lactobacillus sp. strains by phenotypic methods may lead to doubtful results possibly interfering in the reliability of the epidemiological and probiotics studies. Therefore this study aimed to determine the best methodology for the identification of the large diversity of lactobacilli species found in the vagina by comparing two techniques, one based on their biochemical profile and other employing molecular biology. A carbohydrate fermentation test (API 50 CH) was compared with multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the identification of species of vaginal lactobacilli from 135 healthy women. The kappa index was used to evaluate agreement between the methods. Using the molecular technique, L. crispatus (32.6%), L. jensenii (25%) and L. gasseri (20.6%) were the most frequent species. However, using the biochemical technique, the most frequent species were: L. acidophilus (34.8%), L. crispatus (27.2%) and L. fermentum (13%). Although L. acidophilus was the most frequent specie found by biochemical tests, no strain of this microorganism was detected by PCR. Agreement between the methods was low for identification of all the most common species. Although rates of L. crispatus detected were similar using both methods (32.6% and 27.2%), agreement between them was relatively low (kappa = 0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed the limitation of the biochemical method and the applicability of a previously published molecular method (Multiplex PCR) for the identification of lactobacilli in the vaginal tract, focusing on further necessity of its improvement for also targeting L. vaginalis and L. iners.
TI  - Protective effect of Ssanghwa-tang fermented by Lactobacillus fermentum against carbon tetrachloride-induced acute hepatotoxicity in rats.
AB  - Ssanghwa-tang (SHT) is a traditional herbal medicine formula that has been used for the development of physical strength, relief of pain, and the reduction of fatigue. In this study, we fermented SHT with Lactobacillus fermentum (L. fermentum), Lactobacillus gasseri (L.gasseri), or Lactobacillus casei (L.casei) to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of SHT and fermented SHT with Lactobacillus on carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver injury in rats. Rats were given CCl(4) (1 ml/kg, 50% CCl(4) in olive oil) intraperitoneally and either SHT or fermented SHTs (15 ml/kg) was administered 30 min before CCl(4). At 24 hr after CCl(4) injection, the levels of transaminases in the serum were markedly increased. These increases were significantly attenuated by either SHT + L. fermentum or SHT+ L.gasseri. However, SHT and SHT + L.casei showed slight suppression of the increase of transaminases. The liver histological changes were diminished by treatment with SHT + L. fermentum. Additionally, the potential hepatoprotective effect of fermented-SHTs correlated with the amount of unknown metabolite which is produced during fermentation process with L. fermentum, L.gasseri, or L.casei. Therefore, these results suggest that the hepatoprotective effect of SHT may be improved by fermentation with L. fermentum and the intestinal bacterial enzyme activities may likely play an important role in the pharmacological action of herbal medicines.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria colonization and clinical outcome after probiotic supplementation in conventionally treated bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
AB  - This randomized double-blind placebo controlled study assessed the vaginal colonization of lactic acid bacteria and clinical outcome. Vaginal capsules containing L gasseri LN40, Lactobacillus fermentum LN99, L. casei subsp. rhamnosus LN113 and P. acidilactici LN23, or placebos were administered for five days to 95 women after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis. Vulvovaginal examinations and vaginal samplings were performed before and after administration, after the first and second menstruation, and after six months. Presence of LN strains was assessed using RAPD analysis. LN strains were present 2-3 days after administration in 89% of the women receiving LN strains (placebo: 0%, p < 0.0001). After one menstruation 53% were colonized by at least one LN strain. Nine percent were still colonized six months after administration. Ninety-three percent of the women receiving LN strains were cured 2-3 days after administration (placebo: 83%), and 78% after one menstruation (placebo: 71%) (ns). The intervention group experienced less malodorous discharge 2-3 days after administration (p = 0.03) and after the second menstruation (p = 0.04), compared with placebo. In summary, five days of vaginal administration of LN strains after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis lead to vaginal colonization, somewhat fewer recurrences and less malodorous discharge.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of automated ribotyping and RAPD-PCR for typing of Lactobacillus spp. occurring in dental caries.
AB  - A group of 67 Lactobacillus spp. strains containing Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus salivarius species isolated from early childhood caries and identified to the species level in a previous study (Svec et al., Folia Microbiol 54:53-58, 2009) was characterized by automated ribotyping performed by the RiboPrinter microbial characterization system and by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting (RAPD-PCR) with M13 primer to evaluate these techniques for characterization of lactobacilli associated with dental caries. Ribotyping revealed 55 riboprints among the analysed group. The automatic identification process performed by the RiboPrinter system identified 18 strains to the species level, however cluster analysis divided obtained ribotype patterns into individual clusters mostly corresponding to the species assignment of particular strains. RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed by the individual Lactobacillus spp. showed higher variability than the ribotype patterns and the fingerprint profiles generated by the analysed species were distributed among one to four clusters. In conclusion, ribotyping is shown to be more convenient for the identification purposes while RAPD-PCR fingerprinting results indicate this method is a better tool for typing of Lactobacillus spp. strains occurring in dental caries.
TI  - Microbial risk markers for childhood caries in pediatricians' offices.
AB  - Dental caries in pre-school children has significant public health and health disparity implications. To determine microbial risk markers for this infection, this study aimed to compare the microbiota of children with early childhood caries with that of caries-free children. Plaque samples from incisors, molars, and the tongue from 195 children attending pediatricians' offices were assayed by 74 DNA probes and by PCR to Streptococcus mutans. Caries-associated factors included visible plaque, child age, race, and snacking habits. Species were detected more frequently from tooth than tongue samples. Lactobacillus gasseri (p < 0.01), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus vaginalis, and S. mutans with Streptococcus sobrinus (all p < 0.05) were positively associated with caries. By multifactorial analysis, the probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus was negatively associated with caries. Prevotella nigrescens was the only species (p < 0.05) significantly associated with caries by the 'false discovery' rate. Analysis of the data suggests that selected Lactobacillus species, in addition to mutans streptococci, are risk markers for early childhood caries.
TI  - Different fecal microbiotas and volatile organic compounds in treated and untreated children with celiac disease.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the fecal microbiotas of children with celiac disease (CD) before (U-CD) and after (T-CD) they were fed a gluten-free diet and of healthy children (HC). Brothers or sisters of T-CD were enrolled as HC. Each group consisted of seven children. PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis with V3 universal primers revealed a unique profile for each fecal sample. PCR-DGGE analysis with group- or genus-specific 16S rRNA gene primers showed that the Lactobacillus community of U-CD changed significantly, while the diversity of the Lactobacillus community of T-CD was quite comparable to that of HC. Compared to HC, the ratio of cultivable lactic acid bacteria and Bifidobacterium to Bacteroides and enterobacteria was lower in T-CD and even lower in U-CD. The percentages of strains identified as lactobacilli differed as follows: HC (ca. 38%) > T-CD (ca. 17%) > U-CD (ca. 10%). Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus rossiae, and Lactobacillus pentosus were identified only in fecal samples from T-CD and HC. Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus gasseri were identified only in several fecal samples from HC. Compared to HC, the composition of Bifidobacterium species of T-CD varied, and it varied even more for U-CD. Forty-seven volatile organic compounds (VOCs) belonging to different chemical classes were identified using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction analysis. The median concentrations varied markedly for HC, T-CD, and U-CD. Overall, the r(2) values for VOC data for brothers and sisters were equal to or lower than those for unrelated HC and T-CD. This study shows the effect of CD pathology on the fecal microbiotas of children.
TI  - Lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  - A group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ECC) affected children treated in the Department of Pedodontics (Children's Teaching Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic). Biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by API 50 CH kit and conventional tube tests. The rep-PCR fingerprinting with the (GTG)(5) primer was used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. The (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. In total, 20 strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, 17 L. rhamnosus, 14 L. casei/paracasei, 7 L. gasseri, 7 L. salivarius and 4 L. plantarum were identified. Mixtures of two or even three Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. Results obtained by biotyping and (GTG)(5)-PCR were generally comparable except for L. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. The (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. Our results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of Lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.
TI  - Phenotypic and molecular identification of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal secretions.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Twenty lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples of healthy volunteers were characterized according to polyphasic taxonomy. A broad spectrum of activity and protective properties of these vaginal isolates has been reported. METHODS: Phenotypic and genotypic methods such as random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), species-specific and BOX polymerase chain reaction (PCR), amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), and 16S rRNA sequence analyses were applied for Lactobacillus spp. identification. RESULTS: On the basis of carbohydrate utilization profiles using API 50 CHL kits (fermentation pattern), the strains were divided into 7 groups. RAPD- and BOX-PCR analyses revealed heterogeneity within the established phenotypic groups and discriminated successfully between the vaginal strains. The combination of species-specific PCR, ARDRA, and 16S rRNA sequence analyses allowed the species identification of 7 strains as Lactobacillus fermentum, 2 as Lactobacillus gasseri, 1 as Lactobacillus brevis, and 1 as Lactobacillus salivarius. These results were not in agreement with data obtained by classical and molecular methods for some clinical isolates. CONCLUSION: This is the first polyphasic taxonomy study on vaginal lactobacilli from Bulgarian women of reproductive age. These data add to the limited information existing in Bulgaria on the true identity of Lactobacillus spp. in the vaginal microbiota.
TI  - Isolation of lactobacilli with probiotic properties from the human stomach.
AB  - AIMS: Recent evidence suggests that the human gastric microbiota is much more diverse than previously thought. The aim of this study was to assess the potential for isolating lactobacilli from the human stomach. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacilli were selectively cultured from gastric biopsies from 12 patients undergoing routine endoscopy. Lactobacilli were present in four of 12 biopsies. We isolated, in total 10 different strains representing five species (Lactobacillus gasseri, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis, L. reuteri and L. salivarius). The 10 isolates varied greatly in their ability to inhibit the growth of two Gram-positive bacteria and two Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, the acid and bile resistance profiles of the 10 isolates spanned a wide range. CONCLUSIONS: Five different Lactobacillus species were cultured from human gastric biopsies for the first time. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Diverse Lactobacillus species are more prevalent in the human stomach than previously recognized, representing an untapped source of bacteria with beneficial probiotic and/or biotechnological properties.
TI  - Metabolism of prebiotic products containing beta(2-1) fructan mixtures by two Lactobacillus strains.
AB  - The capacity of two probiotic strains, isolated from human breast milk, to use several beta(2-1) fructan mixtures as carbon and energy source in in vitro cultures has been tested. Results showed that both strains, Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714 and Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716, reached higher growth levels on culture media containing fructooligosaccharide mixtures produced by enzymatic synthesis, compared to those obtained by inulin hydrolysis. Furthermore, the shortest beta(2-1) fructan, kestose, was the only prebiotic compound in the mixtures significantly metabolized in all growth media tested. Analysis of short-chain fatty acid production showed no correlation between the fatty acid profile produced and the carbon source used in each experiment. These data could serve to select appropriate beta(2-1) fructans to be used as prebiotics for L. gasseri CECT5714 and L. fermentum CECT5716 and to design suitable symbiotic food products containing the mentioned lactobacilli.
TI  - Species diversity and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria from women in Uganda and Korea.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health of women. The aim of this study was to compare the species richness and relative abundance of Lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria in women of two geographically distant countries, Uganda and Korea. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vaginal samples were obtained from two women populations in Uganda and Korea. The Lactobacillus Rogosa SL agar was used for initial isolation of lactic acid bacteria. After phenotypic analyses, the 16S rRNA gene was amplified by polymerase-chain reaction and analysed by the BLAST program and phylogenetic tree construction. A total of 338 (128 Korean and 210 Ugandan) vaginal lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated, including five genera: Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus, Streptococcus and Weissella. While Lactobacillus crispatus was common in both populations, Lactobacillus fermentum was common only in Korean women, and Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus vaginalis only in Ugandan women. Among other lactic acid bacteria, Weissella was more common in Ugandan, and Pediococcus in Korean women. All Weissella strains produced hydrogen peroxide, and all Pediococcus strains inhibited Candida species. CONCLUSION: Although many lactic acid bacteria colonize women, their species distributions may be different in women of geographically separated communities. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The knowledge of species richness and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria, including Lactobacillus, Pediococcus and Weissella, may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. METHODS: Samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. On the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. The isolates were determined as Lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16S rDNA. Sequencing of 16S rDNA genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. RESULTS: Predominant species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus cellobiosus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and Lactobacillus gasseri were also present. The isolates Lactobacillus salivarius BGHO1, Lactobacillus fermentum BGHO36 and BGHO64, Lactobacillus gasseri BGHO89 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis BGHO99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus flavus, Salmonella enteritidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of Candida albicans. Moreover, the isolates L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 were tolerant to low pH and high concentration of bile salts. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these findings imply that L. salivarius BGHO1 and L. gasseri BGHO89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
TI  - Distribution of salivary Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in periodontal health and disease.
AB  - We surveyed the distribution of salivary Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species in periodontitis patients and healthy subjects. Approximately 700 lactobacilli and 300 bifidobacterial isolates were obtained from 16 young, orally healthy subjects (mean age +/- standard deviation: 21.0+/-2.0 y), 16 periodontitis patients (51.6+/-13.8 y), and 14 well-maintained former periodontitis patients (60.2+/-9.6 y). Among eleven Lactobacillus species detected in saliva, L. salivarius, L. gasseri, and L. fermentum were prevalent, but no species was specifically associated with periodontal health. In contrast, of four Bifidobacterium species, B. adolescentis was specifically (P<0.05) prevalent in young healthy subjects compared with the other two groups. Furthermore, the bifidobacterial count of the well-maintained subjects was the highest (P<0.05) among the groups. These results suggest that bifidobacterial count and species might be associated with periodontal health status and/or age.
TI  - Quantitative evaluation of adhesion of lactobacilli isolated from human intestinal tissues to human colonic mucin using surface plasmon resonance (BIACORE assay).
AB  - AIMS: To isolate lactobacilli from the mucus layer of the human intestine and evaluate their adhesion abilities using a BIACORE assay. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the mucus layer of normal human intestinal tissues using conventional plate culture. The strains were identified using homology comparisons of the 16S rDNA sequence to databases as Lactobacillus salivarius (26%), Lactobacillus fermentum (13%), Lactobacillus gasseri (10%), Lactobacillus paracasei (7%), Lactobacillus casei (3%), Lactobacillus mucosae (3%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (3%). Lactobacillus plantarum LA 318 shows the highest adhesion to human colonic mucin (HCM) using the BIACORE assay at 115.30 +/- 12.37 resonance unit (RU). The adhesion of cell wall surface proteins from strain LA 318 was significantly higher to HCM than to bovine serum albumin (BSA; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We isolated 30 strains of lactobacilli. Lactobacillus salivarius was the predominant species of lactobacilli isolated in this study. The adhesion of strain LA 318 isolated from human transverse colon to its mucin was shown. The adhesion could be mediated by lectin-like components on the bacterial cell surface. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study where lactobacilli were isolated from human intestinal tissues and shown to adhere to HCM.
TI  - Molecular identification of vaginal lactobacilli isolated from Bulgarian women.
AB  - Lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining the vaginal health of women. The development of suitable bacterial replacement therapies for the treatment of vaginosis requires knowledge of the vaginal lactobacilli species representation. The aim of this study was to identify at the species level vaginal Lactobacillus isolates obtained from Bulgarian women in childbearing age by using different molecular methods. Twenty-two strains of lactobacilli isolated from vaginal samples were identified and grouped according to their genetic relatedness. A combined approach, which included amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), ribotyping and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with species-specific oligonucleotide primers was applied. All vaginal isolates were grouped into 5 clusters in comparison with a set of 21 reference strains based on the initial ARDRA results, which was then confirmed by ribotyping. Finally, the strains were subjected to PCR analysis with eight different species-specific primer pairs, which allowed most of them to be classified as belonging to one of the following species: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactobacillus plantarum. In conclusion, this study suggests that the most straightforward identification strategy for vaginal lactobacilli would be grouping by ARDRA or ribotyping, followed by PCR specific primers identification at species level.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Probiotic properties of vaginal lactic acid bacteria to prevent metritis in cattle.
AB  - AIMS: The isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Out of 76 Lactobacillus sp. and seven Streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (MATH) was applied. In the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine Escherichia coli 99/14 and human E. coli. This inhibition was due to acid. Only a few strains inhibited Actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. This inhibition remained after neutralization. The taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA). Most of the strains were identified as Lactobacillus fermentum, a few as Lactobacillus gasseri and one as Lactobacillus rhamnosus. CONCLUSIONS: Bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. The strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of four Lactobacillus strains isolated from breast milk.
AB  - AIMS: The antimicrobial potential of four lactobacilli (Lactobacillus salivarius  CECT5713, Lactobacillus gasseri CECT5714, L. gasseri CECT5715 and Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716), isolated from fresh human breast milk, was evaluated in this study and compared with Lactobacillus coryniformis CECT5711, a reuterin-producing strain isolated from an artisan goat's cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS: Agar diffusion tests, competitive adhesion assays and mucin expression assays were carried out in order to value the antibacterial properties of the lactobacilli strains. The antibacterial capability of the strains was tested in vivo by using a murine infection model with Salmonella choleraesuis. The results revealed that all the strains studied, displayed antibacterial properties against pathogenic bacteria. However, the antibacterial potential varied among the lactobacilli tested and, in fact, L. salivarius CECT5713 showed not only the best in vitro antibacterial activity, but also the highest protective effect against a Salmonella strain in the murine infection model. CONCLUSION: The four breast-milk lactobacilli, and particularly L. salivarius CECT5713, possess potent antibacterial activities that result in a higher protection against S. choleraesuis CECT4155 in a mouse infection model. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: These results suggest that lactobacilli from breast milk could contribute to an anti-infective protection in neonates and would be excellent candidates for the development of infant probiotic products.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - Lactobacillus bacteremia, species identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility of 85 blood isolates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical Lactobacillus isolates are scarce, and appropriate interpretation criteria for susceptibility tests are not available. METHODS: We examined 85 cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia, of which 47 cases have been included in our previous studies. Overall, 14 antimicrobial agents were evaluated by the E-test method, and these results were compared with disk diffusion test findings. The clinical outcomes of the patients and their antimicrobial treatments were registered. RESULTS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of Lactobacillus strains was species dependent. The considerable number of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (n=46), Lactobacillus fermentum (n=12), and Lactobacillus casei (n=12) strains available for testing made it possible to compare the susceptibilities within 1 species, as well. Of the 46 L. rhamnosus isolates, 22 were identified as L. rhamnosus GG type by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All Lactobacillus isolates demonstrated low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin. MICs of vancomycin were high (>256 microg/mL) for all other species except Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus jensenii. Disk diffusion and E-test results were concordant. The MICs of cephalosporins varied; cefuroxime demonstrated a higher level of activity than did ceftriaxone. Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin MICs had variable ranges between different species. Combination therapy was given to 83% of the patients, but, in 54% of them, therapy included only 1 microbiologically active agent, according to results of the susceptibility tests. Mortality at 1 week was 12% among patients who presumably were receiving adequate treatment and 27% among patients who were receiving inadequate treatment (P=.131, by E-test). CONCLUSION: Most clinical Lactobacillus blood isolates demonstrated low MICs of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin, but they had variable susceptibility to penicillin and cephalosporins.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. Some species of Lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) producers. Nonoxynol-9 (N-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. It immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. It is known that N-9 inhibits Lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. PURPOSE: The present study was conducted to identify the species of Lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the H(2)O(2)-producing and N-9-resistant strains in an Argentine population. RESULTS: We identified Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, L. casei subsp. casei, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. In this Argentine, South American population, 62% of women had H(2)O(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. We found a high number of sensitive strains. Sixty-two H(2)O(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to N-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of N-9. DISCUSSION: The vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among Argentine women as in other countries, and (2) N-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.
TI  - [Analysis of the probiotic Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus community in child intestinal flora].
AB  - To investigate the distribution of child intestinal flora and the composition of  its key probiotics community, study on intestinal flora of 21 Chinese children (age 2 - 5) was conducted, which included bacteria isolation and counting, 16S rDNA sequencing and homology analysis. For identification of the key probiotics such as Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in children feces at the species level, the specific primers Im26/Im3 and L159/L677 for PCR amplification of partial 16S rDNA were used. The results show that the composition of child intestinal flora is was relatively stable and almost same to the intestinal flora of the youth (age 20 - 25). Culture-based approaches show that the key probiotic community in feces at the species level was highly different in composition and numbers from individual to individual. B. longum and B. pseudocatenulatum, which are detected at levels of 10(7) CFU/g (wet) in samples and the detection rates are 90.48% and 85.71% respectively, are believed to be major bifidobacterial species in child intestinal microbiota. In addition, B. adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. infantis and B. thermacidophium have also been found. L. mucosae, L. fermentum, L. salivarius, L. ruminis, L. gasseri and L. plantarum are isolated from the stools. L. mucosae (3.68 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 71.43%) and L. fermentum (3.97 log10 CFU/g (wet), detection rate 52.38%) are two dominant species of Lactobacillus. Study on Chinese child intestinal flora, especially on the compositions and numbers of key probiotics in the feces will be very helpful to the development of effective probiotics in future.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - [Antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. DESIGN: review of literature. SETTING: Charles University at Prague, Pharmaceutical Faculty at Hradec Kralove. METHODS: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. CONCLUSIONS: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. The efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of C. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. Essential oils present in the Cayenne pepper (Capsodum frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against C. albicans as well. Clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. The effects of Chinese leek are similar to garlic. Propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the yeast strains decreases in the following order: C. albicans > C. tropicalis > C. crusei > C. guilliermondii. Its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. Tea trea oil (Melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of Candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for C. crusei and C. norvengensis. In the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of Lactobacilus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14, B-54 may be recommended. Moreover there are suitable strains of L. brevis CD-2, L. salivarius FV-2, L. gasseri MB 335, L. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (L. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (L. gasseri). The strains of L. acidophilus CRL 1294 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with Candida. It should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of Lactobacillus (especially L. casei and L. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract. No protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin E, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.
TI  - [Inhibitory activity of vaginal Lactobacillus bacteria on yeasts causing vulvovaginal candidiasis].
AB  - Growing frequency of therapeutical failures of vulvovaginal candidiasis, resulting from resistance of certain species of Candida to imidazole agents, raises interest in the use of probiotics from Lactobacillus genera as prophylaxis. Unfortunately, little is known about inhibitory mechanisms of Lactobacillus on Candida. The aim of this study was to compare the activity of selected Lactobacillus species, representing the physiological vaginal flora, against Candida as well as investigation whether their inhibitory activity against Candida is related strictly to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid production. 125 strains from vaginal smears of healthy women were classified by making use of phenotypic and genotypic methods. The majority of strains belonged to L. acidophilus: L. acidophilus sensu stricto, L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. johnsonii as well as L. fermentum and L. plantarum species. Culture supernatants of selected 25 strains representing the isolated species were examined for their inhibitory activity against the growth of Candida albicans and C. glabrata. The results showed that the strongest and the fastest activity against C. albicans was demonstrated by L. delbrueckii strains, producing the largest quantities of hydrogen peroxide. On the other hand, extended activity, demonstrable after 24 hours, was shown by non-H2O2 producing L. plantarum supernatants. Growth of C. glabrata was not inhibited by any of the examined strains of Lactobacillus. Comparison of activity of live active cultures of Lactobacillus strains and their mixtures with this of pure H2O2 and lactic acid has shown that pure chemical compounds were less active than the cultures. This suggests that mixtures of Lactobacillus strains are in cooperation with each other using many different metabolites.
TI  - A double-blind treatment study of bacterial vaginosis with normal vaginal lactobacilli after an open treatment with vaginal clindamycin ovules.
AB  - The expected 4-week cure rate after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis are only 65-70%. In an attempt to improve the cure rate by adding probiotic lactobacilli we performed a double-blind placebo-controlled study of adjuvant lactobacilli treatment after an open treatment with vaginal clindamycin ovules. Women with bacterial vaginosis as defined by Amsel's criteria were treated with clindamycin ovules. Vaginal smears were collected and analysed according to Nugent's criteria. During the following menstruation period the women used, as an adjuvant treatment, either lactobacilli-prepared tampons or placebo tampons. The lactobacilli tampons were loaded with a mixture of freeze-dried L. fermentum, L. casei var. rhamnosus and L. gasseri. The cure rate was recorded after the second menstruation period. There was no improvement in the cure rate after treatment with lactobacilli-containing tampons compared to placebo tampons; the cure rates as defined by Amsel's criteria were 56% and 62%, respectively, and 55% and 63%, as defined by Nugent's criteria. This is the first study to report cure rates for women with 'intermediate' wet smear ratings according to Nugent's classification and this group had an overall cure rate of 44%. The cure rate of treatment of bacterial vaginosis was not improved by using lactobacilli-prepared tampons for one menstruation.
TI  - Probiotic potential of 3 Lactobacilli strains isolated from breast milk.
AB  - Breast milk is an important factor in the initiation, development, and composition of the neonatal gut microbiota. In a previous study, the authors isolated lactic acid bacteria from milk of healthy mothers. Since some of the identified isolates belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the probiotic potential of 2 Lactobacillus gasseri and 1 Lactobacillus fermentum strains. Different assays, including survival to conditions simulating those existing in the gastrointestinal tract, production of antimicrobial compounds, adherence to intestinal cells, production of biogenic amines, degradation of mucin, enzymatic profile, and pattern of antibiotic resistance, were performed. Globally, the results showed that the probiotic potential of lactobacilli isolated from milk of healthy mothers is, at least, similar to that of the strains commonly used in commercial probiotic products. This fact, together with the presence of prebiotic substances, indicates that breast milk is a natural synbiotic food.
TI  - Identification, characterisation and specificity of a cell wall lytic enzyme from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11.
AB  - Screening of a genomic library with an antiserum raised against whole Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 cells identified a clone expressing an immunoreactive 37-kDa protein. Analysis of the 3010-bp DNA insert contained within the clone revealed four open reading frames (ORFs). One ORF encodes LysA, a 303 amino acid protein which has up to 35% identity with putative endolysins from prophages Lj928 and Lj965 from Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lp1 and Lp2 from Lactobacillus plantarum as well as with the endolysin of Lactobacillus gasseri bacteriophage Phiadh. The immunoreactive protein was shown to be encoded by a truncated ORF downstream of lysA which has similarity to glutamyl-tRNA synthetases. The N-terminus of LysA has sequence similarity with N-acetylmuramidase catalytic domains while the C-terminus has sequence similarity with putative cell envelope binding bacterial SH3b domains. C-terminal bacterial SH3b domains were identified in the majority of Lactobacillus bacteriophage endolysins. LysA was expressed in Escherichia coli and unusually was found to have a broad bacteriolytic activity range with activity against a number of different Lactobacillus species and against Lactococcus lactis, streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus. It was found that LysA is 2 and 8000 times more active against L. fermentum than L. lactis and Streptococcus pyogenes, respectively.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of diverse Lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  - Our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. Production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. The present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to total load of lactobacilli by real-time PCR. Pooled DNA was amplified by PCR with Lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. Specific PCR primers were designed for nine prominent species, including Lactobacillus gasseri, L. ultunensis, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii, L. fermentum, and L. gallinarum. More than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various Lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. Quantification by real-time PCR revealed various proportions of the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of L. gasseri and L. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. The findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of Lactobacillus spp. in the context of extension of the carious lesion.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Genetic diversity of vaginal lactobacilli from women in different countries based on 16S rRNA gene sequences.
AB  - AIMS: Lactobacilli are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as commensal bacteria. The aim of this study was to determine the species of lactobacilli that colonize the vagina and compare them with those found in food and the environment. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-five Lactobacillus strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from 16S rRNA genes were determined and compared with existing data in GenBank. A phylogenetic tree was achieved using the Neighbour-Joining method based on the analysis of 1465 nucleotides. The results showed that most vaginal isolates were L. crispatus, L. jensenii and L. gasseri. Some were L. vaginalis, L. fermentum, L. mucosae, L. paracasei and L. rhamnosus. Two isolates from a native American woman displayed distinct branches, indicating novel phylotypes. Few vaginal isolates matched food or environmental Lactobacillus species. CONCLUSIONS: Most women worldwide were colonized by three common Lactobacillus species: L. crispatus, L. jensenii and L. gasseri. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Knowledge of vaginal Lactobacillus species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Rapid identification of 11 human intestinal Lactobacillus species by multiplex PCR assays using group- and species-specific primers derived from the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23S rRNA.
AB  - Rapid and reliable two-step multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were established to identify human intestinal lactobacilli; a multiplex PCR was used for grouping of lactobacilli with a mixture of group-specific primers followed by four multiplex PCR assays with four sorts of species-specific primer mixtures for identification at the species level. Primers used were designed from nucleotide sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer region and its flanking 23S rRNA gene of members of the genus Lactobacillus which are commonly isolated from human stool specimens: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii (ssp. bulgaricus and ssp. lactis), Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus paracasei (ssp. paracasei and ssp. tolerans), Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus salivarius (ssp. salicinius and ssp. salivarius). The established two-step multiplex PCR assays were applied to the identification of 84 Lactobacillus strains isolated from human stool specimens and the PCR results were consistent with the results from the DNA-DNA hybridization assay. These results suggest that the multiplex PCR system established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of common Lactobacillus isolates from human stool samples.
TI  - Differentiation of Lactobacillus isolates from infant faeces by SDS-PAGE and rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - Isolates of lactobacilli from infant faeces phenotypically characterized as Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (six strains), Lact. rhamnosus (six strains), Lact. gasseri (three strains), Lact. acidophilus (one strain) and Lact. fermentum/reuteri (three strains) according to recent classification systems were subjected to SDS-PAGE of whole cell proteins and rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization, in order to confirm the phenotypic characterization and elucidate the exact taxonomic position of the three strains that had properties between fermentum and reuteri. Results suggested a good agreement between the phenotypic characterization, SDS-PAGE and rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe hybridization for strains of all species except for the Lact. fermentum/reuteri strains. Results obtained by rRNA probes suggested a possible phylogenetic relatedness of the strains to Lact. reuteri. Isolates from infant faeces with interesting probiotic properties could be used as components of fermented milk products.
TI  - The identification of vaginal Lactobacillus species and the demographic and microbiologic characteristics of women colonized by these species.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus has been reported to be the predominant vaginal species. Vaginal lactobacilli isolated from 215 sexually active women were identified using whole-chromosomal DNA probes to 20 American Type Culture Collection Lactobacillus strains. Most women were colonized by L. crispatus (32%), followed by L. jensenii (23%), a previously undescribed species designated L. 1086V (15%), L. gasseri (5%), L. fermentum (0.3%), L. oris (0.3%), L. reuteri (0.3%), L. ruminis (0.3%), and L. vaginalis (0.3%). H2O2 was produced by 95% of L. crispatus and 94% of L. jensenii isolates, compared with only 9% of L. 1086V. Colonization by L. crispatus or L. jensenii was positively associated with being white (P<.001), age >/=20 years (P=.05), barrier contraceptive usage (P=.008), and lower frequency of bacterial vaginosis (P<.001) and gonorrhea (P=.03). L. crispatus and L. jensenii, not L. acidophilus, are the most common species of vaginal lactobacilli.
TI  - Identification of and hydrogen peroxide production by fecal and vaginal lactobacilli isolated from Japanese women and newborn infants.
AB  - We identified Lactobacillus isolates from Japanese women and newborn infants by a DNA-DNA hybridization method. The predominating lactobacilli were Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus gasseri in the women's vaginas and the newborns' intestines and L. gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum in the women's intestines. All L. crispatus strains were exclusively strong H2O2 producers.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus. The physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. In total, 176 strains, including the type strains, have been included. Phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic proteins. Genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and DNA-DNA hybridization for bifidobacteria. In the genus Lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: L. acidophilus group, L. casei group and L. reuteri/L. fermentum group. Most strains referred to as L. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as L. gasseri or as L. johnsonii, both members of the L. acidophilus group. A similar situation could be shown in the L. casei group, where most of the strains named L. casei belonged to L. paracasei subspp. A recent proposal to reject the species L. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species L. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. Bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. According to phenotypic features and confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to B. animalis, although they were often declared as B. longum by the manufacturer. From the genus Enterococcus, probiotic Ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the vanA-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. These unwanted resistances could be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kDa resistance protein. In conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
TI  - Functional analysis of the gene encoding immunity to lactacin F, lafI, and its use as a Lactobacillus-specific, food-grade genetic marker.
AB  - Lactacin F is a two-component class II bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus johnsonii VPI 11088. The laf operon is composed of the bacteriocin structural genes, lafA and lafX, and a third open reading frame, ORFZ. Two strategies were employed to study the function of ORFZ. This gene was disrupted in the chromosome of NCK64, a lafA729 lafX ORFZ derivative of VPI 11088. A disruption cassette consisting of ORFZ interrupted with a cat gene was cloned into pSA3 and introduced into NCK64. Manipulation of growth temperatures and antibiotic selection resulted in homologous recombination which disrupted the chromosomal copy of ORFZ with the cat gene. This ORFZ mutation resulted in loss of immunity to lactacin F but had little effect on production of LafX, which is not bactericidal without LafA. Expression of ORFZ in this ORFZ- background rescued the immune phenotype. Expression of ORFZ in a bacteriocin-sensitive derivative of VPI 11088 also reestablished immunity. These data indicate that ORFZ, renamed lafI, encodes the immunity factor for the lactacin F system. The sensitivity of various Lactobacillus strains to lactacin F was further evaluated. Lactacin F inhibited 11 strains including several members of the A1, A2, A3, A4, B1, and B2 L. acidophilus homology groups. Expression of lafI in bacteriocin-sensitive strains L. acidophilus ATCC 4356, L. acidophilus NCFM/N2, L. fermentum NCDO1750, L. gasseri ATCC 33323, and L. johnsonii ATCC 33200 provided immunity to lactacin F. Furthermore, it was shown that lactacin F production by VPI 11088 could be used to select for L. fermentum NCDO1750 transformants containing the recombinant plasmid encoding LafI. The data demonstrate that lafI is functional in heterologous hosts, suggesting that it may be a suitable food-grade genetic marker for use in lactobacillus species.
TI  - Identification of vaginal lactobacilli from asymptomatic women.
AB  - In the present work, carried out by means of phenotypic and genotypic tests, it has been demonstrated that none of the vaginal lactobacilli isolated from asymptomatic women were genetically close to L. acidophilus ATCC 4356. Strains of homofermentative lactobacilli were identified as Lactobacillus gasseri, L. jensenii and L. crispatus, while in the heterofermentative only one strain was classified as L. fermentum. Moreover a genetically homologous group of heterofermentative lactobacilli, that could represent a new species, were evidenced.
