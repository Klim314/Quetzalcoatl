[effects of pine wood nematode on propagation of its carrying bacteria].
in this paper, the aseptic eggs of bursaphelenchus xylophilus were obtained after treated with 30% h202, and cultured with pinus thunbergii callus. ten b. xylophilus-carrying bacterial strains directly isolated from diseased p. thugbergii and p. massoniana in six epidemic provinces i.e., gcm6-2a pseudomonas putida, gcm6-1a p. putida, zpb1-2a p. putida, hem2a pseudomonas sp., hem1a pseudomonas sp., hem142b pseudomonas sp., gcm1-3a p. cepacia and hm3 pantoeu sp., zpb4-2b staphylococcus sciuri and zpb2-3a enterobacter amnigenus, were collected, and the effects of axenic b. xylophilus (abx) on their propagation were studied. the results showed that pine wood nematode (pwn) promoted the propagation of 7 bacterial strains in pseudomonas and 1 bacterial strain in pantoeu sp., including pseudomonas putida, p. putida, p. putida , pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas sp., pseudomonas sp., p. cepacia and pantoeu sp., but inhibited staphylococcus sciuri and enterobacter amnigenus, which could explain the phenomenon that pseudomonas was the prevailing genus of the bacteria carried by pwn, and might provide essential nutrition to the bacteria. the close relationship between pwn and bacterial strains in pseudomonas might account for the pine wood nematode disease.
