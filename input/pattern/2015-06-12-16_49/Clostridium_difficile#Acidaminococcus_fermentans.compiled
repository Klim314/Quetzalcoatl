TI  - Dehydration of (R)-2-hydroxyacyl-CoA to enoyl-CoA in the fermentation of alpha-amino acids by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (R)-2-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which is dehydrated to enoyl-CoA by syn-elimination. This reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pK 40-50). A mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. The 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component A, an activator, and component D, the actual dehydratase. Component A, a homodimer with one [4Fe-4S]cluster, transfers an electron to component D, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4Fe-4S]clusters and FMN, concomitant with hydrolysis of two ATP. From component D the electron is further transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. In the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pK14). After elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of ATP. The helix-cluster-helix architecture of component A forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of ATP resembling an archer shooting arrows. Therefore we designated component A as 'Archerase'. Here, we describe 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans, Clostridium symbiosum and Fusobacterium nucleatum, 2-phenyllactate dehydratase from Clostridium sporogenes, 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium difficile, and lactyl-CoA dehydratase from Clostridium propionicum. A relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydratases is benzoyl-CoA reductase from Thauera aromatica. Analogous but unrelated archerases are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. In anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven electron transfer from NADH to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component A, has been established. The transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical Na(+)-gradient. This enzyme is related to the Rnf proteins involved in Rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation.
TI  - Molecular characterization of phenyllactate dehydratase and its initiator from Clostridium sporogenes.
AB  - The heterotrimeric phenyllactate dehydratase from Clostridium sporogenes, FldABC, catalyses the reversible dehydration of (R)-phenyllactate to (E)-cinnamate in two steps: (i) CoA-transfer from the cofactor cinnamoyl-CoA to phenyllactate to yield phenyllactyl-CoA and the product cinnamate mediated by FldA, a (R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase; followed by (ii) dehydration of phenyllactyl-CoA to cinnamoyl-CoA mediated by heterodimeric FldBC, a phenyllactyl-CoA dehydratase. Phenyllactate dehydratase requires initiation by ATP, MgCl2 and a reducing agent such as dithionite mediated by an extremely oxygen-sensitive initiator protein (FldI) present in the cell-free extract. All four genes coding for these proteins were cloned and shown to be clustered in the order fldAIBC, which shares over 95% sequence identity of nucleotide and protein levels with a gene cluster detected in the genome of the closely related Clostridium botulinum Hall strain A. FldA shows sequence similarities to a new family of CoA-transferases, which apparently do not form covalent enzyme CoA-ester intermediates. An N-terminal Strep II-Tag containing enzymatically active FldI was overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli. FldI was characterized as a homodimeric protein, which contains one [4Fe-4S]1+/2+ cluster with an electron spin S = 3/2 in the reduced form. The amino acid sequence as well as the chemical and EPR-properties of the pure protein are very similar to those of component A of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase from Acidaminococcus fermentans (HgdC), which was able to replace FldI in the activation of phenyllactate dehydratase. Only in the oxidized state, FldI and component A exhibit significant ATPase activity, which appears to be essential for unidirectional electron transfer. Both subunits of phenyllactyl-CoA dehydratase (FldBC) show significant sequence similarities to both subunits of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-CoA dehydratase (HgdAB). The fldAIBC gene cluster resembles the hadAIBC gene cluster in the genome of Clostridium difficile and the hadABC,I genes in C. botulinum. The four subunits of these deduced 2-hydroxyacid dehydratases (65-81% amino acid sequence identity between the had genes) probably code for a 2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydratase involved in leucine fermentation. This enzyme could be the target for metronidazole in the treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by C. difficile.
TI  - Fermentation of 4-aminobutyrate by Clostridium aminobutyricum: cloning of two genes involved in the formation and dehydration of 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA.
AB  - Clostridium aminobutyricum ferments 4-aminobutyrate via succinic semialdehyde, 4-hydroxybutyrate, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA to acetate and butyrate. The genes coding for the enzymes that catalyse the interconversion of these intermediates are arranged in the order abfD (4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydratase), abfT (4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase), and abfH (NAD-dependent 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase). The genes abfD and abfT were cloned, sequenced and expressed as active enzymes in Escherichia coli. Hence the insertion of the [4Fe-4S]clusters and FAD into the dehydratase required no additional specific protein from C. aminobutyricum. The amino acid sequences of the dehydratase and the CoA-transferase revealed close relationships to proteins deduced from the genomes of Clostridium difficile, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. In addition the N-terminal part of the dehydratase is related to those of a family of FAD-containing mono-oxygenases from bacteria. The putative assignment in the databank of Cat2 (OrfZ) from Clostridium kluyveri as 4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase, which is thought to be involved in the reductive pathway from succinate to butyrate, was confirmed by sequence comparison with AbfT (57% identity). Furthermore, an acetyl-CoA:4-hydroxybutyrate CoA-transferase activity could be detected in cell-free extracts of C. kluyveri. In contrast to glutaconate CoA-transferase from Acidaminococcus fermentans, mutation studies suggested that the glutamate residue of the motive EXG, which is conserved in many homologues of AbfT, does not form a CoA-ester during catalysis.
