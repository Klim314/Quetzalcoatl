TI  == antimicrobial evaluation of plants used for the treatment of diarrhoea in a rural community in northern maputaland, kwazulu-natal, south africa.
AB  == background: zulu people living in the rural area of maputaland (kwazulu-natal, south africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to  the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. with this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of  23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural maputaland. four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. methods: minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (ch2cl2: meoh) and aqueous crude extracts. the following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; bacillus cereus (atcc 11778), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 8739), proteus vulgaris (atcc 33420), salmonella typhimurium (atcc 14028), shigella flexneri (atcc 25875) and staphylococcus aureus (atcc 12600). the fractional inhibitory concentration index (sigmafic) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. results: shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean mic value of 0.04 mg/ml). the aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. acacia burkei, brachylaena transvaalensis against b. cereus and b. transvaalensis against s. flexneri. in the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) sigmafic values of 0.30 for acanthospermum glabratum with krauseola mosambicina; sigmafic values of 0.46 for  a. glabratum with psidium guajava; sigmafic values of 0.39 for b. transvaalensis  with p. guajava and sigmafic values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of b.  transvaalensis with sclerocarya birrea. conclusion: this study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of northern maputaland. very little connection was  observed between frequency of use and efficacy. plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.

TI  == the length of a lantibiotic hinge region has profound influence on antimicrobial  activity and host specificity.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized (methyl)lanthionine containing peptides  which can efficiently inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria. as lantibiotics kill bacteria efficiently and resistance to them is difficult to be  obtained, they have the potential to be used in many applications, e.g., in pharmaceutical industry or food industry. nisin can inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria by binding to lipid ii and by making pores in their membrane. the c-terminal part of nisin is known to play an important role during  translocation over the membrane and forming pore complexes. however, as the thickness of bacterial membranes varies between different species and environmental conditions, this property could have an influence on the pore forming activity of nisin. to investigate this, the so-called "hinge region" of nisin (residues nmk) was engineered to vary from one to six amino acid residues and specific activity against different indicators was compared. antimicrobial activity in liquid culture assays showed that wild type nisin is most active, while truncation of the hinge region dramatically reduced the activity of the peptide. however, one or two amino acids extensions showed only slightly reduced  activity against most indicator strains. notably, some variants (+2, +1, -1, -2)  exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than nisin in agar well diffusion assays  against lactococcus lactis mg1363, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis  ve14089, bacillus sporothermodurans ic4 and bacillus cereus 4153 at certain temperatures.

TI  == pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: linum usitatissimum, commonly known as flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. this study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. materials and methods: the crude aqueous-methanolic extract of flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees c and aerated with carbogen. antibacterial efficacy of the flaxseed extract was tested  against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. results: flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses  of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. when tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high k(+) (80mm)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant  enterococcus faecalis (100%), escherichia coli k1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), bacillus cereus (92.64%), pseudomonas aeruginosa  (76.83%) and salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). the concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except escherichia coli k1, whereas for pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi, it  was bacteriostatic at this concentration. conclusions: our results indicate that  linum usitatissimum (flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. flaxseed extract proved effective against both  enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.

TI  == influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. to be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (da) and molecular weights (mw) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. they were tested at different ph values for their antimicrobial activities against four gram-negative bacteria  (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhi), four gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (aspergillus niger, fusarium oxysporum and alternaria solani). chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (da and mw) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower da and the lower ph give the larger efficiency. antibacterial activity was further enhanced for gram-negative bacteria with decreasing mw, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the gram-positive. concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. fungal growth decreased with increasing mw for f. oxysporum and decreasing da for a. solani, but no mw or da dependences were observed with a. niger.

TI  == synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and carbonic anhydrase enzyme inhibitor effects of salicilaldehyde-n-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone and its  palladium(ii), cobalt(ii) complexes.
AB  == we report the synthesis of the ligand, salicilaldehyde-n-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (salptsmh) derived from p-toluenesulfonicacid-1-methylhydrazide (ptsmh) and its pd(ii) and co(ii) metal complexes were synthesized for the first time. the structure of the ligand and their complexes were investigated using elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance and spectral (ir, nmr and lc-ms) measurements.  salptsmh has also been characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction. (1)h and (13)c shielding tensors for crystal structure were calculated with giao/dft/b3lyp/6-311++g(d,p) methods in cdcl3. the complexes were found to have general composition [ml2]. the results of elemental analysis showed 1:2 (metal/ligand) stoichiometry for all the complex. magnetic and spectral data indicate a square planar geometry for pd(ii) complex and a distorted tetrahedral  geometry for co(ii) complexes. the ligand and its metal chelates have been screened for their antimicrobial activities using the disk diffusion method against the selected gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus,  staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, gram negative bacteria: eschericha  coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia. the inhibition activities of  these compounds on carbonic anhydrase ii (ca ii) and carbonic anhydrase i (ca i)  have been investigated by comparing ic50 and ki values and it has been found that pd(ii) complex have more enzyme inhibition efficiency than salptsmh and co(ii) complex.

TI  == cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the bacillus group. in the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in bacillus cereus strain as 1.1846 through genomic mining and pcr screening. the designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class ii lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cera genes, one modification gene (cerm), two processing genes (cert and cerp), one orphan regulator gene (cerr), and two immunity genes (cerf and cere). in addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comqxpa, was inserted between cerm and cerr. the expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of b. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerm. we constitutively coexpressed cera genes and cerm in escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with  the endoproteinase gluc and a truncated version of putative serine protease cerp. thus, two natural variants of cerecidins a1 and a7 were obtained which contained  two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. both cerecidins a1 and a7 were active against a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria. cerecidin a7, especially its mutant dhb13a, showed remarkable efficacy  against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mdrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), and even streptomyces.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == the diversity and antimicrobial activity of preussia sp. endophytes isolated from australian dry rainforests.
AB  == limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of preussia within australia. this report describes endophytic preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (etoac) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of atcc type strains which included bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and the opportunist yeast pathogen candida albicans. subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive etoac extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the clinical and laboratory standards institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. a total of 18 preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in genbank, suggesting  that they are new species. in preliminary screening, 13/18 preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against mrsa and c. albicans. these results highlight the  antimicrobial potential of australian preussia spp. and also the importance of australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.

TI  == a product of heme catabolism modulates bacterial function and survival.
AB  == bilirubin is the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals. after deposition into bile, bilirubin is released in large quantities into the mammalian gastrointestinal (gi) tract. we hypothesized that intestinal bilirubin  may modulate the function of enteric bacteria. to test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on two enteric pathogens; enterohemorrhagic  e. coli (ehec), a gram-negative that causes life-threatening intestinal infections, and e. faecalis, a gram-positive human commensal bacterium known to be an opportunistic pathogen with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. we demonstrate that bilirubin can protect ehec from exogenous and host-generated reactive oxygen species (ros) through the absorption of free radicals. in contrast, e. faecalis was highly susceptible to bilirubin, which causes significant membrane disruption and uncoupling of respiratory metabolism in this  bacterium. interestingly, similar results were observed for other gram-positive bacteria, including b. cereus and s. aureus. a model is proposed whereby bilirubin places distinct selective pressure on enteric bacteria, with gram-negative bacteria being protected from ros (positive outcome) and gram-positive bacteria being susceptible to membrane disruption (negative outcome). this work suggests bilirubin has differential but biologically relevant effects on bacteria and justifies additional efforts to determine the role of this neglected waste catabolite in disease processes, including animal models.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of amazon astrocaryum aculeatum extracts and its association to oxidative metabolism.
AB  == several compounds present in fruits as polyphenols are able to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms. these proprieties are relevant mainly in tropical areas, as amazonian region where infectious are highly prevalent. therefore, this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of tucuma amazonian fruit against 37 microorganisms. the potential role of oxidative metabolism imbalance was also  studied as causal mechanism of antimicrobial activity. the results showed antibacterial effect of pulp and peel tucuma hydro-alcoholic extracts on three gram-positive bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes) and antifungal effect against candida albicans. the antimicrobial  contribution of main chemical compounds (quercetin, rutin, beta-carotene and gallic, caffeic and chlorogenic acids) found in tucuma extracts was also investigated showing an inhibitory effect depending of the organism mainly by quercetin in bacteria and rutin in c. albicans. analysis of kinetic of dna releasing in extracellular medium by fluorescence using dna pico green assay((r)) and reactive oxygen species production (ros) showed potential oxidative imbalance contribution on tucuma inhibitory effect. in b. cereus and c. albicans this effect was clear since after 24h the ros levels were higher when compared to negative control group. in conclusion, tucuma extracts present antimicrobial activity to four microorganisms that have large problems of drug resistance, and  the possible mechanism of action of this amazon fruit is related to redox imbalance.

TI  == a novel combinatorial biocatalytic approach for producing antibacterial compounds effective against mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb).
AB  == two bacterial hosts expressing cloned aromatic oxygenases were used to catalyze the oxidation and polymerization of indole and related substrates, creating mixtures of indigoid compounds comprised of novel dimers and trimers. crude extracts and purified compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of gram-positive organisms, in general, and mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb), in particular. of the 74 compounds tested against m. tuberculosis, ~66 % had minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 5 mug/ml or less. the most effective antibiotic found was designated sab-p1, a heterodimer of indole and anthranil, which had a mic of 0.16 mug/ml, and did not inhibit kidney cells (ic(50)) at concentrations of >8 mug/ml. combinatorial biocatalysis was used to create a series of halogenated derivatives of sab-p1 with a wider therapeutic window. none of the derivatives had mic values that were superior to sab-p1, but  some had a wider therapeutic window because of decreased kidney cell toxicity. generally, the indigoid dimers that were effective against tb appeared to be specific for tb. some of the trimers generated, however, had a broader spectrum of activity inhibiting not only tb (mic = 1.1 mug/ml) but also the growth of mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis 168, and clostridium acetobutylicum. the structure of two of the novel dimers (sab-c4 and sab-p1) and  a trimer (sab-r1) were solved using x-ray crystallography.

TI  == 2,2'-dithienyl diselenide pro-oxidant activity accounts for antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  == the aim of this study was to explore if 2,2'-dithienyl diselenide (dtds) pro-oxidant activity is related to its antibacterial and antifungal actions. the  antimicrobial activity of dtds against bacterial and fungal was investigated in the broth microdilution assay (3.02-387 mug/ml). additionally, the survival curve of microorganisms in the presence of dtds (12.09-193.5 mug/ml) was performed. the involvement of pro-oxidant activity in the dtds antimicrobial action was investigated by supplementing the growth medium with 10 mm glutathione or ascorbic acid in the disk diffusion technique (0.64-640 mugdtds/discs). the levels of reactive species (rs) induced by 25 mm dtds were also determined. the results demonstrated that dtds was effective in preventing the gram-positive bacteria and candida albicans growth. the minimum inhibitory concentration, twice and half concentrations of dtds confirmed that the activity of compound was bactericidal for some microorganisms (enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus saprophyticus), bacteriostatic for bacillus cereus and fungistatic for c. albicans. antibacterial and antifungal actions of dtds are related to the increase of reactive species levels. the presence of antioxidants in the growth medium avoided the dtds antimicrobial action. in conclusion, dtds showed promising antibacterial and antifungal actions, possibly related to its pro-oxidant activity.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == [analysis of bactericidal material generated by electrical devices advertising bactericidal ability against bacteria on the agar gel plates].
AB  == several japanese companies sell electrical devices advertised as effective in inactivating viruses and killing bacteria by releasing special materials, e.g., plasmacluster ions, nanoe particle and minus ions, into the air. these companies  claim that their devices killed bacteria on plates in their own experiments. we tested device effectiveness using the same experiments from the plasmacluster ioniser sharp co., japan, the nanoe generator panasonic co., japan, and the vion  king jim co., japan, to test their advertising claims. bactericidal ability on agar plate was tested, using staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis as follows: the medium containing a certain amount of each bacterium was put onto an agar plate and smeared. plates were kept in a closed chamber (inner volume 14.4 m3) or a glove box (inner volume 0.2 m), with one of the devices run for 2 hours. plates not exposed to any device were used as controls. each plate was retrieved and put in an incubator to count  the number of bacterial colonies formed on the plate. there was no significant difference in the number of colonies on plates exposed to devices compared to control, in the number for all devices, or in all bacteria tested in experiments  in the 14.4 m3 chamber. these results strongly suggest that these devices have almost no bactericidal effect, at least in space exceeding this volume. colony formation was suppressed in the glove box in all devices and in all bacteria tested except p. aeruginosa, although the degree of suppression differed among experiments. the colony formation suppression mechanism was analyzed, and indicated that:colony formation did not change even after the removal of plasmacluster ions, nanoe particles, or negative ions from the air, while colony  formation was decreased drastically by the removal of ozone from space, which was revealed to be generated inevitably during device operation. these results strongly suggest that the bactericidal effect seen only on the agar plate in narrow space was explained by ozone released in space as a by-product, not by special materials as advertising claimed. it is thus important to analyze the effect of special materials such as those done in this study and to suggest the involvement of ozone as the true cause, as have been done in this study, in evaluating bactericidal effect or viral inactivation as advertised by these companies.

TI  == the insect galleria mellonella as a powerful infection model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  == the study of bacterial virulence often requires a suitable animal model. mammalian models of infection are costly and may raise ethical issues. the use of insects as infection models provides a valuable alternative. compared to other non-vertebrate model hosts such as nematodes, insects have a relatively advanced  system of antimicrobial defenses and are thus more likely to produce information  relevant to the mammalian infection process. like mammals, insects possess a complex innate immune system(1). cells in the hemolymph are capable of phagocytosing or encapsulating microbial invaders, and humoral responses include  the inducible production of lysozyme and small antibacterial peptides(2,3). in addition, analogies are found between the epithelial cells of insect larval midguts and intestinal cells of mammalian digestive systems. finally, several basic components essential for the bacterial infection process such as cell adhesion, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, tissue degradation and adaptation to oxidative stress are likely to be important in both insects and mammals(1). thus, insects are polyvalent tools for the identification and characterization of microbial virulence factors involved in mammalian infections. larvae of the greater wax moth galleria mellonella have been shown to provide a useful insight  into the pathogenesis of a wide range of microbial infections including mammalian fungal (fusarium oxysporum, aspergillus fumigatus, candida albicans) and bacterial pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris, serratia marcescens pseudomonas aeruginosa, listeria monocytogenes or enterococcus faecalis(4-7). regardless of the bacterial species, results obtained with galleria larvae infected by direct injection through the cuticle consistently correlate with those of similar mammalian studies: bacterial strains that are attenuated in mammalian models demonstrate lower virulence in galleria, and strains causing severe human infections are also highly virulent in the galleria  model(8-11). oral infection of galleria is much less used and additional compounds, like specific toxins, are needed to reach mortality. g. mellonella larvae present several technical advantages: they are relatively large (last instar larvae before pupation are about 2 cm long and weight 250 mg), thus enabling the injection of defined doses of bacteria; they can be reared at various temperatures (20 degrees c to 30 degrees c) and infection studies can be  conducted between 15 degrees c to above 37 degrees c(12,13), allowing experiments that mimic a mammalian environment. in addition, insect rearing is easy and relatively cheap. infection of the larvae allows monitoring bacterial virulence by several means, including calculation of ld50(14), measurement of bacterial survival(15,16) and examination of the infection process(17). here, we describe the rearing of the insects, covering all life stages of g. mellonella. we provide a detailed protocol of infection by two routes of inoculation: oral and intra haemocoelic. the bacterial model used in this protocol is bacillus cereus, a gram positive pathogen implicated in gastrointestinal as well as in other severe local or systemic opportunistic infections(18,19).

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

AB  == the hygroscopic secretion produced by the secretory setae of terrestrial larvae of the biting midge forcipomyia nigra (winnertz) was analysed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the viscous secretion is stored at the top of each seta and absorbs water from moist air. gc-ms analyses (four independent tests) showed that the secretion contained 12 free fatty acids, the most abundant of which were oleic (18:1), palmitic (16:0), palmitoleic (16:1) and linoleic (18:2). other acids identified were valeric (5:0), enanthic (7:0), caprylic (8:0), pelargonic (9:0), capric (10:0), lauric (12:0), myristic (14:0) and stearic (18:0). two other compounds, glycerol and pyroglutamic acid, were also found. the antibacterial activity of the fatty acids and pyroglutamic acid was tested using the agar disc diffusion method and targeted gram positive (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis) and gram negative bacterial strains (citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens). the antifungal activity was tested by determining minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of examined compounds. fatty acids were tested against enthomopathogenic fungi (paecilomyces lilacinus, paecilomyces fumosoroseus, lecanicillium lecanii, metarhizium anisopliae, beauveria bassiana (tve-n39), beauveria bassiana (dv-1/07)). the most effective acids against bacterial and fungal growth were c(9:0), c(10:0) and c(16:1), whereas c(14:0), c(16:0,) c(18:0) and c(18:1) demonstrated rather poor antifungal activity and did not inhibit the growth of bacteria. the antimicrobial assay investigated mixtures of fatty and pyroglutamic acids (corresponding to the results of each gc-ms test): they were found to be active against almost all the bacteria except p. fluorescens and also demonstrated certain fungistatic activity against enthomopathogenic fungi. the hygroscopic secretion facilitates cuticular respiration and plays an important role in the antimicrobial protection of f. nigra larvae living in moist terrestrial habitats.

TI  == novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-gc content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptor 2.
AB  == bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). these bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by  the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. the presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-gc gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-gc content gram-positive bacteria. here, through intensive ms analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an n-acyl-s-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-gc gram-positive enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus bulgaricus. two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a tlr2-dependent and tlr1-independent manner but with a different dependence on tlr6. additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. one is  the "n-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing n-acetyl-s-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis. the n-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the tlr2/6 heterodimer. the other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure  containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel tlr2-stimulating lyso and n-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-gc content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key  enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.

TI  == coriander (coriandrum sativum l.) essential oil: its antibacterial activity and mode of action evaluated by flow cytometry.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the antibacterial effect of coriander (coriandrum sativum) essential oil against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial susceptibility was evaluated using classical microbiological techniques concomitantly with the use of flow cytometry for the evaluation of cellular physiology. our results showed that coriander oil has an effective antimicrobial activity against all bacteria tested. also, coriander oil exhibited bactericidal activity against almost all bacteria tested, with the exception of bacillus cereus and enterococcus faecalis. propidium iodide incorporation and concomitant loss of all other cellular functions such as efflux activity, respiratory activity and membrane potential seem to suggest that the primary mechanism of action of coriander oil is membrane damage, which leads to cell death. the results obtained herein further encourage the use of coriander oil in antibacterial formulations due to the fact that coriander oil effectively  kills pathogenic bacteria related to foodborne diseases and hospital infections.

TI  == the role of two families of bacterial enzymes in putrescine synthesis from agmatine via agmatine deiminase.
AB  == putrescine, one of the main biogenic amines associated to microbial food spoilage, can be formed by bacteria from arginine via ornithine decarboxylase (odc), or from agmatine via agmatine deiminase (agdi). this study aims to correlate putrescine production from agmatine to the pathway involving n-carbamoylputrescine formation via addi (the agua product) and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (the agub product), or putrescine carbamoyltransferase (the ptca product) in bacteria. pcr methods were developed to detect the two genes involved in putrescine production from agmatine. putrescine production from agmatine could be linked to the agua and ptca genes in lactobacillus hilgardii x1b, enterococcus faecalis atcc 11700, and bacillus cereus atcc 14579. by contrast lactobacillus sakei 23k was unable to produce putrescine, and although a fragment of dna corresponding to the gene agua was amplified, no amplification was observed for the ptca gene. pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 produces putrescine and is reported to harbour agua and agub genes, responsible for agmatine deiminase and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activities. the enzyme from p. aeruginosa pao1 that converts n-carbamoylputrescine to putrescine (the agub product) is different from other microorganisms studied (the ptca product). therefore, the agub gene from p. aeruginosa pao1 could not be amplified with ptca-specific primers. the agub and ptca genes have frequently been erroneously annotated in the past, as in fact these two enzymes are neither homologous nor analogous. furthermore, the agua, agub and ptca sequences available from genbank were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, revealing that gram-positive bacteria harboured ptca, whereas gram-negative bacteria harbour agub. this paper also discusses the role of the agmatine deiminase system (agds) in acid stress resistance.

AB  == the synthesis of a series of pyranoid derivatives comprising a conjugated carbonyl function and related triazole derivatives, structurally suitable for bioactivity evaluation, was achieved in few steps starting from readily available carboxymethyl glycoside lactones (cmgl). 3-enopyranosid-2-uloses were generated by oxidation/elimination of tri-o-acylated 2-hydroxy pyranosides. subsequent wittig olefination provided stereoselectively 2-c-branched-chain conjugated dienepyranosides with (e)-configuration around the exocyclic double bond. a heterogeneous cui/amberlyst-catalyzed 'click' chemistry protocol was used to convert glycosides bearing a propargyl moiety into the corresponding 1,2,3-triazoles. these new molecules were screened for their in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities and those containing conjugated carbonyl  systems demonstrated the best efficacy. (n-dodecylcarbamoyl)methyl enone glycerosides were the most active ones among the enones tested. the alpha-anomer  displayed very strong activities against bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis and strong activity toward enterococcus faecalis and the fungal pathogen penicillium aurantiogriseum. the corresponding beta-anomer presented a very strong inhibitory effect against two fungal species (aspergillus niger and p. aurantiogriseum). (n-dodecyl-/n-propargyl/or n-benzylcarbamoyl)methyl dienepyranosides exhibited selectively a strong activity toward e. faecalis. further acute toxicity evaluation indicated low toxic effect of the (n-dodecylcarbamoyl)methyl enone glyceroside alpha-anomer and of the carbamoylmethyl dienepyranosides n-protected with propargyl or benzyl groups.

TI  == antibacterial & antiplasmid activities of helicteres isora l.
AB  == background & objectives: the multiple drug resistance (mdr) is a serious health problem and major challenge to the global drug discovery programmes. most of the  genetic determinants that confer resistance to antibiotics are located on r-plasmids in bacteria. the present investigation was undertaken to investigate the ability of organic extract of the fruits of helicteres isora to cure r-plasmids from certain clinical isolates. methods: active fractions demonstrating antibacterial and antiplasmid activities were isolated from the acetone extracts of shade dried fruits of h. isora by bioassay guided fractionation. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of antibiotics and organic  extracts was determined by agar dilution method. plasmid curing activity of organic fractions was determined by evaluating the ability of bacterial colonies  (pre treated with organic fraction for 18 h) to grow in the presence of antibiotics. the physical loss of plasmid dna in the cured derivatives was further confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. results: the active fraction did not inhibit the growth of either the clinical isolates or the strains harbouring reference plasmids even at a concentration of 400 microg/ml. however,  the same fraction could cure plasmids from enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus and e. coli (rp4) at curing efficiencies of 14, 26, 22 and  2 per cent respectively. the active fraction mediated plasmid curing resulted in  the subsequent loss of antibiotic resistance encoded in the plasmids as revealed  by antibiotic resistance profile of cured strains. the physical loss of plasmid was also confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. interpretation & conclusions:  the active fraction of acetone extract of h. isora fruits cured r-plasmids from gram-positive and gram-negative clinical isolates as well as reference strains. such plasmid loss reversed the multiple antibiotic resistance in cured derivatives making them sensitive to low concentrations of antibiotics. acetone fractions of h. isora may be a source to develop antiplasmid agents of natural origin to contain the development and spread of plasmid borne multiple antibiotic resistance.

AB  == background: enterocin as-48 is produced by enterococcus faecalis s48 to compete with other bacteria in their environment. due to its activity against various gram positive and some gram negative bacteria it has clear potential for use as a food preservative. here, we studied the effect of enterocin as-48 challenges on vegetative cells of bacillus cereus atcc 14579 by use of transcriptome analysis.  results: of the 5200 genes analysed, expression of 24 genes was found to change significantly after a 30 min treatment with a subinhibitory bacteriocin concentration of 0.5 microg/ml. most of up-regulated genes encode membrane-associated or secreted proteins with putative transmembrane segments or  signal sequences, respectively. one operon involved in arginine metabolism was significantly downregulated. the bc4206-bc4207 operon was found to be the most upregulated target in our experiments. bc4206 codes for a padr type transcriptional regulator, while bc4207 codes for a hypothetical membrane protein. the operon structure and genes are conserved in b. cereus and b. thuringiensis species, but are not present in b. anthracis and b. subtilis. using real-time qpcr, we show that these genes are upregulated when we treated the cells with as-48, but not upon nisin treatment. upon overexpression of bc4207 in  b. cereus, we observed an increased resistance against as-48. expression of bc4207 in b. subtilis 168, which lacks this operon also showed increased resistance against as-48. conclusion: bc4207 membrane protein is involved in the  resistance mechanism of b. cereus cells against as-48.

TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) fruits from different regions.
AB  == structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of kefe cumin (laser trilobum l.) obtained from different regions (germany, india, and turkey). the main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined  by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. it was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. the highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from germany and india was higher than that of kefe cumin  fruits obtained from turkey. the fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus, proteus vulgaris (fmc  1), proteus mirabilis, bacillus cereus (fmc 19), aeromonas hydrophila (atcc 7965), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 15753), klebsiella pneumoniae (fmc 5), salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter aerogenes (ccm 2531) and escherichia coli (atcc 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.

TI  == comparative analysis of the virulence of invertebrate and mammalian pathogenic bacteria in the oral insect infection model galleria mellonella.
AB  == infection of galleria mellonella by feeding a mixture of bacillus thuringiensis spores or vegetative bacteria in association with the toxin cry1c results in high levels of larval mortality. under these conditions the toxin or bacteria have minimal effects on the larva when inoculated separately. in order to evaluate whether g. mellonella can function as an oral infection model for human and entomo-bacterial pathogens, we tested strains of bacillus cereus, bacillus anthracis, enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa  and a drosophila targeting pseudomonas entomophila strain. six b. cereus strains  (5 diarrheal, 1 environmental isolate) were first screened in 2nd instar g. mellonella larvae by free ingestion and four of them were analyzed by force-feeding 5th instar larvae. the virulence of these b. cereus strains did not differ from the b. thuringiensis virulent reference strain 407cry(-) with the exception of strain d19 (nvh391/98) that showed a lower virulence. following force-feeding, 5th instar g. mellonella larvae survived infection with b. anthracis, l. monocytogenes, e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa strains in contrast to the p. entomophila strain which led to high mortality even without cry1c toxin co-ingestion. thus, specific virulence factors adapted to the insect intestine might exist in b. thuringiensis/b. cereus and p. entomophila. this suggests a co-evolution between host and pathogens and supports the close links between b. thuringiensis and b. cereus and more distant links to their relative b. anthracis.

TI  == assay of enterocin as-48 for inhibition of foodborne pathogens in desserts.
AB  == enterocin as-48 was tested against staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes in different kinds of desserts. the highest activity against s. aureus was detected in baker cream. however, in yogurt-type soy-based  desserts and in gelatin pudding, as-48 (175 arbitrary units [au]/g) reduced viable cell counts of s. aureus by only 1.5 to 1.8 log units at most. the efficacy of as-48 in puddings greatly depended on inoculum size, and viable s. aureus counts decreased below detection levels within 24 h for inocula lower than 4 to 5.5 log cfu/g. for l. monocytogenes, bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 to 87.5 au/g reduced viable counts below detection levels and avoided regrowth of survivors. the lowest activity was detected in yogurt-type desserts. for b. cereus, viable cell counts were reduced below detection levels for bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 au/g in instant pudding without soy or by 175 au/g in the  soy pudding. in gelatin pudding, as-48 (175 au/g) reduced viable cell counts of b. cereus below detection levels after 8 h at 10 degrees c or after 48 h at 22 degrees c. bacteriocin addition also inhibited gelatin liquefaction caused by the proteolytic activity of b. cereus.

TI  == effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  == active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. however, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. that  is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging  material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils  (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. a study  of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has  been carried out. antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella choleraesuis, yersinia enterocolitica, escherichia coli), yeasts (candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (botrytis cinerae, aspergillus flavus, penicillium roqueforti, eurotium repens, penicillium islandicum, penicillium commune, penicillium nalgiovensis). the sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. the results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. the most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. all of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.

TI  == antibacterial protection by enterocin as-48 in sport and energy drinks with less  acidic ph values.
AB  == the low ph and acid content found in sports and energy drinks are a matter of concern in dental health. raising the ph may solve this problem, but at the same  time increase the risks of spoilage or presence of pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, commercial energy drinks were adjusted to ph 5.0 and challenged with listeria monocytogenes (drinks a to f), staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and bacillus licheniformis (drink a) during storage at 37 degrees c. l. monocytogenes was able to grow in drink a and survived in drinks d and f for at least 2 days. addition of enterocin as-48 (1 microg/ml final concentration) rapidly inactivated l. monocytogenes in all drinks tested. s. aureus and b. cereus also survived quite well in drink a, and were completely inactivated by 12.5 microg/ml enterocin as-48 after 2 days of storage or by 25 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. b. licheniformis was able to multiply in drink a, but it was completely inactivated by 5 microg/ml enterocin as-48 after 2 days of storage or by 12.5 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. results from the present study suggest that enterocin as-48 could be used as a natural preservative against these target bacteria in less acidic sport and energy drinks.

TI  == inhibition of bacillus cereus and bacillus weihenstephanensis in raw vegetables by application of washing solutions containing enterocin as-48 alone and in combination with other antimicrobials.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a broad-spectrum cyclic antimicrobial peptide produced by enterococcus faecalis. in the present study, the bacteriocin was tested alone and in combination with other antimicrobials for decontamination of bacillus inoculated on alfalfa, soybean sprouts and green asparagus. washing with enterocin as-48 solutions reduced viable cell counts of bacillus cereus and bacillus weihenstephanensis by 1.0-1.5 and by 1.5-2.38 log units right after application of treatment, respectively. in both cases, the bacteriocin was effective in reducing the remaining viable population below detection levels during further storage of the samples at 6 degrees c, but failed to prevent regrowth in samples stored at 15 or 22 degrees c. application of washing treatments containing enterocin as-48 in combination with several other antimicrobials and sanitizers (cinnamic and hydrocinnamic acids, carvacrol, polyphosphoric acid, peracetic acid, hexadecylpyridinium chloride and sodium hypochlorite) greatly enhanced the bactericidal effects. the combinations of as-48 and sodium hypochlorite, peracetic acid or hexadecylpyridinium chloride provided the best results. after application of the combined treatments on alfalfa sprouts contaminated with b. cereus or with b. weihenstephanensis, viable bacilli were not detected or remained at very low concentrations in the treated samples during a 1-week storage period at 15 degrees c. inhibition of b. cereus by in situ produced bacteriocin was tested by cocultivation with the as-48 producer strain e. faecalis a-48-32 inoculated on soybean sprouts. strain a-48-32 was able to grow and produce bacteriocin on sprouts both at 15 and 22 degrees c.  at 15 degrees c, growth of b. cereus was completely inhibited in the cocultures,  while a much more limited effect was observed at 22 degrees c. the results obtained for washing treatments are very encouraging for the application of enterocin as-48 in the decontamination of sprouts. application of washing treatments containing as-48 alone can serve to reduce viable cell counts of bacilli in samples stored under refrigeration, while application of combined treatments should be recommended to avoid proliferation of the surviving bacilli  under temperature-abuse conditions.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  == many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. the efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. the method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in  their original packaging. dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. the method is applicable to bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis), bacillus cereus spores and fungi (candida albicans and aspergillus niger). these inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. the test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. after incubation at 22.5 degrees c for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. the membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a stomacher. the supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. the feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. the repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the pharmacopoeias. the lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). the recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = t(0)) is around 90%, regardless of  the strain or the test. the number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (w(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (t(0)) and may be considered negligible. application of this method to different types of wipes  demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. the results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. the differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.

TI  == interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  == protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. we investigated the interactions of bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with the amoeba, acanthamoeba polyphaga. there was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except l. monocytogenes and s. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that s. aureus survived and may even multiply within a. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of l. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.

TI  == qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to study the role of qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (prps) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. methods: a pcr-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for qnr-like prps in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis in escherichia coli dh10b. mic values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and e. coli dh10b harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for prps. results: amino acid identity of qnr-like prps in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnra1, qnrb1 and qnrs1 was in the range of 16%  to 22%. recombinant plasmids coding for qnr-like prps conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/l for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/l), depending on the antimicrobial agent and prp. the prp from b. subtilis showed no protective effect. conclusions: the prps analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in e. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in  quinolone resistance of prps from different gram-positive species. these gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.

TI  == alkyl deoxy-arabino-hexopyranosides: synthesis, surface properties, and biological activities.
AB  == octyl and dodecyl glycosides possessing 2-deoxy-arabino-hexopyranoside moieties belonging to the d- and l-series in their alpha- and beta-forms were synthesized  by reaction of an acetyl protected glycal with octanol or dodecanol, catalyzed by triphenylphosphine hydrobromide, followed by deprotection. their surface properties were studied and discussed in terms of the adsorption and aggregation  parameters, pc(20), cmc, and gamma(cmc). the antimicrobial activities were assessed using the paper disk diffusion and broth dilution methods. both the octyl and dodecyl 2-deoxy beta-d-glycosides inhibited significantly enterococcus  faecalis, a microbe also highly susceptible to dodecyl 2,6-dideoxy-alpha-l-arabino-hexopyranoside. this compound was particularly active against bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis, presenting for both bacillus species a minimal inhibitory concentration of the same order of magnitude and a minimal lethal concentration even smaller than that obtained for chloramphenicol, a bioactivity which remained unaltered after 1 year solution storage at 4 degrees c. in addition, activity over listeria monocytogenes was also observed. direct cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the glycosides were determined by proliferative  index (mitotic index) evaluation in peripheral human lymphocytes of healthy donors. all compounds induced acute toxicity effects, and the response was dose dependent for the alpha-anomer of both the alkyl 2-deoxy-arabino-hexopyranosides  and for the corresponding dodecyl beta-anomer, what suggests that non-toxic but still bioactive concentrations may be found for these compounds.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == cleaning and handling implements as potential reservoirs for bacterial contamination of some ready-to-eat foods in retail delicatessen environments.
AB  == this study assessed the association of bacteria with cleaning tools, such as floor mops (n = 25) and cleaning cloths (n = 39), and handling devices, such as disposable plastic gloves (n = 20), used during filled baguette and assorted salad preparation in four selected retail delicatessens in johannesburg, south africa. samples of each cleaning or handling tool were prepared for aerobic (apc), coliform (cc), escherichia coli (ec), bacillus cereus (bcc), and staphylococcus aureus (sac) counts, as well as tested for the incidence of listeria monocytogenes (lm) and salmonella (salm) by standard plating methods. bacterial populations attached to the cleaning and handling tools were observed by scanning electron microscopy (sem). ten selected gram-positive isolates were further analyzed by 16s rrna sequence analysis and compared with isolates from filled baguettes and assorted salads. the floor mops consistently yielded the highest apcs, ccs, and ecs (5.7, 4.1, and 3.0 log cfu/g, respectively), while gloves had the lowest corresponding counts (3.6, 2.0, and 1.0 log cfu/g, respectively). low bccs and sacs were recorded in this study (ca. 1.2 log cfu/g), while salm and lm were each detected in five cleaning tool samples. sem showed rods and cocci attached to handling and cleaning tools. furthermore, results of 16s rrna sequence analysis indicated that several gram-positive isolates were identified as s. aureus, staphylococcus pasteuri, staphylococcus sciuri, and enterococcus faecalis. genetically similar strains (100% similarity) were isolated from cleaning and handling tools and associated ready-to-eat (rte) foods. cleaning and handling tools may act as reservoirs of contamination for rte foods during preparation in retail delicatessens in south africa. the transfer of potential pathogens, such as s. aureus, to foods from cleaning and handling tools may hold food safety implications.

TI  == efficacy of enterocin as-48 against bacilli in ready-to-eat vegetable soups and purees.
AB  == the broad-spectrum bacteriocin enterocin as-48 was tested for biopreservation of  ready-to-eat vegetable foods (soups and purees) against aerobic mesophilic endospore-forming bacteria. by adding as-48 (10 microg/ml), bacillus cereus lwl1  was completely inhibited in all six vegetable products tested (natural vegetable  cream, asparagus cream, traditional soup, homemade-style traditional soup, vegetable soup, and vichyssoise) for up to 30 days at 6, 15, and 22 degrees c. a  collection of strains isolated from spoiled purees showed slightly higher resistance to as-48 in the order paenibacillus sp. > bacillus macroides > b. cereus, although they were also completely inhibited in natural vegetable cream by as-48 at 10 microg/ml. however, cocktails of five or eight strains composed of b. cereus (three strains), b. macroides (two strains), and paenibacillus sp., paenibacillus polymyxa, and paenibacillus amylolyticus showed higher bacteriocin  resistance with as-48 of up to 50 microg/ml required for complete inactivation in natural vegetable cream stored at 22 degrees c. repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) analysis showed that paenibacilli (along with some b. cereus) was the predominant survivor in the cocktails after bacteriocin treatment. to increase the effectiveness of enterocin as-48, the bacteriocin was  tested (at 20 microg/ml) against the eight-strain cocktail in natural vegetable cream in combination with other antimicrobials. the combination of as-48 and nisin had a slight but significant additive effect. bactericidal activity was greatly enhanced by phenolic compounds (carvacrol, eugenol, geraniol, and hydrocinnamic acid), achieving a rapid and complete inactivation of bacilli in the tested puree at 22 degrees c.

TI  == development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (pp) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (pe/evoh) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( origanum vulgare), clove ( syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis; the gram-positive bacteria listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis; the molds penicillium islandicum, penicillium roqueforti, penicillium nalgiovense, eurotium repens, and a spergillus flavus and the yeasts candida albicans, debaryomyces hansenii, and zigosaccharomyces rouxii. films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil  completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the gram-negative bacteria. pp films were more effective than pe/evoh films. the atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (hs-sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms). the analyses showed that the oregano-fortified pp films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified pp films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during  the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding pe/evoh films. shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. in addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet eu regulations regarding food contact materials. following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (di-sdme) and then analyzed by gc-ms. the fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.

TI  == vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. in a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (eos)-cinnamon (cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (thymus vulgaris), and oregano (origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of  microorganisms, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella choleraesuis), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis), molds (penicillium islandicum and aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (candida albicans). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were generally lower for oregano eo than for the thyme and cinnamon eos, especially against the relatively resistant gram-negative. the persistence of the eos' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (sdme) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (gc-ms) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (pca). more relevant chemicals were selected. in addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative gram-positive (l. monocytogenes) and gram-negative (s. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (a. flavus), and a yeast (c. albicans). of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their mics, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. to check for possible interactions between components present in the eos, cinnamon eo was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme eo with thymol,  and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified eos using fractional inhibitory concentration (fic) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on a. flavus and for thymol on l. monocytogenes, s. choleraesuis, and a. flavus. in all other  cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against s. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the eos (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon eo.

TI  == role of bacterial and host factors in infectious endophthalmitis.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a frequent blinding complication of globe-penetrating injury and ocular surgery. the outcome of this intraocular infection depends both on the organism involved and management of the ensuing inflammation. the role of various toxins and bacterial factors in the pathogenesis of this infection is beginning to be delineated, but appears to be organism specific. because of the immune-privileged environment of the eye, principles important in the resolution  of infection at extraocular sites cannot be extrapolated to understanding the host-parasite dynamics in eye infection. moreover, some factors that suppress the intraocular immune environment appear to have unexpected roles in activating phagocytic cells of the innate immune system in response to the presence of bacteria. therefore, considerable additional information characterizing the precise role of bacterial and host factors in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis will be required in order to develop new therapies to improve the outcome of this often blinding infection.

AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

TI  == isolation of bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from burkina faso.
AB  == a collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from burkina faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of bacillus cereus, bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. the six selected strains were identified as lactobacillus plantarum by 16s rdna sequencing, species-specific pcr and multiplex pcr of the reca gene. pcr amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in l. plantarum c11. among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from  this cluster.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of saponins from medicago sp.: structure-activity relationship.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of saponins from medicago sativa, m. arborea and m. arabica against a selection of medically important yeasts, gram-positive and -negative bacteria was investigated. structure-activity growth inhibitory effects of related prosapogenins and sapogenins are also described. increasing antibiotic activity was observed going from the saponin extracts to the sapogenin samples, suggesting that the sugar moiety is not important for the antimicrobial efficacy. activity was especially high against gram-positive bacteria (bacillus cereus, b.  subtilis, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis) with m. arabica being  the species showing a broader spectrum of action. discrete antifungal activity was also observed, mainly against saccharomyces cerevisiae. the observed antimicrobial properties of m. sativa and m. arborea were related to the content  of medicagenic acid, while hederagenin seems to contribute to the bioactivity of  m. arabica total sapogenins.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in enterococcus isolates from batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  == this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling  and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with  the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority  of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited  antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk  for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.

TI  == bacteria isolated from the different developmental stages and larval organs of the obligate parasitic fly, wohlfahrtia magnifica (diptera: sarcophagidae).
AB  == wohlfahrtia magnifica (diptera: sarcophagidae) is the major myiasis-causing fly species in the whole of eurasia for most important domestic animals. the aim of the present work was to obtain data on the culturable bacteria isolated under aerobic conditions from this fly: bacteria were isolated from all developmental stages (larvae, pupa, and imago) of wohlfahrtia magnifica, and the third-stage larval organs were also sampled. to determine the possible antagonistic effects between the dominant bacterial groups, an antibiosis assay was carried out. plating and isolation of bacteria was performed by classical microbiological methods. characterization of the isolated strains was carried out via a polyphasic approach; classical phenotypic tests, chemotaxonomical examinations, and 16s rdna sequence analyses were also applied. in the case of maggot macerate  samples, members of the family enterobacteriaceae were characteristic. members of a new genus (schineria) belonging to the gamma subdivision of proteobacteria were also isolated. according to our data, the shifts in the schineria and proteus populations within the larvae are strongly influenced by their interactions with  each other and among the members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the pupa and imago samples contained several other gram-negative bacteria (stenotrophomonas, brevundimonas, etc.). among gram-positive bacteria, in all maggot macerate samples, members of the genus bacillus and the arthrobacter-micrococcus group of  actinobacteria were dominant (neither of them was a producer or sensitive to the  compounds of other microorganisms), and bacteria related to the genus corynebacterium were also found. from the larvae aureobacterium liquefaciens and  enterococcus faecalis were isolated, and from the pupae dietzia maris and enterococcus faecalis. in the samples of third-stage larval organs, the dominant  groups were the same as in the third-stage larval macerate sample; however, several additional genera/species were observed (rhodococcus fascians, streptomyces sp., rathayibacter sp., bacillus thuringiensis/cereus).

TI  == stability of enterocin as-48 in fruit and vegetable juices.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a candidate bacteriocin for food biopreservation. before addressing application of as-48 to vegetable-based foods, the interaction between as-48 and vegetable food components and the stability of as-48 were studied. enterocin as-48 had variable interactions with fruit and vegetable juices, with complete, partial, or negligible loss of activity. for some juices, loss of activity was ameliorated by increasing the bacteriocin concentration, diluting the juice, or applying a heat pretreatment. in juices obtained from cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, green beans, celery, and avocado, as-48 was very stable for the first 24 to 48 h of storage under refrigeration, and decay of activity was markedly influenced by storage temperature. in fresh-made fruit juices (orange, apple, grapefruit, pear, pineapple, and kiwi) and juice mixtures, as-48 was very  stable for at least 15 days at 4 degrees c, and bacteriocin activity was still detectable after 30 days of storage. gradual and variable loss of activity occurred in juices stored at 15 and 28 degrees c; inactivation was faster at higher temperatures. in commercial fruit juices (orange, apple, peach, and pineapple) stored at 4 degrees c, the bacteriocin was completely stable for up to 120 days, and over 60% of initial activity was still present in juices stored at  15 degrees c for the same period. commercial fruit juices stored at 28 degrees c  for 120 days retained between 31.5% (apple) and 67.71% (peach) of their initial bacteriocin activity. solutions of as-48 in sterile distilled water were stable (120 days at 4 to 28 degrees c). limited loss of activity was observed after mixing as-48 with some food-grade dyes and thickening agents. enterocin as-48 added to lettuce juice incubated at 15 degrees c reduced viable counts of listeria monocytogenes cect 4032 and bacillus cereus lwl1 to below detection limits and markedly reduced viable counts of staphylococcus aureus cect 976.

TI  == enterocin as-48rj: a variant of enterocin as-48 chromosomally encoded by enterococcus faecium rj16 isolated from food.
AB  == the bacteriocinogenic strain rj16 isolated from goat cheese has been identified as enterococcusfaecium by species-specific pcr, dna-rrna hybridization and rdna sequencing. purified bacteriocin from strain rj16 is a carboxypeptidase a-resistant peptide with a molecular mass (7125 da) very close to the cyclic peptide enterocin as-48. bacteriocin from strain rj16 and as-48 show identical antibacterial spectra, although the former is slightly less active on strains of  listeria monocytogenes and bacillus cereus. producer strains show cross-immunity. pcr amplification of total dna from strain rj16 with primers for the as-48 structural gene and sequencing of the amplified fragment revealed an almost identical sequence (99.5%), except for a single mutation that predicts the change of glu residue at position 20 of as-48 to val. therefore, bacteriocin produced by e. faecium rj16 should be considered a variant of as-48, which we call as-48rj. pcr amplification revealed that strain rj16 contains the complete as-48. gene cluster. hybridization with probes for as-48 gene cluster revealed a chromosomal  location of as-48 genes in strain rj16, being the first example of a chromosomal  location of this bacteriocin trait. strain rj16 produced enzymes of interest in food processing (esterase, esterase lipase and phytase activities), and did not decarboxylate amino acids precursors for biogenic amines. strain rj16 did not exhibit haemolytic or gelatinase activities, and pcr amplification revealed the lack of genes encoding for known virulence determinants (aggregation substance, collagen adhesin, enterococcal surface protein, endocarditis antigens, as well as haemolysin and gelatinase production). strain rj16 was resistant to ciprofloxacin (mic > 2 mgl(-1)) and levofloxacin (mic > 4 mgl(-1)) and showed intermediate resistance to nitrofurantoin and erythromycin, but was sensitive to ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, rifampicin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline,  quinupristin/dalfopristin, vancomycin and teicoplanin. altogether, results from this study suggest that this broad-spectrum bacteriocin-producing strain may have a potential use in food preservation.

TI  == sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin g by sublethal injury.
AB  == jenseniin g, a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin g activity. bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin g. the bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. e. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin g, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin g. b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and s. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin g when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. when comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin g, e. faecalis and l. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. all cultures except for s. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin g. salmonella typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin g (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). jenseniin g, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == antibacterial effects of carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees c. extracts of immature, mature and ripe carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. the inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees c for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: b cereus > e coli > s faecalis > s aureus > p vulgaris > s flexneri. no significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. no inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  == the ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. these pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. these infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer  generations of antibiotics. in this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis  and endophthalmitis. the ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus, and enterococcus faecalis. mic90 values for the drugs  against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/ml to 0.57 mg/ml and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. the mic90 for gatifloxacin against streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/ml compared with 0.73 mg/ml for moxifloxacin (p = .011). among the gram-negative isolates, the mean mic90 for gatifloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/ml compared with 2.60 mg/ ml for moxifloxacin (p = .023).  mic90 values for gatifloxacin against klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. for the atypicals, the mic90 values for gatifloxacin against nocardia asteroides and mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. in this study, chemically  synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many gram-positive bacteria but not gram-negative  bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic gram-positive bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was observed. however, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. the interaction of tick defensin with  the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential  over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. transmission electron microscopy of micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. these findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. in addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.

TI  == screening of bifidobacterium strains isolated from human faeces for antagonistic  activities against potentially bacterial pathogens.
AB  == as probiotic bacteria, strains belonging to the genus bifidobacterium colonise the gastro-intestinal tract of humans and animals at the time of birth, and they  are found in young as well as in adult individuals in great numbers. moreover, they can interact with the development of enteric infections by the production of antimicrobial metabolites. in this work 281 strains of bifidobacteria were anaerobically isolated from human faecal samples, supplied by volunteers of different ages (youngs, adults, elders), and preliminarly described by microscopic observation. all strains were screened by the fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase (f6ppk) test in order to confirm their classification within the  genus bifidobacterium. selected strains were used to evaluate their antagonistic  activities against escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, staphylococcus lentus, enterococcus faecalis, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, sphingomonas paucimobilis, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, bacillus cereus, clostridium sporogenes. experiments were performed in vitro by different methods  based on the observation of growth inhibition in petri dishes. the strains that showed the highest inhibiting activities were compared by sds-page for total cell proteins, using type strains of human origin as references. representative isolates were metabolically characterised by the biolog system; a specific database was created with strains obtained from our collection and a statistical  evaluation for metabolic patterns was carried out.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

AB  == the aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. the oil from the aerial parts of lantana xenica mold. (verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. the major constituent of the oil was (e)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene d (6.6 %). the antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of l. xenica inhibited the growth of bacillus cereus and proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (e)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus showed a lower inhibition. the bacteria  micrococcus luteus, klebsiella sp., escherichia coli and the yeast candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (e)-caryophyllene.

AB  == the prevalence of strains of staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (cn) staphylococci, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium and bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, cn staphylococci from 63 samples, e. coli from 49 samples, e. faecalis or e. faecium from 107 samples, and l. monocytogenes from two samples. bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (clt), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (cmp), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ery), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (str), tetracycline (ttc) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) characteristics (mic50, mic90, mic range) were determined for each microbial species. resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of  s. aureus, 40% of cn staphylococci, 73% of e. coli, 88% of e.faecalis, 55% of e.faecium, and one l. monocytogenes strain. most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to str, ttc, and ery (mic50 4 microg/ml). a high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. high resistance to clt was found in 11 strains of e. coli (mic 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to cmp (mic90 16 microg/ml) were detected. the highest numbers  of resistance phenotypes were found in e. coil (16) and cn staphylococci (12). eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria  (e. coli, e. faecalis, e. faecium) and pathogens (s. aureus, cn staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. the obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. this confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ery or  cmp. our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.

TI  == characterization of reutericyclin produced by lactobacillus reuteri lth2584.
AB  == lactobacillus reuteri lth2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. we have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity  and characterized its antimicrobial activity. reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including lactobacillus spp., bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria innocua. it did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of escherichia coli was inhibited. reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, staphylococcus aureus, and b. subtilis and triggered the lysis  of cells of l. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. germination of spores of b. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. the fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts  and culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 cultures grown in mmrs by solvent extraction, gel filtration, rp-c(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 da. structural characterization (a. holtzel, m. g. ganzle, g. j. nicholson, w. p. hammes, and g. jung, angew. chem. int. ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a  novel tetramic acid derivative. the inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of l. reuteri lth2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.

AB  == background and objectives: a photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates  (bc pcs). materials and methods: bc pcs in 35% cpd plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (pas iii) were exposed to photochemical treatment (pct) with 150 microm of the psoralen s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva, 320-400 nm). platelet function was evaluated following pct using a panel of in vitro assays. results: this pct process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia  marcescens). no viable bacteria were detected following pct and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control  bc pcs. complete inactivation of the gram-positive bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with bc pcs. pct was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus hiv-1 in bc pcs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (tcid(50)/ml) of cell-associated hiv-1. rapid inactivation was observed with increasing uva doses: with 150 microm s-59 and a 1 j/cm(2) treatment of uva, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log tcid(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) treatment of uva. no physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control bc pcs during 7 days of storage. conclusion: pct with 150 microm s-59 and a 3 j/cm(2) uva treatment does  not adversely affect in vitro properties of bc pcs stored at 22 degrees c for 7 days. the pct process inactivated bacteria and hiv-1 inoculated into the bc pcs.  these results extend the earlier reported efficacy of pct apheresis pcs to bc pcs.

TI  == formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  == mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. the morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did  not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. different bacterial  strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. the results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by  a surface film. the basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane.  the membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. the results of this investigation seem  to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. this type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.

TI  == pathogenesis of gram-positive bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  == the severity of endophthalmitis has been associated generally with the virulence  of the offending pathogen. however, precisely what constitutes the virulence in intraocular infections remains ill defined. we therefore sought to identify the basis for virulence for three common ocular pathogens (bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus) in terms of intraocular growth  rates, bacterial localization patterns, and the contribution of cell walls and secreted products to the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis. rabbit eyes were injected intravitreally with (i) viable b. cereus, e. faecalis, or s. aureus, (ii) metabolically inactive b. cereus, e. faecalis, or s. aureus, (iii) sacculus  preparations from each strain, or (iv) culture fluid containing products secreted by each strain. eyes were assessed at various times following injection by slit lamp biomicroscopy, electroretinography (erg), bacterial and inflammatory cell enumeration, and histology. b. cereus endophthalmitis followed a more rapid and virulent course than e. faecalis or s. aureus endophthalmitis, eliminating retinal responsiveness, as measured by erg, by 12 h. analysis of bacterial localization revealed that b. cereus uniquely migrated rapidly from posterior to  anterior segment during infection. although injection of neither metabolically inactive bacteria nor cell wall sacculi greatly affected erg, significant intraocular inflammation was observed. injection of b. cereus or s. aureus culture fluids caused both significant reductions in retinal responsiveness and significant intraocular inflammation, paralleling that seen in natural infections. the results demonstrate that toxins, intraocular localization, and, to a lesser extent, the intraocular host response to cell walls all contribute to the pathogenesis of b. cereus, s. aureus, and e. faecalis endophthalmitis in a pathogen-specific manner. the key pathophysiologic differences in these intraocular diseases highlight opportunities for optimizing conventional therapies and deriving new ones.

TI  == uptake kinetics of nucleic acid targeting dyes in s. aureus, e. faecalis and b. cereus: a flow cytometric study.
AB  == for flow cytometry-based detection as well as susceptibility testing and counting, staining of the bacterial cells is essential. in an attempt to develop  rapid preparatory procedures for nucleic acid staining of wild type gram positive bacteria, the uptake of fluorescent dyes in viable s. aureus, e. faecalis, and b. cereus cells was studied by flow cytometry under conditions intended to block probe efflux and increase cell wall permeability. the aim of the study was to develop procedures which allow rapid nucleic acid staining independent of fixation, since ethanol fixation is time-consuming and may mask phenomena associated with viability and lead to uncontrolled loss and aggregation of cells. the dye uptake was measured repeatedly after treating cells with metabolic inhibitors in order to block probe efflux, or cold shock (0 degree c) to increase permeability. the probes used were mithramycin (mi), ethidium bromide (eb), dapi, hoechst 33342 and hoechst 33258. none of the procedures facilitated uptake of the dyes to a level similar to that obtained in fixed control cells in all of the species. after metabolic inhibition of b. cereus cells, dapi and hoechst fluorescence increased to a level similar to or above that found in fixed cells,  indicating that the uptake of these dyes is limited by energy-dependent efflux. a similar increase of dapi fluorescence was observed after cold shock suggesting the uptake of this dye to be limited also by permeability in b. cereus. the mi and eb fluorescence increased to the level of the fixed control cells under all conditions tested, suggesting free probe influx in this species. generally, probe uptake in s. aureus and e. faecalis was lower than in b. cereus cells, and no permeabilizing effect of cold shock was observed. in some experiments the fluorescence exceeded that of ethanol fixed control cells, indicating that the fixation may cause conformational changes in dna.

TI  == in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  == resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. we have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, 22 staphylococcus aureus, 6 enterococcus faecalis and 1 bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. the strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. the minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. mics were determined by the etest method (ab biodisk, solna, sweden) on mueller hinton agar. the mics of appropriate american type culture collection control strains were determined. based on the interpretative criteria of the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (usa), 87 per cent of gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. two isolates (1 e. coli and 1 klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. the spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.

AB  == the photodynamic antibacterial properties of a closely related series of commercially available phenothiazinium dyes were tested against a range of pathogenic strains of gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus) and gram-negative organisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa). the photosensitisers were illuminated using a non-laser  light source at a fluence of 1.75 mw cm-2 and this resulted in the enhancement of antibacterial activity in liquid culture. in several cases, illumination resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal concentrations required, giving up to 100-fold increases in bactericidal activity.

TI  == investigation of bacterial resistance to hatchery disinfectants.
AB  == three commercial chicken hatcheries were sampled for environmental bacteria. isolated bacteria were tested for resistance to commercial preparations of quaternary ammonia, phenolic, and glutaraldehyde liquid disinfectants. bacterial  isolates were exposed to several disinfectant dilutions bracketing the dilutions  recommended by the manufacturer for 5-, 10-, and 15-min exposure periods before subculturing to broth medium. approximately 8% of the isolates from two of three  hatcheries were resistant to disinfectant concentrations at and above the manufacturers recommended dilution and time of exposure. resistant bacteria included serratia marcescens, bacillus cereus, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus badius, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas stutzeri, and enterobacter agglomerans.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli: preliminary characterization and optimization of production of acidocin b, a novel bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus acidophilus m46.
AB  == approximately 1000 lactobacillus strains were isolated and screened for the production of antimicrobial activity, using a target panel of spoilage organisms  and pathogens. only eight positive strains were found; two of these were studied  in more detail. lactobacillus salivarius m7 produces the new broad spectrum bacteriocin salivaricin b which inhibits the growth of listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, brochothrix thermosphacta, enterococcus faecalis and many lactobacilli. a new atypical bacteriocin produced by lact. acidophilus m46, acidocin b, combines the inhibition of clostridium sporogenes with a very narrow  activity spectrum within the genus lactobacillus and was selected for further characterization. acidocin b is sensitive to trypsin, heat-stable (80 degrees c for 20 min) and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluid with butanol. native acidocin b occurs as a large molecular weight complex (100 kda), while with sds-page the partly purified activity migrates as a peptide of 2.4 kda. optimization of the cultivation conditions resulted in an eightfold increase of the amount of acidocin b produced during growth. growth is not necessary for acidocin b production; washed producer cells can synthesize the bacteriocin in a  chemically defined production medium. the application potential of acidocin b is  discussed.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ly264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer,  ly264826 had lower mics for 90% of isolates (mic90) than vancomycin for all species tested. it was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), staphylococcus haemolyticus (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and corynebacterium jeikeium (mic90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). for s. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the mics of ly264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. for coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, ly264826 had mics that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. against most streptococcal species the activities of ly264826 and teicoplanin were similar. bactericidal activity against staphylococcus spp. and most streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the mic. one isolate of s. pyogenes and all enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of ly264826, with mbcs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the mics. the addition of 50% human serum resulted  in a significant increase in activity only against staphylococcus epidermidis. variations in ph from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) cfu/ml did not significantly affect the activity of ly264826.

TI  == the bactericidal activity of a deuteroporphyrin-hemin mixture on gram-positive bacteria. a microbiological and spectroscopic study.
AB  == the combined antibacterial activity of various porphyrins with hemin on gram-positive bacteria was studied. protoporphyrin, hematoporphyrin derivative and deuteroporphyrin show only a marginal inhibitory effect in the dark. however, hemin has a strong cytotoxic effect which is independent of illumination and is equally strong in the dark. the disadvantage of hemin treatment is that it is temporary. in this study, we have demonstrated that a combination of deuteroporphyrin and hemin has a unique cytotoxic activity on staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis and bacillus cereus. the effect of the combined compound is stronger than that of the separate constituents, and is as strong in  the dark as in the light. only 0.005% of the initial s. aureus population survive after a 2 h treatment. absorption and fluorescence spectra of hemin-deuteroporphyrin mixtures in water and liposomes suggest the formation of a species with spectroscopic properties which are different from those of the two constituents.

TI  == microbial spoilage of pre-cooked potato-topped pies.
AB  == the ecological succession of bacteria which developed in pre-cooked potato-topped pies stored at two different temperatures was examined. bacillus, streptococcus and staphylococcus-micrococcus spp. were the predominant organisms isolated from  freshly prepared pies and those stored at 4 degrees and 37 degrees c. none of these groups of bacteria caused significant biodeterioration of pies held at 4 degrees c, but all groups grew well in pies stored at 37 degrees c and achieved counts of ca 10(8)/g of sample. bacillus spp. were the first group to grow, followed by streptococcus and staphylococcus-micrococcus spp. growth which occurred at 37 degrees c did so at the expense of glucose, lactate accumulated and the ph of pie components decreased. amylase activity detected in all pie components during storage was associated with the growth of bacillus spp. and probably supplemented glucose already present in pies, by hydrolytic cleavage of  potato, flour or binder starches. spoilage caused by growth and activity of the bacteria isolated was not associated with visual signs of biodeterioration, nor production of 'off' odour usually associated with spoilage of meats. these results suggest that pre-cooked potato-topped pies held at inappropriate temperatures represent a potential public health risk.

TI  == production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  == two staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (bhi) broth  and a meat medium with bacillus cereus, streptococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. both s. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of s. faecalis in bhi broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the s. aureus inoculum was greater than the s. faecalis inoculum. s. aureus fri-100 grown with b. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the s. aureus inoculum was much higher than the b. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) cfu), whereas s. aureus fri-196e produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. s. aureus grown with e. coli in bhi broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the e. coli inoculum was greater than the s. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the s.  aureus inoculum was much greater than the e. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) cfu), s. aureus fri-100 grown with p. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin  only when the s. aureus inoculum was much greater than the p. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) cfu). it can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.

TI  == differential scanning calorimetry of bacteria.
AB  == thermograms obtained by differential scanning calorimetry of a range of bacteria  of different heat resistances were compared. equations were derived to calculate  the rate at which the numbers of viable organisms in a calorimeter decline as the temperature is raised at a constant rate. vegetative bacteria scanned at 10 degrees c min-1 showed multi-peaked thermograms with four major peaks (denoted m, n, p and q) occurring in the regions 68-73, 77-84, 89-99 and 105-110 degrees c respectively. exceptions were that peak m (the largest peak) occurred at 79-82 degrees c in bacillus stearothermophilus and an additional peak, r, was detected  in escherichia coli at 119 degrees c. at temperatures below the main peak m there were major differences in thermograms between species. there was a direct relationship between the onset of thermal denaturation and the thermoresistance of different organisms. heat-sensitive organisms displayed thermogram features which were absent in the more heat-resistant types. when samples were cooled to 5 degrees c and re-heated, a small endothermic peak, pr, was observed at the same temperature as p. peaks p and pr were identified as the melting endotherms of dna. in all vegetative organisms examined, maximum death rates, computed from published d and z values, occurred at temperatures above the onset of thermal denaturation, i.e. cell death and irreversible denaturation of cell components occurred within the same temperature range.

TI  == streptococcus plasmid pam alpha 1 is a composite of two separable replicons, one  of which is closely related to bacillus plasmid pbc16.
AB  == a tetracycline resistance plasmid of streptococcus faecalis, pam alpha 1, is shown to contain two independent sets of replication functions, separated from each other on either side by short (300- to 400-base-pair) sequences of homology. the homologous sequences are oriented as direct repeats and therefore permit the  dissociation of pam alpha 1 into its component replicons, referred to here as pam alpha 1 delta 1 and pam alpha 1 delta 2, as the reciprocal products of a simple intramolecular recombination. pam alpha 1 delta 1 is a 4.6-kilobase plasmid which carries the tet gene, and pam alpha 1 delta 2 is a 5.1-kilobase plasmid which carries no known selectable marker. pam alpha 1 delta 1 is shown to replicate efficiently in bacillus subtilis and to confer tetracycline resistance on bacillus hosts. we demonstrate by restriction mapping analysis that pam alpha 1 delta 1 is virtually identical to a 4.6-kilobase tetracycline resistance plasmid  of bacillus cereus, pbc16, which is known to show extensive homology to plasmid isolates from staphylococcus species (such as pub110), as well as from other bacillus species. the pam alpha 1 delta 1-pbc16-pub110 replicon thus exists naturally in at least three different gram-positive genera, indicating that these plasmids have a high degree of interspecific functional adaptability and supporting the view that plasmid dna is commonly exchanged among many species of  gram-positive bacteria in their natural environments.

TI  == bacterial mesosomes. real structures or artifacts?
AB  == the ultrastructural study of membrane organization in gram-positive bacteria related to the oso4 fixation conditions revealed that large, complex mesosomes are observed only when the bacteria are subjected to an initial fixation with 0.1%oso4 in the culture broth, as in the prefixation step of the ryter-kellenberger procedure. evidence was obtained suggesting that the large mesosomes are produced by this prefization. the kinetic study of the membrane morphological alterations occurring during the prefixation of bacillus cereus with 0.1%oso4 in the culture broth showed that the amount of mesosome material increases linearly from zero to a maximum observed at 1.7 min of prefixation and  that at about this time a maximum is reached for the number of mesosomes per unity of cell area and for the average individual mesosome area. the large mesosomes observed in gram-positives fixed by the complete ryter-kellenberger procedure would be the result of the membrane-damaging action of 0.1%oso4. such damaging action was deduced from the observation thay 0.1%oso4 quickly lyses protoplasts and induces a quick and extensive leakage of intracellular k+ from b. cereus and streptococcus faecalis. in support of that interpretation is the observation that in bacteria subjected to several membrane-damaging treatments, mesosome-like structures are seen after three different fixation procedures. in bacteria initially fixed with 1% oso4, 4% oso4 or 2.5% glutaraldehyde, no large complex mesosomes are observed, small and simple invaginations of the cytoplasmic membrane being present. the size of these minute mesosomes is inversely proportional that causes of fixation. uranyl acetate was found among the studied  fixatives the one to the rate the least damage to bacterial membranes. this fixative satisfactorily preserves protoplasts. in bacteria initially fixed with uranyl acetate no mesosomes were found. the results of the present work throw serious doubts on the existence of mesosomes, both large and small, as real structures of bacterial cells. it is proposed that a continuous cytoplasmic membrane without infoldings (mesosomes) would be the real pattern of membrane organization in gram-positives.

TI  == rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  == a gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic  products. the presence of proteus vulgaris, streptococcus faecalis, s. liquefaciens, escherichia coli b, bacillus cereus, and b. popilliae was detected  in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7-  to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of serratia marcescens, aerobacter aerogenes, e. coli k-12, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhimurium. metabolites elaborated by the  equivalent of less than a single cell of b. cereus, s. faecalis, p. vulgaris, or  e. coli b were sensed by the electron capture detector. the flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.

TI  == survey of the bacteriocines of enterococci.
AB  == brock, thomas d. (indiana university, bloomington), barbara peacher, and deborah  pierson. a survey of the bacteriocines of enterococci. j. bacteriol. 86:702-707.  1963.-a survey has been made of bacteriocine production by a wide variety of well-characterized strains of group d streptococci. on the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. type 1 is produced by all streptococcus zymogenes (s. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. type 2 is produced by some s. liquefaciens (s. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. type 3 is produced  by certain strains of both s. faecalis and s. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group d streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except leuconostoc citrovorum. type 4 is produced by certain s. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of s. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. the strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. no strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.
