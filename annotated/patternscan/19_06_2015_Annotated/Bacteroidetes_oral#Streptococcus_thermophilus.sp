TI  == effects of streptococcus thermophilus on volatile sulfur compounds produced by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == halitosis as oral malodour is an unpleasant odour caused by volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). vscs are produced primarily by anaerobic bacteria that abundantly produce proteinase as trypsin-like enzyme. general therapies, such as  mouthwash and plaque control, do not provide a continuous effect on oral halitosis. streptococcus thermophilus is a probiotic bacterium that is beneficial for human health. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of s. thermophilus on porphyromonas gingivalis-producing vscs and to analyze the inhibitory mechanism of halitosis. p. gingivalis was cultured with or without s.  thermophilus, and the emission of vscs from the spent culture medium was measured by gas chromatography. in order to analyze the inhibitory effect, the antibacterial activity of s. thermophilus against p. gingivalis was assessed. after the spent culture medium or whole bacterial of s. thermophilus was mixed with the spent culture medium of p. gingivalis, vscs were again measured by gas chromatograph. when s. thermophilus and p. gingivalis were co-cultivated, vscs were present at a lower level than those of single-cultured p. gingivalis. s. thermophilus inhibited growth of p. gingivalis, and the whole bacteria and the spent culture medium of s. thermophilus reduced emission of vscs gas. s. thermophilus may reduce oral malodour by inhibition of p. gingivalis growth and neutralizing vscs with their metabolites or themselves.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.
