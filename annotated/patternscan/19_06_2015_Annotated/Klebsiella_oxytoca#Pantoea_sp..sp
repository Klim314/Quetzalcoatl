TI  == spatiotemporal development of the bacterial community in a tubular longitudinal microbial fuel cell.
AB  == the spatiotemporal development of a bacterial community in an exoelectrogenic biofilm was investigated in sucrose-fed longitudinal tubular microbial fuel cell  reactors, consisting of two serially connected modules. the proportional changes  in the microbial community composition were assessed by polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and dna sequencing in order to relate them to the performance and stability of the bioelectrochemical system. the reproducibility of duplicated reactors, evaluated by cluster analysis and jaccard's coefficient, shows 80-90% similarity in species composition. biofilm development through fed-batch start-up and subsequent stable continuous operation results in a population shift from gamma-proteobacteria- and bacteroidetes- to firmicutes-dominated communities, with other diverse species present at much lower relative proportions. dgge patterns were analysed by range-weighted richness (rr) and pareto-lorenz evenness distribution curves to investigate the evolution of the bacterial community. the first modules shifted from dominance by species closely related to bacteroides graminisolvens, raoultella ornithinolytica and klebsiella sp. bm21 at the start of continuous-mode operation to a community dominated by paludibacter propionicigenes-, lactococcus sp.-, pantoea agglomerans- and klebsiella oxytoca-related species with stable power generation (6.0 w/m(3)) at day 97. operational strategies that consider the dynamics of the population will provide  useful parameters for evaluating system performance in the practical application  of microbial fuel cells.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterization of three bacterial symbionts of fruit  fly, bactrocera tau (tephritidae: diptera).
AB  == characterization of three bacterial symbionts (bc1, bc2 and bc3) of fruit fly bactrocera tau including morphological, biochemical and 16s rdna (rrs gene) analysis was done to determine their taxonomic position. morphological and biochemical characterization placed two bacteria (bc1, klebsiella oxytoca and bc2, pantoea agglomerans) into family enterobacteriaceae and the third one (bc3,  staphylococcus sp.) into family staphylococcaceae. 16s rdna gene sequence comparison with the available ncbi database sequences further confirmed the characterizations of bacterial symbionts. molecular phylogeny of klebsiella oxytoca and pantoea agglomerans closely related to the other free living enterobacterial members with 74 to 93% sequence homology (genetic distance 0.000  to 0.085); however, they showed only 74 to 87% similarity with other insect symbionts (genetic distance 0.090 to 0.121). staphylococcus sp. showed 94% sequence homology with other members of family staphylococcaceae with the genetic distance of 0.013. population of these symbionts in adult fruit flies increased exponentially up to the 10th day of adult emergence and thereafter it became almost constant.

TI  == [intestinal enterobacteria of the hibernating apis mellifera mellifera l. bees].
AB  == dynamics of enterobacteria of normal intestinal microflora was studied in apis mellifera mellifera l. bees hibernating under snow in the western urals. the cell numbers (n) of the predominant species klebsiella oxytoca increased from 10-10(6) cfu/bee in november 2004 to 10(4)-10(7) cfu/bee in march 2005; its frequency of occurrence (p) increased from 92 to 100%. increase of providencia rettgeri (11.2004: n up to 10(6), p 25%; 03.2005: n 10(2)-10(6), p 80%) was accompanied by the substitution of morganella morganii (11.2004: n up to 10(6), p 25%) with proteus vulgaris (03.2005: n up to 10(5), p 8%). by spring, hafnia alvei and citrobacter sp., which are pathogenic to bees, disappeared (11.2004: n up to 10(5), p 13 and 10%, respectively). endophytic species pantoea agglomerans, leclecria sp., and other representatives of the "enterobacter agglomerans" group  were present in november and after the first emergence in spring (n up to 10(5);  november: p 15%; april: p 23%). in april, the number of enterobacteria decreased  to 10(5), and p. rettgeri became the predominant species (p 54%) instead of k. oxytoca (p 43%).

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == dust-borne bacteria in animal sheds, schools and children's day care centres.
AB  == a total of 316 bacterial strains, including psychrophiles, mesophiles and thermophiles, were isolated and identified from indoor dusts in schools, children's day care centres and animal sheds. several species which had not previously been reported from indoor environments were found: sphingomonas, brevibacterium, nocardiopsis, deinococcus and rhodococcus/gordona. a new psychrophilic actinomycete genus was also found in animal sheds, representing a new undescribed peptidoglycan type and an unusual whole-cell fatty acid composition. the indoor dusts of animal sheds contained mainly the gram-negative  genera pseudomonas, pantoea, flavobacterium and xanthomonas early in the indoor feeding season, but changed to a composition dominated by bacillus, micrococcus and mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes towards the end of the season. the  dust contained, and air-borne bacterial flora in schools and day care centres were dominated by, gram-positive bacilli and actinomycetes, notably bacillus cereus, brevibacillus brevis, b. licheniformis, b. subtilis and species of arthrobacter, corynebacterium, rhodococcus/gordona, nocardiopsis sp., deinococcus, staphylococcus and micrococcus. indoor air and dust contained klebsiella oxytoca, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, ac. lwoffi, bacillus cereus and  nocardiopsis dassonvillei with the status of hazard group ii. indoor dusts of animal sheds contained eight different 3-hydroxy fatty acids, the 2-hydroxy fatty acid 14:0 and two 10-methyl fatty acids, whereas in dusts from schools and day care centres, these were below the detection level (< 3.5 ng mg-1). the 3-and 2-hydroxy fatty acids could be assigned to one or more of the dust-contained cultivable strains, but 10-methyl c16:0 was not present in any of the strains isolated. the dusts from schools and children's day care centres contained 0.2-0.3 ng of endotoxin mg-1 and 0.5-1.4 ng of beta-d-glucan mg-1, whereas the dusts from animal sheds contained more 0.3-41 ng mg-1 and 8-35 ng mg-1, respectively.
