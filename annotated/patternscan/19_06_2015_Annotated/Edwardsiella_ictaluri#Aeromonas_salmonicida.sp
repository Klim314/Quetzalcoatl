TI  == bactericidal efficacy of elevated ph on fish pathogenic and environmental bacteria.
AB  == ship ballast water is a recognized medium for transfer and introductions of nonindigenous species. there is a need for new ballast water treatment methods that effectively and safely eliminate or greatly minimize movements of these species. the present study employed laboratory methods to evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of increased ph (ph 10.0-12.0) for exposure durations of up to 72 h to kill a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria including fish pathogens (aeromonas spp., yersinia ruckeri, edwardsiella ictaluri, serratia liquefaciens, carnobacterium sp.), other common aquatic-inhabitant bacteria (serratia marcescens, pseudomonas fluorescens, staphylococcus sp., bacillus sp.)  and indicators listed in international maritime organization d2 standards; namely, vibrio cholera (an environmental isolate from fish), escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis. volumes of 5 n naoh were added to tryptic soy broth to obtain desired ph adjustments. viable cells were determined after 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. initial (0 h) cell numbers ranged from 3.40 x 10(4) cfu/ml for bacillus sp. to 2.44 x 10(7) cfu/ml for e. faecalis. the effective endpoints of ph and treatment duration necessary to realize 100% bactericidal effect varied; however, all bacteria tested were killed within 72 h at ph 12.0 or lower. the lowest parameters examined, 4 h at ph 10.0, were bactericidal to v. cholera, e. ictaluri, three of four isolates of e. coli, and (three of four) aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida. bactericidal effect was attained at ph 10.0 within 12 h for the other a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida, and within 24 h for  p. fluorescens, and the remaining e. coli.

TI  == multiplex-pcr for simultaneous detection of 3 bacterial fish pathogens, flavobacterium columnare, edwardsiella ictaluri, and aeromonas hydrophila.
AB  == a multiplex pcr (m-pcr) method was developed for simultaneous detection of 3 important fish pathogens in warm water aquaculture. the m-pcr to amplify target dna fragments from flavobacterium columnare (504 bp), edwardsiella ictaluri (407  bp) and aeromonas hydrophila (209 bp) was optimized by adjustment of reaction buffers and a touchdown protocol. the lower detection limit for each of the 3 bacteria was 20 pg of nucleic acid template from each bacteria per m-pcr reaction mixture. the sensitivity threshold for detection of the 3 bacteria in tissues ranged between 3.4 x 10(2) and 2.5 x 10(5) cells g(-1) of tissue (channel catfish ictalurus punctatus rafinesque). the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the m-pcr was evaluated with 10 representative isolates of each of the 3 bacteria and 11 other gram-negative and 2 gram-positive bacteria that are taxonomically related or ubiquitous in the aquatic environment. except for a single species (a. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida), each set of primers specifically amplified the target dna of the cognate species of bacteria. m-pcr was compared with bacteriological culture for identification of bacteria in experimentally infected fish. the m-pcr appears promising for the rapid, sensitive and simultaneous detection of flavobacterium columnare, e. ictaluri and a. hydrophila in infected  fish compared to the time-consuming traditional bacteriological culture techniques.

TI  == bacterial vaccines for fish--an update of the current situation worldwide.
AB  == during the last few years, the use of vaccines for disease prevention in aquaculture has expanded both with regard to the number of fish species and number of microbial diseases. according to the responses to a questionnaire received from 41 countries, vaccination is used in the commercial aquaculture of  species like atlantic salmon (salmo salar), rainbow trout (oncorhynchus mykiss),  sea bass (dicentrarchus labrax), sea bream (sparus aurata), barramundi (lates calcarifer), tilapia (tilapia spp), turbot (scophthalmus maximus l.), yellowtail  (seriola quinqueradiata), purplish and gold-striped amberjack (seriola dumereli), striped jack (pseudocaranx dentex) and channel catfish (ictalurus punctatus). the range of bacterial infections for which vaccines are commercially available now comprises classical vibriosis (listonella anguillarum, vibrio ordalii), furunculosis (aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida), cold-water vibriosis (vibrio salmonicida), yersiniosis (yersinia ruckeri), pasteurellosis (photobacterium damselae supsp. piscicida), edwardsiellosis (edwardsiella ictaluri), winter ulcer (moritella viscosa), and streptococcosis/lactococcosis (streptococcus iniae, lactococcus garviae). furthermore, experimental vaccines are used against diseases such as infection with vibrio harveyi and photobacterium damsela subsp. damsela in barramundi, piscirickettsiosis and bacterial kidney disease in salmonids, as well as infection with flexibacter maritimus (now: tenacibaculum maritimum) in turbot. there was good agreement between the information received from different sources in the same country. most vaccines are licensed products, but some non-licensed vaccines are also used in commercial fish farms. most bacterial vaccines are inactivated products and recombinant vaccine technology has so far been used to a very limited extent. salmonid fish are usually immunised with multivalent vaccines by intraperitoneal  injection. in marine fish species vaccination is generally performed by immersion, but use of injection vaccination is increasing, particularly in the mediterranean region. only limited use of orally administered fish vaccines is reported. in general, the effect of vaccination against bacterial infections is good. the best protection is obtained with injectable, adjuvanted vaccines. however, injection-site adverse reactions often occur when such products are used.

TI  == pharmacokinetics of oxytetracycline in the red pacu (colossoma brachypomum) following different routes of administration.
AB  == oxytetracycline (otc) pharmacokinetics were studied in the red pacu (colossoma brachypomum) following intravenous (i.v.) and intramuscular (i.m.) administration at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight. otc plasma concentrations were determined by high-performance-liquid-chromatography (hplc). a non-compartmental model was used to describe plasma drug disposition after otc administration. following i.m. administration, the elimination half-life (t1/2) was 62.65 +/- 1.25 h and the bioavailability was 49.80 +/- 0.01%. after i.v. administration the t1/2 was 50.97 +/- 2.99 h, the vd was 534.11 +/- 38.58 ml/kg, and ci(b) was 0.121 +/- 0.003 ml/min x kg. the 5 mg/kg i.v. dose used in this experiment resulted in up to 48 h plasma concentrations of otc above the reported mic values for some strains of fish pathogens such as aeromonas hydrophila, a. liquefaciens, a. salmonicida, cytophaga columnaris, edwardsiella ictaluri, vibrio anguillarium, v. ordalii, v.  salmonicida and yeersinia ruckeri. these mic values are below the susceptible range (4 microg/ml) listed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) as determined by the nccls susceptibility interpretive criteria.

TI  == automated biochemical identification of bacterial fish pathogens using the abbott quantum ii.
AB  == the quantum ii, originally designed by abbott diagnostics for automated rapid identification of members of enterobacteriaceae, was adapted for the identification of bacterial fish pathogens. the instrument operates as a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 492.600 nm. a sample cartridge containing 20 inoculated biochemical chambers is inserted in the path of the analyzing beam. reactions are converted into a 7-digit octal biocode, relayed via a sensor to the memory module, and compared to biocodes preprogrammed in the memory. an identification is then printed. presently, the quantum ii is capable of identifying human strains of aeromonas hydrophila and edwardsiella tarda. this study was initiated to determine the feasibility of expanding the use of the quantum ii to include identification of bacterial fish pathogens. ten to 50 isolates of edwardsiella ictaluri, serratia liquefaciens, yersinia ruckeri, aeromonas hydrophila, typical aeromonas salmonicida, and atypical aeromonas salmonicida were utilized to determine optimal incubation conditions, relative stability of the biochemicals, and ability to obtain consistent biocode numbers.  after sorting the octal biocodes from the 169 isolates into groupings using a cluster analysis technique, it was shown by a chi-square goodness of fit test that isolates of a given species were sorted into the same cluster group at a frequency of at least 99%. results of this study illustrate the usefulness of the quantum ii bid system for the identification of bacterial fish pathogens not contained within the system's memory module.
