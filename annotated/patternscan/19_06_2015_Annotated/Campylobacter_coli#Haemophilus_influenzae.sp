TI  == chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) grown in r. macedonia.
AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == kpsc and kpss are retaining 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo) transferases involved in synthesis of bacterial capsules.
AB  == capsular polysaccharides (cpss) are high-molecular-mass cell-surface polysaccharides, that act as important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. several clinically important gram-negative pathogens share similar systems for cps biosynthesis and export; examples include escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and pasteurella multocida. each cps contains a serotype-specific repeat-unit structure, but the glycans all possess a lipid moiety at their reducing termini.  in e. coli and n. meningitidis, the predominant lipid is a lysophosphatidylglycerol moiety that is attached to the repeat-unit domain of the cps via multiple residues of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo), referred  to as a poly-kdo linker. the kdo residues are beta-linked, suggesting that they are synthesized by retaining glycosyltransferases. to date, the only characterized kdo transferases are the inverting enzymes that catalyze the alpha-linkages found in lipopolysaccharide. here, we identify two conserved proteins from cps assembly systems, kpsc and kpss, as the beta-kdo-transferases and demonstrate in vitro reconstitution of poly-kdo linker assembly on a fluorescent phosphatidylglycerol acceptor. kpss adds the first kdo residue, and this reaction product is then extended by kpsc. cross-complementation experiments demonstrate that the e. coli and n. meningitidis protein homologs are functionally conserved.

TI  == applications of pcr (real-time and masstag) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in diagnosis of respiratory infections and diarrheal illness among deployed u.s.  military personnel during exercise balikatan 2009, philippines.
AB  == laboratory-based surveillance for diarrheal and respiratory illness was conducted at the 2009 republic of the philippines-united states balikatan exercise to determine the presence of specific pathogens endemic in the locations where the military exercises were conducted. ten stool and 6 respiratory specimens were obtained from individuals meeting case definitions for diarrhea or respiratory illness. stool specimens were frozen in dry ice and remotely tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rotavirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, entamoeba histolytica, giardia, and cryptosporidium and polymerase chain reaction for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, campylobacter, shigella, vibrio, salmonella, and norovirus. eight (4 for campylobacter jejuni, 2 for campylobacter coli, 1 for norovirus genogroup ii, and 1 for both campylobacter coli and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli) of 10 samples were positive for at least 1 enteric pathogen. masstag polymerase chain reaction for influenza a and b, respiratory syncytial virus groups a and b, human coronavirus-229e and human coronavirus-oc43, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 2,3, and 4a, human adenovirus, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, legionella pneumonia, and mycoplasma pneumonia was done on respiratory specimens. out of 6 samples, 3 tested positive for h. influenzae;  1 tested positive for both h. influenzae and human parainfluenza virus 3; and 2 tested negative. laboratory-based surveillance can be useful in determining etiologies of diarrheal and respiratory illness of deployed military personnel.

TI  == exploiting bacterial glycosylation machineries for the synthesis of a lewis antigen-containing glycoprotein.
AB  == glycoproteins constitute a class of compounds of increasing importance for pharmaceutical applications. the manipulation of bacterial protein glycosylation  systems from gram-negative bacteria for the synthesis of recombinant glycoproteins is a promising alternative to the current production methods. proteins carrying lewis antigens have been shown to have potential applications for the treatment of diverse autoimmune diseases. in this work, we developed a mixed approach consisting of in vivo and in vitro steps for the synthesis of glycoproteins containing the lewis x antigen. using glycosyltransferases from haemophilus influenzae, we engineered escherichia coli to assemble a tetrasaccharide on the lipid carrier undecaprenylphosphate. this glycan was transferred in vivo from the lipid to a carrier protein by the campylobacter jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase pglb. the glycoprotein was then fucosylated in vitro by a truncated fucosyltransferase from helicobacter pylori. diverse mass spectrometry techniques were used to confirm the structure of the glycan. the strategy presented here could be adapted in the future for the synthesis of diverse glycoproteins. our experiments demonstrate that bacterial enzymes can be  exploited for the production of glycoproteins carrying glycans present in human cells for potential therapeutic applications.

TI  == enzymatic synthesis of cytidine 5'-monophospho-n-acetylneuraminic acid.
AB  == we have established an efficient method for enzymatic production of cytidine 5'-monophospho-n-acetylneuraminic acid (cmp-neuac) from inexpensive materials, n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) and cytidine 5'-monophosphate (cmp). the haemophilus influenzae nane gene encoding glcnac 6-phosphate (glcnac 6-p) 2-epimerase and the campylobacter jejuni neub1 gene encoding n-acetylneuraminic acid (neuac) synthetase, both of whose products are involved in neuac biosynthesis, were cloned and co-expressed in escherichia coli cells. we examined the synthesis of neuac from glcnac via glcnac 6-p, n-acetylmannosamine (mannac) 6-p, and mannac by the use of e. coli cells producing glcnac 6-p 2-epimerase and neuac synthetase, in expectation of biological functions of e. coli such as the supply of phosphoenolpyruvate (pep), which is an essential substrate for neuac synthetase,  glcnac phospholylation by the pep-dependent phosphotransferase system, and dephospholylation of mannac 6-p. eleven mm neuac was synthesized from 50 mm glcnac by recombinant e. coli cells with the addition of glucose as an energy source. next we attempted to synthesize cmp-neuac from glcnac and cmp using yeast cells, recombinant e. coli cells, and h. influenzae cmp-neuac synthetase, and succeeded in efficient production of cmp-neuac due to a sufficient supply of pep  and efficient conversion of cmp to cytidine 5'-triphosphate by yeast cells.

TI  == haemophilus influenzae as a possible cause of guillain-barre syndrome.
AB  == recent reports have contained conflicting results on the relationship between antecedent haemophilus influenzae infection and guillain-barre syndrome (gbs). to investigate the prevalence of h. influenzae infection in gbs patients in a british population, we carried out a retrospective study with 62 consecutive gbs  patients and 63 normal controls of similar age and sex. whole bacteria of both encapsulated and nonencapsulated strains of h. influenzae were employed as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for anti-h. influenzae igg, igm and iga antibodies. elevated antibodies of two or three classes were found in one gbs patient and none in the normal controls. six gbs patients had igg antibodies against nonencapsulated h. influenzae compared with only one in the normal control group (p=0.06). western blot for igg antibody showed that all  the sera with igg antibodies recognized the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of both strains of h. influenzae. antiganglioside gm1 antibody was not associated with anti-h. influenzae antibody in our study. absorption with encapsulated or nonencapsulated h. influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli before testing on western blot showed that only nonencapsulated h. influenzae absorbed the anti-lps antibodies. in conclusion, there is a possible but rare association  of gbs with nonencapsulated h. influenzae in the uk.

TI  == the emulsiv filter removes microbial contamination from propofol but is not a substitute for aseptic technique.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the ability of the emulsiv filter (ef) to remove extrinsic microbial contaminants from propofol. methods: aliquots of staphylococcus aureus  (s. aureus), candida albicans (c. albicans), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae), moraxella osloensis (m. osloensis), enterobacter agglomerans (e. agglomerans), escherichia coli (e. coli), serratia marcescens (s. marcescens), moraxella catarrhalis (m. catarrhalis), haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) and campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni) were inoculated into vials containing 20 ml  of sterile propofol. the unfiltered inoculated propofol solutions served as controls. ten millilitres and 20 ml samples of the inoculated propofol were filtered through the ef. all solutions were then subplated onto three culture plates using a precision 1 micro l calibrated platinum loop and incubated. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were counted. data were analyzed using a one-sample t test, and a p value of less than 0.05 was selected as the level of statistical significance. results: the ef was able to completely remove cfu of s. aureus, c. albicans, k. pneumoniae, m. osloensis, e. agglomerans, e. coli, s. marcescens, and m. catarrhalis (p < 0.05). a small number of h. influenzae cfu were able to evade filtration in both the 10 ml and 20 ml samples. c. jejuni cfu  were able to evade filtration in only the 10 ml sample. conclusions: the ef removes the majority of microbial contaminates from propofol with the exception of h. influenzae and c. jejuni. although the ef is capable of removing most of the microbial contamination produced by h. influenzae and c. jejuni, a few cfu are capable of evading filtration. consequently, even the use of a filter capable of removing microbial contaminants is not a substitute for meticulous aseptic technique and prompt administration when propofol is used.

TI  == a strategy to retrieve the whole set of protein modules in microbial proteomes.
AB  == protein homology is often limited to long structural segments that we have previously called modules. we describe here a suite of programs used to catalog the whole set of modules present in microbial proteomes. first, the darwin allall program detects homologous segments using thresholds for evolutionary distance and alignment length, and another program classifies these modules. after assembling these homologous modules in families, we further group families which  are related by a chain of neighboring unrelated homologous modules. with the automatic analysis of these groups of families sharing homologous modules in independent multimodular proteins, one can split into their component parts many  fused modules and/or deduce by logic more distant modules. all detected and inferred modules are reassembled in refined families. these two last steps are made by a unique program. eventually, the soundness of the data obtained by this  experimental approach is checked using independent tests. to illustrate this modular approach, we compared four proteobacterial proteomes (campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, and helicobacter pylori). it appears that this method might retrieve from present-day proteins many of the modules which can help to trace back ancient events of gene duplication and/or fusion.

TI  == identification and characterization of an immunogenic outer membrane protein of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == we cloned and expressed in escherichia coli a gene encoding an 18-kda outer membrane protein (omp18) from campylobacter jejuni atcc 29428. the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding omp18 was determined, and an open reading frame of  165 amino acids was revealed. the amino acid sequence had the typical features of a leader sequence and a signal peptidase ii cleavage site at the n-terminal part  of omp18. moreover, the sequence had a high degree of similarity to the peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein p6 of haemophilus influenzae  and the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein pal of e. coli. southern blot analysis in which the cloned gene was used as a probe revealed genes similar to that encoding omp18 in all species of the thermophilic group of campylobacters as well as campylobacter sputorum. all campylobacters tested expressed a protein with a molecular mass identical to that of omp18. the protein reacted immunologically with polyclonal antibodies directed against omp18 from c. jejuni. pcr amplification of the gene encoding omp18 with specific primers and subsequent restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified dna fragments showed that the gene for omp18 is highly conserved in c. jejuni strains isolated from humans, dogs, cats, calves, and chickens but is different in other campylobacter species. in order to obtain pure recombinant omp18 protein for serological assays, the cloned gene for omp18 was genetically modified by replacing the signal sequence with a dna segment encoding six adjacent histidine residues. expression of this construct in e. coli allowed purification of the modified protein (omp18-6xhis) by metal chelation chromatography. sera from patients with past c. jejuni infection reacted positively with omp18-6xhis, while sera from healthy blood donors showed no reaction with this antigen. omp18, which is an outer membrane protein belonging to the family of pals is well conserved in c. jejuni and is highly immunogenic. it is therefore a good candidate as an antigen for the serological diagnosis of past c. jejuni infections.

TI  == cross-reactive antigens shared by pseudomonas aeruginosa, helicobacter pylori, campylobacter jejuni, and haemophilus influenzae may cause false-positive titers  of antibody to h. pylori.
AB  == cystic fibrosis (cf) patients suffer from many of the gastrointestinal conditions which occur in non-cf individuals, e.g., dyspepsia and peptic ulceration. these symptoms may be caused by helicobacter pylori but could also be due to either pancreatic insufficiency or the intensive antibiotic treatment used in cf patients. since cf patients chronically infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa produce antibodies against a wide range of antigens, including antigens common to many other bacteria, e.g., groel and lipopolysaccharide, we studied, by the western blot (immunoblot) technique, the specificity of immunoglobulin g antibodies to h. pylori in danish cf patients chronically infected with p. aeruginosa, cf patients without p. aeruginosa infection but with haemophilus influenzae infection, patients with dyspeptic ulcers associated with h. pylori, and patients recovering from acute campylobacter jejuni or campylobacter coli infection. sera from cf patients with chronic p. aeruginosa or h. influenzae infection and patients recovering from acute c. jejuni infection cross-reacted with h. pylori antigens. a strong cross-reacting protein antigen at approximately 14 kda and minor cross-reactive antigens at approximately 27, 30, and 60 kda (the heat shock protein groel is equivalent to the common antigen of p. aeruginosa) could be demonstrated. the results of this study show that high immunoglobulin g  antibody titers against h. pylori in cf patients cannot be regarded as indicating present or past h. pylori infection unless their specificity is proven by absorption studies.

TI  == in-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  == in-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. mics for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, several enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas hydrophila and campylobacter jejuni were determined. mic values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, h. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of s. aureus, s. pneumoniae, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, e. coli, p. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative m. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-mic concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of  cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. evaluation of bactericidal  activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large  bacterial populations of s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. the bactericidal activity was apparently lower against m. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, s. aureus, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae.

AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == genome maps of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli.
AB  == little information concerning the genome of either campylobacter jejuni or campylobacter coli is available. therefore, we constructed genomic maps of c. jejuni ua580 and c. coli ua417 by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the genome sizes of c. jejuni and c. coli strains are approximately 1.7 mb, as determined by sali and smai digestion (n. chang and d. e. taylor, j. bacteriol. 172:5211-5217, 1990). the genomes of both species are represented by single circular dna molecules, and maps were constructed by partial restriction digestion and hybridization of dna fragments extracted from low-melting-point agarose gels. homologous dna probes, encoding the flaab and 16s rrna genes, as well as heterologous dna probes from escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and haemophilus influenzae, were used to identify the locations of particular genes.  c. jejuni and c. coli contain three copies of the 16s and 23s rrna genes. however, they are not located together within an operon but show a distinct split in at least two of their three copies. the positions of various housekeeping genes in both c. jejuni ua580 and c. coli ua417 have been determined, and there appears to be some conservation of gene arrangement between the two species.

TI  == cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  == the specificity of serological tests for lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. in order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi must be identified.  therefore, to analyze cross reactions of borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (borrelia hermsii, treponema pallidum, treponema phagedenis, leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes o3 and o9), campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes o1, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri and legionella micdadei) were examined by western  blot using borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. broad cross reactivity was shown for  borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kda range. other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kda. some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with treponema phagedenis. the absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kda range. showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, ospa and pc seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. in contrast to p100 and ospa, however, p41 and pc showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus borrelia.

AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == a comparison of the in-vitro activity of clarithromycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, with erythromycin and other oral agents.
AB  == on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations clarithromycin (6-o-methylerythromycin), a new macrolide, was found to be slightly more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci. moraxella catarrhalis, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) and b. ureolyticus and slightly less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter coli/jejuni and the b. melaninogenicus/oralis groups. there was complete cross-resistance between the two agents. reports of potentiation of the activity  against haemophilus influenzae of clarithromycin by its own metabolite and by human serum appear to operate in vivo, and therefore the new agent shows great promise, especially for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of temafloxacin compared with other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == temafloxacin, like other 4-quinolones, was highly active against most isolates of enterobacteriaceae. it was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin but approximately as active as ofloxacin and enoxacin. it was the most active of the  quinolones against acinetobacter spp. and xanthomonas maltophilia but was slightly less active than ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas spp. temafloxacin was highly active against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae and was the most active of the quinolones against gardnerella vaginalis and campylobacter coli/jejuni. it was more active than ciprofloxacin against most staphylococci and equally active against streptococci and enterococci. temafloxacin was the most active quinolone against anaerobic bacteria and, with the exception of a few isolates of bacteroides spp. and some clostridia, all anaerobes were within the sensitive range (mic less than or equal to 2 mg/l).

TI  == antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at university hospital, riyadh, saudi  arabia.
AB  == results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from king khalid university hospital in riyadh, saudi arabia. streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. the sensitivity pattern of staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. the resistance of haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin  and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. the resistance of e.  coli, klebsiella species and proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. the gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). gentamicin and amikacin resistance for pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. salmonella enteritidis, shigella species, and enteropathogenic e. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. ninety six percent of gram-negative rods except p. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. in addition, p. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of cefpirome and cefepime, two new cephalosporins.
AB  == in in vitro tests the broad-spectrum cephalosporins cefpirome and cefepime were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, although often less so against strains  resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanate and ticarcillin-clavulanate, and against most strains of acinetobacter spp. and aeromonas hydrophila. they were also active against pseudomonas aeruginosa, although strains with non-plasmid mediated beta-lactam resistance were sometimes less sensitive. other pseudomonas spp. varied in their sensitivity. both agents were highly active against haemophilus influenzae, but beta-lactamase-producing branhamella catarrhalis were somewhat less sensitive. neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible, although non-beta-lactamase producing penicillin-resistant strains had higher mics. gardnerella vaginalis was also susceptible and campylobacter coli/jejuni usually  susceptible. both antibiotics had good activity against staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci except for methicillin-resistant strains and staphylococcus haemolyticus which were of borderline sensitivity. all streptococci were sensitive, with the exception of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci and enterococci against which cefpirome had greater activity than cefepime. both antibiotics had little useful activity against the bacteroides fragilis group or bacteroides oralis group but were active against most other anaerobes. clostridium difficile and some other clostridium species were resistant.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of norfloxacin in children].
AB  == oral new quinolone, norfloxacin (nflx, am-715), was evaluated for its safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics in children. 1. nflx was effective in 88.0% of 25 cases infected with haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, and other bacteria. 2. after single oral administration of 50 mg and 100 mg nflx tablet at fasting, mean peak values of serum concentration were 0.35, 0.48 microgram/ml and t1/2 values were 2.2, 2.7 hours, respectively. 3. no adverse reactions suggestive for arthropathy were encountered with nflx therapy with daily doses of 4.6-35.7 mg/kg (maximum 600 mg per day) and duration of 3 to  19 days. from these preliminary data, nflx seems to have a place in the treatment of pediatric infectious diseases.

TI  == in-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in canada.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. against the enteric pathogens salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei, yersinia enterocolitica and  campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. meropenem was also more active than imipenem against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.25 mg/l), against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against acinetobacter spp. and  two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. both  meropenem and imipenem were inactive against ps. (xanthomonas) maltophilia.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. iii. microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates.  an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and  10(6) cfu) were used throughout. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, indole-positive proteus spp., enterobacter spp., shigella sonnei, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. serratia marcescens and providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at  4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. the activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against ps. aeruginosa. pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant ps. aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefotiam therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotiam (ctm) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-six  patients were treated with 40 to 200 mg/kg per day of ctm by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute  bronchitis (1), pneumonia (4), empyema (2), urinary tract infection (2), typhoid  fever (1), acute enterocolitis (2), partially-treated purulent meningitis (1), and suspected septicemia in neuroblastoma (1); and the remaining ten patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pyogenes (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (4), haemophilus influenzae (4), escherichia coli (1), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (1), salmonella typhi (1), and campylobacter jejuni (1). all but two patients of bacterial infections were cured after the ctm therapy, and the rate of efficacy was 87.5%. diarrhea (3), urticaria (1), transient elevation of got and gpt (1), and transient eosinophilia (3) were found to be associated with  the ctm therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum ctm level was 0.93 +/- 0.13 hours, and excretion into the urine was  rapid. csf concentration obtained 1 hour after an intravenous injection of 21 mg/kg of ctm in a case with inflamed meninges was 1.5 mcg/ml, and the csf/serum ratio was 9.0%. from these data, ctm appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.
