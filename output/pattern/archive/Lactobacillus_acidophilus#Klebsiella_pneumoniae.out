[antagonistic effect of bacteriocinogenic lactobacillus acidophilus on klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter freundii and proteus mirabilis cells].
data of the ultrastructural cellular changes of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, including k. pneumoniae, c. freundii and p. mirabilis cells impacts to bacteriocin-producing l. acidophilus are presented. enterobacteria in response to the bacteriocinogenic effect of lactobacilli are manifestated by expressive destructions of sensitive to pore formation bacteriocin cells. various morphological types of enterobacteria cells with increase of involution, lysing and resting forms are revealed. the specific ultrastructural changes of enterobacteria cells which evidencing the significant destructive processes of the cells membranes are detected. the destabilization of cellular wall in expansion periplasmic spaces and appearance of the ultrastructural reorganization of bacterial cells nucleoid also are registrated. revealing the mechanism of lactobacilli secreted bacteriocin action to conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria might provide new ways to select the effective highly antagonistic probiotic strains.
the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
