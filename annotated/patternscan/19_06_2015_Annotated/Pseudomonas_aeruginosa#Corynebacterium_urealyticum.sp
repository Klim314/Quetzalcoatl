TI  == rapid one step detection of pathogenic bacteria in urine with sexually transmitted disease (std) and prostatitis patient by multiplex pcr assay (mpcr).
AB  == we developed a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay to simultaneously detect chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma urealyticum, corynebacterium spp. and seudomona aeruginosa. this method employs a single tube and multiple specific primers which yield 200, 281, 346, 423, 542, and 1,427 bp pcr products, respectively. all the pcr products were easily detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and were sequenced to confirm the specificity of the reactions. to test this method, dna extracted from urine samples was collected from 96 sexually transmitted disease or prostatitis patients at a local hospital clinical center, and were subjected to the mpcr assay. the resulting amplicons were cloned and sequenced to exactly match the sequences of known pathogenic isolates. n. gonorrhoeae and corynebacterium spp. were the most frequently observed pathogens found in the stds and prostatitis patients, respectively. unexpectedly, p. aeruginosa was also detected in some of  the std and prostatitis samples. more than one pathogen species was found in 10%  and 80.7% of std and prostatitis samples, respectively, indicating that std and prostatitis patients may have other undiagnosed and associates. the sensitivity of the assay was determined by sing purified dna from six pathogenic laboratory strains and revealed that this technique could detect pathogenic dna at concentrations ranging from 0.018 to 1.899 pg/ul. moreover, the specificities of  this assay were found to be highly efficient. thus, this mpcr assay may be useful for the rapid diagnosis of causative infectious stds and prostatitis. useful for  the infectious stds and prostatitis.

TI  == etiologies of the urinary tract infections in a yemeni city.
AB  == objective: to determine the causative agents of urinary tract infection in yemeni patients in sana'a city, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities of these agents in vitro. methods: consecutive mid-stream urine specimens were submitted to our laboratory by 4029 patients in sana'a city from 1990 to the end  of 1999. the specimens were cultured and the isolates were identified using standard microbiological techniques. the antibiotic susceptibilities of the isolates were also determined (in vitro). results: the number of patients with urinary tract infection who yielded positive cultures from their mid stream urine specimens was 685 out of 4029 patients (17%). the ratio of female-to-male patients was 462:223 (2.07:1). the causative agents were mainly members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 579 out of the 685 isolates (84.5%). escherichia coli  was the main pathogen, 357 isolates out of all the isolates (52%) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, 143 isolates (21%) and proteus species, 56 isolates (8%).  the other pathogens (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus saprophyticus, corynebacterium urealyticum and enterococcus faecalis) constituted 129 out of the 685 isolates (19%). there was a shift in the types of the causative agents of urinary tract infection between the first and 2nd halves of the study period. the isolation of escherichia coli decreased from 60% in the first half to 42% in the 2nd. whereas klebsiella pneumoniae increased from 16% in the first half to 27% in the 2nd, proteus species from 8% to 9%, staphylococcus aureus from 5% to 7%, pseudomonas aeruginosa from 3% to 7%, enterobacter aerogenes from 3% to 3.5%, staphylococcus  saprophyticus from 2% to 3% and corynebacterium urealyticum from 1% to 2%. ninety percent of all the urinary pathogens were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, 75% to nitrofurantoin, 57% to gentamicin, 46% to cefaclor, 46% to nalidixic acid, 39% to doxycycline, 37% to co-trimoxazole and 20% to ampiclox. conclusion: the types of  urinary tract pathogens and their antibiotic susceptibilities in addition to the  rate of isolation from male and female patients are reported. it is recommended that ciprofloxacin and nitrofurantoin or both are used in the blind treatment of  urinary tract infection while awaiting the culture and sensitivity results. it is also recommended to continuously monitor the pattern of urinary pathogens from the community to guide the blind treatment of patients in the future.

TI  == newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  == the improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. several  new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. win 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, enterococcus spp., corynebacterium spp., listeria monocytogenes and bacillus spp. bmy 40062, pd 117558, pd 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these  species. these drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile and the bacteroides fragilis group. mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than mycobacterium chelonae, and mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. in addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against mycobacterium leprae. sparfloxacin, bmy 40062 and win 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. improved antibacterial activity has also been found against mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, acinetobacter spp. and pseudomonas maltophilia. by contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterobacteriaceae. recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including plasmodium spp., trypanosoma cruzi and leishmania donovani, but not against toxoplasma gondii. in the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.

TI  == [comparative bacteriological and chemical analysis of kidney calculi. apropos of  135 cases].
AB  == the formation of some urinary tract stones (struvite stones) is known to be related to infection by urease-possessing microorganisms, such as proteus sp. and some other bacteria. ureaplasma urealyticum, a genital mycoplasma, contains also  urease and is predominantly located in the urogenital tract. its significance in  the production of human urinary stones has not yet been elucidated. in this study, 135 human calculi obtained by surgery were analysed chemically and were cultured for the presence of conventional bacteria and u. urealyticum, 51 were ammonium magnesium phosphate stones and contained proteus (27), e. coli (4), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), streptococcus d (2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1),  staphylococcus aureus (1), corynebacterium (1), candida albicans (1). u. urealyticum was isolated in one patient, from two different calculi (left and right) taken after an interval of fifteen days. different bacteria were isolated  from other calculi (oxalate, uric acid). this findings suggest that ureaplasma urealyticum should be looked for in struvite calculi.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora in semen from fertile and infertile groups  of men.
AB  == semen samples were collected by masturbation under asceptic conditions from men who had sired children within the past 6 mo (group a) and asymptomatic men attending an infertility clinic who had not sired children and whose wives were asymptomatic for infertility (group b). these 109 semen samples were analyzed and cultured for isolation of aerobic and anerobic organisms. overall, 68% of the specimens had positive bacterial cultures: 54% of the samples from group a were positive and 73% from group b were positive. mixed bacterial flora were isolated  from both groups but in group b they were more varied and present in a higher colony count than in group a. staphylococcus epidermidis, staph. aureus, corynebacterium species, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum were isolated from group a. group b revealed these organisma plus streptococcus pneumoniae type iii, strep. pyogenes group a, strep. feacalis, escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans, bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus species, and eubacterium species. semen samples from group a were of better quality than those from group  b. in addition, the antibacterial effect of seminal plasma from group a was greater than that from group b.
