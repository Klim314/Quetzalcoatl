TI  == clinical and microbiological findings at sites treated with orthodontic fixed appliances in adolescents.
AB  == introduction: fixed orthodontic appliances can alter the subgingival microbiota.  our aim was to compare the subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters in adolescent subjects at sites of teeth treated with orthodontic bands with margins at (obm) or below the gingival margin (obsm), or with brackets (obr). methods: microbial samples were collected from 33 subjects (ages, 12-18 years) in treatment more than 6 months. the microbiota was assessed by the dna-dna checkerboard hybridization method. results: bacterial samples were taken from 83  obr,103 obsm, and 54 obm sites. probing pocket depths differed by orthodontic type (p <0.001) with mean values of 2.9 mm (sd, 0.6) at obsm sites, 2.5 mm (sd, 0.6) at obm sites, and 2.3 mm (sd, 0.5) at obr sites. only actinomyces israelii (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001) had higher levels at obr sites,  whereas neisseria mucosa had higher levels at sites treated with obsm or obm (p <0.001). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was found in 25% of sites independent of the appliance. conclusions: different types of orthodontic appliances cause minor differences in the subgingival microbiota (a israelii and  a naeslundii) and higher levels at sites treated with orthodontic brackets. more  sites with bleeding on probing and deeper pockets were found around orthodontic bands.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == prevalence and risk indicators for destructive periodontal diseases in 3 urban american minority populations.
AB  == background, aims: destructive periodontal diseases have been reported disproportionately more prevalent and severe in african-americans relative to other american populations. differences in subgingival microbiota and host immune response have also been reported for african-americans, implying that risk factors for disease progression may also differ for these populations. since it is not clear whether these differences are truly genetic or due to confounding variables such as social economic status, we examined a series of clinical, environmental, demographic, and microbiologic features associated with periodontal disease status in a group of 185 urban minority subjects resident within the greater new york metropolitan area. methods: the study population consisted of 56 asian-american, 71 african-american and 58 hispanic subjects. clinical data recorded included pocket depth, attachment level, gingival erythema, bleeding upon probing, suppuration, and the presence of supragingival plaque. environmental and demographic data recorded included smoking history, years resident in the united states, whether the subject reported a private dentist and occupational status. subgingival plaque was sampled from the mesial aspect of all teeth exclusive of third molars and the levels of 40 subgingival species enumerated using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the african-american group had more missing teeth, deeper periodontal pocket depth and more attachment loss than the asian-american or hispanic groups. however, the african-american group were less likely to report having a private dentist, had a greater proportion of smokers and a greater proportion of unskilled individuals.  the profile of subgingival species differed among the three ethnic/racial groups  with a. actinomycetemcomitans, n. mucosa, s. noxia and t. socranskii significantly elevated in the asian-american group and p. micros significantly elevated in the african-american group. when subset by occupational status, numbers of missing teeth, pocket depth, attachment level and prior disease activity were all found increased in the unskilled relative to the professional group. local factors including the mean % of sites with plaque, marginal gingival erythema, bleeding upon probing and suppuration were also elevated in the unskilled group. the microbial profile differed among the 3 occupational groups with the unskilled group having elevated numbers of species associated with destructive periodontal diseases. conclusions: although greater destructive periodontal disease prevalence and severity were found in the african-american group, these results suggest that environmental and demographic variables, such as occupational status, may have a greater influence on risk indicators associated with disease prevalence and progression in these populations.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.
