TI  == modified oligosaccharides as potential dental plaque control materials.
AB  == metabolic acids produced by oral pathogens demineralize tooth surfaces, leading to dental caries. glucosyltransferases are the key factor in this process. we synthesized various modified oligosaccharides and tested them for their inhibitory effects on glucosyltransferase activity. oligosaccharides were produced using a mixed-culture fermentation of lipomyces starkeyi and leuconostoc mesenteroides and then further modified as iron- and sulfate-oligosaccharides. iron- and sulfate-oligosaccharides reduced glucosyltransferase activity of streptococci from 17% to 43% and prevented the formation of insoluble biomass on  the surface of glass vials or stainless steel wires in the presence of sucrose. they also reduced the growth and acid productions of oral pathogens including s.  mutans, s. sobrinus, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcmitans.
