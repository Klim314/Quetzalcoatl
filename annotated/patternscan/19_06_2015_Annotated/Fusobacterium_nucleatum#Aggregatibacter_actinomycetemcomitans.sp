TI  == coaggregation and biofilm growth of granulicatella spp. with fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == background: members of fastidious granulicatella and aggregatibacter genera belong to normal oral flora bacteria that can cause serious infections, such as infective endocarditis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has long been implicated in aggressive periodontitis, whereas dna-based methods only recently showed an association between granulicatella spp. and dental diseases. as bacterial coaggregation is a key phenomenon in the development of oral and nonoral multispecies bacterial communities it would be of interest knowing coaggregation pattern of granulicatella species with a. actinomycetemcomitans in  comparison with the multipotent coaggregator fusobacterium nucleatum. the aim was to investigate coaggregation and biofilm formation of granulicatella elegans and  granulicatella adiacens with a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum strains. results: f. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher autoaggregation than all other test species, followed by a. actinomycetemcomitans sa269 and g. elegans. a. actinomycetemcomitans cu1060 and g. adiacens did not autoaggregate. g. elegans with f. nucleatum exhibited significantly (p < 0.05) higher coaggregation than most others, but failed to grow as biofilm together or separately. with f. nucleatum as partner, a. actinomycetemcomitans strains sa269, a rough-colony wild-type strain, and cu1060, a spontaneous smooth-colony laboratory variant, and g. adiacens were the next in coaggregation efficiency. these dual species combinations also were able to grow as biofilms. while both g. elegans and g. adiacens coaggregated with a. actinomycetemcomitans strain sa269,  but not with cu1060, they grew as biofilms with both a. actinomycetemcomitans strains. conclusions: g. elegans failed to form biofilm with f. nucleatum despite the strongest coaggregation with it. the ability of granulicatella spp. to coaggregate and/or form biofilms with f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains suggests that granulicatella spp. have the potential to integrate into dental plaque biofilms.

TI  == quantitation of biofilm and planktonic life forms of coexisting periodontal species.
AB  == background: complexity of oral polymicrobial communities has prompted a need for  developing in vitro models to study behavior of coexisting bacteria. little knowledge is available of in vitro co-growth of several periodontitis-associated  species without early colonizers of dental plaque. the aim: was to determine temporal changes in the quantities of six periodontal species in an in vitro biofilm model in comparison with parallel planktonic cultures. material and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus and fusobacterium nucleatum were anaerobically grown as multispecies and monospecies biofilms and parallel planktonic cultures using cell culture plates and microfuge tubes, respectively. after incubating 2, 4, 6, 8 days, biofilms and planktonic cultures  were harvested, dna extracted and the target species quantified using qpcr with species-specific 16s rdna primers. biofilm growth as monocultures was visualized  at day 2 and 8 with confocal microscopy and crystal violet staining. results: the six species were found throughout the test period in all culture conditions, except that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were not detected in multispecies planktonic cultures at day 8. in multispecies biofilm, p. gingivalis qpcr counts  (cells/ml) increased (p<0.05) from day 2-8 and were then higher (p<0.05) than those of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, whereas in monospecies biofilm,  p. gingivalis counts were lower (p<0.05) than those of the other species, except  a. actinomycetemcomitans. when multi- and monospecies biofilm cultures were compared, p. gingivalis counts were higher (p<0.05) but those of the other species, except p. intermedia, lower (p<0.05) in multispecies biofilm. comparison between planktonic and biofilm cultures showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  micra and c. rectus had higher (p<0.05) counts in planktonic cultures no matter whether grown in mono- or multispecies environment. conclusions: six periodontal  species were able to form multispecies biofilm up to 8 days in vitro without pioneer plaque bacteria. p. gingivalis seemed to prefer multispecies biofilm environment whereas p. micra and a. actinomycetemcomitans planktonic culture.

TI  == influence of complement on neutrophil extracellular trap release induced by bacteria.
AB  == background and objectives: neutrophil extracellular trap (net) release has generally been studied in the absence of serum, or at low concentrations of untreated or heat-inactivated serum. the influence of serum complement on net release therefore remains unclear. we examined the dna release induced by staphylococcus aureus and three oral bacteria: actinomyces viscosus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincettii. material and methods: bacteria-stimulated net release from the neutrophils of healthy donors was measured fluorometrically. various complement containing and complement blocking conditions were used, including heat inactivation of the serum and antibody blockade of complement receptors 1 (cr1, cd35) and 3 (cr3, cd11b/cd18). results: while the presence of serum markedly enhanced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and to a lesser extent by a. viscosus, there was no enhancement of net release induced by  f. nucleatum. the serum-mediated enhancement of net release by a. actinomycetemcomitans was neutralized by heat inactivation of serum complement, while this was not the case for s. aureus. blockade of cr1, significantly reduced net release induced by s. aureus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and a. viscosus, while blockade of cr3, had no effect. however, opsonization of s. aureus with antibodies may also have contributed to the enhancing effect of serum, independently of complement, in that purified igg promoted net release. conclusions: in conclusion, complement opsonization promotes net release induced  by a variety of bacteria, including a. actinomycetemcomitans, and cr1 plays a dominant role in the process. complement consumption or deficiency may compromise netosis induced by some bacterial species, including a. actinomycetemcomitans. within biofilms, the complement-inactivating abilities of some bacteria may protect other species against netosis, while these are more vulnerable when adopting a planktonic lifestyle.

TI  == bacterial profile of aggressive periodontitis in morocco: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: aggressive periodontitis (agp) is one of the most severe forms of periodontal diseases. in morocco, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has been  strongly associated with agp, however limited knowledge is available about the implication of other periodontal pathogens in this entity. therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota in moroccan patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 aggressive, 13 localized and 37 generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 20 chronic periodontitis (chp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were  pooled in pre-reduced transport fluid and examined by culture. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more frequent (p = 0.004) in generalised  agp compared to chp, and porphyromonas gingivalis was less prevalent in localized agp, when compared with generalized agp (p = 0.040) or chp (p = 0.016). prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia were also frequently detected in all groups. mean proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in agp groups, when compared to chp, and generalized agp patients harbored significantly higher proportions of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, when compared to localized agp or chp. conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum were frequently detected in this moroccan population with agp. differences in frequency of detection, counts and proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. forsythia suggests the presence of distinct microbiological profiles for localized agp, generalized agp and chp patients.

TI  == laser supported reduction of specific microorganisms in the periodontal pocket with the aid of an er,cr:ysgg laser: a pilot study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a radial firing tip of an er,cr:ysgg laser as an adjunct to a nonsurgical periodontal treatment. methods: twelve patients with chronic or aggressive periodontitis were treated by conventional periodontal treatment using ultrasonic devices and hand instruments and, additionally, in two quadrants with an er,cr:ysgg laser. a new radial firing tip (rfpt 14-5, biolase) was used with 1.5 w, 30 hz, 11% air, 20% water, and pulse duration 140 mus. microbiological smears were taken before treatment, one day after lasing, and three and six months after lasing. pocket depths of all periodontal sites were measured before and six months after treatment. results: the total bacterial load of prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans inside the pocket was reduced significantly throughout the whole examination time. greater pocket depth reductions were observed in all groups. there was a slight higher reduction of pocket depth in the lased group after six months. conclusions: these results support the thesis that er,cr:ysgg laser supported periodontal treatment leads to a significant reduction of periopathogenes and thereby helps the maintenance of periodontal health.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of chemokine cxcl10 for dermal and oral microorganisms.
AB  == cxcl10 (ip-10) is a small 10 kda chemokine with antimicrobial activity. it is induced by ifn-gamma, chemoattracts mononuclear cells, and promotes adhesion of t cells. recently, we detected cxcl10 on the surface of the skin and in the oral cavity. in the current study, we used broth microdilution and radial diffusion assays to show that cxcl10 inhibits the growth of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium striatum, and candida albicans hmv4c, but not corynebacterium bovis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, poryphromonas gingivalis, or c. albicans atcc 64124. the reason for the selective antimicrobial activity is not yet known. however, antimicrobial activity of cxcl10 may be related to its composition and structure, as a cationic 98 amino acid residue molecule with 10 lysine residues,  7 arginine residues, a total net charge of +11, and a theoretical pi of 9.93. modeling studies revealed that cxcl10 contains an alpha-helix at the n-terminal,  three anti-parallel beta-strands in the middle, and an alpha-helix at the c-terminal. thus, cxcl10, when produced on the surface of the skin or in the oral cavity, likely has antimicrobial activity and may enhance innate antimicrobial and cellular responses to the presence of select commensal or opportunistic microorganisms.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == antibacterial photodynamic treatment of periodontopathogenic bacteria with indocyanine green and near-infrared laser light enhanced by trolox(tm).
AB  == background and objectives: it has been shown that certain vitamins can significantly enhance the effect of photodynamic anti-tumor therapy. unfortunately, there is no sufficient information available about the impact of those antioxidants on antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt). the present study is aimed at investigating the antimicrobial effect of the dye indocyanine green (icg) in the presence of trolox(tm) , a vitamin e analogue, upon irradiation with near-infrared (nir) laser light (808 nm) on the gramnegative periodontopathogenic bacteria aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.). methods: bacteria solved in pbs were incubated with icg (50-500 mug/ml) in the presence and absence of trolox(tm) (2 mm). irradiation was performed after 10 minutes of dark-incubation with nir-laser-light (25-100 j/cm(2) , 810 nm). during treatment, temperature was also recorded inside the bacterial solutions. the treated suspensions were serial diluted and plated onto blood agar plates. after anaerobe cultivation for 5 days the colony-forming units (cfu/ml) were determined. results: the antibacterial effect was icg-concentration and exposure dependent. it was found that high icg-concentrations and light fluence rates caused bacterial reduction due to hyperthermia. where low icg-concentrations (<250 mug/ml) and fluence rates only induced minor regression, additional trolox(tm) -administration significantly enhanced the photodynamic effect. while treatment of a.a. (250 mug/ml icg, 100 j/cm(2) ) without trolox(tm) caused no bacterial reduction, additional administration led to total eradication. in the presence of trolox(tm) reduction to one-fifth of the original icg-concentration (50 mug/ml) still induced total suppression of p.g. and f.n. at identical fluence (100 j/cm(2) ). treatment with icg, nir-light or trolox(tm) alone showed no remarkable bactericidal effect. application of high icg-concentrations (500 mug/ml) and exposure values (100 j/cm(2) ) caused peak temperatures of 64.53 degrees c. conclusions: the results clearly show that trolox(tm) significantly enhanced the  antibacterial effect of icg upon irradiation with nir-laser-light. additional administration of trolox(tm) may also increase the efficiency of other apdt systems.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of artemisinin extracts  from artemisia annua l.
AB  == the anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties of artemisinin derived from water, methanol, ethanol, or acetone extracts of artemisia annua l.  were evaluated. all 4 artemisinin-containing extracts had anti-inflammatory effects. of these, the acetone extract had the greatest inhibitory effect on lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide (no), prostaglandin e2 (pge2), and proinflammatory cytokine (il-1beta , il-6, and il-10) production. antioxidant activity evaluations revealed that the ethanol extract had the highest free radical scavenging activity, (91.0+/-3.2%), similar to alpha-tocopherol (99.9%).  the extracts had antimicrobial activity against the periodontopathic microorganisms aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. animalis, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, and prevotella intermedia. this study shows that artemisia annua l. extracts contain anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial substances and should be considered for use in pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dental diseases.

TI  == association between periodontal condition and subgingival microbiota in women during pregnancy: a longitudinal study.
AB  == objective: in this study, the gingival conditions and the quantitative detection  for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia in pregnant women were determined. material  and methods: quantitative determinations of periodontal bacteria by using a sybr  green system in women during pregnancy were performed. women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and non-pregnant women were included in this study. a. actinomycetemcomitans was observed in high numbers in women at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy with a significant difference (p<0.05). f. nucleatum and  p. intermedia were also observed in high levels. results and conclusion: our results show that pregnant women are more susceptible to gingivitis, and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival biofilm might be taken into account for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == selected dietary (poly)phenols inhibit periodontal pathogen growth and biofilm formation.
AB  == periodontitis (pd) is a chronic infectious disease mediated by bacteria in the oral cavity. (poly)phenols (pps), ubiquitous in plant foods, possess antimicrobial activities and may be useful in the prevention and management of periodontitis. the objective of this study was to test the antibacterial effects  of selected pps on periodontal pathogens, on both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. selected pps (n = 48) were screened against streptococcus mitis (s. mitis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis). the antibacterial potential of each compound was evaluated in terms  of planktonic minimum inhibitory concentration (pmic) and planktonic minimum bactericidal concentration (pmbc) using standardized broth microdilution assays.  the most active pps were further tested for their effect on mono-species and multi-species biofilms using a colorimetric resazurin-based viability assay and scanning electron microscopy. of the 48 pps tested, 43 showed effective inhibition of planktonic growth of one or more test strains, of which curcumin was the most potent (pmic range = 7.8-62.5 mug ml(-1)), followed by pyrogallol (pmic range = 2.4-2500 mug ml(-1)), pyrocatechol (mic range = 4.9-312.5 mug ml(-1)) and quercetin (pmic range = 31.2-500 mug ml(-1)). at this concentration,  adhesion of curcumin and quercetin to the substrate also inhibited adhesion of s. mitis, and biofilm formation and maturation. while both curcumin and quercetin were able to alter architecture of mature multi-species biofilms, only curcumin-treated biofilms displayed a significantly reduced metabolic activity. overall, pps possess antibacterial activities against periodontopathic bacteria in both planktonic and biofilm modes of growth. further cellular and in vivo studies are necessary to confirm their beneficial activities and potential use in the prevention and or treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

TI  == regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: in periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (am) and nitric oxide (no). the aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. material and methods: regulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, veillonella atypica, streptococcus salivarius and candida  albicans was examined. am and no were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (no metabolites) griess assay respectively. cellular production of am and inducible no synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. the inter-relationship of am and no production were further investigated with macrophages. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus induced maximal levels of both am and no after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral  keratinocytes. am production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible no synthase inhibitor, nomega -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. likewise, no production was increased upon exposure to am, while the am receptor antagonist am 22-52 reduced the release of no. conclusions: pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, p. gingivalis and prev. intermedia, and commensals, s. salivarius and v. atypica, as regards the upregulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes. interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. understanding the coordinated regulation of am and no production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.

TI  == periodontal and peri-implant microbiota in patients with healthy and inflamed periodontal and peri-implant tissues.
AB  == objective: to compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty-two chinese were included. four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [ppd >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (bop) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (ppd >/=4 mm). subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was used to quantify six pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), treponema denticola (t.d.), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), and staphylococcus aureus (s.a.). counts were log10-transformed. results: the most commonly detected species were s. a. and f.  n., while a. a. and. p. i. had the lowest detection frequency. the detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. there were no statistically significant differences  for any of the species or clinical sites (p > 0.05, cochran's q test). no statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of f. nucleatum. this was more abundant in periodontitis sites (p = 0.023, friedman's 2-way anova). both periodontal and  peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor  s. aureus cells. the log10-transformed loads of s. aureus were approximately 3.5  within each of the clinical sites (p = 0.232). this was the highest of the six species analyzed. conclusions: within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of  health status. the prevalence and levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis  and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

TI  == essential oils and isolated compounds from lippia alba leaves and flowers: antimicrobial activity and osteoclast apoptosis.
AB  == in the present study, essential oils extracted from the leaves and flowers of lippia alba (mill.) n.e.br. (l. alba) were analyzed for their antimicrobial activity and their effects on osteoclasts. the periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a. actinomycetemcomitans; atcc 43717), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum; atcc 25586) and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis); atcc 33277) were used in antimicrobial activity assays for determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), whereas bacteroides fragilis (b. fragilis; atcc 25285) was used as the control microorganism. osteoclast (oc) apoptosis was assessed by tunel assay and fas receptor expression was detected by immunocytochemistry. the analysis of antimicrobial activity revealed that p. gingivalis had the lowest mic values, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans had the highest. l. alba essential oils were found to be toxic to human cells, although the compounds, carvone, limonene and citral, were non-toxic and induced apoptosis in the ocs. this study demonstrates that l. alba has potential biotechnological application in dentistry. in fact periodontal disease has a multifactorial etiology, and the immune response to microbial challenge leads to osteoclast activation and the resorption of the alveolar bone, resulting in tooth loss.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of platelet-rich plasma and other plasma preparations against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: in addition to releasing a pool of growth factors during activation,  platelets have many features that indicate their role in the anti-infective host  defense. the antimicrobial activities of platelet-rich plasma (prp) and related plasma preparations against periodontal disease-associated bacteria were evaluated. methods: four distinct plasma fractions were extracted in the formulation used commonly in dentistry and were tested for their antibacterial properties against three periodontal bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the minimum inhibitory concentration of each plasma preparation was determined, and in vitro  time-kill assays were used to detect their abilities to inhibit bacterial growth. bacterial adhesion interference and the susceptibility of bacterial adherence by  these plasma preparations were also conducted. results: all plasma preparations can inhibit bacterial growth, with prp showing the superior activity. bacterial growth inhibition by prp occurred in the first 24 hours after application in the  time-kill assay. prp interfered with p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans attachment and enhanced exfoliation of attached p. gingivalis but had no influences on f. nucleatum bacterial adherence. conclusions: prp expressed antibacterial properties, which may be attributed to platelets possessing additional antimicrobial molecules. the application of prp on periodontal surgical sites is advisable because of its regenerative potential and its antibacterial effects.

TI  == effect of non-surgical periodontal treatment on short chain fatty acid levels in  gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: short chain fatty acids (scfas) play important roles in periodontal diseases. however, the concentrations of scfas in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with aggressive periodontitis are not known. the aim of this intervention study was to investigate the influences of non-surgical periodontal  therapy on levels of scfas in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (g-agp), and analyze the concentrations of scfas in sites with or without the detected putative periodontal pathogens. material and methods: eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected on filter paper strips from patients with g-agp (n = 20; mean age  24.5 years), before and at 2 wk, 2, 4 and 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal treatment. eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected from periodontally healthy controls (n = 20; mean age 26.2 years). concentrations of formic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and isovaleric acid from the supernatant of gingival crevicular fluid samples were measured by high performance capillary electrophoresis. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum from the precipitate of the same pretreatment samples of gingival crevicular fluids were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. results: the clinical parameters of patients with g-agp during the 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal  treatment were improved remarkably. the formic acid concentration increased significantly after treatment; the level of formic acid was lower in the p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with the negative sites. the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid reduced significantly after treatment and reached the lowest level at 2 wk post-treatment, although showed a tendency to increase after 2 mo post-treatment, and the three scfa levels were significantly higher in p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with those in the negative sites. conclusion: non-surgical periodontal treatment resulted in a significant decrease of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid levels and increase of formic acid level in gingival crevicular fluids in patients with g-agp, accompanied by improvement in clinical parameters. a marked lower level of formic acid, as well as higher levels of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with g-agp was consistent with periodontal pathogen infection.

TI  == relationship of clinical and microbiological variables in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of the study was to analyze how metabolic control of type 1 diabetes is related to clinical and microbiological periodontal parameters. material and methods: the study involved 56 subjects aged from 19 to 50 years divided into 2 groups: healthy subjects (the h group), and diabetic (type 1 diabetes) patients with chronic untreated generalized periodontitis (the dm group). the glycosylated hemoglobin value (hba1c) was determined using the unicel dxc 800 synchron system (beckman coulter, usa), and the concentration in blood was measured by the turbidimetric immunoinhibition method. a molecular genetic assay (micro-ident plus, germany) was used to detect periodontopathogenic bacteria in plaque samples. periodontitis was confirmed by clinical and radiological examination. results: fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, and eikenella corrodens were the most frequently found bacteria in dental plaque samples (77.8%, 66.7%, and 33.4%, respectively), whereas aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was identified 40.7% less frequently in the dm group than in the h group. the strongest relationship was observed between the presence of 2 periodontal pathogens - f. nucleatum and capnocytophaga spp. - and  poorer metabolic control in type 1 diabetes patients (hba1c) and all clinical parameters of periodontal pathology. conclusions: periodontal disease was more evident in type 1 diabetic patients, and the prevalence of periodontitis was greatly increased in subjects with poorer metabolic control.

TI  == effect of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus hd100 on multispecies oral communities.
AB  == the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on different periodontal pathogens has already been described. however, it is necessary to consider the polymicrobial nature of periodontal disease. the current study explores the predation of bdellovibrio on oral pathogens organized in multispecies communities. the effect of the predator was evaluated on in vitro six species communities with microbial culturing. additionally, the effect on ex vivo subgingival plaque and saliva samples from periodontitis patients was assessed. in the latter experiment results were examined with microbial culturing, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the latter technique was used to get an overview of the whole mixed microbial population. results showed that even in more complex models, b. bacteriovorus was still able to predate on fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. however predation on prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis could not be validated in multispecies models. the effect of bdellovibrio was not restricted to the target bacteria. changes in the  overall ecology of the different models were evident. it could be concluded that  the efficiency of predation decreased when complexity of the models increased. however, b. bacteriovorus was able to attack two important oral pathogens, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, even when present in ex vivo clinical samples. these effects still have to be validated in in vivo models to see the impact of bdellovibrio on the whole bacterial ecology.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == real-time pcr quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva samples from  healthy young adults.
AB  == objective: the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. most published real-time pcr assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. the aims of this study were to develop a real-time pcr assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and colony-forming unit (cfu). materials and methods: taqman primers/probe sets were used for the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), and total bacteria. six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals  were determined. the relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and cfu was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial dna and cfu per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. results: fn, ec, and pi were detected  in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for tf, pg, and  aa, respectively. numbers of ec and fn in saliva were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01). the values of dna (fg) per cfu ranged from 64 for ec to 121 for  pg. conclusion: the real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (cfu). clinical relevance: this real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == nanoparticle-encapsulated chlorhexidine against oral bacterial biofilms.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine (chx) is a widely used antimicrobial agent in dentistry. herein, we report the synthesis of a novel mesoporous silica nanoparticle-encapsulated pure chx (nano-chx), and its mechanical profile and antimicrobial properties against oral biofilms. methodology/principal findings: the release of chx from the nano-chx was characterized by uv/visible absorption spectroscopy. the antimicrobial properties of nano-chx were evaluated in both planktonic and biofilm modes of representative oral pathogenic bacteria. the nano-chx demonstrated potent antibacterial effects on planktonic bacteria and mono-species biofilms at the concentrations of 50-200 microg/ml against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and enterococccus faecalis. moreover, nano-chx effectively suppressed multi-species biofilms such as s. mutans, f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis up to 72 h. conclusions/significance: this pioneering study demonstrates the potent antibacterial effects of the nano-chx on oral biofilms, and it may be developed as a novel and promising anti-biofilm agent for clinical use.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == development of an in vitro periodontal biofilm model for assessing antimicrobial  and host modulatory effects of bioactive molecules.
AB  == background: inflammation within the oral cavity occurs due to dysregulation between microbial biofilms and the host response. understanding how different oral hygiene products influence inflammatory properties is important for the development of new products. therefore, creation of a robust host-pathogen biofilm platform capable of evaluating novel oral healthcare compounds is an attractive option. we therefore devised a multi-species biofilm co-culture model  to evaluate the naturally derived polyphenol resveratrol (rsv) and gold standard  chlorhexidine (chx) with respect to anti-biofilm and anti-inflammatory properties. methods: an in vitro multi-species biofilm containing s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans was created to represent a  disease-associated biofilm and the oral epithelial cell in okf6-tert2. cytotoxicity studies were performed using rsv and chx. multi-species biofilms were either treated with either molecule, or alternatively epithelial cells were  treated with these prior to biofilm co-culture. biofilm composition was evaluated and inflammatory responses quantified at a transcriptional and protein level. results: chx was toxic to epithelial cells and multi-species biofilms at concentrations ranging from 0.01-0.2%. rsv did not effect multi-species biofilm composition, but was toxic to epithelial cells at concentrations greater than 0.01%. in co-culture, chx-treated biofilms resulted in down regulation of the inflammatory chemokine il-8 at both mrna and protein level. rsv-treated epithelial cells in co-culture were down-regulated in the release of il-8 protein, but not mrna. conclusions: chx possesses potent bactericidal properties, which may impact downstream inflammatory mediators. rsv does not appear to have bactericidal properties against multi-species biofilms, however it did appear to  supress epithelial cells from releasing inflammatory mediators. this study demonstrates the potential to understand the mechanisms by which different oral hygiene products may influence gingival inflammation, thereby validating the use  of a biofilm co-culture model.

TI  == the interaction of implant luting cements and oral bacteria linked to peri-implant disease: an in vitro analysis of planktonic and biofilm growth - a preliminary study.
AB  == background: there is little consensus on the most appropriate cement to use when  restoring a cement-retained, implant-supported restoration. one consideration should be the interaction of pathogenic oral bacteria with restorative cements. purpose: to determine how oral bacteria associated with peri-implant disease grow in the presence of implant cements. materials and methods: five test cements with varying composition (zinc oxide-eugenol [tbo], eugenol-free zinc oxide [tbne], zinc orthophosphate [fl], and two resin cements [pic and ml]) were used to fabricate specimen disks. the disks were submerged in bacterial suspensions of either aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, or porphyromonas gingivalis. planktonic bacterial growth within the test media was measured by determining the optical density of the cultures (od600 ). positive controls (media and bacteria without cement disks) and negative controls (media alone) were similarly evaluated. the mean and standard deviations (sd) were calculated for planktonic growth from three separate experiments. anova statistical analysis with post hoc tukey tests was performed where differences existed (p < .05). selected cement disks (tbo and ml) were further examined for bacterial biofilm growth. surface bacteria were removed and grown on agar media,  and colony-forming units (cfus) were quantified. results: planktonic growth for both a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis was significantly inhibited (p <  .05) when grown in the presence of cement disks consisting of tbne, pic, fl, and  tbo. in contrast, neither of these bacteria displayed growth inhibition in the presence of ml cement disks. f. nucleatum growth was also significantly inhibited by pic, fl. and tbo (p < .05), but not by ml and tbne cement disks. cfu counts for the biofilm study for tbo gave minimal and, in some instances, no bacterial adherence and growth, in contrast to ml, which supported substantially greater bacterial biofilm growth. conclusion: cements display differing abilities to inhibit both planktonic and biofilm bacterial growth. cements with the ability to reduce planktonic or biofilm growth of the test bacteria may be advantageous in reducing peri-implant disease. understanding the microbial growth-inhibiting characteristics of different cement types should be considered important in the selection criteria.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == subgingival bacteria in ghanaian adolescents with or without progression of attachment loss.
AB  == objective: this study describes subgingival bacterial profiles associated with clinical periodontal status in ghanaian adolescents with or without progression of attachment loss. materials and methods: among 500 adolescents included in a cohort study, 397 returned 2 years later for a periodontal re-examination, including full-mouth cal measurements. at follow-up, a subgroup of 98 adolescents was also subjected to bacterial sampling with paper points at four periodontal sites (mesial aspect of 11, 26, 31, and 46) and analyzed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique against dna-probes from nine periodontitis-associated bacterial species. results: the 98 ghanaian adolescents  examined in the present study were similar to the entire group examined at the 2-year follow-up with respect to age, gender, and cal >/=3 mm. a high detection frequency of fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia (>99%) using checkerboard analysis was found, while for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  the detection frequency was <50%. a strong correlation was found at the individual level between the presence of p. intermedia and the total cal change,  and p. intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis were strongly correlated with a change in cal and probing pocket depth (ppd) at the sampled sites. in a linear regression model, a significant discriminating factor for the total cal change in the dentition during the 2-year follow-up period was obtained for p. intermedia and public school. conclusion: this study indicates that subgingival bacterial species other than a. actinomycetemcomitans, for example, p. intermedia, have a significant association with periodontal breakdown (change in cal) in ghanaian adolescents with progression of periodontal attachment loss.

TI  == a periodontitis-associated multispecies model of an oral biofilm.
AB  == purpose: while single-species biofilms have been studied extensively, we know notably little regarding multispecies biofilms and their interactions. the purpose of this study was to develop and evaluate an in vitro multispecies dental biofilm model that aimed to mimic the environment of chronic periodontitis. methods: streptococcus gordonii kn1, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc23726, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc33384, and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc33277 were used for this experiment. the biofilms were grown on 12-well plates with a round glass slip (12 mm in diameter) with a supply of fresh medium. four different single-species biofilms and multispecies biofilms with the four bacterial strains listed above were prepared. the biofilms were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (clsm) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) for four different planktonic single-species and multispecies bacteria were determined. the mics of doxycycline and chlorhexidine for four different single-species biofilms and a multispecies biofilm were also determined. results: the clsm and sem examination revealed that the growth pattern of the multispecies biofilm was similar to those of single-species biofilms. however, the multispecies biofilm became thicker than the single-species biofilms, and networks between bacteria were formed. the mics  of doxycycline and chlorhexidine were higher in the biofilm state than in the planktonic bacteria. the mic of doxycycline for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, or a. actinomycetemcomitans. the mic of chlorhexidine for the multispecies biofilm was higher than were those for the single-species biofilms of p. gingivalis or f. nucleatum. conclusions: to mimic the natural dental biofilm, a multispecies biofilm composed of four bacterial species was grown. the 24-hour multispecies biofilm may be useful as a laboratory dental biofilm model system.

TI  == antibacterial action of chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == objectives: the antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. methods:  the agar diffusion assay with cervitec((r)) and cervitecplus((r)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. in a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (cervitecplus((r)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (cervitec((r)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and porphyromonas intermedia. friedman/wilcoxon tests and u-test were used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). results: most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: cervitec((r))/cervitecplus((r)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. however, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at  any time. the total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. a tendency to higher counts of a. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. conclusion: both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.

TI  == combinatorial effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole on selected periodontal bacteria and whole plaque samples.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to analyze in vitro the combinatorial effects of the antibiotic combination of amoxicillin plus metronidazole on subgingival bacterial isolates. design: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum  and eikenella corrodens from our strain collection and subgingival bacteria isolated from patients with periodontitis were tested for their susceptibility to amoxicillin and metronidazole using the etest. the fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici), which is commonly used to describe drug interactions, was calculated. results: synergy, i.e. fici values </= 0.5, between amoxicillin and metronidazole was shown for two a. actinomycetemcomitans (fici: 0.3), two f.  nucleatum (fici: 0.3 and 0.5, respectively) and one e. corrodens (fici: 0.4) isolates. indifference, i.e. fic indices of >0.5 but </=4, occurred for other isolates and the 14 p. intermedia/nigrescens strains tested. microorganisms resistant to either amoxicillin or metronidazole were detected in all samples by  etest. conclusion: combinatorial effects occur between amoxicillin and metronidazole on some strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. corrodens. synergy was shown for a few strains only.

TI  == microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == diverse toll-like receptors mediate cytokine production by fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in macrophages.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) orchestrate a repertoire of immune responses in macrophages against various pathogens. fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans are two important periodontal pathogens. in the present study, we investigated tlr signaling regulating cytokine production of macrophages in response to f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans. tlr2 and tlr4 are redundant in the production of cytokines (interleukin-6 [il-6] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [tnf-alpha]) in f. nucleatum- and a. actinomycetemcomitans-infected macrophages. the production of cytokines by macrophages in response to f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans infection was impaired in myd88-deficient macrophages. moreover, cytokine concentrations were lower in myd88-deficient macrophages than in tlr2/tlr4 (tlr2/4) double-deficient cells. an endosomal tlr inhibitor, chloroquine, reduced cytokine production in tlr2/4-deficient macrophages in response to f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans, and dna from f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans induced il-6 production in bone marrow-derived macrophages (bmdms), which was abolished by chloroquine. western blot analysis revealed that tlr2/4 and myd88 were required for optimal activation of nf-kappab and mitogen-activated protein kinases (mapks) in macrophages in response to f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans, with different kinetics. an inhibitor assay showed that nf-kappab and all mapks (p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase [erk], and jun n-terminal protein kinase [jnk]) mediate f. nucleatum-induced production of cytokines in macrophages, whereas nf-kappab and p38, but not erk and jnk, are involved in a. actinomycetemcomitans-mediated cytokine production. these findings suggest that multiple tlrs may participate in the cytokine production of macrophages against periodontal bacteria.

TI  == biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (pds ii(r)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (met) or ciprofloxacin (cip) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. materials and methods: fibrous matrices were processed from pds polymer solution by electrospinning. antibiotic-containing pds solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% met, 25 wt.% met, 5 wt.% cip, and 25 wt.% cip. pure pds was used as a control. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) was done to evaluate met and cip release. dual-species biofilms formed by lactobacillus casei (lc) and streptococcus salivarius (ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. after 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) using agar diffusion assay. results: a three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. pure pds showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% met (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% met (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% cip (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% cip (765 +/- 288 nm). hplc demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. no inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. meanwhile, cip-containing matrices inhibited growth of fn and aa. conclusion: cip-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. clinical relevance: based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.

TI  == photodynamic antimicrobial effect of safranine o on an ex vivo periodontal biofilm.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing resistance of oral pathogens against antibiotic measures urgently requires new therapeutic strategies. in this context, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) may play a crucial part in the future. the aim of the present study was to compare the antibacterial efficiency  of apdt using the photosensitizer safranine o with that of chlorhexidine (0.2% chx) on an ex vivo biofilm. methods: first the antibacterial activity of both measures against planktonic cultures of streptococcus gordonii atcc 33399, streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans atcc 33384 and porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 was observed. then a patient specific ex vivo biofilm was established  from plaque and saliva samples of patients (n = 19) with chronic periodontitis. the antibacterial effects of apdt and of 0.2% chx were determined on the ex vivo  biofilms cultivated for 24 and 72 hours. after cultivation of the treated samples on blood agar (2 days) the results were quantified by counting the colony forming units (cfu/ml). results: photodynamic treatment with safranine o showed a distinct antibacterial effect on f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. whereas s. gordonii was suppressed completely by apdt, treatment with 0.2% chx caused only a partial reduction. in the ex vivo biofilm model (24-hour biofilm), apdt caused a  significantly higher bacterial killing than treatment with 0.2% chx. compared to  the untreated control, there was no significant difference on the 72-hour biofilm for both methods. conclusions: the results show that oral-pathogenic species in planktonic solution can be suppressed significantly by apdt with safranine o. especially for bacteria in a 24-hour ex vivo biofilm, this method is more effective than treatment with 0.2% chx. both antibacterial treatments did not show any significant effect on the biofilm cultivated for 72 hours.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in the genital tract: are they related to adverse pregnancy  outcome?
AB  == one of the most important factors implicated in preterm birth (ptb) is acute genitourinary tract infection. the bacteria causing chronic periodontal inflammation include gram-negative rods and anaerobes similar to those found in women with bacterial vaginosis. the aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between oral and vaginal microflora and preterm low  birth weight. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect both the presence and level of six periodontitis-related species: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp(fn), and prevotella intermedia (pi) for both oral samples of subgingival plaque and cervical samples, obtained from 80 patients, during gynaecological examinations. the more representative oral pathogen (less than 60 percent) species in oral samples of preterm and term group were tf, td, and fn. 24.4 percent of pregnant women presented periodontal pathogens in vaginal swab; the most representative species  with a percentage over 0.1 percent of total bacteria in genital tract of preterm  group were tf, td, and piwith a positive correlation (less than 0.5). the presence of the bacterium t. denticolain the vagina, regardless of the amount, adversely affects preterm delivery.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == dental caries and microbiota in children with black stain and non-discoloured dental plaque.
AB  == aim: we aimed to assess caries experience and microbiota in systemically healthy  children with black stain (bs) and non-discoloured plaque. methods: forty-six children with bs and 47 counterparts with non-discoloured plaque aged 7.9 +/- 1.3 years were clinically examined. dental caries was scored using who criteria. samples of bs and non-discoloured dental plaque were collected from tooth surfaces. the dna of the samples was extracted and real-time pcr was performed to determine the total number of bacteria and the species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus sp., actinomyces naeslundii, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: children with bs had lower dmft (p = 0.013), lower dt values (p = 0.005) and a tendency to lower caries prevalence (p = 0.061) than children with non-discoloured plaque. plaque samples of the bs group contained higher numbers of a. naeslundii (p = 0.005) and lower numbers of f. nucleatum (p = 0.001) and lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == anaerobic co-culture of mesenchymal stem cells and anaerobic pathogens - a new in vitro model system.
AB  == background: human mesenchymal stem cells (hmscs) are multipotent by nature and are originally isolated from bone marrow. in light of a future application of hmscs in the oral cavity, a body compartment with varying oxygen partial pressures and an omnipresence of different bacterial species i.e. periodontitis pathogens, we performed this study to gain information about the behavior of hmsc in an anaerobic system and the response in interaction with oral bacterial pathogens. methodology/principal findings: we established a model system with oral pathogenic bacterial species and eukaryotic cells cultured in anaerobic conditions. the facultative anaerobe bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were studied.  their effects on hmscs and primary as well as permanent gingival epithelial cells (ca9-22, hgpec) were comparatively analyzed. we show that hmscs cope with anoxic  conditions, since 40% vital cells remain after 72 h of anaerobic culture. the ca9-22 and hgpec cells are significantly more sensitive to lack of oxygen. all bacterial species reveal a comparatively low adherence to and internalization into hmscs (0.2% and 0.01% of the initial inoculum, respectively). in comparison, the ca9-22 and hgpec cells present better targets for bacterial adherence and internalization. the production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine il-8 is higher  in both gingival epithelial cell lines compared to hmscs and fusobacterium nucleatum induce a time-dependent cytokine secretion in both cell lines. porphyromonas gingivalis is less effective in stimulating secretion of il-8 in the co-cultivation experiments. conclusions/significance: hmscs are suitable for  use in anoxic regions of the oral cavity. the interaction with local pathogenic bacteria does not result in massive pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. the test system established in this study allowed further investigation of parameters prior to set up of oral hmsc in vivo studies.

TI  == antimicrobial photodynamic efficiency of novel cationic porphyrins towards periodontal gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the gram-negative aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum are major causative agents of aggressive periodontal disease. due to increase in the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) seems to be a plausible alternative. in this work, photosensitization was performed on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in pure culture using new-age cationic porphyrins, namely mesoimidazolium-substituted porphyrin derivative (imp) and pyridinium-substituted porphyrin derivative (pyp). the photophysical properties of both the sensitizers  including absorption, fluorescence emission, quantum yields of the triplet excited states and singlet oxygen generation efficiencies were evaluated in the context of apdt application. the studied porphyrins exhibited high ability to accumulate into bacterial cells with complete penetration into early stage biofilms. as compared with imp, pyp was found to be more effective for photoinactivation of bacterial strains associated with periodontitis, without any signs of dark toxicity, owing to its high photocytotoxicity.

TI  == oral community interactions of filifactor alocis in vitro.
AB  == filifactor alocis is a gram positive anaerobe that is emerging as an important periodontal pathogen. in the oral cavity f. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between f. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of f. alocis with streptococcus gordonii, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. in an in vitro community development model, s. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of f. alocis into a dual species community. in contrast, f. nucleatum and the type strain of f. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. accumulation of a low passage isolate of f. alocis was also enhanced by f. nucleatum. in three species communities of s. gordonii, f. nucleatum and f. alocis, the antagonistic effects of s. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of f. nucleatum toward f. alocis. the interaction between a.  actinomycetemcomitans and f. alocis was strain specific and a. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate f. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. p. gingivalis and f. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of p. gingivalis greater than in the absence of f. alocis. however, while p. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of f. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to f. alocis alone. the inhibitory effect of p. gingivalis toward f. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the mfa1 fimbrial subunit. in addition, ai-2 production by p. gingivalis helped maintain levels of f. alocis. collectively, these results show that the pattern of f. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in f. nucleatum.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish (armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (itcs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus casei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and clostridium perfringens. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method.  the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of the itcs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative  anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. the itcs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a mbc of 1.25 mg/ml, against c. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against f. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. these results suggest that the itcs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.

TI  == efficacy of a new mouth rinse formulation based on 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride in the control of plaque and gingivitis: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == aim: to assess the efficacy of a 0.07% cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) mouth rinse in the control of plaque and gingival inflammation during a 6-month period. material and methods: adult subjects with moderate gingivitis were selected [>/=40% bleeding on marginal probing (bomp)]. after retrieving microbiological samples and evaluating the clinical parameters (plaque, bomp and stain indexes),  a professional prophylaxis was performed and subjects were randomly assigned to the test (cpc mouth rinse) or to the placebo group. subjects were re-assessed after 3 and 6 months. results: a total of 67 patients (35 test, 32 placebo) were  included in the analysis. at 6 months, intra-group significant plaque reductions  were observed in the test group (0.691, p < 0.001), but not in the placebo (0.181, p = 0.653). at 6 months, the mean bomp values were lower in the test group (p = 0.052). changes between baseline and 6 months were significantly higher in the test group both for plaque (p = 0.002) and bomp (p = 0.037) when compared with the placebo. a microbiological impact was observed in the test group, especially for prevotella intermedia. conclusion: the evaluated 0.07% cpc-based mouth rinse, used three times per day adjunctively to mechanical tooth  cleaning, prevents plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation, as compared to  the placebo, for at least 6 months.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == the connection between ruptured cerebral aneurysms and odontogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: patients with ruptured saccular intracranial aneurysms have excess long-term mortality due to cerebrovascular and cardiovascular diseases compared with general population. chronic inflammation is detected in ruptured intracranial aneurysms, abdominal aortic aneurysms and coronary artery plaques. bacterial infections have been suggested to have a role in the aetiology of atherosclerosis. bacteria have been detected both in abdominal and coronary arteries but their presence in intracranial aneurysms has not yet been properly studied. objective: the aim of this preliminary study was to assess the presence  of oral and pharyngeal bacterial genome in ruptured intracranial aneurysms and to ascertain if dental infection is a previously unknown risk factor for subarachnoid haemorrhage. methods: a total of 36 ruptured aneurysm specimens were obtained perioperatively in aneurysm clipping operations (n=29) and by autopsy (n=7). aneurysmal sac tissue was analysed by real time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes to detect bacterial dna from several oral species. immunohistochemical staining for bacterial receptors (cd14 and toll-like receptor-2 (tlr-2)) was performed from four autopsy cases. results: bacterial dna was detected in 21/36 (58%) of specimens. a third of the positive samples contained dna from both endodontic and periodontal bacteria. dna from endodontic  bacteria were detected in 20/36 (56%) and from periodontal bacteria in 17/36 (47%) of samples. bacterial dna of the streptococcus mitis group was found to be  most common. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola were the three most common periodontal pathogens. the highly  intensive staining of cd14 and tlr-2 in ruptured aneurysms was observed. conclusions: this is the first report showing evidence that dental infection could be a part of pathophysiology in intracranial aneurysm disease.

TI  == serum antibody responses to periodontal microbiota in chronic and aggressive periodontitis: a postulate revisited.
AB  == background: the authors revisited the 1999 international workshop postulate of robust serum antibody responses to infecting agents in localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) and weak responses in generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp). antibody responses were further examined in localized and generalized chronic periodontitis (lcp and gcp). methods: the study includes 119 patients (60 males and 59 females, aged 11 to 76 years), 18 with lagp, 37 with gagp, 37 with lcp, and 27 with gcp. multiple subgingival plaque samples/patient (1,057 in total) were analyzed with respect to 11 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations, and serum immunoglobulin (ig)g levels were measured against the same bacteria using checkerboard immunoblotting. further, infection ratios (antibody level over the average bacterial colonization by the homologous  species) were computed for each patient. comparisons of bacterial colonization, serum igg levels, and infection ratios were made across the diagnostic categories using multivariable linear regression models adjusting for age and race/ethnicity. results: there were no statistically significant differences in serum igg levels to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans among the four diagnostic categories. igg levels to several species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus, were highest in patients with gagp and significantly different from lcp and gcp, but not from lagp. comparisons based on infection ratios showed no statistically significant differences for any species between gagp and lagp. conclusion: this study provides evidence against the 1999 workshop's postulate of weak serum antibody responses in patients with gagp and shows that serum igg responses in gagp are comparable to those in lagp, but higher than in gcp or lcp for several species.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and toll-like receptor 2 are associated with hypertensive disorders in placental tissue: a case-control study.
AB  == aim(s): to explore the associations between the presence of periodontal pathogens and the expression of toll-like receptors (tlr-2 and tlr-4) in the placental tissue of patients with hypertensive disorders compared to the placentas of healthy normotensive patients. material and methods: a case-control study was performed. from a cohort composed of 126 pregnant women, 33 normotensive healthy  pregnant women were randomly selected, and 25 cases of patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, were selected. placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of delivery. all of the samples were processed and analysed for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. determination of the expressions of tlr-2 and tlr-4 was performed in samples of total purified protein isolated from  placental tissues and analysed by elisa. the data were assessed using descriptive statistics. the associations among variables were estimated through multiple logistic regression models and the mann-whitney test to evaluate the differences  between the two groups. results: a significant increase was observed in the expression of tlr-2 in the placentas of patients with hypertensive disorders (p = 0.04). additionally, the multiple logistic regression models demonstrated an association between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis in placental tissues and hypertensive disorders (or: 9.39, p = 0.001, ci 95% 2.39-36.88 and or: 7.59, p = 0.019, ci 95% 1.39-41.51, respectively). conclusions: in the present study, pregnant women with periodontal disease presented an association in the placental tissue between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis and hypertensive disorders. additionally, increased expression of tlr-2 was observed. however, further studies are required to determine the specific roles of periodontal pathogens and tlrs in the placental tissue of patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.

TI  == subgingival root brushing in deep human periodontal pockets.
AB  == objective: the short-term clinical and microbiological effects of patient-applied subgingival root brushing were assessed on untreated deep human periodontal pockets. methods: assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total cultivable subgingival counts, and cultivable counts and proportions of six putative periodontal pathogens were carried out at baseline and after 14 days on  two contralateral > or = 6 mm bleeding interproximal posterior sites in each of 11 adults with untreated chronic periodontitis. one of the sites was randomly assigned to daily patient-applied subgingival root brushing for 14 days, and the  other to remain with the patient's pre-existing tooth brushing and flossing regimen. no other periodontal therapy was performed during the 14 test days. results: significant reductions in plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, total subgingival counts, and levels of putative periodontal pathogens were found after 14 days of subgingival root brushing. subgingival root brushing nearly eliminated bleeding on probing at test sites, reduced probing depths by a mean of 1.8 mm, and reduced cultivable subgingival proportions of six evaluated putative  periodontal pathogens from a cumulative total of 14.1% to 0.8%. in comparison, no significant clinical or microbiological changes were detected after 14 days where the patient's pre-existing oral hygiene regimen remained unaltered. conclusions:  subgingival root brushing over 14 days, in properly trained patients, induced favorable clinical and microbiological changes in deep periodontal pockets > or = 6 mm even in the absence of professional subgingival debridement.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in human chronic periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == background: patients with chronic periodontitis (cp) may yield multiple species of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens that vary in their antibiotic drug susceptibility. this study determines the occurrence of in vitro antibiotic resistance among selected subgingival periodontal pathogens in patients with cp.  methods: subgingival biofilm specimens from inflamed deep periodontal pockets were removed before treatment from 400 adults with cp in the united states. the samples were cultured, and selected periodontal pathogens were tested in vitro for susceptibility to amoxicillin at 8 mg/l, clindamycin at 4 mg/l, doxycycline at 4 mg/l, and metronidazole at 16 mg/l, with a post hoc combination of data for  amoxicillin and metronidazole. gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads were subjected to ciprofloxacin disk-diffusion testing. results: overall, 74.2% of the patients with cp revealed subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to at least one of the test antibiotics. one or more test species, most often prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, or aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, were resistant in vitro to doxycycline, amoxicillin, metronidazole, or clindamycin, in 55%, 43.3%, 30.3%, and 26.5% of the patients with cp, respectively. fifteen percent of patients harbored subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant to both amoxicillin and metronidazole, which were mostly either s. constellatus (45 individuals) or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of gram-negative enteric rods/pseudomonads (nine individuals). conclusions: patients with cp in the united states frequently yielded subgingival periodontal pathogens resistant in vitro to therapeutic concentrations of antibiotics commonly used in clinical periodontal practice. the wide variability  found in periodontal pathogen antibiotic-resistance patterns should concern clinicians empirically selecting antibiotic treatment regimens for patients with  cp.

TI  == phototoxic effect of blue light on the planktonic and biofilm state of anaerobic  periodontal pathogens.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this study was to compare the phototoxic effects of blue  light exposure on periodontal pathogens in both planktonic and biofilm cultures.  methods: strains of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis, in planktonic or biofilm states, were exposed to visible light at wavelengths of 400.520 nm. a quartz-tungsten-halogen  lamp at a power density of 500 mw/cm(2) was used for the light source. each sample was exposed to 15, 30, 60, 90, or 120 seconds of each bacterial strain in  the planktonic or biofilm state. confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm) was used to observe the distribution of live/dead bacterial cells in biofilms. after  light exposure, the bacterial killing rates were calculated from colony forming unit (cfu) counts. results: clsm images that were obtained from biofilms showed a mixture of dead and live bacterial cells extending to a depth of 30-45 microm. obvious differences in the live-to-dead bacterial cell ratio were found in p. gingivalis biofilm according to light exposure time. in the planktonic state, almost all bacteria were killed with 60 seconds of light exposure to f. nucleatum (99.1%) and with 15 seconds to p. gingivalis (100%). in the biofilm state, however, only the cfu of p. gingivalis demonstrated a decreasing tendency with increasing light exposure time, and there was a lower efficacy of phototoxicity to p. gingivalis as biofilm than in the planktonic state. conclusions: blue light exposure using a dental halogen curing unit is effective in reducing periodontal  pathogens in the planktonic state. it is recommended that an adjunctive exogenous photosensitizer be used and that pathogens be exposed to visible light for clinical antimicrobial periodontal therapy.

TI  == no evidence of triclosan-resistant bacteria following long-term use of triclosan-containing toothpaste.
AB  == background and objective: there is a paucity of data in relation to the possible  emergence of triclosan (tcs)-resistant bacteria following long-term exposure to tcs toothpaste. therefore, this study investigated whether long-term continuous exposure to tcs in toothpaste selects for tcs-resistant bacteria within the oral  biofilm. material and methods: dental plaque samples were collected from 40 individuals during year 5 of a randomised controlled trial. participants had been randomly assigned to use tcs (3000 mug/ml tcs) (n = 18) or placebo toothpaste (n  = 22). diluted plaque samples were plated on to wilkins-chalgren agar plates containing 5% (v/v) laked sheep red blood cells and tcs (concentrations ranging from 25 to 150 mug/ml) and incubated at 37 degrees c under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for 2-10 d. selected bacterial isolates were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing and tcs minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) determined for each isolate. results: at 3000 mug/ml tcs no growth was observed under microaerophilic or anaerobic conditions in either group. the mics of tcs for all isolates ranged from 125 to 1000 mug/ml in both groups. species common to both groups had similar mics. veillonella parvula and campylobacter gracilis were the most frequent isolates from both groups, with similar mics in both groups. conclusion: the use of tcs-containing toothpaste did not appear to lead to an increase in mic of tcs of oral bacterial isolates.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == the microbiology of the peri-implant sulcus following successful implantation of  oral prosthetic treatments.
AB  == background: oral implants are widely used in partially and fully edentulous patients; however, the integration of an implant can be endangered by factors such as intraoral bacteria or inflammatory reactions. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial flora present in the sulcus around dental implants  and to assess the relationship between gingival health and microbial flora present. materials and methods: twenty patients who had received oral implants with no complications were followed for a period of 9 months. assessment of probing depth, the presence of bleeding on probing and microbial sampling from the peri-implant sulcus were performed at three different time points- 4 weeks after surgery, 1 month and 6 months after loading. the samples were taken by paper points and transferred to the microbiology lab in thioglyocolate cultures.  in order to do a colony count and isolate the aerobic capnophilic and anerobic bacteria the samples were cultured and incubated on laboratory media. the colonies were also identified using various diagnostic tests. alterations in the  presence of various bacterial species over time and gum health were tested using  analysis of variance (anova) with tukey's test post hoc. results: the average pocket depth for each patient ranged from 1.37 +/- 0.39 mm to 2.55 +/- 0.72 mm. the bacteria isolated from the cultured samples included aerobic, facultative anerobic, obligate anerobic and capnophilic bacteria. conclusion: the anerobic conditions created in the peri-implant sulcus might with time enhance the number  of anerobic bacteria present following dental implant loading.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

TI  == comparative evaluation of subgingival plaque microflora in pregnant and non-pregnant women: a clinical and microbiologic study.
AB  == context: gingival changes in pregnancy have been attributed to changes in the subgingival biofilm related to hormonal variations. aims: to evaluate the subgingival plaque microflora in pregnant and nonpregnant women to determine if pregnancy induces any alterations in the subgingival plaque and to associate these changes with changes in periodontal status. settings and design: thirty pregnant and 10 nonpregnant women within the age group of 20-35 years having a probing pocket depth (ppd) of 3-4 mm were included in the study. the pregnant women were equally divided into 3 groups of 10, each belonging to i, ii, and iii  trimester. materials and methods: plaque index, gingival index, ppd, and microbiologic evaluation for specific bacterial counts for prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, parvimonas micra, and fusobacterium nucleatum were carried out for all subjects. statistical analysis: mann-whitney u test. results: increase in gingival inflammation was observed in ii and iii trimester as compared with i trimester and control. plaque scores did not show any significant difference between pregnant and nonpregnant women. specific bacterial examination revealed an increase in proportion of p. intermedia in pregnant women of both ii and iii trimester as compared with i trimester and nonpregnant women. conclusions: a definite increase in proportions  of p. intermedia occurs in subgingival plaque microflora in pregnancy that may be responsible for the exaggerated gingival response.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == peptides: beta-cyclodextrin inclusion compounds as highly effective antimicrobial and anti-epithelial proliferation agents.
AB  == background: the use of antimicrobial peptides (amps) as therapeutic agents for periodontal infections has great advantages, such as broad spectrum of action, low toxicity, and limited bacterial resistance. however, their practical use is limited because of the large amount of peptide required to exercise the microbicidal function. methods: lyetxi, ll37f, and kr12 cationic peptides were prepared with beta-cyclodextrin (betacd) at 1:1 molar ratios. the susceptibility  of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed in anaerobic conditions. cytotoxicity assays were performed using osteoblast and caco-2 epithelial cells, and hemolytic activity was assessed on rabbit erythrocytes at an absorbance of 414 nm. parameters of surface roughness and electrical charge were established by atomic  force microscopy and zeta (zeta) potential, respectively. results: amp/betacds drastically decreased the peptide concentration required for activity against the bacteria tested. moreover, amps associated with betacd were able to modify cell-surface parameters, such as roughness and zeta potential. on the other hand, amp/betacd did not alter the degree of hemolysis induced by the pure amps. the effective concentration at half-maximum values of the peptides and compounds on osteoblasts were greater than the concentrations required to achieve inhibition of bacterial growth in all the species tested. amp/betacds inhibited the proliferation of caco-2 epithelial cells in a more efficient manner than amps alone. conclusion: amp/betacd compounds more effectively inhibit periodontopathogenic bacteria than amps alone, with the additional ability of inhibiting the proliferation of epithelial cells at concentrations that are non-cytotoxic for osteoblasts and erythrocytes.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial effects of two antihalitosis mouth rinses on oral pathogens and human tongue microbiota.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of a mouth rinse containing chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride (mr1) with a stannous fluoride-based mouth rinse (mr2) in vitro. materials and methods: samples of the tongues from 10 subjects with and 10 subjects without halitosis were inoculated on blood agar plates. the agar was perforated, and the cylindrical holes were filled either with mouth rinse mr1 or with mouth rinse mr2. after incubation, inhibition zones of the whole tongue microbiota and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured. in addition, mr1 and mr2 were applied in a short interval killing test (sikt) on four oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, f. nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. total viable cell counts were made after two minutes of incubation with increasing concentrations of mr1 and mr2. results: mr1 showed a significantly higher in vitro antimicrobial activity against the whole tongue microbiota and f. nucleatum than mr2 in both groups of subjects. in the sik test, mr1 showed a significantly greater killing capacity than mr2. the results show that a mouth rinse with low concentrations of chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride appears to be more effective in inhibiting growth of the human tongue microbiota in vitro than a fluoride/stannous fluoride-containing mouth rinse. conclusion: this in vitro observation supports the use of chlorhexidine and cetylpyridinium chloride in the treatment of oral halitosis.

TI  == aetiology, microbiology and therapy of periapical lesions around oral implants: a retrospective analysis.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was: (i) to evaluate whether an endodontic pathology on the extracted tooth or adjacent teeth of an implant site has an influence on the emergence of a periapical lesion, (ii) to retrospectively analyse the outcome of different treatment strategies, (iii) to determine which bacteria were present in periapical lesions. methods: the endodontic status of the tooth at the implant site and the adjacent teeth was explored and linked to the periapical status of the implant. for all the lesions treated since 2000, their survival was assessed. finally, microbial samples (culturing) from the periapical lesions, were analysed. results: if an endodontic treatment or a periapical lesion at the apex of a tooth is present, a periapical lesion around the implant can be detected in 8.2% up to 13.6% (or 7.2). for periapical pathology at the adjacent teeth, the percentage rises to 25% (or 8.0). the best treatment option could not be found. bacteria were found in 9/21 lesions. the most prominent species was p. gingivalis. conclusions: when an endodontic pathology is present on the extracted or neighbouring teeth, it is significantly  more likely that a periapical lesion will develop around a future implant.

TI  == optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tanerella forsythia and  treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen streptococcus mutans. results: eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using blast analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mfold). the most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qpcr-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.  for the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of dna extracts from isolates of closely related species. for these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the applied biosystems 7300, the bio-rad iq5 and the roche light cycler 480). for all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. the overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the light cycler 480. conclusions: in conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of s. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus fusobacterium.this can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial  dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. methods: subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. the quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion  method. results: using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall  showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. conclusion: it was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility profiles of oral pathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a bacterial disease that can be treated with systemic antibiotics. the aim of this study was to establish the antibiotic susceptibility profiles of five periodontal pathogens to six commonly used antibiotics in periodontics. a total of 247 periodontal bacterial isolates were tested for susceptibility to the six antibiotics using the etest method. mic(50) and mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) were calculated. both european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) and clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) breakpoints were used in the study to interpret results. beta-lactamase production was tested when amoxicillin resistance was found. mic(90) values of the anaerobic bacteria were all well below breakpoint values, except for three isolates of prevotella intermedia and one isolate of fusobacterium nucleatum that were resistant to amoxicillin (clsi breakpoints); these isolates were beta-lactamase-positive. two isolates of the capnophilic aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans appeared to be amoxicillin-resistant but failed to show beta-lactamase activity. comparison with a previous study from the netherlands showed minor differences in susceptibility profiles, but the mic(90) values of a. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin, clindamycin, azithromycin and tetracycline were higher. geographical differences in the susceptibility profiles of porphyromonas gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans between european countries  were noted. comparison of european susceptibility profiles with that of a south american country (colombia) revealed a much higher resistance in the latter. owing to these differences in susceptibility profiles, it is of concern to regularly perform surveillance studies on antibiotic resistance.

AB  == aim: to determine the relationship between periodontal pathogen load and anti-human heat shock protein 60 (hhsp60) antibodies in patients with established cardiovascular disease (cvd). materials and methods: participants were cardiovascular patients (n = 74) with a previous hospital admission for myocardial infarction. concurrent periodontal pathogen load of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was determined using quantitative real-time pcr. serum antibodies to these pathogens, groel and hhsp60 were determined using an elisa. results: there was a trend for increasing anti-hhsp60 antibody as the number of bacterial species increased. the strongest positive correlations were found between anti-hhsp60 levels and numbers of t. forsythia (r = 0.43; p < 0.001) and  between anti-hhsp60 and anti-groel levels (r = 0.39; p = 0.001). patients with extensive periodontal pocketing (>/=4 mm) had higher numbers of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (p < 0.05) and a higher subgingival pathogen load (p < 0.05) than patients with minimal pocketing (</=1 site >/= 4 mm). they also had significantly elevated anti-hhsp60 levels (p < 0.05). overall, the highest anti-hhsp60 levels were seen in patients with extensive periodontal pocketing and all four bacterial species. conclusions: in cardiovascular patients, a greater burden of subgingival infection with increased levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia is associated with modestly higher anti-hhsp60 levels.

TI  == antibacterial effects of blackberry extract target periodontopathogens.
AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

AB  == background and objective: healthy subjects who do not have aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity may possess factors in saliva that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against the bacterium. the aim of this study was to identify and purify proteins from saliva of healthy subjects that might demonstrate antibacterial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans and test the same against the bacteria. material and methods: saliva from 10 healthy  volunteers was tested individually for its anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans activity. among the 10 subjects, eight demonstrated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans activity. saliva was collected from one healthy volunteer who demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. after clarifying the saliva, it was subjected to an affinity chromatography column with a. actinomycetemcomitans. the proteins bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans were eluted from the column and identified using mass spectrometry (maldi-tof/tof ms). among  other proteins that bound to a. actinomycetemcomitans, which included lactoferrin, immunoglobulin a and kallikrein, cystatin sa was observed in significantly higher concentrations, and this was purified from the eluate. the purified cystatin sa was tested at different concentrations for its ability to kill a. actinomycetemcomitans in a 2 h cell killing assay. the bacteria were also treated with a proteinase inhibitor, leupeptin, to clarify whether the antimicrobial effect of cystatin sa was related to its protease inhibitory function. cystatin sa was also tested for its ability to prevent binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans to buccal epithelial cells (becs) in an a. actinomycetemcomitans-bec binding assay. results: cystatin sa (0.1 mg/ml) demonstrated a statistically significant antimicrobial activity against a. actinomycetemcomitans. the effect of cystatin sa decreased with lower concentrations, with 0.01 mg/ml showing no effect. the addition of monoclonal cystatin sa antibodies to the purified sample completely negated the antimicrobial effect. treatment of a. actinomycetemcomitans with leupeptin resulted in no antimicrobial effect, suggesting that the antimicrobial activity of cystatin sa is independent of its protease inhibitory function. a. actinomycetemcomitans pretreated with cystatin sa showed reduced binding to becs, suggesting a potential role for cystatin sa in decreasing the colonization of a.  actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: the present study shows that cystatin sa demonstrates antimicrobial activity against the periodontopathogen a. actinomycetemcomitans, and future studies determining the mechanism of action are necessary. the study also shows the ability of cystatin sa to reduce significantly the binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans to becs.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. we measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at  different stages of korean chronic periodontal diseases. we divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (g), moderate periodontitis (p1),  severe periodontitis (p2), and normal individuals (n) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. we used real-time pcr with taqman probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of  periodontitis. bacterial levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. these results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages  of periodontitis.

TI  == butyric acid induces apoptosis in both human monocytes and lymphocytes equivalently.
AB  == short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are metabolites from anaerobic periodontopathic bacteria that induce apoptosis in immune cells such as lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages. however, it remains unclear if scfas from pathogens induce apoptosis in monocytes/macrophages similarly with lymphocytes. this study investigated whether scfas-induced apoptosis is equal among the immunoregulatory cells. cell apoptosis of the employed human cells was evaluated after treatment with culture  supernatants from various periodontopathic bacteria or sodium butyrate. apoptosis and viability were determined by detection of dna fragmentation and using an mts  assay kit, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum culture filtrates strongly induced apoptosis whereas prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia culture filtrates failed to induce apoptosis in the thp-1 and u937 human monocyte and macrophage cell lines. healthy gingival fibroblasts and oral epithelial cells were resistant to all the culture filtrates. gas-liquid chromatography detected butyric acid in p. gingivalis (21.0-34.0 mm) and f. nucleatum (36.0 mm) in culture filtrates, whereas, only trace levels were seen in p. nigrescens and p. intermedia. these results suggest that butyric acid produced by periodontopathic bacteria severely damages immunoregulatory cells in a consistent manner and, likewise, could be involved in mediating periodontal chronic inflammation.

TI  == specificity of antimicrobial peptide ll-37 to neutralize periodontopathogenic lipopolysaccharide activity in human oral fibroblasts.
AB  == background: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 is known to have a potent lipopolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity in various cell types. because of  observed heterogeneity within periodontopathogenic lps, the authors hypothesized  that ll-37 had specificity to neutralize such lps activity. the present study, therefore, aims to investigate the lps-neutralizing activity of ll-37 to various  periodontopathogenic lps in interleukin-8 (il-8) production after challenging them in human oral fibroblasts. methods: human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (pdlf) and gingival fibroblasts (gf) were cultured from biopsies of periodontal ligament and gingival tissues. after cell confluence in 24-well plates, lps (10 mug/ml) from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were added with or without ll-37 (10 mug/ml). after 18 hours, the supernatant was collected and analyzed in  il-8 production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all periodontopathogenic lps statistically significantly induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf (p <0.01). after neutralization with ll-37, both pdlf and gf showed a statistically significant reduction in il-8 production compared with lps-treated groups without ll-37 (p <0.01), and the percentage of reduction in il-8 production in pdlf appeared to be higher than in gf. in addition, the percentage of reduction in il-8 production varied considerably according to each  periodontopathogenic lps. conclusions: the antimicrobial peptide ll-37 had an ability to suppress periodontopathogenic lps-induced il-8 production in both pdlf and gf. its lps-neutralizing activity revealed specificity to periodontopathogenic lps and seemed to be dependent on the heterogeneity within lps between different genera.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the effects of different photoablative laser irradiation protocols on the gingiva of periodontopathic patients.
AB  == objective: we aimed at quantifying the presence of periodontopathogens in gingival biopsies from periodontitis patients treated with different photoablative lasers (diode gaas, er:yag, nd:yag, and co(2) lasers) and histologically analyzing their effects on the gingiva. background data: substantial evidence indicates that intracellular location of periodontal bacteria in the gingival epithelium may contribute to chronic periodontitis. methods: sixteen adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were subjected to conventional scaling/root planing and topical chlorhexidine, and immediately laser-irradiated on the inner and outer free gingiva. small gingival biopsies were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction and cytofluorescence to identify periodontopathogens; tissue damage and endothelial icam-1 expression were assessed by histological and immunofluorescence analyses. results: high dna  levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and ekenella corrodens, were detected in all samples. nd:yag and diode lasers were capable of  eradicating periodontopathogenic bacteria endowed within gingival epithelial cells outside periodontal pockets, without causing connective tissue damage and microvessel rupture. they also reduced icam-1 immunolabelling by the vascular endothelium. conversely, er:yag lasers induced marked microvessel rupture and bleeding and failed to completely and selectively ablate the infected gingival epithelium, whereas co(2) laser caused heat-induced coagulation of the lamina propria. conclusions: this study indicates that periodontopathogens can persist within cells outside the pocket epithelium, despite conventional periodontal treatment. nd:yag and diode lasers are able to eradicate intra- and extracellular bacteria from these sites, suggesting that they can be considered suitable devices to improve the clinical outcome of periodontal disease.

TI  == regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with or without systemic doxycycline. a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == aim: comparison of regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with and without administration of postsurgical systemic doxycycline (doxy). methods: in each of 61 patients one infrabony defect was treated with enamel matrix derivative (emd), emd plus filler or membrane at two centres. by random assignment patients received either 200 mg doxy per day or placebo (plac) for 7 days after surgery. prior to and 6 months after surgery probing pocket depths (ppd) and vertical attachment level (pal-v) were obtained. results: fifty-four patients (doxy: 27; plac: 27) were re-examined after 6 months and had been treated exclusively with emd. seven to 8 days after surgery 81% of defects in both groups showed complete  flap closure. in both groups significant (p < 0.001) ppd reduction (doxy: 3.87 +/- 1.44 mm; plac: 3.67 +/- 1.30 mm) and pal-v gain (doxy: 3.11 +/- 1.50 mm; plac: 3.32 +/- 1.83 mm) were observed. however, the differences failed to be statistically significant (ppd: 0.20; p = 0.588; pal-v: 0.21; p = 0.657). conclusions: two hundred milligram systemic doxy administered for 7 days after therapy of infrabony defects with emd failed to result in better ppd reduction and pal-v gain compared with plac which may be due to low power (50%) and, thus,  random chance.

TI  == [effect of periodontal surgery on the subgingival periodontal microbiota in artificial class iii furcation defects: an experimental study in monkeys].
AB  == objective: this study was to longitudinally evaluate the change of prevalence of  five periodontal putative pathogens in the subgingival plaque of artificial class iii furcation defects at the three time-points, including before the establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. methods: eighteen chronic infected class iii fi defects were created at  the mandibular first molars, second molars and second premolars of three adult male macaca fascicularis. the samples of subgingival plaque were obtained from the subgingival area of furcation defects in buccal and lingual sites before the  establishment of furcation defects, before and 6 months after periodontal surgery. 36 samples were obtained at one time-points. five periodontal putative pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema dinticola (td), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), were detected with 16srrna based pcr. results: 1. the prevalence of pg, tf, td and fn was gradually increased, from 58.3% to 69.4%  to 88.9%, 47,2% to 69.4% to 83.3%, 13.9% to 36.1% to 61.1% (p<0.01), and 69.4% to 91.7% to 91.7% (p<0.05), respectively during the experimental period. the prevalence of fn was higher than pg, tf and td. the prevalence of aa was the lowest and no obvious difference among the three samplings(from 25.9% to 13.9% to 33.3%)was detected. 2. the prevalence of more than 3 species simultaneously detected was increased from 38.9% to 61.1% to 83.3% (p <0.01). the red complex (pg + tf + td) was detected from 8.3% to 27.8% to 44.4% (p<0.01) at the different time point. 3. the combined detection frequency of red complex in the inflammatory sites (87.5%), which were histologically defined as inflammatory cells infiltrated in furcation area 6 months post-surgery, and the same sites pre-surgery (62.5%) was more than that in pre-creation of furcation defects (p<0.01). but there were no significant differences compared to that in non inflammatory area (60.0%, 40.0%), respectively. conclusion: the prevalence of periodontal pathogenic bacteria correlated with the severity of local inflammation. the increase of coexistent rate of red complex at the second and third sampling times suggests that the red complex play important role in the pathogenesis of periodontitis. fn may be a resident bacteria in the subgingival plaque, play a bridge role on the biofilm formation and maturation. aa may not be a major causative bacteria in the clinical periodontitis.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == azithromycin as an adjunctive treatment of generalized severe chronic periodontitis: clinical, microbiologic, and biochemical parameters.
AB  == background: this study examines the efficacy of azithromycin in combination with  non-surgical periodontal therapy on clinical and microbiologic parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) matrix metalloproteinases-8 (mmp-8) levels over 6 months in patients with severe generalized chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: twenty-eight of 36 patients with severe generalized cp were included in this randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. they were randomly assigned to azithromycin or placebo groups (500 mg, once daily for 3 days). probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level, dichotomous presence or absence of supragingival plaque accumulation, and bleeding on probing were recorded. gcf samples were obtained from one single-rooted tooth with pd >/= 6 mm, whereas microbiologic samples were collected from two single-rooted teeth with pd >/= 6 mm. microbiologic parameters were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and total bacteria. gcf mmp-8 levels were determined by immunofluorescence assay. results: azithromycin and placebo groups demonstrated similar but significant improvements in all clinical parameters (p <0.05). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia, and total bacteria significantly decreased over the 6-month period in both groups, whereas  f. nucleatum was significantly reduced in all visits in the azithromycin group, with the levels also being lower compared with those of the placebo group (p <0.05). the azithromycin and placebo groups exhibited significant reduction in gcf mmp-8 levels at the post-treatment visit and at 2 weeks (p <0.05). conclusion: on the basis of the present findings, it can be concluded that adjunctive azithromycin provides no additional benefit over non-surgical periodontal treatment on parameters investigated in patients with severe generalized cp.

TI  == necrotizing periodontal diseases in hiv-infected brazilian patients: a clinical and microbiologic descriptive study.
AB  == objective: nowadays, necrotizing periodontal diseases have a low prevalence; however, a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of these diseases is necessary for determining more adequate preventive and therapeutic strategies. method and materials: from a pool of 1,232 hiv-infected patients, 15 presented with necrotizing periodontal diseases, which were evaluated by full-mouth periodontal clinical measurements. subgingival biofilm samples were collected from necrotizing lesions of six of these individuals. the presence and levels of  47 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: all 15 patients (10 had severe immunodeficiency) had been infected sexually. thirteen patients were taking antiretroviral medication (66.7% undergoing highly active antiretroviral therapy). regarding necrotizing periodontal diseases, necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (60%) was more prevalent  than necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (40%). the frequency of supragingival biofilm and bleeding on probing ranged from 11.5% to 59.2% and 3.0% to 54.0%, respectively, whereas the mean probing depth and clinical attachment level were between 1.48 and 2.61 mm and 1.30 and 2.62 mm, respectively. species detected in  high prevalence and/or counts in necrotizing lesions included treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, dialister pneumosintes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus intermedius, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and campylobacter rectus. in contrast, parvimonas micra, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium nodatum, and helicobacter pylori were observed in the lowest mean prevalence and/or counts. conclusion: necrotizing periodontal disease lesions in hiv-infected patients present a microbiota with high prevalence and/or counts of classical periodontal pathogens, in particular t denticola, as well as species not commonly considered as periodontal pathogens, such as e faecalis and d pneumosintes. in addition, these individuals with necrotizing periodontal disease frequently display severe immunodeficiency and aids-defining diseases such as tuberculosis.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == release of metronidazole from electrospun poly(l-lactide-co-d/l-lactide) fibers for local periodontitis treatment.
AB  == objectives: we aimed to achieve detailed biomaterials characterization of a drug  delivery system for local periodontitis treatment based on electrospun metronidazole-loaded resorbable polylactide (pla) fibers. methods: pla fibers loaded with 0.1-40% (w/w) mna were electrospun and were characterized by sem and  dsc. hplc techniques were used to analyze the release profiles of metronidazole (mna) from these fibers. the antibacterial efficacy was determined by measuring inhibition zones of drug-containing aliquots from the same electrospun fiber mats in an agar diffusion test. three pathogenic periodontal bacterial strains: fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas  gingivalis were studied. cytotoxicity testing was performed with human gingival fibroblasts by: (i) counting viable cells via live/dead staining methods and (ii) by exposing cells directly onto the surface of mna-loaded fibers. results: mna concentration influenced fiber diameters and thus w/w surface areas: diameter being minimal and area maximal at 20% mna. hplc showed that these 20% mna fibers  had the fastest initial mna release. from the third day, mna release was slower and nearly linear with time. all fiber mats released 32-48% of their total drug content within the first 7 days. aliquots of media taken from the fiber mats inhibited the growth of all three bacterial strains. mna released up to the 28th  day from fiber mats containing 40% mna significantly decreased the viability of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis and up to the 2nd day also for the resistant a. actinomycetemcomitans. all of the investigated fibers and aliquots showed excellent cytocompatibility. significance: this study shows that mna-loaded electrospun fiber mats represent an interesting class of resorbable drug delivery systems. sustained drug release properties and cytocompatibility suggest their potential clinical applicability for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == investigation and quantification of key periodontal pathogens in patients with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background and objective: diabetes is a recognized risk factor for periodontitis. there are conflicting data regarding whether healthy diabetic patients or diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis have an altered subgingival microbiota compared with nondiabetic individuals. the aim of the present study was to detect quantitative differences in selected periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaque of diabetic patients using taqman quantitative pcr. material and methods: type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with (n=9) or without chronic periodontal disease (n=15) were recruited and matched to nondiabetic control subjects (n=12 periodontally healthy, n=12 chronic periodontitis). subgingival plaque samples were collected from deep (>4 mm probing depth) and shallow sites (</=3 mm probing depth) using paper points, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis were  quantified. results: forty-eight subjects (69 samples) were recruited. marked differences were seen in the levels of all three bacterial species, relative to the total bacterial population, according to periodontal health status. using real-time quantitative pcr, bacterial counts for p. gingivalis were significantly higher in deep pockets of diabetic and nondiabetic subjects compared with periodontally healthy subjects (p<0.05) but did not differ significantly between  diabetics and nondiabetics. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in all groups in low quantities, and counts did not differ significantly between groups (p>0.05). f. nucleatum was abundant in all groups, with no clear significant differences between groups. p. gingivalis was found in higher quantities in periodontitis than in periodontally healthy subjects (p<0.05). statistically significant positive correlations were identified between pocket depth and counts for all three species tested (p<0.05). conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were present in significantly different quantities and proportions in subgingival plaque, according to periodontal disease status. no significant differences were identified between the subgingival microbiota of  type 2 diabetes mellitus patients compared with nondiabetic subjects.

AB  == background: bioactive tio(2) coatings have been found to enhance fibroblast adhesion and gingival attachment on the titanium surfaces, but no information is  available whether the coatings also promote the adhesion of periodontal pathogens. aim: the purpose of this study was to investigate protein adsorption and the adhesion of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) and fusobacterium  nucleatum (fn) on bioactive tio2 surfaces. materials and methods: commercially pure titanium discs (diameter 11.0 mm, grade 2) were coated with sol-gel derived  bioactive tio2 coatings (metalive, vivoxid, turku, finland) and preincubated in 1.5 ml pbs/diluted serum/diluted saliva at room temperature to mimic the clinical situation after implantation and to allow serum/saliva proteins to adhere on the  substrates. uncoated titanium discs were used as controls. results: sds-page revealed similar protein profiles on bioactive and control titanium substrates. no differences were noticed in aa or fn adhesion between bioactive and control titanium. however, serum and saliva conditioning diminished aa adhesion on both surfaces (p<0.001). conclusion: it can be concluded that bioactive tio2 coating does not promote adhesion of aa and fn.

TI  == a five-species transcriptome array for oral mixed-biofilm studies.
AB  == background: oral polymicrobial interactions and biofilm formation are associated  with initiation and progression of caries, gingivitis, and periodontitis. transcriptome studies of such interactions, allowing a first mechanistic insight, are hampered by current single-species array designs. methodology/principal findings: in this study we used 385 k nimblegene technology for design and evaluation of an array covering the full genomes of 5 important physiological-, cariogenic-, and periodontitis-associated microorganisms (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis). array hybridization was done with cdna from cultures grown for 24 h anaerobically. single species experiments identified cross-species hybridizing array probes. these probes could be neglected in a mixed-species experimental setting without the need to exclude  the whole genes from the analysis. between 69% and almost 99% of the genomes were actively transcribed under the mono-species planktonic, monolayer, and biofilm conditions. the influence of streptococcus mitis (not represented on the array) on s. mutans gene transcription was determined as a test for a dual-species mixed biofilm setup. phenotypically, under the influence of s. mitis an increase in s.  mutans biofilm mass and a decrease in media ph-value were noticed, thereby confirming previously published data. employing a stringent cut-off (2-fold, p<0.05), 19 s. mutans transcripts were identified with increased abundance, and 11 with decreased abundance compared to a s. mutans mono-species biofilm. several of these genes have previously been found differentially regulated under general  and acid stress, thereby confirming the value of this array. conclusions/significance: this new array allows transcriptome studies on multi-species oral biofilm interactions. it may become an important asset in future oral biofilm and inhibitor/therapy studies.

TI  == effect of a self-etching adhesive containing an antibacterial monomer on clinical periodontal parameters and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients.
AB  == introduction: the aims of this study were to evaluate the effect of a self-etching adhesive system containing an antibacterial monomer on periodontal health and subgingival microbiologic composition in orthodontic patients and to compare it with a conventional adhesive system. methods: a split-mouth design was chosen, and 15 patients were included in the study. brackets in contralateral quadrants were bonded with either a conventional adhesive system (control) or a self-etching adhesive system that contained an antibacterial monomer. clinical periodontal parameters including plaque index, gingival index, probing depths, and bleeding on probing were determined. subgingival plaque samples were collected before bracket placement (t0) and at the 6-month follow-up (t1). the real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was used to determine the subgingival counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and campylobacter rectus. for clinical periodontal parameters, analysis of covariance (ancova) and, for bacterial counts, wilcoxon tests were used for statistical comparisons at the p <0.05 level. results: clinical periodontal parameters were not changed, and they were not different between the  groups from t0 to t1. t forsythensis and f nucleatum increased during the treatment period in both groups (p <0.05). the majority of the bacteria were t nucleatum at t0 and t1 in both groups. changes in bacterial load from t0 to t1 were not different between groups except for t forsythensis and f nucleatum (p <0.05). conclusions: the use of an antibacterial monomer did not have an additional positive effect on clinical periodontal parameters. when used in bonding orthodontic brackets, the antibacterial monomer failed to reduce periodontopathogenic bacteria when compared with the conventional adhesive system during a 6-month treatment period.

AB  == maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. it is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. this study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia were not observed  in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. interestingly, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98e+02 and 1.75e+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32e+03 cells ml(-1). although f. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

TI  == comparative evaluation of two structurally related flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin  and liquiritigenin, for their oral infection therapeutic potential.
AB  == isoliquiritigenin (1) and liquiritigenin (2) are structurally related flavonoids  found in a variety of plants. the purpose of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of biological properties of these compounds in regard to their therapeutic potential for oral infections. compound 1 demonstrated significant antibacterial activity against three major periodontopathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. in  contrast, 2 exerted less pronounced effects on the above bacterial species. neither compound was effective against cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans  and streptococcus sobrinus). furthermore, 1 exhibited a stronger inhibitory activity than 2 toward p. gingivalis collagenase and human matrix metalloproteinase 9. finally, the capacity of 1 to attenuate the inflammatory response of macrophages induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (lps) was much higher when compared to 2. the activation of transcriptional factors nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) associated with the lps-induced inflammatory response in macrophages was inhibited strongly by 1, but less affected by 2.

TI  == efficacy of chlorhexidine digluconate-containing formulations and other mouthrinses against periodontopathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == objective: to determine in vitro the action of chlorhexidine digluconate and different commercially available mouthrinses on oral microorganisms. method and materials: minimal inhibitory concentrations and possible induction of resistance by chlorhexidine digluconate, an essential oil-containing mouthwash and an amine  fluoride/stannous fluoride solution, were determined against microorganisms normally found in the oral cavity (10 streptococci, 2 enterobacteria, 1 candida albicans, 8 porphyromonas gingivalis, 6 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 1 fusobacterium nucleatum). further, the effect of a 1-minute exposure on cell and bacterial viability was studied. results: the susceptibility of the oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine digluconate ranged from 0.01% to 0.50%. passages  on agar plates containing subinhibitory concentrations of chlorhexidine digluconate resulted in a transitory moderate increase in the tolerance to chlorhexidine digluconate in five of the 24 isolates. after 1 minute of exposure, chlorhexidine digluconate solutions as well as the essential oil and the amine/stannous fluoride-containing solutions showed a high activity against the tested microorganisms. commercially available chlorhexidine digluconate formulations (ie, those with antidiscoloration systems) were partly less efficient than the corresponding manually prepared chlorhexidine digluconate preparation. the determination of mtt resulted in a strong cytotoxicity of all tested preparations to gingival fibroblasts. conclusion: the results indicate that most of the chlorhexidine digluconate formulations as well as essential oil  and the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride solutions are active against oral microbes. long-term use of these agents would not result in emergent antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == simultaneous detection of periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque and placenta of women with hypertension in pregnancy.
AB  == background: there are many studies documenting increased prevalence of periodontal infection in women with preeclampsia. but, very few studies have attempted to establish causal relationship between the two. objective: to find out causal circumstantial evidence by isolating specific periodontal pathogens in oral and placental samples. materials and methods: antenatal periodontal screening and subgingival plaque collection was carried out in ten women with hypertension in pregnancy and ten normotensive controls on their hospital admission at term for cesarean delivery. placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of elective cesarean delivery. subgingival plaque and placental biopsy were studied for porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using quantitative polymerase chain reaction technique. periodontist and laboratory personnel were unaware of case or control status. periodontal status was not informed to the obstetrician recruiting the cases and laboratory. microbiology report was not revealed till end of the study. results: periodontal pathogens were found to be high in the group with hypertension than the controls. p gingivalis was found in all the samples from subgingival plaque and placenta, irrespective of the periodontal disease status. conclusion: in cases with hypertension, periodontal pathogens are present in higher proportion in subgingival plaque and placenta.

TI  == tongue piercing: the effect of material on microbiological findings.
AB  == purpose: biofilms on oral piercings may serve as a bacterial reservoir and lead to systemic bacteremia or local transmission of pathogenic microbiota. the use of piercing materials which are less susceptible to biofilm accumulation could contribute to prevention of problems. the present study investigated whether there are microbiological differences in bacterial samples collected from tongue  piercings made of different materials. methods: a total of 85 subjects with tongue piercings participated in this study. after a baseline dental examination, sterile piercings of four different materials were randomly allocated to the study subjects. after 2 weeks, microbiologic samples were collected and processed by checkerboard deoxyribonucleic acid- deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization methods. results: about 28.8% of subjects reported 61 lingual recessions (1.91 +/- .96 mm), whereas 5% reported tooth chipping on one tooth each. with the exception of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (y4), fusobacterium nucleatum  species, and parvimonas micra, bacteria associated with periodontitis were not commonly found in the samples from studs or piercing channels. of the 80 bacterial species, 67 were found at significantly higher levels (p < .001) in samples from stainless steel than from polytetrafluoroethylene or polypropylene piercings. conclusion: the low bacterial counts from piercing channels suggest that having a tongue pierced would not contribute to an increased risk for oral infection. the present study demonstrated that studs made of steel might promote  the development of a biofilm, whereas those made of polytetrafluoroethylene or polypropylene may be rather inert to bacterial colonization. the finding of staphylococci on steel and titanium studs may suggest an elevated risk for complication if the piercing channel is infected.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == efficacy of taurolidine against periodontopathic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of taurolidine was tested against periodontopathic species in comparison to chlorhexidine digluconate in the presence or absence of  serum. minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), microbiocidal concentrations (mbc), as well as killing were determined against 32 different microbial strains  including 3 porphyromonas gingivalis, 3 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and 15 potentially superinfecting species with and without 25% v/v human serum. the mic(50) of taurolidine against the tested microbial strains was 0.025% and the mic(90) 0.05%. the respective values for the mbcs were 0.05% and 0.1%. addition of 25% serum (heat-inactivated) did not change the mic and mbc values of taurolidine. in contrast, mics and mbcs of chlorhexidine (chx) increased by two steps after addition of serum. taurolidine killed microorganisms in a concentration and time-dependent manner, the killing rate of 1.6% taurolidine was 99.08% +/- 2.27% in mean after 2 h. again, killing activity of taurolidine was not affected if serum was added, whereas addition of inactivated serum clearly reduced the killing rate of all selected bacterial strains by chx. therefore, taurolidine possesses antimicrobial properties which are not reduced in the presence of serum as a main component in gingival crevicular fluid and wound fluid. taurolidine may have potential as an antimicrobial agent in non-surgical and surgical periodontal treatment.

AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of chlorhexidine mouthrinse (chx) in addition to daily plaque control on subgingival microbiota in patients with untreated gingivitis. fifty gingivitis patients were randomized to  chx or placebo groups. chx group rinsed with 0.2% chx, while placebo group rinsed with placebo mouthrinse for 4 weeks. subgingival plaque samples were collected and plaque index (pi), papilla bleeding index (pbi), calculus index, and probing  pocket depth (ppd) were recorded at baseline and at 4 weeks. the amounts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and total bacteria were detected by quantitative real-time pcr method. in the chx group the total bacteria count was significantly reduced in posterior teeth at 4 weeks (p < 0.05), while no significant decrease was observed in the placebo group (p > 0.05). chx mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily plaque control could be useful in the management of plaque-associated gingivitis and in reducing the subgingival total bacteria count especially in posterior teeth.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == antibacterial compounds from siraitia grosvenorii leaves.
AB  == luo han guo (lhg) fruits (siraitia grosvenorii swingle) have been used as traditional medicine in china for centuries to treat sore throats and coughs. however, lhg leaves are seldom used and minimal scientific information is available on them. in our recent study on the leaves of s. grosvenorii, the bioactive compounds beta-amyrin (2), aloe emodin (5), aloe-emodin acetate (6), 5alpha,8alpha-epidioxy-24(r)-methylcholesta-6,22-dien-3beta-ol (7) and p-hydroxyl benzyl acid (8), accompanied by n-hexadecaoic acid (1), 12-methyltetradecanoic acid (3), beta-sitosterol (4) and daucosterol (9) were first obtained. their structures have been identified on the basis of spectroscopic studies. the activities of these compounds were evaluated in vitro against the growth of oral  bacterial species streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and the yeast candida albicans, and their minimum inhibition concentrations were determined. furthermore, the activity against s. mutans is likely to be due to the inhibition of glucosyltransferase. the experimental data provide important information on bioactive phytochemicals in the leaf of s. grosvenorii, which shows that the leaf can be a new resource as an antibacterial agent.

TI  == interaction of oral bacteria with gingival epithelial cell multilayers.
AB  == primary gingival epithelial cells were cultured in multilayers as a model for the study of interactions with oral bacteria associated with health and periodontal disease. multilayers maintained at an air-liquid interface in low-calcium medium  displayed differentiation and cytokeratin properties characteristic of junctional epithelium. multilayers were infected with fluorescently labeled porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum or streptococcus gordonii, and bacterial association was determined by confocal microscopy and quantitative image analysis. porphyromonas gingivalis invaded intracellularly and spread from cell to cell; a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum remained extracellular and showed intercellular movement through the multilayer; whereas s. gordonii remained extracellular and predominantly associated with the superficial cell layer. none of the bacterial species disrupted barrier function as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance.  p. gingivalis did not elicit secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. however, a.  actinomycetemcomitans and s. gordonii induced interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha), il-6 and il-8 secretion; and f. nucleatum stimulated production of il-1beta and tnf-alpha. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii, but not p. gingivalis, increased levels of apoptosis after 24 h infection. the results indicate that the organisms with pathogenic potential were able to traverse the epithelium, whereas the commensal bacteria did not. in addition, distinct host responses characterized the interaction between the junctional epithelium and oral bacteria.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: in recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. the available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. the main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery  atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. methods: atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial dna was extracted. to obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16s ribosomal-rna gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a nested pcr with specific primers for the target bacteria  was performed next. statistical tests included the chi(2) test. results: forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. all of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. the bacterial species most commonly found was porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%;  28 of 42), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42),  eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). the simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, the presence of dna from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

AB  == background: a limited number of studies suggest a prevalence of periodontal pathogens in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra); however, results are inconsistent. the aim of this study is to investigate clinical periodontal and microbiologic parameters in patients with ra. methods: sixty-six patients with ra, aged 49.5 +/- 8.4 years, participated in the study. the periodontal classification was assessed with the periodontal screening index (psr/psi) allocated to the following parameters: 1) healthy; 2) gingivitis (psr/psi score 0 to 2, maximum one sextant score; 3) moderate periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 3, maximum one sextant score; or, 4) severe periodontitis (>1 sextant psr/psi score 4). pool samples were taken for microbiologic (polymerase chain reaction) analysis for the presence of 11 periodontal pathogens. statistical analysis was by non-parametric analysis of covariance. results: no patients were  periodontally healthy: 24 patients were classified as having gingivitis; 18 patients had moderate periodontitis; 23 patients had severe periodontitis; and one patient was toothless. for most patients, fusobacterium nucleatum (98%), eikenella corrodens (91%), and parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros; 88%) were above the detection threshold. strong periodontal pathogens were less frequently detected: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 16%); porphyromonas gingivalis (58%); and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis, 78%). statistical analysis showed no significant influence of rheumatic factor (p = 0.33) on periodontal classification and on microbiologic parameters (p >0.05). only smoking showed a significant influence (p = 0.0004) on the periodontal classification and in the case of e. corrodens (p = 0.02). conclusions: most patients with ra in this study showed moderate-to-severe periodontitis and the presence of periodontal pathogens. no association was found between rheumatic factor on periodontal classification and microbiologic parameters.

TI  == short- and medium-chain fatty acids exhibit antimicrobial activity for oral microorganisms.
AB  == objectives: this study assessed the antibacterial activity of short-, medium-, and long-chain fatty acids against various oral microorganisms. methods: the short-chain fatty acids [formic acid (c1), acetic acid (c2), propionic acid (c3), butyric acid (c4), isobutyric acid (c4), isovaleric acid (c5), hexanoic acid (c6)], medium-chain fatty acids [octanoic acid (c8), capric acid (c10), lauric acid (12)], and long-chain fatty acids [myristic acid (c14), palmitic acid (c16)], were investigated for antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguis, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. results: the data demonstrated that the fatty acids exhibited patterns of inhibition against oral bacteria with some specificity that appeared  related more to the bacterial species that the general structural characteristics of the microorganism. as a group the fatty acids were much less effective against c. albicans than the oral bacteria, with effectiveness limited to hexanoic, octanoic, and lauric acids. formic acid, capric, and lauric acids were broadly inhibitory for the bacteria. interestingly, fatty acids that are produced at metabolic end-products by a number of these bacteria, were specifically inactive  against the producing species, whilst substantially inhibiting the growth of other oral microorganisms. conclusions: the results indicate that the antimicrobial activity of short-chain fatty acids (scfas), medium-chain fatty acids (mcfas), long-chain fatty acids (lcfas) could influence the microbial ecology in the oral cavity via at least 2 potential pathways. first, the agents delivered exogenously as therapeutic adjuncts could be packaged to enhance a microbial-regulatory environment in the subgingival sulcus. second, it would be the intrinsic nature of these fatty acid inhibitors in contributing to the characteristics of the microbial biofilms, their evolution, and emergence of species within the biofilms. further studies on these functions are required to better understand the nature of these potential microbial interactions in the biofilms.

TI  == effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic species--an in vitro study.
AB  == the in vitro study was aimed to determine the effect of ozone on periodontopathogenic microorganisms. ozone was generated for 6 s-2 x 24 s (corresponding to 0.56 mg-2 x 2.24 mg of ozone) against 23 mainly anaerobic periodontopathogenic species. agar diffusion test was used as a screening method. then, the killing activity was tested in a serum-free environment and with 25% v/v inactivated serum. further, the effect of ozone on bactericidal activity of native serum was analyzed against fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. agar diffusion test showed a high efficacy of ozone against microorganisms, especially against porphyromonas gingivalis. this result was confirmed by the killing tests; most of the strains in a concentration of 10(5) were completely eliminated after twofold 18-s application of ozone. only four of the six potentially "superinfecting" species (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, candida albicans) survived in part. addition of heat-inactivated serum reduced the killing rate of ozone by 78% after 6-s and by 47% after twofold 18-s exposures; no strain was completely eradicated after any application of ozone. the bactericidal effect of native serum was enhanced after application of ozone; no effect was visible on the included a. actinomycetemcomitans strain which was found to be completely resistant to the bactericidal action of serum. in conclusion, (a) ozone has a strong antibacterial activity against putative periodontopathogenic microorganisms, and (b) the bactericidal effect is reduced in the presence of serum. ozone may have potential as an adjunctive application to mechanical treatment in periodontitis patients.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of dentifrices on human oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: in vitro testing of antimicrobial agents is an important tool in the testing hierarchy, and may provide interesting insights into their potential clinical efficacy. agents with demonstrable in vitro antimicrobial activity may be effective against the same microorganisms in vivo, whereas agents without demonstrable in vitro antimicrobial activity are unlikely to exhibit in vivo antimicrobial activity. in addition, these methods may also be useful in screening antimicrobial agents in product formulations because such agents with both in vitro and in vivo activity may have reduced antimicrobial effects when formulated into a dentifrice. accordingly, this study examined the in vitro and ex vivo antimicrobial activity of three commercial dentifrices: one formulated with 0.243% sodium fluoride (crest cavity protection toothpaste-regular); one with 0.454% stannous fluoride, sodium hexametaphosphate, and zinc lactate (crest  pro-health), and one with 0.3% triclosan, 2.0% pvm/ma copolymer, and 0.243% sodium fluoride (colgate total). methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each dentifrice was determined for resident oral bacterial species, including bacteria that are associated with dental caries; periodontitis, and oral halitosis. evaluations were performed on individual laboratory strains, and  on oral bacteria from supragingival plaque samples obtained from 10 adults and from oral rinse samples obtained from 18 adults. results: the lowest mics against the oral strains and human samples, i.e., greatest antimicrobial activity, were seen for the triclosan/ copolymer dentifrice. there was, in general, a four-fold  difference in mics between the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice and the stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrice. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited periodontal pathogens, such as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum. in ex vivo tests measuring antimicrobial effects, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice substantially inhibited bacterial growth after 30-, 60-, and 120-second exposures compared to the sodium fluoride or stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrices. similarly, in ex vivo tests measuring antimicrobial effects on supragingival plaque biofilms, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice substantially inhibited bacterial growth compared  to the other test dentifrices. conclusion: different in vitro and ex vivo analyses show that the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice has significant antimicrobial activity on oral bacteria, including species causing dental caries, periodontitis, and oral halitosis, and it provides superior efficacy compared to  the stannous fluoride/sodium hexametaphosphate/zinc lactate dentifrice.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == salivary infectious agents and periodontal disease status.
AB  == background and objectives: the potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. this study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. material and methods: the study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and epstein-barr virus were identified using the taqman real-time pcr methodology. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. results: c. rectus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in  subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of epstein-barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. the diagnostic  sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for p. gingivalis and for t. forsythia and 86.49 for p. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. the  optimal copy-counts per ml saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for p. gingivalis, 700,000 for t. forsythia and 910,000 for p. intermedia. conclusion: salivary copy-counts of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and p. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.

TI  == effects of toluidine blue-mediated photodynamic therapy on periopathogens and periodontal biofilm: in vitro evaluation.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) is a selective modality of killing targeted cells, mostly known for its application in neoplasms. pdt can be considered to be an alternative method for the elimination of periodontal bacteria from the pocket without harms for the resident tissues. therefore, pdt may replace systemic antibiotics and enhance the effect of mechanical treatments of periodontal defects. this effort focused on the in vitro sensitization of periopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia ) toluidine blue mediated and on the use of a diode laser emitting source. the objective of this research was to evaluate the bactericidal in vitro effect of laser diodes 830 nm (as the light source) after photosensitization with toluidine blue (tbo) on the following periopathogenic bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia. after evaluating the effect on the single bacterial strain, the ability of diode laser to disrupt the structure  of biofilms produced by a. actinomycetemcomitans after photosensitization with tbo was also analyzed. the study suggests that the association of tbo and diode laser light 830 nm is effective for the killing of bacteria strains and determines the photoinactivation of aggregatibacter biofilms. in summary, photodynamic therapy has effectively shown its capabilities and, therefore, it can be considered a valid alternative approach to antimicrobial therapy of periodontitis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == killing of anaerobic pathogens by predatory bacteria.
AB  == recently, the predation of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus on a periodontal pathogen has been described. the current study explores the potential antimicrobial activity of a range of predatory bacteria against key periodontal pathogens. a number of representatives from the bdellovibrio, bacteriovorax and peredibacter lineages (called 'balos') were tested for their activity towards a group of key periodontal pathogens and an optimal multiplicity of infection was established. as the oral cavity contains a wide variety of bacteria that are not preyed upon,  it was investigated if they can have an effect on the predation efficiency of balos. it was concluded that a number of important variables involved in bacterial predation are found to be compatible with the composition of the oral microbiota. this finding makes the case for continued study of the potential for  balos to combat periodontal pathogens.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

TI  == comparison of the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma in the assessment of the ability of common cultivable oral anaerobic bacteria to produce malodorous volatile sulfur compounds from cysteine and methionine.
AB  == objective: to compare the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). materials and methods: broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (ph 7.7) with an optical density od(550)  of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile  15-ml head space vials. reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mml-methionine and l-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees c for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 m phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. production of vscs was measured using the halimeter and the oral chroma. results: the major vsc producers identified by both halimeter and oral chroma with l-cystenine as substrate were campylobacter ureolyticus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and gemella morbillorum. the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both halimeter and oral chroma were essentially identical. with l-methionine as substrate, both halimeter and oral chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with c. ureolyticus,p. gingivalis,fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia as major vsc producers. the  concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the halimeter were lower compared  to those assessed by the oral chroma. conclusion: the results suggest that the oral chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of vsc production by oral microflora than the halimeter.

TI  == antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of 4-hydroxycordoin: potential therapeutic benefits.
AB  == 4-hydroxycordoin (1), a natural isopentenyloxychalcone, is a plant secondary metabolite that is relatively rare. since there are very few reports about the biological activities of 1, its potential benefits for periodontal disease were investigated. a marked and dose-dependent antibacterial activity of 1 was observed against the three major periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. moreover, compound 1 showed an antiadhesion effect, since it inhibited attachment of p. gingivalis to oral epithelial cells. finally, using a macrophage model, the ability of 1 to inhibit  the secretion of inflammatory mediators induced by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide was demonstrated. the anti-inflammatory  effect observed was associated with reduced activation of the nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) p65 and activator protein-1 (ap-1) pathways.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

TI  == energy dose parameters affect antimicrobial photodynamic therapy-mediated eradication of periopathogenic biofilm and planktonic cultures.
AB  == objective: this study evaluated the in vitro efficacy of a commercially available apdt system in eradication of the periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in both planktonic and biofilm cultures. background data: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) is an effective antibacterial approach in vitro; however, few data are available regarding effective light-energy parameters. materials and methods: planktonic and biofilm cultures of periopathogens were exposed to a methylene blue-based formulation and irradiated with a 670-nm nonthermal diode laser. energy doses were varied from 2.3 to 9.4 j/cm(2) through adjustments in illumination time and a constant power density. controls consisted of no treatment, light only, and photosensitizer only. temperature changes were recorded in experimental samples before and after illumination. results: apdt with an energy dose of 9.4 j/cm(2) was effective in eradicating p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans in biofilm and planktonic form. reductions from control in planktonic cultures at this energy dose were 6.8 +/- 0.7, 5.2 +/- 0.6, and 1.9 +/- 0.6 log(10), respectively, whereas biofilm reductions were 4.5 +/- 1.2, 3.4 +/- 1.1, and 4.9 +/- 1.4 log(10). decreasing the treatment time produced an energy dose-dependent killing effect in both models. changes in sample temperature did not exceed 3 degrees c under these exposure parameters. conclusion: this study demonstrated that three important periopathogens are susceptible to apdt-mediated killing, regardless of whether they are present in planktonic or biofilm form. furthermore, a clear energy dose-dependence exists with this treatment that should to be taken into account when determining optimal treatment times in clinical application.

TI  == microbiota around teeth and dental implants in periodontally healthy, partially edentulous patients: is pre-implant microbiological testing relevant?
AB  == this study aimed to assess the prevalence of seven periodontal marker pathogens,  before implant placement and 1 yr after loading, in periodontally healthy individuals and to assess the long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of pathogens to below threshold levels. in 93 individuals needing single tooth replacement, pooled subgingival microbiological samples from standard sites were  cultured and analyzed before implant treatment and 1 yr after loading. threshold  levels commonly used in periodontology to predict periodontal breakdown were applied. subjects with levels of pathogens above these thresholds received initial periodontal treatment including systemic antibiotics when indicated. at baseline, 49.5% of periodontally healthy subjects harboured one or more marker pathogens above threshold levels. periodontal treatment reduced the pathogen levels below threshold values in 78.3% of these initially colonized subjects. in  all cases aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were reduced to below threshold. at 1 yr after loading, periodontal pathogens were present above threshold levels in 74.1% of all subjects. it is concluded that in  almost half of periodontal healthy individuals the subgingival biofilm harbours periodontal pathogens above threshold values. long-term effectiveness of pre-implant reduction of the selected marker pathogens appeared limited in our patient population, making pre-implant reduction unpredictive for post-implant levels of these pathogens. thus, considering the applied microbiological criteria, generalized pre-implant microbiological testing is not contributory in  periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of subgingival species in chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background and objective: the increasing rate of resistance of microorganisms to  penicillin and other antibiotics has generated concern among health authorities in latin america. the present investigation determined the in vitro susceptibility of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, black-pigmented prevotella spp. and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans to metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and moxifloxacin in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and nonselective culture media. the antimicrobial susceptibility of periodontopathogenic isolates was studied in chronic periodontitis patients in colombia. metronidazole, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, clindamycin and moxifloxacin were tested on all bacterial isolates and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. results: of the 150 bacteria identified, 51 were p. gingivalis, 45 were black-pigmented prevotella spp., 36 were f. nucleatum and 18 were a. actinomycetemcomitans. all the isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin/clavulanic  acid and to moxifloxacin, but exhibited variable susceptibility patterns to the other antimicrobial agents tested. conclusion: the results of the present study suggest that periodontal microorganisms in patients with chronic periodontitis can be resistant to the antimicrobial agents commonly used in anti-infective periodontal therapy. we suggest that the indiscriminate use of antimicrobials could result in the appearance of more highly antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria associated with periodontal diseases in our population compared with the populations of other countries.

TI  == gram-negative periodontal bacteria induce the activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4, and cytokine production in human periodontal ligament cells.
AB  == background: periodontitis is a bacterially induced chronic inflammatory disease.  toll-like receptors (tlrs), which could recognize microbial pathogens, are important components in the innate and adaptive immune systems. both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses might result from different bacteria stimulation and the triggering of different tlrs. this study explores the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) with tlr2 and tlr4. methods: we studied the gene expression changes of tlr2 and tlr4 and cytokine production (interleukin-1beta, -6, -8, -10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) in human periodontal ligament cells (hpdlcs) stimulated with heat-killed bacteria or p. gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (lps) in the presence or absence of monoclonal antibodies to tlr2 or tlr4 (anti-tlr2/4 mab). results: both test bacteria and 10  microg/ml p. gingivalis lps treatment increased the gene expression of tlr2 and tlr4 and cytokine production in hpdlcs. in addition, these upregulations could be blocked by anti-tlr2/4 mab. however, the expression of tlr4 mrna in hpdlcs stimulated with 1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps was not increased. no differences were found in the cytokine production caused by 1 microg/ml p. gingivalis lps treatment in the presence or absence of anti-tlr4 mab. conclusion: these patterns of gene expression and cytokine production indicate that gram-negative periodontal bacteria or their lps might play a role in triggering tlr2 and/or tlr4, and be of importance for the immune responses in periodontitis.

TI  == effects of a composition containing lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria: a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
AB  == we report a clinical trial of the effects of test tablets containing bovine lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase on oral malodor and salivary bacteria. fifteen subjects with volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) in mouth air above the olfactory threshold (h(2)s >1.5 or ch(3)sh >0.5 ng/10 ml) as detected by gas chromatography were enrolled in the trial. either a test or a placebo tablet was ingested twice  at 1-h intervals in two crossover phases. mouth air was monitored for vsc levels  at the baseline before ingestion of a tablet, 10 min after the first ingestion, 1 h (just before the second ingestion), and 2 h after the first ingestion. whole saliva was analyzed at the baseline and at 2 h for bacterial numbers. at 10 min,  the level of ch(3)sh was significantly lower in the test group (median [interquartile range] = 0.28 [0.00-0.68] ng/10 ml) compared to that in the placebo group (0.73 [0.47-1.00] ng/10 ml; p = 0.011). the median concentration of ch(3)sh in the test group was below the olfactory threshold after 10 min until 2  h, whereas the level in the placebo group was above the threshold during the experimental period. no difference in the numbers of salivary bacteria was detected by culturing or quantitative pcr, but terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism detected one fragment with a significantly lower copy number  at 2 h in the test group (mean +/- standard error, 4.89 +/- 0.11 log(10) copies/10 microl) compared to that in the placebo group (5.38 +/- 0.15 log(10) copies/10 microl; p = 0.033). these results indicate a suppressive effect of the  test composition on oral malodor and suggest an influence on oral bacteria.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == communication: antimicrobial activity of smap28 with a targeting domain for porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == antibiotic therapy is often used with mechanical therapy to treat periodontal disease. however, complications associated with antibiotic use can occur. a 'bacteria-specific' targeted approach would eliminate some of these complications and kill specific periodontopathogens without harming the commensal bacteria. one such approach is to couple antimicrobial peptides to a ligand, pheromone, or antibody specific for the periodontopathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. to assess the feasibility of this approach, we attached pqgppq, a peptide from proline-rich protein 1 to either the n-terminus of smap28 (peptide zs37-37) or the c-terminus  of smap28 (peptide zs37-38) to see whether it has potential as a carrier ligand to deliver smap28 to the surface of p. gingivalis. for escherichia coli and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the median minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of zs37-37 was higher than the median of smap28 alone, although the median mic of zs37-38 was lower than that of smap28 alone. for p. gingivalis, there was no difference in the median mic values. for s. aureus, the  median mic was higher for zs37-37 and zs37-38 compared to smap28 alone, particularly for zs37-38. for fusobacterium nucleatum, the median mic values were equal for zs37-37 and zs37-38 and higher than the median mic for smap28 alone. attaching pqgppq to smap28 did not greatly increase the antimicrobial activity of zs37-37 or zs37-38 for p. gingivalis nor substantially decrease the antimicrobial activity of zs37-37 or zs37-38 for the four other microorganisms tested. this is  an initial step to develop a selective antimicrobial agent that has 'targeted' antimicrobial activity without adverse reactions often associated with the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics.

TI  == [effect of periodontal mechanical treatment on periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid of chronic periodontitis patients].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the subgingival prevalent rates of 6 periodontal pathogenic bacteria in gingival crevicular fluids of cp patients before and after treatment, to analyze the relationship between the prevalent variance and periodontal clinical parameters, and to provide a microbiologic method of evaluating curative effect and estimating the prognosis. methods: gingival crevicular fluids of 13 cp patients were collected at baseline, 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment. also, gingival crevicular fluids were collected from 11 healthy subjects. six periodontal pathogenic bacteria including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis(pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum(fn), prevotella nigrescens (pn) were detected by 16s rrna based pcr. results: the pli, pd, bi of the cp patients 2 months and 4 months after periodontal mechanical treatment were evidently less than those before treatment. these 4 months after treatment were a little more than those 2 months  after. the six bacteria were more frequently detected in the cp patients at baseline than in healthy controls. the prevalent rates of tf (42.1%, 73.7%, 70.2%), pg (47.4%, 68.4%, 77.2%), aa (15.8%, 22.8%, 7.0%), pn (38.6%, 57.9%, 64.9%), pi(15.8%, 38.6%, 42.1%) 2 weeks, 2 months and 4 months following treatment were significantly lower than those at baseline (tf 96.5%, pg 93.0%, aa 36.8%, pn 86.0%, pi 84.2%), but the prevalent rates of all the detected bacteria  2 months after treatment were higher than those at 2 weeks after. conclusion: tf, pg, aa, pn and pi may cooperate in the development of cp. the changes of periodontal pathogenic bacteria could be detected before the changes of clinical  parameters and the patients should be re-evaluated and re-treated regularly within 2 months after treatment.

AB  == fish oil, enriched in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa), is widely used as a dietary or nutritional supplement with numerous benefits, including as  an anti-inflammatory particularly linked to atherosclerosis. while n-3 pufa have  been suggested to be able to improve oral health through a reduction in inflammation through elevations in these fatty acids in serum and cellular membranes, information is lacking for the possibility that these fatty acids could directly impact the survival and growth of the oral bacteria that trigger the chronic inflammatory responses. the n-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (epa), docosahexaenoic acid (dha) and alpha-linolenic acid (ala), and their fatty acid ethyl esters, alaee, epaee, dhaee were analysed for antibacterial activity against oral pathogens. this study demonstrated a novel bioactivity of the three  major n-3 pufa, epa, dha, and ala, and their ester derivatives. our experimental  data indicated that n-3 pufa and their ester derivatives exhibited strong antibacterial activity against various oral pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. this study suggested that n-3 pufa could have a positive therapeutic effect for improving oral health via their antibacterial activities, besides their anti-inflammatory effects.

TI  == quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens in female patients with and without chronic periodontitis by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is a highly prevalent endogenous polymicrobial disease. to  better understand the etiology of the disease a quantitative approach is mandatory and real-time pcr is the molecular technique currently preferred to achieve this purpose. taking into account that such a kind of study is still scarce, we aimed to evaluate the association between periodontal microbiota and chronic periodontitis. a total of 60 low-income age-matched female adults, 30 with chronic periodontitis and 30 without periodontal disease, were enrolled. dna obtained from subgingival specimens was used for quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia by real-time pcr.  a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were detected in all subjects, p. gingivalis was observed in 70.0% and 46.6% and p. intermedia in 90.0% and 80.0% of chronic periodontitis patients and periodontally healthy subjects, respectively. p. gingivalis mean count was significantly higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in periodontally healthy individuals. accurate detection and quantification of five putative periodontal pathogens was  feasible using a simple and fast real-time pcr protocol. although p. gingivalis and p. intermedia have been found more commonly in chronic periodontitis patients, no statistical difference was observed between periodontally diseased and healthy groups. quantitative data indicated association between p. gingivalis and chronic periodontitis. however, because of its uneven distribution, it should not be solely taken as a marker of periodontal status.

AB  == to determine the influence of oral status on halitosis, the relationship between  halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria present in plaque on the tongue and the subgingival sulcus was examined in 62 periodontally healthy adults. halitosis indicators used were the organoleptic score; gas chromatography results [total volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) = h(2)s + ch(3)sh + (ch(3))(2)s]; halimeter values; and the results of three clinical tests, plaque control record (plcr), plaque index (pli), and tongue coat status. significant correlations with organoleptic scores was observed for plcr, pli, tongue coat status, vsc amounts,  and halimeter values, indicating that halitosis in periodontally healthy subjects tended to originate from tongue plaque deposits. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect six periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola) from the tongue and subgingival plaque. significant effects on the organoleptic scores, tongue coat status, total vsc, h(2)s and ch(3)sh amounts, and halimeter values were observed only for t. denticola and f. nucleatum and only in the tongue plaque, not in the subgingival plaque. thus, therapies developed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria may lead to future treatments of halitosis.

AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of commercial dentifrices.
AB  == this investigation compared the effects of a fluoride dentifrice and toothpastes  formulated with antimicrobial ingredients (stannous fluoride and triclosan/copolymer) on oral micro-organisms, including those found in samples taken from the human oral cavity. microbiological techniques determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of each dentifrice necessary to inhibit  the growth of bacterial strains from the healthy oral cavity, as well as those found in dental caries, periodontal disease, and halitosis. ex vivo studies utilized oral rinse samples and supragingival plaque from adults to determine antimicrobial effects on the entire microbial diversity of these samples, including biofilm-derived micro-organisms. the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the lowest mics and significantly inhibited gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (including the periodontal pathogens aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). in the  ex vivo tests, the triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated substantial inhibition in the oral rinse samples over each treatment period (p > 0.0005) as compared to either the fluoride or stannous fluoride dentifrices. similarly, the  triclosan/copolymer dentifrice demonstrated the highest inhibition of micro-organisms in the supragingival plaque biofilm (p < 0.0005). no significant  differences were observed between the fluoride and stannous fluoride dentifrices  (p > 0.5).

TI  == the bactericidal effect of a genius nd:yag laser.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the 'in vitro' bactericidal effect of the nd:yag laser (genius, molsgaard dental, copenhagen, denmark) on six periodontal pathogens. methods: suspensions of six different periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra) were prepared in small eppendorff tubes, and exposed to a nd:yag laser for five different periods of time. laser settings used: power 6 watt (on a scale of 1-12 w), frequency 50 hz, pulse duration 250 mus. after exposure to the laser, aliquots of the suspensions were spread on blood agar plates for bacterial counting. results: after 5 s of laser exposure, there was a decrease in total colony forming units for all six selected microorganisms. after 15, 30 and 45 s, no viable bacterial cells could be retrieved. conclusion: in this 'in vitro' model, 15 s of nd:yag laser use was found to be effective for total killing of the six tested periodontal pathogens.

TI  == epithelial cell pro-inflammatory cytokine response differs across dental plaque bacterial species.
AB  == aim: the dental plaque is comprised of numerous bacterial species, which may or may not be pathogenic. human gingival epithelial cells (hgecs) respond to perturbation by various bacteria of the dental plaque by production of different  levels of inflammatory cytokines, which is a putative reflection of their virulence. the aim of the current study was to determine responses in terms of interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 secretion induced by porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus gordonii in order to gauge their virulence potential. materials and methods: hgecs were challenged with the four bacterial species, live or heat killed, at various multiplicity of infections and the elicited il-1beta, il-6, il-8 and il-10 responses were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: primary hgecs challenged with live p. gingivalis produced high levels of il-1beta, while challenge with live a. actinomycetemcomitans gave high levels of  il-8. the opportunistic pathogen f. nucleatum induces the highest levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while the commensal s. gordonii is the least stimulatory. conclusion: we conclude that various dental plaque biofilm bacteria  induce different cytokine response profiles in primary hgecs that may reflect their individual virulence or commensal status.

TI  == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == differential effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors slpi, elafin,  scca1, and scca2.
AB  == objective: secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitors (slpi), elafin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and 2 (scca1 and scca2) are specific endogenous serine protease inhibitors expressed by epithelial cells that prevent tissue damage from excessive proteolytic enzyme activity due to inflammation. to determine the effects of various periopathogens on these protease inhibitors, we utilized human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) challenged with cell-free bacteria supernatants  of various periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. design: the gene expression and secretion of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were determined using real-time pcr and elisa, respectively. the direct effects of periopathogens and p. gingivalis gingipain mutants on these inhibitors were examined in vitro by western blot. the effect on the innate immune response of gecs was measured by expression of antimicrobial peptides: human beta-defenisin-2 (hbd2) and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 20 (ccl20). results: we found that slpi, scca2, elafin, hbd2,  and ccl20 gene expression levels were significantly induced (p<0.001) in response to p. gingivalis, whose virulence factors include cysteine proteases, but not in  response to stimulation by other bacteria. p. gingivalis reduced the secretion of slpi and elafin significantly in gecs, and degraded recombinant slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2. differential degradation patterns of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were observed with different bacteria as well as p. gingivalis mutants associated with the loss of specific gingipains secreted by p. gingivalis. in addition, pretreatment of gecs with slpi, scca1, or scca2 partially blocked hbd2  and ccl20 mrna expression in response to p. gingivalis, suggesting a protective effect. conclusion: our results suggest that different periopathogens affect the  host protease inhibitors in a different manner, suggesting host susceptibility may differ in the presence of these pathogens. the balance between cellular protease inhibitors and their degradation may be an important factor in susceptibility to periodontal infection.

TI  == nod1 and nod2 mediate sensing of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == in bacterial infection, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (nod) 1 and nod2 induce innate immune responses by recognizing fragments of the bacterial component peptidoglycan (pgn). to determine the roles of these receptors in detection of periodontal pathogens, we stimulated human embryonic kidney cells expressing nod1 or nod2 with heat-killed porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum or their soluble pgns (spgns). all bacteria and their spgns could stimulate activation of  nf-kappab. however, there were differences in nod1- and nod2-stimulatory activities among the species of bacteria. p. gingivalis showed weaker nod1- and nod2-stimulatory activities than did other bacteria. these differences in activities were confirmed by production of interleukin-8 from oral epithelial cells stimulated with spgns. these findings indicate that both nod1 and nod2 might be involved in the recognition of periodontal pathogens, and that the weak  nod-stimulatory property of p. gingivalis might be helpful for survival in the periodontal pocket.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

TI  == differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis. host cell invasion by p. gingivalis  has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on p. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. p. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell  line ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. among the pathogens tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote p. gingivalis invasion (p<0.01). this increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. in contrast, co-infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tannerella forsythia attenuated p. gingivalis invasion. the fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not  observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. these results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by p. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans builds mutualistic biofilm communities with fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella species in saliva.
AB  == human oral bacterial pathogens grow in attached multispecies biofilm communities. unattached cells are quickly removed by swallowing. therefore, surface attachment is essential for growth, and we investigated multispecies community interactions  resulting in mutualistic growth on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we used two model systems, saliva-coated transferable solid-phase polystyrene pegs (peg biofilms) and flow cells with saliva-coated glass surfaces. fluorescent antibody  staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in flow cells, and  quantitative real-time pcr with species-specific primers was used to quantify the biomass in peg biofilms. veillonella sp. strain pk1910, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans jp2, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 were unable to  grow as single species in flow cells. only a. actinomycetemcomitans grew after 36 h when peg biofilms remained submerged in saliva from the time of inoculation. mixed-species coaggregates were used for two- and three-species inoculation. the  biomass in two-species biofilms increased in both systems when veillonella sp. strain pk1910 was present as one of the partners. enhanced growth of all strains  was observed in three-species biofilms in flow cells. interestingly, in flow cells f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans exhibited mutualism, and, although f. nucleatum was unable to grow with either of the other species in the  peg system, f. nucleatum stimulated the growth of veillonella sp. and together these two organisms increased the total biomass of a. actinomycetemcomitans in three-species peg biofilms. we propose that mutualistic two-species and multispecies oral biofilm communities form in vivo and that mutualism between commensal veillonellae and late colonizing pathogens, such as aggregatibacteria,  contributes to the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus inhibit oral bacteria-induced macrophage activation and phagocytosis.
AB  == introduction: periodontal disease is an inflammatory condition caused by periodontal microorganisms. viruses such as human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) and epstein-barr virus (ebv) are associated with certain types of periodontal disease, but their roles in promoting the disease are unclear. because both viruses infect human macrophages, cells which play key roles in the clearance of  pathogenic bacteria, it is likely that the viruses alter the functional capacity  of macrophages by inhibiting their defense mechanisms against invading pathogens. methods: macrophages preinfected with hcmv or ebv were evaluated following stimulation by selected oral bacteria. bacteria-induced macrophage activation was assayed by measuring the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) produced in the media, and phagocytic activity was analysed by a phagocytosis assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bacteria. the virus-infected macrophages were also subjected to semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction to measure the expression of toll-like receptor 9, which is involved in the activation of phagocytosis-related pathways. results: both hcmv and ebv significantly diminished the tnf-alpha production typically induced by oral bacteria, inhibited the phagocytic activity of macrophages, and downregulated the expression of toll-like receptor 9. conclusion: infection by hcmv or ebv inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge, thereby  suggesting their pathogenic role in the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == the impact of the stone age diet on gingival conditions in the absence of oral hygiene.
AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == proteolytic activities of oral bacteria on prommp-9 and the effect of synthetic proteinase inhibitors.
AB  == tissue reactions to bacteria lead to proinflammatory reactions involving matrix metalloproteinases (mmps). synthetic protease inhibitors may offer new possibilities to regulate bacterial proteases. we investigated proteolytic activities of certain periodontal bacteria, their effects on the latent prommp-9, and the effects of synthetic mmp inhibitors and a serine protease inhibitor pefabloc. the strains studied were porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptoccus micros, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and 5 aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. their gelatinolytic activities and the effects of certain synthetic mmp inhibitors and  pefabloc were analyzed by zymography. bacterial effects on prommp-9 conversion were investigated by western immunoblot. all investigated periodontal bacteria produced gelatinolytic cell-bound and extracellular proteinases which could fragment latent prommp-9, suggesting co-operative processing cascades in oral tissue remodeling. a. actinomycetemcomitans produced the weakest gelatinolytic activity. synthetic proteinase inhibitors exhibited slight but clear reductive effects on the bacterial proteolytic activities. we conclude that targeted anti-proteolytic treatment modalities against bacterial-host proteolytic cascades can be developed.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == streptococcus cristatus attenuates fusobacterium nucleatum-induced interleukin-8  expression in oral epithelial cells.
AB  == background and objective: oral epithelial cells may be invaded by a polymicrobial intracellular flora, including pathogens together with commensals. various oral pathogens can induce the production of interleukin-8, a potent neutrophil chemotractant, in oral epithelial cells. evidence from the gut suggests that commensal species may modulate inflammatory responses to pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the interleukin-8 responses of oral epithelial cells to an oral pro-inflammatory species, fusobacterium nucleatum, in combination with an oral commensal, streptococcus cristatus. material and methods: kb, tert-2, tr146  and scc15 cells were cocultured with f. nucleatum and s. cristatus, either alone  or in combination, at 37 degrees c in 5% co2 under various conditions. the mrna expression of interleukin-8 was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and protein secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent  assay. results: f. nucleatum alone evoked a potent interleukin-8 response, whereas s. cristatus alone did not induce significant interleukin-8 expression in oral epithelial cells. when present together, s. cristatus attenuated the f. nucleatum-induced interleukin-8 production in the four oral epithelial cell lines to varying degrees. the inhibitory effect of s. cristatus was independent of its  viability and its co-aggregation with f. nucleatum, was not related to soluble bacterial products and appeared to require bacterial contact with epithelial cells. similar effects were seen with several other species of oral streptococci. conclusion: our data suggest that s. cristatus may exert immunomodulatory effects on the interleukin-8 response of oral epithelial cells to f. nucleatum challenge.

TI  == comparison of culture methods and multiplex pcr for the detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in biofilm associated with severe forms of periodontitis.
AB  == conventional culture methods and multiplex pcr, both of which we have been used for a long time in our clinical microbiology laboratory, were compared for their  ability to detect a selected panel of periodontopathic bacteria: aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. tests were performed in a single subgingival sample taken from a periodontal diseased site with a probing depth equal to or greater than 6mm. the results were compared site-by-site, taking into account the quality and the presence or absence of pathogens. 529 samples of subgingival plaque were analysed and the prevalence of  the six species monitored varied in relation to the species itself and the method of detection. the most represented species is f. nucleatum, with a percentage of  positive variability between 44.9% pcr and 46.5% culture test. generally, the lowest prevalence was determined by culture test, with the exception of e. corrodens and f. nucleatum, which, unlike other bacteria, have been seen in higher percentages in culture with respect to pcr. for both methods, there was a  good degree of accuracy in the determination of a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, and p. gingivalis. it becomes weak for f. nucleatum and p.  intermedia. both culture and pcr techniques introduced many methodological problems when applied in oral microbiology, but the ideal technique for accurate  detection of pathogens in subgingival plaque samples has yet to be developed.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

AB  == background and objective: host responses following the recognition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide can range from acute inflammation to septic shock. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the ability of the ksl-w decapeptide to bind to and block the endotoxic effects of lipopolysaccharide. material and methods: an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based binding assay using fluorescently labeled ksl-w to detect adsorbed escherichia coli o55:b5 lipopolysaccharide was employed. a commercially available recombinant factor c lipopolysaccharide detection assay, hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes as well as e-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells were used to assess the anti-endotoxic effects after ksl-w exposure to e. coli lipopolysaccharide as well as to oral lipopolysaccharide samples. results: lipopolysaccharide-binding assays using e. coli o55:b5 lipopolysaccharide revealed both a higher maximal binding range (532-713 microm) and a half-maximum binding concentration (70-185 microm) for the ksl-w peptide when compared with its analog control. significant inhibition of e-selectin expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (p < 0.0001) as well as hemagglutination of rabbit erythrocytes occurred after the interaction of ksl-w with e. coli lipopolysaccharide. recombinant factor c enzyme detection inhibition revealed dose-dependent inhibition values ranging from 1.0-51.8 microm. which were dependent upon the type of lipopolysaccharide sample tested. conclusion: these results demonstrate that for the concentrations tested, the ksl-w decapeptide was nontoxic to mammalian cells and could bind to and block the host recognition and response towards enteric, as well as oral, lipopolysaccharide samples.

AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == [detection of periodontal pathogens in coronary atherosclerotic plaques].
AB  == objective: to explore the possible correlation between coronary heart disease and periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque samples and coronary atherosclerotic plaques were harvested from a total of 31 patients with periodontitis who scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery. the bacteria dna was obtained from  subgingival plaque samples and coronary atherosclerotic plaques using the chelex-100 method. the extracted dna was examined using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. results: in coronary atherosclerotic plaques samples from the 31 patients, porphyromonas gingivalis (pg, 38.7%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa, 0%), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn, 22.6%), prevotella intermedia (pi, 12.9%), bacteroides forsythus (bf, 38.7%) were detected. the concordant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in subgingival plaques and in coronary atherosclerotic plaques in the same patient was pg 5 (16.1%), aa  0 (0%), pi 2 (6.5%), fn 4 (12.9%) and bf 8 (25.8%). conclusions: the presence of  periodontal bacteria dna in coronary atherosclerotic plaques could indicate that  periodontal pathogenic bacteria may play a role in the coronary heart disease process.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans serotype f o-polysaccharide mediates coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == background/aims: intergeneric bacterial coaggregation may play an important role  in plaque development. methods: in this study we investigated the coaggregation reaction between two periodontal pathogens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum. results: previous studies showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b strains coaggregate with f. nucleatum strain pk1594, and that a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b o-polysaccharide (o-ps) is the receptor responsible for coaggregation between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype f o-ps has been shown to be structurally and antigenically related to serotype b o-ps. in the present study we show that a. actinomycetemcomitans strain cu1060n, a serotype f strain, also coaggregated with f. nucleatum pk1594. like coaggregation between serotype b strains and f. nucleatum, coaggregation between cu1060n and f. nucleatum was inhibited by galactose. an o-ps mutant of cu1060n failed to coaggregate with f. nucleatum. conclusion: we concluded that a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype f o-ps, like serotype b o-ps, mediates coaggregation between a. actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacteria.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems in subjects with radiation-induced hyposalivation.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microbial flora in specific oral sites in 13 dentate subjects, 6-8 months after completed radiation therapy (rt group) and in 13 matched controls. material and methods: the microflora on the tongue, buccal mucosa, vestibulum, supragingival plaque and subgingival region was analysed using duplicate sampling and cultivation technique. a clinical examination was also performed. results: candida albicans was found in one or more sites in 54% of the rt subjects and in 15% of the controls. in three rt subjects, c. albicans  was found at all four sites analysed. an unexpected finding was that enterococci  were found in all rt subjects and in high number in 38%. none of the controls harboured enterococci. in supragingival plaque, lactobacillus spp. were detected  in 92% of the rt subjects and the number and proportion of lactobacillus spp. were extremely high compared with the controls. mutans streptococci were detected in high numbers in 31% of the rt subjects, while they were not detected in 23%. conclusion: the microbial results explain why some rt subjects have an increased  susceptibility to oral diseases and stress that site-specific microbial analysis  is an important diagnostic tool when planning oral health preventive care for rt  subjects.

TI  == relationship between campylobacter rectus and periodontal status during pregnancy.
AB  == introduction: in a previous study, we showed that the growth of campylobacter rectus is stimulated by the presence of female sex hormones in the culture medium. in the present study, we examined the relationship between c. rectus levels in the saliva and the periodontal status of pregnant women. methods: unstimulated whole saliva was collected from 22 pregnant and 15 non-pregnant women. periodontal pocket depth (pd) and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the concentrations of suspected periodontopathogenic bacteria in the saliva samples.  in addition, the concentration of estradiol in the saliva samples was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: the average age, number of teeth, and total number of bacteria in the saliva of subjects in both groups were similar. the percentage of sites with a pd = 4 mm and the salivary estradiol concentrations were significantly higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women. in addition, the percentage of bop sites and the c. rectus levels in the saliva of the pregnant women tended to be higher than in non-pregnant women, although these differences were not statistically significant. there were positive correlations  between c. rectus levels and estradiol concentrations, and between c. rectus levels and the percentage of sites with pd = 4 mm in the pregnant women. conclusion: these results indicate that c. rectus levels are higher in the oral flora of pregnant women and that this may be associated with increased salivary estradiol concentrations. this may contribute to periodontal disease progression  during pregnancy.

TI  == quantitative analysis of association between herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the development of human periodontitis may depend upon  cooperative interactions among herpesviruses, specific pathogenic bacteria and tissue-destructive inflammatory mediators. this study sought to identify associations among human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and six putative periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis lesions. material and methods: fifteen periodontitis patients (nine with aggressive periodontitis and six with chronic periodontitis) and 15 periodontally normal subjects were included in the study. in each study subject, a microbiological sample was collected, using a curette, from the deepest periodontal probing depth of the dentition. a real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was employed to determine the subgingival counts  of human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus. statistical analysis was performed using the student's t-test, the pearson correlation coefficient test and the single variable logistic regression test for odds ratio-based risk calculation. results: human cytomegalovirus was detected in eight periodontitis lesions and in one normal periodontal site, epstein-barr virus was detected in nine periodontitis lesions and in two normal periodontal sites, and the study bacteria were detected in 6-15 periodontitis lesions and in  1-11 normal periodontal sites. correlations were found between counts of human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus, between counts of human cytomegalovirus and p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and c. rectus, and between counts of epstein-barr virus and p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr  virus counts were also positively associated with the level of periodontal attachment loss, probing pocket depth and gingival bleeding on probing. conclusion: this study confirmed that periodontal human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus are associated with major periodontopathic bacteria and with the severity of periodontal disease. the finding of abundant herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions redefines the pathogenic paradigm of the disease. understanding the interplay between herpesviruses and specific bacterial species  in the pathogenesis of periodontitis may form the basis for new approaches to preventing, reducing or delaying tissue breakdown from periodontal infections.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  == extracts or alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a m. aquifolium  extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the m. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. the values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. the most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == activation of toll-like receptors 2 and 4 by gram-negative periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: periodontitis is a chronic infectious disease associated with a  gram-negative subgingival microflora. bacterial components stimulate, among other receptors, toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and/or tlr4. accumulating evidence indicates that both qualitatively and quantitatively distinct immune responses result from the triggering of tlr2 as compared to tlr4 triggering. the aim was to study the interaction of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum and veillonella parvula with tlr2 and tlr4. we investigated all known serotypes (k(-), k1-k6) of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a-e strains for their potency to stimulate cytokine production. methods: human embryonic kidney (hek) cells, stably transfected with cd14, cd14-tlr2, or cd14-tlr4 and whole blood were stimulated with bacterial sonicates. cytokine production (interleukin-6, -8, -10 and -12) was measured in the supernatant by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: all test bacteria stimulated hek-cd14-tlr2, but only a. actinomycetemcomitans and v. parvula stimulated hek-cd14-tlr4. no differences were found in the activation  of hek-cd14-tlr2/4, or cytokine production in whole blood between serotypes of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: gram-negative periodontal bacteria predominantly stimulated tlr2, which may be of importance for the th1/th2 cell orientation of the immune response in periodontitis.

TI  == gingival epithelial cell transcriptional responses to commensal and opportunistic oral microbial species.
AB  == transcriptional profiling and ontology tools were utilized to define the biological pathways of gingival epithelial cells modulated by coculture with the  oral commensal streptococcus gordonii and the opportunistic commensal fusobacterium nucleatum. overall, f. nucleatum and s. gordonii perturbed the gingival epithelial cell transcriptome much less significantly than the oral pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans perturbed the transcriptome, indicating that there was a greater degree of host adaptation by the commensal species (m. handfield, j. j. mans, g. zheng, m. c. lopez, s. mao, a. progulske-fox, g. narasimhan, h. v. baker, and r. j. lamont, cell. microbiol. 7:811-823, 2005). the biological pathways significantly impacted by f. nucleatum and s. gordonii included the mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) and toll-like receptor signaling pathways. differential regulation of gadd45 and dusp4, key components of the mapk pathway, was confirmed at the protein level by western blotting. modulation of the mapk pathway is likely to affect host cell proliferation and differentiation. in addition, both the mapk and toll-like receptor pathways ultimately converge on cytokine gene expression.  an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of secreted interleukin-6 (il-6) and il-8 demonstrated that f. nucleatum induced production of these cytokines, whereas s.  gordonii inhibited secretion from the epithelial cells. stimulation of secretion  of proinflammatory cytokines from epithelial cells may reflect the invasive phenotype of f. nucleatum and contribute to the greater pathogenic potential of f. nucleatum than of s. gordonii.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide regulates matrix metalloproteinase, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase, and plasminogen activator production by human gingival fibroblasts: a potential role in connective tissue destruction.
AB  == fibroblasts, a major constituent of gingival connective tissue, can produce immunoregulatory cytokines and proteolytic enzymes that may contribute to tissue  destruction. in this study, we evaluated the production of matrix metalloproteinases (mmps), tissue inhibitors of mmps (timps), and plasminogen activators by gingival fibroblasts stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) produced by periodontopathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.  in addition, changes in the expression and phosphorylation state of fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins induced by a. actinomycetemcomitans lps were characterized using antibody microarrays. we showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps induced the production of a 50 kda plasminogen activator, mmp-2 and, to a lesser extent, mmp-3 by fibroblasts. the stimulation of fibroblasts with a. actinomycetemcomitans lps also resulted in the overproduction of timp-1, but had  no effect on the production of timp-2. comparable responses were also obtained with porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum lps. the results of the microarray analyses showed that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps induced changes in the phosphorylation state and expression of gingival fibroblast intracellular signaling proteins. more specifically, they suggested that a. actinomycetemcomitans lps may induce both jun n-terminus protein-serine kinases (jnk) and mitogen-activated protein-serine kinase p38 alpha (p38alpha mapk) pathway activation, leading to increased activator protein-1 (ap-1) and nuclear factor kappa-b (nfkappab) activities, which in turn can stimulate mmp-2,  mmp-3, timp-1, and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (upa) expression. this may contribute to periodontal connective tissue destruction.

TI  == interleukin-1alpha stimulation in monocytes by periodontal bacteria: antagonistic effects of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontal pathogenic bacteria are associated with elevated levels of interleukin-1alpha (il-1alpha) but it is unclear if all species can induce cytokine production equally. porphyromonas gingivalis may be able antagonize il-1alpha induced by other species through the activity of its proteases or lipopolysaccharide (lps). monomac-6 cells and primary human monocytes were treated with culture supernatants from porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedius, veillonella atypical and prevotella nigrescens. il-1alpha protein levels were measured after 6 h of incubation. in addition, monocytes were co-stimulated with supernatants from p. gingivalis and other bacteria. the role of p. gingivalis proteases was tested using arg-x and lys-x mutant strains. the role of lps was investigated using purified p. gingivalis lps and polymixin depletion. all species tested induced significant il-1alpha production, but p. gingivalis was the weakest. co-stimulation of monocytes with p. gingivalis antagonized the ability of other bacterial species to induce il-1alpha production. this effect was at its greatest with c. rectus (resulting in a 70% reduction). gingipain mutant strains and chemical inhibition of protease activity did not reduce antagonistic activity. however, 100 ng/ml of p. gingivalis lps can reproduce the antagonistic activity of p. gingivalis culture supernatants. periodontitis-associated bacterial species stimulate il-1alpha production by monocytes. p. gingivalis can antagonize this effect, and its lps appears to be the crucial component. this study highlights the importance of mixed infections in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease because reduction of pro-inflammatory  cytokine levels may impair the ability of the host to tackle infection.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of electrolyzed water on oral bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. tap water was electrolyzed in a water vessel  using platinum cell technology. the electrolyzed tap water (called puri-water) was put in contact with five major periodontopathogens or toothbrushes contaminated with these bacteria for 30 sec. in addition, puri-water was used as  a mouthwash for 30 sec in 16 subjects and the antibacterial effect on salivary bacteria was evaluated. puri-water significantly reduced the growth of all periodontopathogens in culture and on toothbrushes, and that of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in saliva, when compared to the effect of tap water. it also significantly reduced mutans streptococci growing on mitis salivarius-bacitracin  agar. our results demonstrate that the electrolyzed tap water is effective as a mouthwash and for toothbrush disinfection.

AB  == the mfa1 protein of porphyromonas gingivalis is the structural subunit of the short fimbriae and mediates coadhesion between p. gingivalis and streptococcus gordonii. we utilized a promoter-lacz reporter construct to examine the regulation of mfa1 expression in consortia with common oral plaque bacteria. promoter activity of mfa1 was inhibited by s. gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus mitis. in contrast, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus cristatus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum did not affect mfa1 expression. expression of sspa/b, the streptococcal receptor for mfa1, was not required for regulation of mfa1 promoter activity. proteinaceous molecule(s) in oral streptococci may be responsible for regulation of mfa1 expression. porphyromonas gingivalis is capable of detecting heterologous organisms, and responds to selected organisms by specific gene regulation.

TI  == protective effects of grape seed proanthocyanidins against oxidative stress induced by lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathogens.
AB  == background: during phagocytosis or stimulation with bacterial components, macrophages activate various cell processes, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ros) and reactive nitrogen species (rns), which are critical for  successful defense against invading organisms. increased levels of ros/rns create oxidative stress that results in tissue and bone destruction. grape seed proanthocyanidins have been reported to possess a wide range of biologic properties against oxidative stress. in the present study, we investigated the effects of a grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (gse) and commercial polyphenols on the production of ros and rns and on the protein expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) by murine macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharides (lps) of periodontopathogens. methods: macrophages (raw 264.7) were treated with non-toxic concentrations of either gse or commercial polyphenols (gallic acid [ga] and [-]-epigallocatechin-3-gallate [egcg]) and stimulated with lps of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fusobacterium nucleatum, and inos expression was evaluated by immunoblotting. nitric oxide (no) production was quantified using the colorimetric griess assay, whereas ros production was measured with the fluorescent 123-dihydrorhodamine dye. results: gse strongly decreased no and ros production and inos expression by lps-stimulated macrophages. ga also revealed a strong inhibitory effect on no production without affecting inos expression but slightly increasing ros production. egcg showed an inhibitory effect on no and ros production and on inos expression by macrophages. conclusion: our findings demonstrate that proanthocyanidins have potent antioxidant properties and should be considered a potential agent in the prevention of periodontal diseases.

TI  == inflammation, heat shock proteins and periodontal pathogens in atherosclerosis: an immunohistologic study.
AB  == background: inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial  groel with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. methods: in this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and groel were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. results: the inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by cd14(+) macrophages and cd4(+) t cells. most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were hla-dr(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of cd25 expression, demonstrating that  the activated t cells were not proliferating. few cd1a(+) and cd83(+) cells were  noted. human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. groel and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. chlamydia pneumoniae, porphyromonas  gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. conclusion: these results give evidence for a  specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == selective inhibition of porphyromonas gingivalis growth by a factor xa inhibitor, dx-9065a.
AB  == background: porphyromonas gingivalis is a causative bacterium of adult periodontitis. however, there is no drug specific for p. gingivalis and for its virulence factor. objectives: the objective of this study was to examine the effects of a new selective inhibitor of activated factor x, dx-9065a, on growth of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria. methods: we incubated p. gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria in the presence or absence of dx-9065a and examined the effect of dx-9065a on bacterial growth and trypsin-like activity in its cultures. we also examined the effects of dx9065a on amidolytic activity of purified trypsin-like proteinases (gingipains rgpa and rgpb), from p. gingivalis and on trypsin-like activity in gingival crevicular fluids from patients with adult periodontitis. results: dx-9065a selectively inhibited the growth of p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, and its effect on p. gingivalis was bactericidal. trypsin-like proteinase activity was detected  in p. gingivalis, and the activity was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. dx-9065a even inhibited amidolytic activity of rgpa and rgpb from p. gingivalis. furthermore, trypsin-like proteinase activity in gingival crevicular fluids was strongly inhibited by dx-9065a. conclusions: dx-9065a inhibits p. gingivalis growth in part through to its ability to inhibit the trypsin-like proteinase activity in p. gingivalis and may be useful for a new drug for treatment of adult periodontitis.

TI  == analysis of the antibacterial activity and plaque control benefit of colgate total dentifrice via clinical evaluation and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == objective: this study analyzed, from a combined clinical and molecular biologic perspective, the antibacterial and antiplaque efficacy of colgate total dentifrice (ctd). methodology: a single-blind crossover study design utilized 11  healthy human subjects. after a one-week washout period, subjects donated dental  plaque, received a dental prophylaxis, and subsequently brushed with a test product. twenty-four hours postbrushing, dental plaque was collected and a clinical plaque score determined. dental plaque was submitted for real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) analysis. the same procedure was repeated in accordance with a crossover design for the use of the second test product. following a one-week washout, a plaque donation, prophylaxis, and brushing with the test product ensued for each subject. twenty-four hours post-brushing, the subjects returned for a plaque score and plaque donation. results: twenty-four hours after brushing, dental plaque coverage increased 17.88% +/- 8.27% with ctd, compared to 30.42% +/- 9.97% with colgate cavity protection (ccp; p = 0.005). real-time pcr found plaque collected 24 hours after  brushing with ctd exhibited, on average, fewer representative periodontal pathogens (fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, and porphyromonas gingivalis) and fewer early colonizers (actinomyces naeslundii) than plaque collected before brushing, whereas ccp showed a moderate effect on oral bacteria. conclusion: the study provides clinical and molecular biological evidence to substantiate the antibacterial and  plaque control benefits of colgate total, and suggests the value of combining a molecular biological method with clinical research to corroborate clinical benefits.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein vaccine reduces the alveolar bone loss induced by multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: heat shock protein (hsp) can be utilized as a vaccine to cross-protect against multiple pathogenic species. the present study was performed to evaluate porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) as a vaccine candidate to inhibit multiple bacteria-induced alveolar bone loss. material and methods: recombinant p. gingivalis hsp60 was produced and purified from p. gingivalis groel gene. rats were immunized with p. gingivalis hsp60, and  experimental alveolar bone loss was induced by infection with multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria. results: there was a very strong inverse relationship between postimmune anti-p. gingivalis hsp immunoglobulin g (igg) levels and the amount of alveolar bone loss induced by either p. gingivalis or multiple bacterial infection (p=0.007). polymerase chain reaction data indicated  that the vaccine successfully eradicated the multiple pathogenic species. conclusions: we concluded that p. gingivalis hsp60 could potentially be developed as a vaccine to inhibit periodontal disease induced by multiple pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == differential induction of human beta-defensin expression by periodontal commensals and pathogens in periodontal pocket epithelial cells.
AB  == background: to investigate the possible role of beta-defensins in gingival health and periodontal disease, we examined the effect of several stimuli on the expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), human beta-defensin-1, -2, -3, and -4 (hbd) in primary human diseased gingival epithelial (hge) cell cultures from periodontitis patients by quantitative taqman reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rt-pcr). methods: several strains of the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were added to the cells, as well as the oral commensal bacteria fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli. the induction by the proinflammatory stimuli phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) was also tested. results: in addition to the published observations (pma induces hbd-2 and -4; tnf-alpha induces hbd-2 and -3), it was found that pma can upregulate hbd-1 and hbd-3, whereas tnf-alpha can induce hbd-4. the commensal bacteria were significant inducers of hbd-2, hbd-3, and il-8. the pathogen p. gingivalis induced hbd-1 and hbd-3 at different time points than the commensals,  but no induction of il-8 and hbd-2 could be observed. these data fit with the chemokine paralysis theory. a correlation was found between the pathogenicity of  different serotypes of a. actinomycetemcomitans and the induction profiles of defensins and il-8. conclusion: the results suggest that a correlation can be found in diseased oral epithelium between the defensin profiles that are induced  and the pathogenicity of the oral bacterial strains.

TI  == the effects of intra-amniotic injection of periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides in sheep.
AB  == objective: periodontal disease may cause several complications of pregnancy, including fetal death. the purpose of this study was to investigate in sheep the  effects of the intra-amniotic injection of lipopolysaccharide from 3 periodontopathic organisms and to compare these effects with those resulting from similar injection of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. the outcomes that were  studied included the rates of fetal death and the features of inflammation and lung maturation in survivors. study design: at 118 days of pregnancy, ewes that were bearing single fetuses were allocated at random to receive intra-amniotic injections of saline solution (n = 13 fetuses), or lipopolysaccharide from porphyromonas gingivalis (in doses from 0.1 to 10 mg [n = 22 fetuses]), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 6 fetuses]), fusobacterium nucleatum (10 mg [n = 6 fetuses]) or escherichia coli (10 mg [n = 14 fetuses]; 1 mg [n = 7 fetuses]). surviving fetuses were delivered  abdominally at 125 days of gestation (term, 150 days). results: when compared with escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide at similar dosages, periodontopathic lipopolysaccharides had high rates of fetal lethality. only 6 of 22 fetuses that  were exposed to intra-amniotic porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide survived doses of 0.1 to 10 mg, and only 3 of 6 fetuses survived 10-mg actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide. escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide did not cause fetal loss when given at doses of 10 mg (n = 14  fetuses) or 1 mg (n = 7 fetuses). fetuses that survived exposure to these lipopolysaccharides showed features of inflammation in amniotic fluid and cord blood at birth and enhanced lung maturation. conclusion: lipopolysaccharides from these 3 periodontopathic organisms have much higher rates of fetal lethality than escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide but can cause similar intrauterine inflammatory responses and improvements in lung volumes in survivors. sources of  inflammation that are distant from the uterus may underlie a proportion of unexplained stillbirth and other complications of pregnancy.

TI  == antimicrobial profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in the netherlands and spain.
AB  == background and aim: antimicrobial resistance of periodontal pathogens towards currently used antibiotics in periodontics has been investigated in a previous study. microbial resistance in the periodontal microflora was more frequently observed in spanish patients in comparison with dutch patients. the aim of the present study was to compare antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of five periodontal bacteria isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples from adult patients with periodontitis were collected and cultured on selective and non-selective plates. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and micromonas micros were isolated and used for minimal inhibitory concentration tests using the epsilometer (e-test) technique. eight different antibiotics were tested on all bacterial isolates. mic50 and mic90 values for each antibiotic and each species were determined and the percentage of resistant strains was calculated. results:  significantly higher mic values were noted in spanish strains of f. nucleatum for penicillin, ciprofloxacin, of p. intermedia for penicillin, amoxicillin and tetracycline, of m. micros for tetracycline, amoxicillin and azithromycin, and of p. gingivalis for tetracycline and ciprofloxacin. based on breakpoint concentrations, a higher number of resistant strains in spain were found in f. nucleatum for penicillin, amoxicillin and metronidazole, in prevotella intermedia for tetracycline and amoxicillin, and in a. actinomycetemcomitans for amoxicillin and azithromycin. resistance of p. gingivalis strains was not observed for any of the antibiotics tested both in spain and the netherlands. conclusions: differences exist in the susceptibility profiles of periodontal pathogens isolated from periodontitis patients in spain and in the netherlands. this implicates that antibiotic susceptibility testing is necessary to determine efficacy of antimicrobial agents. also, clinical studies with antibiotics should  take these differences into account. the information from the present study indicates that it may not be possible to develop uniform protocols for usage of antibiotics in the treatment of severe periodontitis in the european union.

TI  == an antibacterial surface on dental implants, based on the photocatalytic bactericidal effect.
AB  == background: it is well known that the moderately roughened surfaces of dental implants enhance direct bone-implant contact. however, rough implant surfaces, as compared to smooth surfaces, are thought to pose a higher risk of bacterial infection when exposed to the oral cavity. purpose: this study was focused on evaluating the photocatalytic bactericidal effects of anatase titanium dioxide (tio(2)) on gram-negative anaerobic bacteria known to be associated with periimplantitis. materials and methods: a film of photocatalytic anatase tio(2) was added onto the surface of commercially pure titanium disks by plasma source ion implantation (psii) followed by annealing. the photocatalytic properties of the film were confirmed by the degradation of methylene blue. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum cells were incubated anaerobically and seeded on the disk. the disks were then exposed to ultraviolet  a (uva) illumination from black light in an anaerobic environment. after illumination, the number of viable cells was counted in terms of colony-forming units. results: the anatase tio(2) film added by the psii method and annealing exhibited a strong photocatalytic reaction under uva illumination. the viability  of both types of bacteria on the photocatalytic tio(2) film was suppressed to less than 1% under uva illumination within 120 minutes. conclusion: the bactericidal effect of the tio(2) photocatalyst is of great use for sterilizing the contaminated surface of dental implants.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a chilean population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (agp). other periodontopathic bacteria such as  porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. the aim of  the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in chilean patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (cp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each  patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (rtf) and cultured. periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. the identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (pcr). results: agp showed a significatively higher prevalence of c. rectus than cp (p = 0.036). the only statistical difference found was for c. rectus. patients with agp showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. a similar prevalence in both groups  of patients was observed for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia/nigrescens, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in agp than cp patients. in localized agp, p. intermedia/nigrescens, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and p. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized agp patients who harbored a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. conclusions: c. rectus, p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, p. micros, and capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of agp in this chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between agp and cp was for c. rectus, suggesting that the differences  in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. in this study, the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == comparison of culture and real-time pcr for detection and quantification of five  putative periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == objectives: bacterial cultivation is a well-established method for analyzing plaque samples. real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) is a novel rapid method for the identification and quantification of periodontopathogenic bacteria that has been recently introduced. in this study, we compared real-time pcr with conventional anaerobic cultivation. method: a total of 78 subgingival plaque samples were harvested from pockets > or =5 mm in 22 patients with advanced chronic periodontitis and immediately transferred into transport medium. aliquots were evaluated with species-specific probes by real-time pcr (meridol perio diagnostics, gaba) and anaerobic bacteria culture on selective media for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythensis. the  analysis was performed by two separate, blinded examiners. results: when real-time pcr was compared with the culture method (golden standard) for the detection of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria, the sensitivity and specificity for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 67% and 100%, respectively (kappa:  0.79); for f. nucleatum 73% and 53%, respectively (kappa: 0.21); for p. gingivalis 94% and 84%, respectively (kappa: 0.77); for p. intermedia 33% and 94%, respectively (kappa: 0.26) and for t. forsythensis 92% and 56%, respectively (kappa: 0.51). spearman's correlation coefficients for the quantitative results of both methods were 0.82 for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 0.33 for f. nucleatum, 0.83 for p. gingivalis, 0.38 for p. intermedia and 0.67 for t. forsythensis. conclusion: overall, the agreement between both test methods was excellent for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis, fair for t. forsythensis and poor for f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the discrepancies in the results may be explained by the inability of cultivation methods to distinguish between close related taxa, and the problems of keeping periopathogenic bacteria viable, which is required for standard cultivation.

TI  == treponema medium glycoconjugate inhibits activation of human gingival fibroblasts stimulated with phenol-water extracts of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == oral treponemes are well-known as causative agents of periodontal diseases; however, the details have not been fully clarified. here, we examined the effects of treponema medium glycoconjugate on the activation of human gingival fibroblasts using phenol-water extracts from porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the phenol-water extracts activated human gingival fibroblasts to mediate il-8 production, as well as il-8 mrna expression, phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. t. medium glycoconjugate exhibited no activation of human gingival fibroblasts, while phenol-water extract-induced activation of human gingival fibroblasts was clearly inhibited by t. medium glycoconjugate. furthermore, binding of biotinylated phenol-water extracts to cd14 in the presence of lps-binding protein was blocked with t. medium glycoconjugate. these results suggest that t. medium glycoconjugate has an inhibitory effect on host cell activation by periodontopathic bacteria caused by  binding to cd14- and lps-binding protein.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == antiproliferative activity of actinobacillus (haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans  and fusobacterium nucleatum in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == several studies indicate actinobacillus (haemophilus) actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum as etiologic agents of periodontal disease. immunosuppressive factors produced by microorganisms probably contribute to the initiation and evolution of this disease. this study evaluated the antiproliferative activity of ammonium precipitate fractions of a. (h.) actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum isolates from humans and marmosets both with and without periodontal disease. all a. (h.) actinomycetemcomitans and most  f. nucleatum strains inhibited pbmc proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. the degree of cell proliferative inhibition of each bacterial species differed among  the strains and was independent of host clinical status. the in vitro inhibition  of stimulated lymphocyte proliferation induced by different a. (h.) actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum isolates demonstrated the importance of this phenomenon in bacterial virulence, playing a possible suppressor role in host defense mechanisms in vivo. moreover, our findings pointed out a marked difference between a. (h.) actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cytoplasmic extracts in their antiproliferative activity, regarding the antigen concentration required for maximum inhibition and their vulnerability to heating and proteolytic treatment.

AB  == objective: a possible relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular disease has been suggested. the aims of this controlled clinical study were: (i)  to ascertain the presence of periodontal bacteria dna [actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus)]  in carotid atheromatous plaques and (ii) to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna, if any, in periodontal pockets and in carotid  atheroma in the same patient. methods: a total of 52 patients scheduled for carotid endarderectomy were enrolled in this study. the test group consisted of 26 dentate patients; the control group included 26 edentulous patients. a complete periodontal examination, including radiographic orthopanoramic and subgingival plaque sample, was performed in the test population. oral and x-ray examinations were performed in the control group. atheromatous plaques were harvested during surgical procedure for each dentate and edentulous patient and then sent to the microbiological laboratory. subgingival plaque samples and carotid specimens were examined using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique by means of specific primers for periodontal bacteria. amplification of extracted dna was tested using human beta-globin specific-primers. results: out of 52 endarterectomy samples, 12 (seven dentate, five edentulous patients) were excluded as negative to dna amplification. in subgingival plaque samples of 19 test patients, t. forsythensis (79%), f. nucleatum (63%), p. intermedia (53%), p. gingivalis (37%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (5%) were found. no periodontal bacteria dna was detected by pcr in any of the carotid samples in either patient  group. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in atheromatous plaques could not be confirmed by this study and thus no correlation could be established between species associated with periodontal disease and putative bacteria contributing to atheromatous plaques.

TI  == in situ biofilm formation by multi-species oral bacteria under flowing and anaerobic conditions.
AB  == an understanding of biofilm behavior of periodontopathic bacteria is key to the development of effective oral therapies. we hypothesized that interspecies bacterial aggregates play an important role in anaerobic biofilm establishment and proliferation, and contribute to the survivability of the biofilm against therapeutic agents. the system developed in this study assessed a multi-species (streptococcus gordonii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) biofilm formation under anaerobic and flowing conditions with the use  of an in situ image analysis system. the biofilm was comprised of a base film of  non-aggregated cells and complex interspecies aggregates that formed in the planktonic phase which rapidly colonized the surface, reaching 58 +/- 9% and 65 +/- 11.8% coverage by 5 and 24 hrs, respectively. upon sds (0.1%) treatment of a  24-hour biofilm, substantial detachment (55 +/- 14%, p < 0.05) of the aggregates  was observed, while the base film bacteria remained attached but non-viable. rapid re-establishment of the biofilm occurred via attachment of viable planktonic aggregates.

TI  == effect of supragingival plaque control on subgingival microflora and gingivo-periodontal tissues.
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a short term evaluation of the effect of supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microflora and gingivoperiodontal tissues in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis. a total of 92 sites from 23 patients were studied; patients ranged between 35 and 60 years of age (x  46.4 +/- 1.71). plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi), bleeding on probing (bp), probing depth (pd), and attachment level (al) were measured. subgingival microflora of the same sites was studied by dark field microscopy, and cultures in non-selective and selective media for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (pi/n), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and  fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). the patients were included in a supragingival plaque control program which included oral hygiene training and assessment, and professional control of supragingival plaque and calculus. after 28 days, measurement of clinical parameters and the microbiological study were repeated. the sites were divided according to baseline pd values into: group 1 (5 mm), group 2 (6 mm) and group 3 (> or = 7 mm). results revealed a significant reduction in pi scores, gi scores, pb and pd in groups 2 and 3. no significant difference in al was observed in any of the three groups. pi scores were found to decrease significantly in group 1, and gi scores, bp and pd tended to decrease. a significant increase in coccoid cells and a significant decrease in motile rods and spirochetes, both small and total, was observed in groups 2 and 3. group 1 showed a significant decrease in medium and total spirochetes. at the end of the  study, a significant decrease in pi/n was found in all three groups. significant  decreases were found in pg and fn in groups 3 and 2 respectively. although it holds true that supragingival plaque control reduced a potentially pathogenic subgingival microbiota, this effect was not sufficient to be compatible with healthy gingivoperiodontal tissues.

TI  == microbiologic diagnostics at titanium implants.
AB  == background: the microbiota found at periimplant lesions have been shown to contain putative periodontal pathogens as well as opportunistic species such as staphylococcus spp, enterics, and candida spp. therefore, a microbiologic diagnosis may be of value as guidance before treatment of such lesions. purpose:  the aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of some putative pathogens associated with long-term followed-up cases using two different microbiologic procedures. materials and methods: fifteen subjects contributed with plaque samples from teeth and implants; these were analyzed with respect to 18 putative  periimplant pathogens using cultural methods and a deoxyribonucleic acid dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: the number of individuals positive for the analyzed pathogens was similar in samples taken from teeth and implants when analyzed with the dna-dna hybridization technique. when comparing detection frequency by culture procedure and by "checkerboard" technique at implants, the number of individuals positive for these species was lower with the traditional culture technique than with the checkerboard analyses. using a higher cutoff point (> or = 4) with the checkerboard technique, the number of positive individuals was generally lower than that found with the culture technique. when  comparing the techniques on an implant site level, the prevalence obtained by culture was lower for all analyzed species. if the specific species were present  in the samples analyzed by the checkerboard technique, they were present only in  every second sample analyzed with the culture technique. the high specificity values showed that if the checkerboard technique did not detect any porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, or fusobacterium nucleatum, the bacteria were also undetectable by the culture technique. the two methods therefore did not overlap but did supplement each other. conclusions: based on the current results it is recommended that the technique used when analyzing microbiota around titanium implants should be a combination of the two protocols mentioned as they seem to give the most comprehensive outcome when used together.

TI  == induction of calprotectin release by porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide  in human neutrophils.
AB  == calprotectin, a major cytosolic protein of leukocytes, is detected in neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and epithelial cells. this protein is known to be a marker for several inflammatory diseases and is detected in inflammatory  gingival tissue with periodontal disease. recently, we found that the calprotectin level in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontitis patients was significantly higher than that of healthy subjects. however, the regulation of calprotectin in periodontal disease is unclear. in the present study, we investigated the effect of lipopolysaccharides of periodontopathic bacteria on calprotectin release from human neutrophils. neutrophils from healthy donors were treated with lipopolysaccharides from porphyromonas gingivalis (p-lps), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and escherichia coli. calprotectin of neutrophil was identified by immunoblotting and calprotectin amount was determined by elisa. two subunits (10  and 14 kda) of calprotectin were observed in the cell and medium fractions from neutrophils. p-lps increased calprotectin release from seven to 16 times the control level after 30 min and its effect appeared in a dose-dependent manner (10-1000 ng/ml). lipopolysaccharides from a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced calprotectin release from neutrophils. these results suggest that lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria induce calprotectin release from human neutrophils.

TI  == detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries by laser fluorescence.
AB  == objectives: detection of subgingival calculus and dentine caries in the bottom of deep periodontal pockets is often difficult without visual observation. we thus examined the possibility of its detection using autofluorescence induced by laser irritation. methods: autofluorescence was measured at various excitation and emission wavelength settings in five specimens each of sound dentine and enamel,  subgingival calculus, and root caries. periodontopathic model teeth with bacterial cells and blood clots were also irritated by laser to obtain autofluorescent images. results: subgingival calculus and dentine caries showed a characteristic 700 nm emission when excited at 635 nm or a 720 nm emission when excited at 655 nm; sound dentine or enamel, however, did not. the calculus differentiation power, however, was higher with excitation at 635 nm than at 655  nm. the autofluorescent images photographed at an excitation of 633 nm provided clear calculus identification in periodontopathic model teeth when a 700 nm band-pass filter or a 700 nm high-pass filter was used. however, fluorescence intensity was masked when the calculus surface was covered by bacterial cells or  blood clots. for clinical use, it would be important to remove subgingival plaque and debris from root surfaces before attempting to detect subgingival calculus and root caries with this manner. conclusion: the autofluorescence method employing excitation of 633-635 nm was found to be a powerful tool for detecting  subgingival calculus and root caries.

TI  == a comparison of the antibacterial efficacies of essential oils against oral pathogens.
AB  == cariogenic bacteria and periodontopathic bacteria are present in dental plaque as biofilms. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial effects of essential oils on the following oral bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus. we tested manuka oil, tea tree oil, eucalyptus oil, lavandula oil, and romarinus oil and determined their minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. the essential oils inhibited the growth of the bacteria tested, manuka oil being the most effective. minimum bactericidal concentration values showed that lavandula oil acts bacteriostatically, and the remaining oils, bactericidally. periodontopathic bacterial strains tested were killed completely by exposure for 30 s to 0.2% manuka oil, tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil. tea tree oil and manuka oil showed significant adhesion-inhibiting activity against p. gingivalis. all the essential oils tested inhibited the adhesion of s. mutans. this study showed that, among the essential oils tested, manuka oil and tea tree oil in particular had strong antibacterial activity against periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria. from the viewpoint of safety, we also examined the effects of these essential oils on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that, at a concentration of 0.2%, they had little effect on cultured cells.

TI  == intracellular production and extracellular release of oxygen radicals by pmns and oxidative stress on pmns during phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == in this study we investigated intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) during the phagocytosis of periodontopathic bacteria. in in vitro assays, bacteria of the species porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum were phagocytosed at 37 degrees c for 4 h by purified peripheral human  pmns from healthy subjects (n = 6). superoxide production during phagocytosis was determined by flow cytometry and with a fluorescence/luminescence microplate reader. after phagocytosis, oxidative stress was determined by flow cytometry. both the intracellular and extracellular oxygen radical production by pmns phagocytosing f. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of pmns phagocytosing p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans ( p < 0.01 by the mann-whitney test). moreover, after 4 h of incubation, the oxidative stress of pmns phagocytosing f. nucleatum was significantly greater than that of pmns phagocytosing p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. we conclude that a high level of superoxide production by pmns may damage not only periodontopathic bacteria but also pmns themselves, and may be correlated with the destruction of  periodontal tissue.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == lethal photosensitization of periodontal pathogens by a red-filtered xenon lamp in vitro.
AB  == background: the ability of helium-neon (he-ne) laser irradiation of a photosensitizer to induce localized phototoxic effects that kill periodontal pathogens is well documented and is termed photodynamic therapy (pdt). objectives: we investigated the potential of a conventional light source (red-filtered xenon lamp) to activate toluidine blue o (tbo) in vitro and determined in vitro model parameters that may be used in future in vivo trials. materials and methods: porphyromonas gingivalis 381 was used as the primary test  bacterium. results: treatment with a 2.2 j/cm2 light dose and 50 micro g/ml tbo concentration resulted in a bacterial kill of 2.43 +/- 0.39 logs with the he-ne laser control and 3.34 +/- 0.24 logs with the lamp, a near 10-fold increase (p =  0.028). increases in light intensity produced significantly higher killing (p = 0.012) that plateaued at 25 mw/cm2. there was a linear relationship between light dose and bacterial killing (r2 = 0.916); as light dose was increased bacterial survival decreased. no such relationship was found for the drug concentrations tested. addition of serum or blood at 50% v/v to the p. gingivalis suspension prior to irradiation diminished killing from approximately 5 logs to 3 logs at 10 j/cm2. when serum was washed off, killing returned to 5 logs for all species tested except bacteroides forsythus (3.92 +/- 0.68 logs kill). conclusions: the data indicate that pdt utilizing a conventional light source is at least as effective as laser-induced treatment in vitro. furthermore, pdt achieves significant bactericidal activity in the presence of serum and blood when used with the set parameters of 10 j/cm2, 100 mw/cm2 and 12.5 micro g/ml tbo.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

AB  == purified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lipopolysaccharide (lps) was found to be able to bind fusobacterium nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of f. nucleatum to a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b. sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lps to the f. nucleatum lectin are the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4, and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 6 of d-galactose, indicating that the beta-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine in the serotype b lps trisaccharide repeating unit  is the monosaccharide residue recognized by the f. nucleatum lectin. these data strongly suggest that a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lps is one of the receptors responsible for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation of a. actinomycetemcomitans to fusobacteria.

TI  == ovine periodontitis as a potential model for periodontal studies. cross-sectional analysis of clinical, microbiological, and serum immunological parameters.
AB  == objectives: : to investigate infection and host immunity patterns in sheep with naturally occurring "broken-mouth" periodontitis. materials and methods: : eight  periodontally healthy (hs) and eight periodontally diseased ewes (pds) were selected. subgingival plaque and sera were collected and examined for evidence of human periodontitis-associated pathogens. serum igg titers were measured by elisa to multiple strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, dichelobacter nodosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as well as several purified antigens (cysteine proteases, lps, k, and fimbriae). results: : neither the organism aa nor antigens to aa were found in any animal. most animals were positive for pg, bf, and pi, but dna probes detected no difference between hs and pds relative to  amounts of pathogens in subgingival plaque. pds had significantly higher serum igg titers to all pg strains, to 50% of bf strains, to the pi and fn strains, and to fimbriae and the two cysteine proteases (p-values ranging from 0.05 to 0.001). regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between number of teeth lost and serum igg antibody titers to whole-cell sonicate antigens of p. gingivalis strains (p<0.01) and body weight (p<0.01). conclusions: : the presence of pathogens associated with periodontitis was reflected in differences in serum  igg titers between healthy and diseased sheep. this may have influenced animal body weight and might have systemic health and economic consequences. the data suggest that susceptible and non-susceptible sheep can be identified for periodontal research.

AB  == epileptic patients taking phenytoin with gingival-overgrowth and those without gingival-overgrowth were compared for daily drug dose, plasma total phenytoin concentration, plasma free-phenytoin concentration and serum igg antibody titre against 13 periodontal bacteria. significantly higher daily drug dose was noted in patients with gingival overgrowth (p < 0.05) when compared with those without  overgrowth. in addition, both total and free forms of plasma phenytoin concentration were significantly higher in sera of patients with gingival growth  than of those without overgrowth (p < 0.01). strong positive correlation was found between daily drug dose and serum phenytoin concentration in patients with  gingival overgrowth, while weak correlation was found in patients without gingival overgrowth, suggesting a difference in drug metabolism in these two groups. however, no differences were found in serum igg antibody titres to 13 periodontal bacteria examined between two groups. these results suggest that metabolic ability of phenytoin is one of the factors for developing gingival overgrowth, and that periodontal infection may not be a primary causative factor  for gingival overgrowth but act as an additive factor which increase tissue mass  for this unwanted side effect.

AB  == we sought to determine (i) the association of subgingival bacterial profiles to clinical periodontal status in a population with limited access to dental care in thailand, and (ii) the external validity of our earlier findings from a similar study in rural china. we examined 356 subjects, 30-39 yr old and 50-59 yr old, with respect to clinical periodontal status and subgingival plaque at maximally 14 sites per subject. checkerboard hybridizations were used to analyse a total of 4343 samples. the prevalence of the 27 species investigated ranged between 87.2%  and 100%. discriminant analysis based on microbial profiles classified correctly  67.5% of all deep (> or = 5 mm) and 64.2% of all shallow sites, and 67.4% of all  subjects with and 69.3% of all subjects without > or = 3 deep pockets. high colonization by 'red complex' bacteria was four times as likely (95% confidence limits (cl) 2.5-6.6) in subjects with > or = 10 sites with attachment loss of > or = 5 mm, and 4.3 times as likely (95% cl 2.6-7.1) in subjects with > or = 30 such sites. the data confirmed (i) the ubiquitous prevalence of the bacteria investigated in subjects with no regular access to dental care; and (ii) the high odds for periodontal pathology conferred by increased levels of specific periodontal bacteria.

AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to examine the outer-surface microbiota  of the prosthetic connector of frialit-2 implants, and to compare the microbial findings with the peri-implant parameters 2 years after functional loading. in 16 implant-treated patients (55.8 +/- 9.5 years) the outer-surface micro-organisms of the prosthetic connectors were determined in 32 frialit-2 implants. the functional loading time of the prosthetic suprastructures was 24.1 +/- 13.8 months on average. after removal of the implant-supported restoration, microbial  samples were obtained from the outer-surfaces of the frialit-2 prosthetic connector. the microbial plaque samples were specified on cdc-blood agar as percentages of the total cultivable flora. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was semiquantitively determined on tsbv-agar in cfu/ml. the microbial plaque samples were dominated by actinomyces israelii (68.8%), eubacterium lentum (56.3%) and veillonella parvula (43.8%) with proportions ranking between 3.9% (v. parvula) and 11.1% (a. israelii). the most frequently detected gram-negative microorganisms were fusobacterium nucleatum (87.5%), porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3%), and peptostreptococcus micros (68.8%) with enhanced proportions for p. gingivalis (11.4%) and p. micros (11.4%). no statistical significant correlation  could be established between the microbiota present on the outer-surfaces of the  f2-connector and the peri-implant parameters examined. the outer-surface microflora recovered from the implanto-prosthetic-connector of frialit-2 implants reveals a colonization with gram-positive bacteria and potentially harmful gram-negative micro-organisms that were frequently detected, but present at low levels. after 2 years of restorative loading, the outer-surface microbial colonization is compatible with peri-implant soft tissue health.

TI  == isotypic antibody response to plaque anaerobes in periodontal disease.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that locally produced immunoglobulin (ig)a could be more protective than igg and that there could be a relationship between  crevicular fluid-specific iga levels and the onset of periodontal disease. this study was designed to investigate this hypothesis regarding specific immune responses towards 4 plaque anaerobes in gingival crevicular fluid and saliva from patients with periodontopathies and controls. methods: gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) and whole saliva were collected from 35 adults with periodontitis and 24 periodontally healthy adults (controls). antigens were extracted from actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum and used to set up specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) tests to assess iga and igg levels to these microorganisms in the fluids collected. results: the crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients contained significantly higher levels of igg to the 4 microorganisms tested than  that of controls (p < 10(-6) for all comparisons). iga levels to the 4 bacteria were statistically significantly much higher in control crevicular fluid (p < 10(-7) for all comparisons). controls also had statistically significantly higher levels of specific salivary iga than patients (p < 0.02 for all comparisons). conclusions: these data support the potentially protective role of specific iga directed to oral microorganisms involved in the onset and development of periodontal disease.

TI  == igg subclass specific antibody response to periodontopathic organisms in hiv-positive patients.
AB  == background: we previously reported an increased rate of progression of periodontal disease over an 18-month period in human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-positive subjects compared to controls. the mechanism for disease progression and rapid tissue loss was unknown. data on the microbiological studies failed to show any significant difference in the microbial characteristics of the periodontal lesions in hiv-positive patients compared to hiv-negative controls. immunological analysis had identified neutrophils as an important component of the host defense against periodontal infection, especially against rapid tissue loss. serum igg reactivities to periodontal pathogens in hiv-positive patients with periodontitis were reduced. other data provided circumstantial evidence to suggest that igg subclass (igg2) specific antibody might assist bacterial clearing in periodontal infection. the aim of the current  study was to examine the specific igg subclass antibody response to a panel of periodontopathic organisms: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in hiv-positive patients compared to hiv-negative controls. methods: sera from 120 hiv-positive patients (40 periodontitis, 69 gingivitis, and 11 no oral diseases)  were tested for igg subclass specific antibody response to the above listed 6 organisms using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. data were compared with those  obtained from 40 hiv-negative control subjects (35 periodontitis, 2 gingivitis, and 3 no oral diseases). results: in the hiv-positive group, a consistently high  response rate was found in igg1 to all the bacteria tested. in addition, high levels of igg3 and igg4 to pg and igg1 and igg2 to pi were also present. however, no significant difference was detected among the periodontitis, gingivitis, and no oral disease subgroups. when the periodontitis patients from the hiv-positive  group were compared to the hiv-negative group, no difference in the antibody levels and response rates was noted. conclusion: we conclude that in hiv-positive patients, the specific igg subclass antibody response to periodontopathic organisms was similar to that of hiv-negative subjects.

AB  == background: in a previous study, we evaluated the in vivo effects of an nd:yag laser on periodontal disease by measuring crevicular interleukin (il)-1beta levels before and after laser application. it was found that laser therapy was less effective than traditional scaling and root planing. these results might be  due to incomplete removal of microbial residues and cementum-bound endotoxin on root surfaces by the laser. in this study, we explored the in vitro effectiveness of an nd:yag laser for the elimination of cementum-bound endotoxin by measuring il-1beta changes in stimulated monocytes. methods: fresh human monocytes were harvested from adults without periodontitis and grown in rpmi 1640 medium. diseased cementum particles were collected and prepared from teeth with untreated periodontitis and were irradiated with 5 levels of laser energy. cementum particles were subjected to endotoxin testing by a limulus amebocyte lysate (lal) assay and then were incubated with cultured monocytes. production of il-1beta in  stimulated monocytes was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantified by spectrophotometry. results: the endotoxin unit (eu) of diseased cementum was 18.4 eu/mg, which seemed to be remarkably lower than that of common  periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis (381) at 15,300 eu/mg/ml, prevotella intermedia (atcc 25611) at 227 eu/mg/ml, and fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 25586) at 1,987 eu/mg/ml. monocytes subjected to stimulation by diseased cementum particles without laser irradiation produced 124 to 145 pg/ml il-1beta, 9- to 18-fold higher than that of unstimulated monocytes (7.07 to 15.95 pg/ml). diseased cementum particles after irradiation with various energy levels  of the nd:yag laser could still stimulate monocytes to secrete 89 to 129 pg/ml il-1beta. no statistically significant difference was found in the production of  il-1beta induced by diseased-bound cementum with or without laser irradiation. conclusions: the nd:yag laser varying from 50 mj, 10 pps to 150 mj, 20 pps, for 2 minutes, did not seem to be effective in destroying diseased cementum endotoxin.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and other putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with and without periodontal destruction.
AB  == background and aims: bacteria play an essential role in the pathogenesis of destructive periodontal disease. it has been suggested that not all bacteria associated with periodontitis may be normal inhabitants of a periodontally healthy dentition. in particular, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans have been isolated infrequently from subjects without periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare prevalence and proportions of a number of periodontal bacteria in periodontitis patients and control subjects. material and methods: in all, 116 consecutive subjects diagnosed with moderate to severe periodontitis (mean age 42.4) and 94 subjects without radiographic evidence of alveolar bone loss (mean age 40.4) were recruited for the study. the gingival condition in the control group varied between gingival health and various degrees of gingivitis. in patients, the deepest pocket in each quadrant was selected for microbiological sampling. in control subjects all mesial and distal sites of all first molars were selected for sampling. all paper points from a patient were pooled and processed for anaerobic cultivation within 6 h after sampling. clinical variables of sampled sites included bleeding index, probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more often prevalent in patients than in controls. the highest odds ratios were found for p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (12.3 and 10.4 resp.). other odds ratios varied from 3.1 to 7.7 for a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros, respectively. absolute numbers of target bacteria were all higher in patients, but only the mean percentage of b. forsythus was significantly higher in patients in comparison to controls (p < 0.001). conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p.  gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, f. nucleatum and p. micros are all significant markers for destructive periodontal disease in adult subjects. based  on calculated odds ratios, b. forsythus and p. gingivalis are the strongest bacterial markers for this disease and are infrequently cultured from subjects without periodontal bone loss.

TI  == microbial profile on metallic and ceramic bracket materials.
AB  == the placement of orthodontic appliances creates a favorable environment for the accumulation of a microbiota and food residues, which, in time, may cause caries  or exacerbate any pre-existing periodontal disease. the purpose of the present study was to compare the total bacterial counts present on metallic and ceramic orthodontic brackets in order to clarify which bracket type has a higher plaque retaining capacity and to determine the levels of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp on both types of brackets. thirty-two metallic brackets and 24  ceramic brackets were collected from orthodontic patients at the day of debonding. two brackets were collected from each patient; one from a maxillary central incisor and another from a maxillary second premolar. sixteen patients who used metallic brackets and 12 patients who used ceramic brackets were sampled. bacterial populations were studied using "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization, which uses dna probes to identify species in complex microbial samples. the significance of differences between groups was determined using the  mann-whitney u-test. results showed no significant differences between metallic and ceramic brackets with respect to the caries-inducing s mutans and l acidophilus spp counts. mean counts of 8 of 35 additional species differed significantly between metallic and ceramic brackets with no obvious pattern favoring one bracket type over the other. this study showed higher mean counts of treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii, streptococcus anginosus, and eubacterium nodatum on metallic brackets while higher counts of eikenella corrodens, campylobacter showae, and selenomonas noxia were found on ceramic brackets.

TI  == contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens.
AB  == experimental studies have shown that intraoral transmission of bacteria can occur. of course, the question arises as to how this transmission may happen. in  this study, the contamination of interdental brushes by periodontopathogens is examined and compared to the microbial load of the periodontal pockets. in ten untreated chronic periodontitis patients, four interdental sites were professionally brushed with one interdental brush per patient. subsequently, samples from the depths of the pockets (of the specific interdental sites) were obtained with paper-points. the interdental brush samples and the samples of the  subgingival plaque, obtained by the pooled paper-points, were processed for dark-field microscopy examination as well as anaerobic culturing. the results showed that, although significant differences could be found between the brushes  and paper-points with direct microscopy, the culturing did not uncover many differences. on the contrary, the detection frequencies of specific bacterial species were almost the same between the two. the total anaerobic colony-forming  units (cfu), p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and e. corrodens found on the brushes showed a significant correlation with the subgingival plaque samples (p<0.005). these results suggest that, in untreated situations, interdental brushes are contaminated relatively easily by putative periodontopathogens in numbers comparable to their presence in periodontal pockets. this contamination could be  a factor in the intraoral spread of bacteria.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == parotid salivary s-iga antibodies during experimental gingivitis in smokers and non-smokers.
AB  == persons who smoke display a less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the  experimental gingivitis model as compared with non-smokers. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether this could partly be explained by differences in levels of parotid total secretory iga (s-iga) or parotid s-iga reactive with selected oral microorganisms. parotid saliva samples were obtained  from 11 smoking and 14 non-smoking volunteers, at baseline, after 5 and 14 days of full mouth experimental gingivitis. output levels of total s-iga and of specific s-iga reactive with cell extracts from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces naeslundii, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, peptostreptococcus micros, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans were determined in the samples by means of elisa. smokers and non-smokers were found to have similar output levels (microg/min) of total s-iga, and the values did not significantly change during the experimental gingivitis trial. parotid salivary outputs (units/min) of the bacteria-specific s-iga at baseline and at days 5 and 14, were not different between smokers and non-smokers; no changes were observed during the experimental gingivitis trial. the present observations indicate that total s-iga and bacteria-specific s-iga in saliva are not main factors that can explain the less pronounced increase of gingival bleeding in the experimental gingivitis model in smokers as compared with non-smokers.

TI  == treatment of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: conventional mechanical treatment of papillon-lefevre syndrome  periodontitis has a poor prognosis. this report describes an effective antimicrobial treatment of rapidly progressing periodontitis in an 11-year old girl having papillon-lefevre syndrome. method: clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification. presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus was determined by a nested-pcr detection method. therapy included scaling and root planing, oral hygiene instruction, and systemic amoxicillin-metronidazole therapy (250 mg of each/3 times daily/10 days) which, based on follow-up microbiological testing, was repeated after 4 months. supportive periodontal therapy took place at 2 visits during a 16-month period. results: at baseline, 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. at 16 months, probing and radiographic measurements revealed no teeth with additional attachment loss, and several teeth exhibited significant reduction in gingivitis and pocket depth, increase in radiographic alveolar bone height and clinical attachment level, and radiographic evidence of crestal lamina dura. baseline subgingival microbiota included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacteriumnucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros  (10.6%), as well as cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus. at termination of the study, culture and pcr examinations showed absence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. micros and herpesviruses, and p. nigrescens and f.nucleatum each comprised less than 0.1 % of subgingival isolates. conclusion: this study suggests that controlling the periodontopathic microbiota by appropriate antibiotic and conventional periodontal therapy can arrest papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of indigenous indians of central america.
AB  == objective: to define the subgingival microbial profiles of adult subjects from a  previously identified rural community of indigenous indians in guatemala, central america. materials and methods: a full-mouth periodontal examination was performed in 114 adult subjects from 45 families. plaque samples were collected from both deep and shallow periodontal pockets and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to identify 17 species previously associated with periodontitis or health. results: plaque deposits and gingivitis were universal and widespread, and periodontal pocketing > or =5 mm was highly prevalent (84% of subjects). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly more prevalent in shallow sites. at the subject level, actinomyces naeslundii and peptostreptococcus micros were significantly more prevalent in periodontally-healthy subjects. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any sample. conclusion: there was no association between periodontal disease status and presence of suspected periodontal pathogens. these latter results conflict somewhat with those from treated populations. however, in this population where extensive plaque deposits  and gingivitis are universal, the presence of putative pathogens may be more reflective of the local environment.

TI  == associations between serum antibody levels to periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == background: the role of antibodies to periodontal microorganisms in the development of periodontal tissue destruction is still unclear. the aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum levels of igg, iga, and igm antibodies to 6 periodontal microorganisms and clinical subtypes of varying severity of early-onset periodontitis (eop) in young african american adults. methods: the study group consisted of 159 african americans aged 19 to 25 years (mean 22 years) and included 97 cases with eop and 62 controls with no clinical signs of eop. these subjects were selected from a nationally representative sample of adolescents who received an oral examination as part of the national survey of oral health of united states children in 1986-1987. the group was examined clinically a second time 6 years later and blood samples were collected. serum levels of igg, iga, and igm reactive to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum were assessed. results: serum levels of igg and iga antibody reactive to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans and iga antibody to p. intermedia were significantly higher in generalized eop cases compared to healthy controls. igm antibody levels did not show any significant associations with eop for any of the 6 bacterial species tested. there were no significant differences in antibody levels between  controls and the 13 subjects in our study who were classified with localized eop. conclusions: the findings suggest that antibodies to p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of eop. substantial longitudinal studies that monitor antibody levels and avidity prior to disease onset, during progression, and following clinical intervention will be necessary to fully understand the role of this component of the immune response in protection versus tissue destruction and the  potential use in eop risk assessment and disease management.

TI  == lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga ochracea are antagonists for human toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) 2 and 4 have recently been identified as possible signal transducers for various bacterial ligands. to investigate the roles of tlrs in the recognition of periodontopathic bacteria by the innate immune system, a chinese hamster ovary (cho) nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab)-dependent reporter cell line, 7.7, which is defective in both tlr2- and tlr4-dependent signaling pathways was transfected with human cd14 and tlrs. when the transfectants were exposed to freeze-dried periodontopathic bacteria, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, and fusobacterium nucleatum, and a non-oral bacterium, escherichia coli, all species of the bacteria induced nf-kappab-dependent cd25 expression in  7.7/hutlr2 cells. although freeze-dried a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli also induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, freeze-dried p. gingivalis did not. similarly, lipopolysaccharides (lps) extracted from a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, and e. coli induced cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells, but lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea did not. furthermore, lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea attenuated cd25 expression in 7.7/hutlr4 cells induced by repurified lps from e. coli. lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea also inhibited the secretion of interleukin-6 (il-6) from u373 cells, the secretion of il-1beta from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and icam-1 expression in human gingival fibroblasts induced by repurified lps from e. coli. these findings indicated that lps from p. gingivalis and c. ochracea worked as antagonists for human tlr4. the antagonistic activity of lps from these periodontopathic bacteria may be associated with the etiology of periodontal diseases.

TI  == supragingival and subgingival microbiota of adult patients with down's syndrome.  changes after periodontal treatment.
AB  == in this longitudinal study, five adult down's syndrome patients with periodontitis were placed on a frequent recall visit schedule (every 6 weeks) after treatment, in order to investigate: 1) the microbiological status, both supragingivally and subgingivally, and the changes that occurred after treatment  and 2) the effect of frequent professional supragingival plaque control on the subgingival microbiota and clinical variables in these patients. the clinical variables recorded were probing pocket depth, probing attachment level, bleeding  on probing and presence of plaque (full mouth, six surfaces per tooth). microbiological examination was performed separately for supragingival and subgingival samples from the same site for 14 species, using whole genomic dna probes and the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique. the findings indicate that, although a reduction of periodontal indices was noticed, plaque levels remained high (60%) even at the end of the experimental period. periodontal pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently detected both supragingivally and subgingivally (>30%). the presence of a species supragingivally and the presence at the same time points subgingivally were correlated. this finding suggested that supragingival plaque acts as a reservoir  for reinfection of treated sites. a reduction of the percentages of detection of  these species was noticed 1 month after an oral hygiene period as well as at 3 and 6 months after treatment. inadequate oral hygiene as performed by these patients probably affected supragingival, and consequently subgingival, plaque composition.

TI  == intra- and interspecies regulation of gene expression by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans luxs.
AB  == the cell density-dependent control of gene expression is employed by many bacteria for regulating a variety of physiological functions, including the generation of bioluminescence, sporulation, formation of biofilms, and the expression of virulence factors. although periodontal organisms do not appear to  secrete acyl-homoserine lactone signals, several species, e.g., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum, have recently been shown to secrete a signal related to the autoinducer ii (ai-2) of the signal system 2 pathway in vibrio harveyi. here, we report that the periodontal pathogen actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans expresses a homolog of v. harveyi luxs and secretes an ai-2-like signal. cell-free conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from a recombinant escherichia coli strain (e. coli ais) expressing a. actinomycetemcomitans luxs induced luminescence in v. harveyi bb170 >200-fold over controls. ai-2 levels peaked in mid-exponential-phase cultures of  a. actinomycetemcomitans and were significantly reduced in late-log- and stationary-phase cultures. incubation of early-log-phase a. actinomycetemcomitans cells with conditioned medium from a. actinomycetemcomitans or from e. coli ais resulted in a threefold induction of leukotoxic activity and a concomitant increase in leukotoxin polypeptide. in contrast, no increase in leukotoxin expression occurred when cells were exposed to sterile medium or to conditioned broth from e. coli ais(-), a recombinant strain in which luxs was insertionally inactivated. a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 also induced expression of afua, encoding a periplasmic iron transport protein, approximately eightfold, suggesting that luxs-dependent signaling may play a role in the regulation of iron acquisition by a. actinomycetemcomitans. finally, a. actinomycetemcomitans ai-2 added in trans complemented a luxs knockout mutation in p. gingivalis by modulating the expression of the luxs-regulated genes uvrb and hasf in this organism. together, these results suggest that luxs-dependent signaling may modulate aspects of virulence and the uptake of iron by a. actinomycetemcomitans  and induce responses in other periodontal organisms in mixed-species oral biofilm.

TI  == absence of a specific subgingival microflora in adults with down's syndrome.
AB  == background: periodontal disease in down's syndrome (ds) is generally characterized by a high degree of bone loss. bone loss of 5 mm or more is observed in 70% of these subjects. among ds subjects, considerable differences in disease progression occur. so far, no studies have been conducted in which specific properties of the subgingival microflora have been related to the condition observed. aims: to investigate (1) the subgingival microflora in ds subjects and other mentally retarded (control) individuals which were matched to  the utmost and (2) to investigate the subgingival microflora of a "low-risk" and  a " high-risk" group formed in ds subjects. material and methods: 17 ds subjects  and 17 control subjects were matched with respect to age, plaque level and bleeding on probing. in addition, the ds group was divided in a "low-risk" group  (0-2 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=6) and a "high-risk"group (6-13 teeth lost due to periodontal disease n=11). prevalence and proportions of the putative periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus in the subgingival plaque were determined using anaerobic culture techniques. no differences in the prevalence of distinct suspected periodontopathic bacteria and bacterial subgingival composition between the ds group and the control group could be established. also no differences in the prevalence of the seven investigated microbial species between the "low-risk" and the "high-risk" group were observed. conclusions: because of the lack of differences in microflora between the ds group and the control group, a specific effect of the microbiological composition in the periodontal status of subjects with ds can be  excluded in this population. host factors constitute the more likely explanation  of the differences observed in ds.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

TI  == [clinical and microbiological study of adult periodontal disease].
AB  == the aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. a total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy  sites were selected according to clinical criteria. the following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. in disease sites the most frequently isolated were: prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). the aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes  26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. the presence of motile rods, spirochetes and p. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. there were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.

TI  == mutans streptococci in subgingival plaque of treated and untreated patients with  periodontitis.
AB  == background: the etiology of root caries is thought to be identical to coronal caries, though root caries seem to be more complicated because of the higher susceptibility of exposed roots (dentin) by periodontal therapy to demineralization than intact enamel. this implies that mutans streptococci are the most likely pathogens in the development of root caries. although it is known that both the numbers of mutans streptococci and the frequency of isolation in root caries lesions are negatively correlated with the distance from the gingival margin, the subgingival sulcus has not been considered a possible habitat for mutans streptococci. however, subgingival occurrence of mutans streptococci in both untreated and treated periodontal patients has not been documented well in the literature. objective: to investigate the presence and levels of mutans streptococci in the subgingival plaque of patients (n=154) in different stages of periodontal therapy. the subgingival sulcus may be a possible habitat for mutans  streptococci. this localisation of mutans streptococci may be of importance in the development of root caries after periodontal surgery. materials and methods:  in this cross-sectional study, subgingival plaque samples from 154 consecutive adult periodontitis patients were tested for presence and levels of mutans streptococci and putative periodontal pathogens by anaerobic cultures. these patients were divided into 4 groups based on their stage of periodontal treatment: (1) untreated patients; (2) patients after initial periodontal therapy only; (3) patients in the maintenance phase who not underwent periodontal surgery; (4) patients after periodontal surgery. results: the prevalence of mutans streptococci in the 4 study groups varied from 82% in untreated patients to 94% in maintenance patients. the mean proportion of mutans streptococci was 6.65% in maintenance patients versus 1.86% in untreated patients (p=0.005) and 2.51% in patients after scaling and root planing (p=0.041). conclusions: the subgingival area is a microbial habitat for mutans streptococci that may be of importance in the development of root caries in periodontitis patients.

TI  == untreated periodontal disease in indonesian adolescents. subgingival microbiota in relation to experienced progression of periodontitis.
AB  == background/aims: in an indonesian population deprived of regular dental care, the experienced progression of disease between baseline (1987) and follow-up (1994) was investigated in relation to the composition of the subgingival microbiota at  follow-up. at baseline the age ranged from 15 to 25 years. clinical and microbiological evaluation was completed in 158 of the 167 subjects available at  follow-up. methods: plaque index (pi), pocket depth (pd), bleeding on probing (bop), and attachment loss (al) were scored at the approximal surfaces of all teeth and subgingival calculus on the approximal surfaces of the ramfjord teeth only (number of sites with subgingival calculus: nsc). a pooled sample of the deepest pocket in each quadrant was evaluated using microbiological culture techniques. results: at baseline the mean values of the clinical parameters were  al=0.35 mm, pi=1.01, bop=0.80 pd=3.25 mm and nsc=6.04 and at follow-up al=0.75 mm, pi=1.16, bop=1.19, pd=3.34 mm and nsc=5.85. all parameters except pd and nsc  showed a statistically significant increase. at follow-up the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 40%, of porphyromonas gingivalis 67%, of prevotella intermedia 66%, of fusobacterium nucleatum 79%, of bacteroides forsythus 16%, of campylobacter rectus 4%, and of p. micros 6%. no differences in clinical parameters were found between groups with or without these micro-organisms. in 129 subjects al of > or =2 mm at > or =1 site was found. logistic regression showed three significant odds-ratio's for experienced progressive periodontitis: plaque index (12.2), gender (3.4) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (2.9). conclusions: the results of this retrospective study suggest that plaque is the most important parameter related to experienced disease progression, and that the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans may be associated with increased chance of disease progression.

TI  == smoking affects the subgingival microflora in periodontitis.
AB  == background: tobacco smoking has been identified as one major risk factor for destructive periodontal disease. scaling and root planing have been shown to be less effective in smokers with periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to compare the subgingival microbial flora of treated and untreated smokers and non-smokers. methods: four independent adult patient groups with periodontitis were included in this investigation: 88 untreated smokers (u-s); 90 untreated non-smokers (u-ns); 119 treated non-smokers (t-ns); and 171 treated smokers (t-s). clinical variables included cumulative plaque index (cpi), probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), cumulative bleeding index (cbi), and cumulative suppuration index (csi). paper point samples from the deepest bleeding pocket in each quadrant of the dentition were analyzed for the presence and levels of 6 periodontal bacterial pathogens using anaerobic culture techniques. results: u-s showed a higher mean cumulative plaque index than u-ns (3.5 versus 2.7). mean pd and mean cal were higher in the t-s in comparison to the t-ns group (7.0 versus 6.6 mm and 5.6 versus 4.7 mm, respectively). microbiological characteristics of u-s were a higher prevalence of prevotella intermedia/nigrescens and higher mean levels of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn). t-s patients were characterized by higher prevalence of bacteroides forsythus (bf), pm, and campylobacter rectus (cr) and higher mean levels of pm and fn. the mean percentage of b. forsythus tended to be higher in the t-s group than in the t-ns group (6.9% versus 5.6%). the relative risk to be infected with bf, pm, and cr was statistically higher in smokers (odds ratios: 1.9, 1.9, and 1.6, respectively). the chance to find > or =10% of bf, pm, and/or fn was 3.3 higher in smokers when a. actinomycetemcomitans and p gingivalis were absent. detection of > or =20% pm/fn in treated patients was strongly associated with smoking (odds ratio 13.8, p= 0.002). conclusions: smoking is a determining factor for the composition of the subgingival microflora in adult patients with periodontitis and may select for a specific cluster of periodontal pathogens, notably bf, pm, fn, and cr. on the basis of these observations, smoking, among other criteria, may be one parameter to use in deciding to treat refractory periodontitis in smokers with a systemic antibiotic  therapy directed against smoking-associated periodontal bacteria.

TI  == heterogeneity of host immunological risk factors in patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the pathogenesis of early-onset periodontitis (eop) can be explained  by various host risk factors. previous studies have focused on a single (among many possible) immunological risk factor and the association among the factors has not been assessed. we comprehensively investigated the associations among multiple host immunological risk factors in eop patients to further elucidate their role in the pathogenesis of eop. methods: sixty-eight eop patients (50 generalized eop, 18 localized eop), 51 eop-suspected patients (s-eop), 43 adult periodontitis (ap) patients, and 36 periodontally healthy subjects (hs) participated in this cross-sectional study. we examined peripheral neutrophil functions, phenotypic and functional characterization of peripheral lymphocytes (lymphocyte subsets, t-cell proliferative activity), cytokine productivity (interleukin [il]-1, il-2, tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha, interferon [ifn]-gamma, il-4 and il-6), serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody titers against 12 periodontal bacteria, and hla class ii genotypes. results: g-eop, s-eop, and ap patient groups showed significantly lower percentages of pan t cells and cd8-positive cells (p < 0.02) compared with the hs group. l-eop patients showed depressed il-4 and tnf-alpha productivity compared with the hs group (p < 0.02).  the eop group showed significantly elevated antibody levels against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and fusobacterium nucleatum compared with the hs group (p < 0.05). the frequency with dqb1*0503 was significantly higher in the eop patient group than the hs group (p = 0.045) due to the higher frequency in l-eop patients than the hs group (p = 0.035). there were wide interindividual variations in each of the tests among patient and hs groups; however, eop patients showed wider intradiagnostic group variations in certain host defensive cell functions than the other groups. there were some eop patients who showed extremely low or high values in some tests; the eop patients could be further divided into subgroups according to their host defensive and immunological profiles. however, there was  heterogeneity in some of the other host immunological tests even in the subgroups. conclusions: the association of host immunological risk factors in eop patients is widely varied and more complex than previously thought. these results indicate the difficulty of explaining the pathogenesis of eop based on a single host risk factor and also emphasize the importance of critical assessment of not  only eop patient groups, but also individual patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == [bacterial virulence in the etiology of periodontal diseases].
AB  == strong relationships have been very often described between various form of periodontal disease (pd) and certain bacterial species, so that nowadays periodontal disease is recognized as an infectious disease. destruction of periodontal supporting tissues happens as a response to very intricate host-parasite interactions. when the clinician will be able to fully understand and identify such phenomena it would be possible to succeed in a properly diagnosis and control of the active phase of periodontal disease. the first step  in such a direction would be to analyze the common characteristic of some bacterial species, the so called suspected periodontopathogens. such species namely gram-negative, associated with the outbreak of periodontal disease have in common the capacity to disrupt the integrity of the host defences by means of the so called virulence factors. these factors may enhance the bacterial colonization or may interfere with the host response that ultimately results in periodontal support breakdown. the present review focuses on the virulence factors of the main suspected periodontopathogens evaluating the effects on the host immune response and directly on the periodontal tissues.

TI  == effect of lipopolysaccharide from periodontal pathogens on the production of tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 by human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == both tissue plasminogen activator (t-pa) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 2 (pai-2) are important proteolysis factors present in inflamed human periodontal tissues. the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of lipopolysaccharide (lps) on the synthesis of t-pa and pai-2 by human gingival fibroblasts (hgf). lps from different periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium  nucleatum were extracted by the hot phenol water method. the levels of t-pa and pai-2 secreted into the cell culture media were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa). the mrna for t-pa and pai-2 were measured by rt-pcr. the results showed t-pa synthesis was increased in response to all types  of lps studied and pai-2 level was increased by lps from a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, but not p. gingivalis. when comparing the effects of lps from non-periodontal bacteria (escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis) with the lps from periodontal pathogens, we found that the ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was greater following exposure of the cells to lps from periodontal pathogens. the highest ratio of t-pa to pai-2 was found in those cells exposed to lps from p. gingivalis. these results indicate that lps derived from periodontal pathogens may cause unbalanced regulation of plasminogen activator and plasminogen activator inhibitor by hgf and such an effect may, in part, contribute to the destruction of periodontal connective tissue through dysregulated pericellular proteolysis.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == early colonization of dental implants by putative periodontal pathogens in partially edentulous patients.
AB  == there is limited scientific information available on the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets in partially edentulous individuals. knowledge about this process is one step in better understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. in this study, the early colonization of the peri-implant pockets by putative periodontal pathogens was studied in 20 partially edentulous  individuals using anaerobic culture techniques. at baseline, the presence and levels of putative periodontal pathogens in the microflora of periodontal pockets and saliva were established. immediately after loading of the titanium implants and after 6 and 12 months the presence and levels of selected putative periodontal pathogens were determined in periodontal and peri-implant pockets. a  second aim was to detect bacterial contamination of the implant site and the inside of the implant. at baseline, the most frequently isolated species from the periodontal pockets were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and peptostreptococcus micros. bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were isolated from 9, 2 and 3  patients respectively. six months after placing of the bridges, the majority of the implant sites had detectable levels of most periodontal bacterial species with the exception of a. actinomycetemcomitans which could not be isolated from any of the peri-implant samples during the experimental period, although 2 patients had this organism at baseline. in 2 patients with detectable subgingival p. gingivalis at baseline this species was found after 12 months in the peri-implant sites. one of these patients lost 2 implants which was associated with a high proportion of p. gingivalis in the peri-implant pockets. a second patient developed 2 fistulas around 2 implants at 8 months and this event was also associated with the presence of p. gingivalis. it is concluded that proper periodontal infection control before installment of dental implants in partially  edentulous patients may prevent early bacterial complications.

TI  == photoactive porphyrin derivative with broad-spectrum activity against oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == photodynamic therapy (pdt) has historically been used as a means to treat cancerous tumors but has recently been used to kill bacterial cells through the use of targeted photosensitizers. pdt is a potential adjunct to scaling and root  planing in the treatment of periodontal disease. however, the effectiveness of porphyrin derivatives against microorganisms has been limited because some gram-negative bacteria are refractory to photodynamic treatment with these agents. we have designed a porphyrin derivative conjugated to a pentalysine moeity that endows the molecule with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. whereas the porphyrin, chlorin e6, showed in vitro activity against a limited spectrum of bacteria, chlorin e6 conjugated to pentalysine showed in vitro activity against all oral microorganisms tested, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, actinomyces viscosus, and the streptococci. potent  antimicrobial activity (>/=5-log-unit reduction in the numbers of cfu per milliliter) was retained in the presence of up to 25% whole sheep blood. the use  of potent, selective agents such as this chlorin e6-pentalysine conjugate to more effectively reduce the pathogenic bacteria in the periodontal pocket may be a significant tool for the treatment of periodontal disease.

TI  == differences in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of two periodontitis populations of different geographical origin. a comparison between spain and the  netherlands.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to compare the subgingival microbiota of two geographically distinct patient populations using identical clinical and bacteriological methods. adult patients with a diagnosis of periodontitis were consecutively selected according to pre-defined clinical criteria. microbiological samples were taken from the deepest four sites with bleeding. the samples were plated on blood agar plates, for the determination of the total anaerobic counts and identification of specific bacterial pathogens, and on tsbv  and mcconkey for isolation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and enteric rods, respectively. thirty-one patients in spain and 30 patients in the netherlands were selected. both patient groups showed similar clinical characteristics, both in terms of age, gender and periodontal clinical variables. a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more prevalent (23.3% vs. 3.2%) in the dutch group, while porphyromonas gingivalis was significantly more prevalent (64.5% vs. 36.7%) in the spanish group. bacteroides forsythus and most commensal  periodontal pathogens showed similar prevalences, except peptostreptococcus micros that was significantly more frequent in the dutch group (96.7% vs. 74.2%). in summary, the subgingival microbiota from the spanish group was characterised by a high prevalence of p. gingivalis and low of a. actinomycetemcomitans, while  the flora from the dutch group was characterised by a high prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. micros.

AB  == background: although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a korean population so far. the purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in korean patients by culture-independent methods. methods: a total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken  from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. ap samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [pd]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm pd) in each patient. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. aliquots of pcr products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. results: all diseased sites harbored fusobacterium sp., while porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema sp., and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. peptostreptococcus micros, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. in  sites of periodontally healthy subjects, fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). treponema sp., p. gingivalis, and b. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. p. micros, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy  sites, respectively. the prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (p <0.05). conclusions: using highly sensitive methods relying on 16s ribosomal rna-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with ap patients in a korean population. with the exceptions of fusobacterium sp. and b. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

AB  == aims: the colonization of suspected periodontal pathogens during the healing of periodontal defects treated by guided tissue regeneration (gtr) with e-ptfe membranes and tetracycline fibers was investigated. methods: fifteen patients, each with one pair of angular periodontal bone defects of comparable size and morphology were recruited for the study. in a matched-pair study design, the test defects were treated with e-ptfe membranes in combination with tetracycline fibers, while control defects were treated with e-ptfe membranes alone. microbiological specimens were taken from control as well as from test sites preoperatively (t0), intraoperatively (t1), two weeks after surgery (t2) and from membranes at time of removal (t3). cultural methods were used to identify the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and actinobacillus actinomicetemcomitans (aa). results: at baseline and t1, none of the suspected periodontal pathogens were detected at test or control sites. levels of p. intermedia and f. nucleatum, as mean percentages of total culturable microflora, were detected at levels significantly higher in control sites than test sites at times t2 and t3. conclusions: findings from this study suggest that e-ptfe membranes are frequently colonized by periodontal pathogens, and that bacterial colonization of healing sites after gtr procedures can be kept under control with a controlled delivery system releasing tetracycline.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == longitudinal study of dental implants in a periodontally compromised population.
AB  == background: the purpose of this longitudinal study was to determine the clinical  status and the composition of the subgingival microbiota of dental implants and natural teeth in patients with a history of periodontitis. methods: twenty-five partially edentulous patients treated for moderate to advanced adult periodontitis and having a total of 42 implants participated in this 3-year study. the assessment of clinical status was done 1, 2, and 3 years after prosthetic loading (t1, t2, and t3, respectively). clinical parameters evaluated  included probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), gingival index (gi), and plaque index (pi). the subgingival microbiota at peri-implant and periodontal sites were analyzed at t1 and t2. results: no significant difference  in clinical parameters between implants and teeth and within the 2 groups between different time points was observed through the study. pd and cal measurements of  sampled periodontal and peri-implant sites did not show any statistically significant difference through the study and between the 2 groups. pi of sampled  periodontal sites showed a statistically significant improvement during the study. from the morphological observation of the subgingival microbiota, a significant difference in the composition of motile rods between implants and teeth was found at t1. there were no differences detected in the subgingival microbiota, culturally identified at peri-implant and periodontal sites for the duration of the study. conclusions: in conclusion, implants were colonized by the indigenous periodontal microbiota and were well maintained in patients with a history of periodontitis. no significant association between progressing or non-progressing periodontal or peri-implant sampled sites in terms of loss of attachment and infection with at least one of the searched periodontal pathogens  was found, suggesting that the presence of putative periodontopathogens at peri-implant and periodontal sites may not be associated with future attachment loss or implant failure.

TI  == microbiological features of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == papillon-lefevre syndrome patients exhibit hyperkeratosis palmo-plantaris and severe periodontitis. the syndrome is an autosomal recessive trait, but the mechanism of periodontal destruction is not known. this report presents the clinical and microbiological features of an 11-year old girl with papillon-lefevre syndrome. clinical examination included conventional periodontal measurements and radiographic analysis. in samples from 3 deep periodontal lesions, the occurrence of major suspected periodontopathic bacteria was determined by selective and non-selective culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) identification, and the presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus by a nested-pcr detection method. 10 of 22 available teeth demonstrated severe periodontal breakdown. major cultivable bacteria included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (3.4% of total isolates), prevotella nigrescens (16.4%), fusobacterium nucleatum (14.3%) and peptostreptococcus micros (10.6%). a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis and eikenella corrodens were identified by pcr analysis. the patient's non-affected parents and older brother revealed several periodontal pathogens but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the viral examination demonstrated cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr type 1 virus in the subgingival sample of the papillon-lefevre syndrome patient. the father and brother yielded subgingival cytomegalovirus but  not epstein-barr type 1 virus. we hypothesize that human herpesviruses in concert with a. actinomycetemcomitans play important roles in the development of papillon-lefevre syndrome periodontitis.

TI  == microbiological response of localized sites with recurrent periodontitis in maintenance patients treated with tetracycline fibers.
AB  == background: whether adjunctive tetracycline fibers can provide an additive effect to scaling and root planing in treating non-responsive sites in maintenance subjects is still controversial. recolonization of the bacteria from untreated sites or from the extracrevicular region may explain the insignificant response to local therapy. the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the microbiological response of sites treated with tetracycline fibers combined with  scaling and root planing. methods: the study was conducted in a split-mouth design. thirty patients on maintenance therapy having at least 2 non-adjacent sites in separate quadrants with probing depths between 4 to 8 mm with bleeding on probing, or aspartate aminotransferase enzyme levels > 800 microiu in the gingival crevicular fluid, were treated with scaling and root planing plus tetracycline fibers or with scaling and root planing only. subgingival plaque samples were collected at baseline, and 1, 3, and 6 months following treatment. a. actino-mycetemcomitans, c. rectus, b. forsythus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia were detected by culture, immunofluorescence, or pcr technique. results: there was a reduction of total bacterial cell count, as well as of certain periodontal pathogens, following treatment. the prevalence of  a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, and p. gingivalis and the mean proportions of c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and p. gingivalis decreased after therapy, but there was no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatment groups with respect to bacterial proportions or the number of positive sites. besides, the pathogens could not be eliminated from the periodontal pocket, and recolonization of the pocket was noted at 3 months post-treatment. conclusions: bacteria located within the cheek, tongue mucosa, saliva, or untreated sites may contribute to reinfection of the pockets and explain the insignificant response to local tetracycline therapy.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with amoxicillin and clavulanic acid in patients with adult periodontitis. a randomised double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and microbiological  effects of initial periodontal therapy in conjunction with systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid in adult periodontitis patients using a double-blind, parallel-group, and placebo-controlled protocol. 21 patients with a clinical diagnosis of generalised adult periodontitis were recruited. clinical measurements and microbiological assessments were carried out at baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. approximately 6 weeks after initial periodontal treatment (3-6 h), patients were randomly assigned to receive coded study medication of 500 mg amoxicillin plus 125 mg clavulanic acid (augmentin) or placebo, every 8 h for 10 days. patients returned for follow-up visits 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after completion of the medication. the mean plaque index (pi) at baseline was 1.1 for placebo group and 0.9 for the test group. at 3 months, the pi had dropped to 0.3 in both groups, and was maintained during the rest of the study. the changes in bleeding on probing (bop) and gingival index (gi) in the course of the study were similar in both groups. the mean whole mouth probing pocket depth (ppd) in the placebo group was 3.8 mm at baseline and 3.9 mm in the  test group. a mean reduction of 1.0 mm in the placebo group and 0.9 mm in the test group was observed during the first 3 months. no further reduction in ppd was noticed during the study period in either group. there was no statistically significant difference in the ppd reduction between the 2 groups. the change in clinical attachment level (cal) from baseline to 3 months amounted to 0.5 mm in both groups. between 3 and 12 months, the cal changed in neither group. in both groups, treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of spirochetes and motile  rods in positive patients, but no significant differences between either group were noted in any of the dark field microscopy observations. at baseline, 1 patient in the placebo group and 2 patients in the test group were culture positive for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa). after therapy, aa was not detectable in the placebo group and 1 patient remained positive in the test group. in the placebo group, the number of patients positive for porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) decreased from 7 to 2 after therapy. in the test group, the 4 patients positive for pg at baseline remained positive after therapy. in both groups, all subjects were positive for prevotella intermedia (pi) and fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) at baseline. at 12 months, all subjects had detectable subgingival fn. 9 out of the 11 placebo and 8 of the 10 test patients  remained positive for pi. there were no differences in detection frequency of peptostreptococcus micros (pm) and bacteroides forsythus (bf) in both groups between baseline, 3, and 12 months post-treatment. the findings demonstrated that, in comparison to placebo, systemic amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid provided no additional clinical and microbiological effects in the treatment of adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == a 15-month evaluation of the effects of repeated subgingival minocycline in chronic adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: a double-blind, randomized, parallel, comparative study was designed  to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of subgingivally administered minocycline ointment versus a vehicle control. methods: one hundred four patients (104) with moderate to severe adult periodontitis (34 to 64 years of age; mean 46 years) were enrolled in the study. following scaling and root planing, patients were randomized to receive either 2% minocycline ointment or a matched vehicle control. study medication was administered directly into the periodontal pocket with a specially designed, graduated, disposable applicator at baseline; week 2;  and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. scaling and root planing was repeated at months 6 and 12. standard clinical variables (including probing depth and attachment level) were evaluated at baseline and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. microbiological sampling using dna probes was done at baseline; at week 2; and at months 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15. results: both treatment groups showed significant  and clinically relevant reductions in the numbers of each of the 7 microorganisms measured during the entire 15-month study period. when differences were detected, sites treated with minocycline ointment always produced statistically significantly greater reductions than sites which received the vehicle control. for initial pockets > or =5 mm, a mean reduction in probing depth of 1.9 mm was seen in the test sites, versus 1.2 mm in the control sites. sites with a baseline probing depth > or =7 mm and bleeding index >2 showed an average of 2.5 mm reduction with minocycline versus 1.5 mm with the vehicle. gains in attachment (0.9 mm and 1.1 mm) were observed in minocycline-treated sites, with baseline probing depth > or =5 mm and > or =7 mm, respectively, compared with 0.5 mm and 0.7 mm gain at control sites. subgingival administration of minocycline ointment  was well tolerated. conclusions: overall, the results demonstrate that repeated subgingival administration of minocycline ointment in the treatment of adult periodontitis is safe and leads to significant adjunctive improvement after subgingival instrumentation in both clinical and microbiologic variables over a 15-month period.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in adult twins.
AB  == background: both environmental and genetic factors are known to influence clinical measures of periodontal disease. the purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic factors similarly influence the presence of specific periodontal bacteria in subgingival plaque. methods: reared-together and reared-apart monozygous (mz) and dizygous (dz) adult twins were examined clinically. demographic and behavioral information was obtained from each subject by questionnaire. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from the index teeth,  and the presence of p. intermedia, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum was determined using an immunoassay. results: microbiological and clinical data were available for 169 twin pairs. the subject-based prevalences of the bacteria in the twin groups ranged from 11% for  porphyromonas gingivalis to 40% for f. nucleatum. for all species examined, the concordance rates were not significantly different (p > 0.05) between mz and dz twin groups. these findings were apparent despite similar smoking histories, self-reported oral hygiene practices, and antibiotic use in the twin groups. furthermore, mz twins reared together were not more similar than mz reared-apart  twins with respect to any bacterial species examined. conclusions: these findings suggest that in a population with access to routine dental care, any effects that host genes and the early family environment have on the presence of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque are not apparent in adulthood. most twins with disease in this study had early periodontitis. results from this study may not necessarily be extrapolated to more advanced disease states.

TI  == induction of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte antibodies in mice injected with lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == we examined the levels of anti-thymocyte/t lymphocyte autoantibody (ata) in the serum of mice injected intraperitoneally with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga ochracea, and non-oral escherichia coli. all of the lps induced igm-ata. among these, lps from  c. ochracea induced the highest level of igm-ata, whereas that of p. gingivalis induced the lowest. the peritoneal t lymphocytes of mice injected with lps were bound by igm-ata. peritoneal b-1 (cd5+b) cells stimulated by each lps produced much more igm-ata than splenic b-2 (cd5-b) cells, suggesting that b-1 cells might be responsible for the production of these antibodies. serum of mice injected with c. ochracea and f. nucleatum lps showed cytotoxicity against thymocytes in the presence of rabbit complements. binding and cytotoxicity were confirmed by igm purified from serum of the mice injected with c. ochracea lps. furthermore, serum of mice treated with c. ochracea, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans  lps inhibited the proliferation of thymocytes. however, purified igm from the serum of mice treated with c. ochracea lps failed to produce the same inhibition. our results suggest that lps from certain species of periodontopathic bacteria can induce igm-ata in the serum and these antibodies may modulate the local immune network in periodontal tissues.

TI  == relationship of the subgingival microbiota to a chairside test for aspartate aminotransferase in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == background: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between  the occurrence of certain specific periodontal pathogens and aspartate aminotransferase (ast) levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf). methods: thirty systemically healthy subjects with moderate to advanced periodontitis were selected. within each subject, the ast contents of gcf from sites with probing depth between 5 mm and 7 mm were measured using a chairside colorimetric test. ast-positive site refers to one that had an ast level > or = 800 microiu. subgingival plaque samples from one ast-positive and one negative site were collected for microbiological examination. one site with probing depth < or = 3 mm and no gingival inflammation was selected as a healthy control. clinical parameters of the chosen sites, including the plaque index and gingival index scores, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were measured. culture and immunofluorescence (if) were used for detecting common periodontal pathogens, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, and porphyromonas gingivalis. logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between the ast test and certain specific pathogens. results: the gcf scores and  total cultivable bacterial counts were higher in ast-positive sites than either ast-negative or healthy sites. the prevalence and proportions of specific periodontal pathogens such as c rectus, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga species, p. intermedia, and p. gingivalis were significantly higher in positive than in negative sites. in analyzing the correlation of the proportion of 6 pathogens with the ast test by logistic regression, only p. gingivalis showed a significant positive correlation. the odds ratio of having a  high proportion of p. gingivalis in the presence of a positive ast test was 1.21. conclusions: the present study showed that at ast-positive sites, there is a higher prevalence and higher proportion of certain periodontal pathogens. although only the correlation of p. gingivalis and ast values was statistically significant, the results imply that certain periodontal pathogens may be associated with elevation of ast levels in gcf.

TI  == inflammatory cytokine production and specific antibody responses against possible causative bacteria in patients with multilesional periapical periodontitis.
AB  == we examined the induction of inflammatory cytokines (including interleukin-1, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) by several species of possible causative bacteria in periapical periodontitis. assays were done on human whole blood cultures from patients with differing numbers of periapical lesions; those having radiographically clear periapical lesions in 10 or more teeth (high lesion group), in one or two teeth (low lesion group), and healthy volunteers having no periapical lesions (no lesion group). prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845 induced interleukin-6 more strongly in subjects from the high lesion group than in the other groups. to ascertain the degree of sensitization by test bacteria, we examined the reactivities of antibodies in serum and saliva from the six subjects to different bacterial species. porphylomonas gingivalis cells reacted strongly with sera from the high lesion group. thus, prevotella melaninogenica and porphylomonas gingivalis may be involved in multilesional periapical periodontitis by inducing specific cytokines and/or humoral immune responses.

TI  == analysis of serum antibody responses to periodontopathogens in early-onset periodontitis patients from different geographical locations.
AB  == serum antibody specificity to oral micro-organisms was used to delineate the pathogens associated with early-onset periodontal diseases in a turkish population. additionally, comparison of the findings to those derived from a clinically similar us patient population described differences in bacterial specific antibody between these 2 geographic regions. serum from 89 (ljp), 86 (rpp) and 94 (normal) subjects was analyzed (elisa) to determine igg antibody to  14 oral micro-organisms. all ljp patients from turkey exhibited elevated antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotypes c and a significantly increased), while antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 and jp2 (serotype b) were significantly higher in us ljp patients. 50% of the turkish rpp patients also showed elevated anti-a. actinomycetemcomitans antibody, although the us rpp patients exhibited significantly higher antibody levels and frequency of elevated antibody to the a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes. healthy subjects and ljp and  rpp patients from the us exhibited higher antibody levels to all 3 p. gingivalis  serogroups compared to those from turkey, although, the frequency of elevated antibody to the p. gingivalis serogroups was significantly higher in ljp and rpp  patients from turkey than from the us. interestingly, 87% and 77% of the ljp patients in the turkish population had elevated antibody responses to p. gingivalis and e. corrodens, respectively, which was not observed in the us ljp patients. these data suggested that considerable variation exists in the systemic antibody levels to periodontopathogens between these 2 countries. this supports potential differences in subgingival colonization or antigenic composition of these pathogens between patient populations from different geographical regions.

TI  == additional clinical and microbiological effects of amoxicillin and metronidazole  after initial periodontal therapy.
AB  == the aims of this study were to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects  of initial periodontal therapy (it) and to determine the additional effects of systemic amoxicillin (flemoxin solutab) 375 mg tid plus metronidazole 250 mg tid  therapy, in patients with adult actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa)-associated periodontitis in conjunction with either porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), bacteroides forsythus (bf) and/or prevotella intermedia (pi). in addition the adverse effects of the antimicrobial therapy were also documented. a total of 22 patients were enrolled. the deepest, bleeding pocket in each quadrant was selected and at these 4 experimental sites clinical measurements and microbiological testing was carried out at baseline, after (it), i.e., 21 weeks after baseline, and after antimicrobial therapy (am), i.e., 35 weeks after baseline. at baseline, the mean plaque index (pi) amounted 0.5, 0.1 after it and  0.3 after systemic am. the mean bleeding index decreased from 1.6 to 1.2 after it and a further decrease to 0.7 after am was noted. suppuration was completely eliminated after am. the mean change of probing pocket depth (ppd) after it amounted 1.4 mm and was further reduced with an additional mean change of 1.1 mm  after medication. clinical attachment gain was 1.1 mm after it and an additional  0.9 mm was observed after am. one of the 22 aa positive patients and 4 of 17 pg positive patients became negative for these species after it. the number of patients with detectable pi decreased from 16 to 10 after it. after am, in comparison to baseline, suppression below detection level for aa was achieved in  19 out of 22, for pg in 9 out of 17, for bf in 13 out of 14, and for pi in 11 out of 16 patients. by contrast, higher frequencies of peptostreptococcus micros and  fusobacterium nucleatum were found after am. on the basis of the microbiological  results the study group was separated into 2 subgroups: group a consisted of subjects who had no detectable levels of aa, pg, bf and <5% of pi after am. group b consisted of those who still showed presence of one of these 3 species and/or > or =5% levels of pi. after am, group b had significantly higher pi, bi, ppd and cal scores then group a. it is concluded that group a showed low plaque scores and no detectable periodontal pathogens. this microbiological condition has been  associated with a long-term stable periodontium.

TI  == oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers in natural and experimentally-induced  gingivitis.
AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == severity of localized juvenile periodontitis as related to polymorphonuclear chemotaxis and specific microbial isolates.
AB  == the purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine if an association exists  between severity of localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) and impairment of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (pmn) chemotaxis and/or colonization by specific microbial isolates; (b) to determine if the number of specific microbial isolates, i.e., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus correlates to clinical severity of sites with ljp. thirty-six first molars in nine subjects with ljp were examined. a clinical severity score was computed based on attachment level and vertical bone loss. the mean score of the four sites was designated as the clinical severity score for each subject. a dna probe was used to quantitate colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, e. corrodens,  and c. rectus. the chemotaxis of isolated peripheral blood pmns was measured in boyden chambers using the leading front technique. it was found that the clinical severity score ranged from 7.8 for mild involvement to 32.5 for severe ljp. the chemotaxis result for each patient (micron/90 min) was expressed as a percentage  of the value for a paired healthy control and ranged from 40% to 104%. four of the nine subjects had chemotaxis values less than 70% of control. linear regression analysis showed: (a) no significant correlation between pmn chemotaxis and severity of ljp in subjects (r = .14); (b) a significant correlation (r = 0.43) between severe sites with ljp and number of specific microbial isolates. sites with severe ljp had present at least five different microbial isolates as compared with non-severe sites (p < .05). no particular trend of colonization by  periodontopathogens was seen in non-severe sites. further, severe sites of ljp displayed a statistically significant greater colonization by p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and c. rectus than did non-severe sites (p < .05). it may be concluded that neither the degree of pmn chemotactic impairment nor a. actinomycetemcomitans is a reliable indicator of the severity of ljp.

AB  == the purpose of the present study was to establish in vitro the inhibiting effect  of a herbal extract mixture on a selected number of micro-organisms and to test in vivo the effect of a mouthwash containing 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture on  plaque and gingivitis as compared to a minus active control mouthrinse. the herbal extract was a mixture of: juniperus communis (juniper), urtica dioca (nettle), achillaea millefolium (yarrow); 1:1:1. in the study, in-vitro, the effect of pure herbal extract mixture on acid production of streptococcus mutans  was tested and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the following micro-organisms were tested: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actynomyces viscosus, actynomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula. the mic-values for a. viscosus and p. gingivalis  were 100 mg/ml. the mic-values for a. naeslundii and a. actinomycetemcomitans were considerably lower (10 mg/ml). s. mitis was the most susceptible of the tested organisms to the extract with a mic value of 1 mg/ml. s. mutans, c. rectus, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum were not influenced by the extracts. no inhibitory effect of the 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture was observed on the acid production of s. mutans. for the study in-vivo, 45 volunteers were selected  on the basis of having moderate gingival inflammation. as efficacy parameters the plaque index, modified gingival index and angulated bleeding index were assessed. the subjects were randomly divided among 3 experimental groups (2x test and 1 'minus active' control). the participants were requested to rinse with 10 ml of mouthwash twice a day for a period of three months. after 6 weeks and 3 months, the same clinical indices as at baseline were recorded. the results show no difference between the two test groups and the control group. in conclusion, the  results of the present study have shown that the mixture of the 3 herbal extracts, juniperus communis, urtica dioca and achillaea millefolium when used in a mouthrinse has no effect on plaque growth and gingival health.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of several periodontopathic bacteria in adult periodontitis, their in vitro susceptibility to minocycline-hcl, and whether the efficacy of the drug changes with a decrease  in bacterial susceptibility. twenty-one patients (43 to 75 years old) with 62 periodontal lesions from pockets > or =4 mm participated in the study. after subgingival sampling, an ointment containing 2% minocycline-hcl was applied locally to the selected pockets once a week for 4 weeks. the lesions were clinically examined after 1 and 4 weeks of administration. the distribution of the subgingival microorganisms included capnocytophaga sputigena (37.1%), prevotella intermedia (22.6%), porphyromonas gingivalis (22.6%), fusobacterium nucleatum (20.1%), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (9.7%), and eikenella corrodens (4.8%). the distribution was complex, with 76.8% of the sites containing 1 to 3 bacterial spieces. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of minocycline-hcl for each organism showed that most were inhibited by a minocycline-hcl concentration equal to or less than the mic for reference strains. however, some clinical strains of prevotella intermedia seemed to exihibit low susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. there were no significant differences among sites with strains exhibiting low or normal susceptibility to minocycline-hcl. the concentration of the drug applied to deep periodontal pockets inhibited the growth of most of the microorganisms investigated in this study.

TI  == salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque as related to periodontal and hiv infection status.
AB  == levels of total iga and specific iga reactive with streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by elisa in parotid saliva from hiv+ and hiv- persons with healthy gingiva (hg), chronic gingivitis, chronic marginal periodontitis (cmp), or necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis (nup). when the hiv+ group was compared with the hiv- group regardless of periodontal status, total salivary iga concentration was higher in hiv+ patients, but no such difference was observed for total iga output. hiv+ cmp displayed higher total iga concentration as compared with hiv- cmp. no significant differences in specific iga outputs and ratios were detected  between hiv+ and hiv- subgroups with similar periodontal status. hiv+ nup displayed increased specific iga output towards s. mutans and increased specific  iga ratio values towards s. mutans, p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ cmp, and increased specific iga ratio values towards s. mutans and p. nigrescens as compared with hiv+ hg. no such differences were observed between the hiv- subgroups. in sum, salivary iga responses to bacteria in dental plaque seem not to be related to chronic periodontal disease and hiv infection, but are  possibly influenced by acute periodontal infection.

TI  == subgingival temperature: relation to gingival crevicular fluid enzymes, cytokines, and subgingival plaque micro-organisms.
AB  == there have been no reports on the relationship of subgingival temperature to specific gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) components. therefore, the purpose of this cross-sectional study was to determine whether there was any relationship between subgingival temperature and gcf levels of neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), beta-glucuronidase (bg), interleukin-1 alpha (il-1), and interferon alpha (ifn). furthermore, another objective was to confirm an association of subgingival temperature with clinical parameters and specific subgingival plaque micro-organisms as has been reported earlier. 27 human subjects each having healthy (n = 50), gingivitis (n = 59) and periodontitis (n = 53) sites were evaluated. the plaque index (pi), subgingival temperature, probing depth, attachment loss, bleeding index and gingival index were measured. gcf was  sampled following the measurement of the pi and removal of the supragingival plaque. gcf samples were assayed for the enzymes ne, bg, mpo and the cytokines ifn-alpha and il-1 alpha. a sterile gracey curette was utilized at each sampled site to collect subgingival plaque. the plaque samples were evaluated using an immunoassay. subgingival temperature was found to directly correlate with all clinical parameters (p < 0.001). significant, albeit not large, correlations were found between subgingival temperature and ne (r = 0.35, p < 0.001), mpo (r = 0.26, p < 0.001) and bg (r = 0.23, p < 0.01). temperature was found to correlate  positively with e. corrodens (r = 0.33, p < 0.02) and f. nucleatum (r = 0.25, p < 0.05) but not with p. intermedia (r = 0.02, p = 0.9), p. gingivalis (r = 0.20, p  = 0.1) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (r = 0.01, p > 0.9). in conclusion, subgingival temperature is correlated with the gcf enzymes, ne, mpo and bg as well as the clinical parameters and specific plaque micro-organisms associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == reduced serum igg reactivities with bacteria from dental plaque in hiv-infected persons with periodontitis.
AB  == serum samples were obtained from 44 hiv-seropositive (hiv+) and 37 hiv-seronegative (hiv-) persons that were grouped according to periodontal status. serum igg and iga reactivities towards streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis. prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were measured by means of elisa. hiv+ persons with chronic marginal periodontitis showed significantly lower igg reactivities to the periodontal pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum as compared  with their hiv- counterparts (p < 0.05). specific serum iga reactivities were similar in the two periodontitis groups, except for p. nigrescens where the hiv+  group with chronic marginal periodontitis had lower values than their systemically healthy counterparts (p < 0.05). the results indicate that hiv infection affects the humoral serum immune responses against bacteria in dental plaque; the depressed antibody responses may contribute to the increased susceptibility for periodontal infections in hiv-infected patients.

TI  == "checkerboard" versus culture: a comparison between two methods for identification of subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the present study compared the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization methodology with culture techniques for the analysis of the composition of the subgingival microbiota. 70 subjects, presenting with a variety of periodontal conditions, contributed with a total of 283 subgingival plaque samples analyzed with respect  to the following species: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans. species identification and quantification was performed by (i) the checkerboard method, using whole genomic, digoxigenin labeled dna probes; and (ii) culture, including non-selective and selective media in combination with routine biochemical testing using commercial  test panels. we found that the checkerboard technology resulted in higher prevalence figures for half of the species tested when compared to culture data.  if the latter were used as the reference, checkerboard detection sensitivities ranged from 0.17 to 0.86, specificities from 0.17 to 1.0, and diagnostic accuracies from 0.51 to 0.81, depending on bacterial species. the use of the checkerboard data as the reference resulted in detection sensitivities for the culture procedures between 0.24 and 1.0 and specificities between 0.21 and 0.87.  the checkerboard methodology resulted in statistically significant higher bacterial counts for the majority of the species. it was further observed that, for most species, the higher the total number colony-forming units in the sample, the higher the discrepancy between the results obtained by the two techniques.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == cross-infection from periodontitis sites to failing implant sites in the same mouth.

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == development of resistance to metronidazole and minocycline in vitro.
AB  == by local delivery of antibiotics to periodontal pockets, very high initial concentrations are often quickly succeeded by subinhibitory concentrations, which may facilitate development of bacterial resistance. the purpose of the present study was to investigate possible development of resistance in suspected periodontal pathogens after exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of metronidazole and minocycline. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of 18 reference strains and 12 clinical isolates was determined by a broth dilution method. subsequently, all strains with mic < 8 micrograms/ml were exposed to serial passage on plates containing subinhibitory and gradually increasing concentrations of antibiotics, until growth was inhibited. initially, most strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml of minocycline and < or = 0.5 microgram/ml of metronidazole, though a. actinomycetemcomitans was resistant to metronidazole. after growth at subinhibitory concentrations, 8 strains survived 1-2 x and 11 stains survived 8-32 x their initial mic of metronidazole, growing at up to 8 micrograms/ml. all a. actinomycetemcomitans survived 8-64 x their initial mic of minocycline, growing at > or = 2 micrograms/ml, while all other strains were inhibited at < or = 0.250 microgram/ml, corresponding to a 1-8 x increase in their initial mic. thus, development of resistance was observed for periodontal bacteria growing at up to 64 x their initial mic, but the final level of resistance was moderate.

TI  == secretion of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha, il-8 and il-1ra by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes in response to lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are the first cells that migrate into periodontal tissues and gingival crevices in response to invading pathogens. it was recently demonstrated that pmn have the ability to synthesize and release cytokines following appropriate stimulation, while it is not clear whether these  capacities are directly related to periodontal destructive processes. we therefore investigated the amounts of the cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), il-8 and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) secreted by pmn from healthy donors following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (lps) from 4 periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea and fusobacterium nucleatum, and the non-oral bacterium escherichia coli. a actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and e. coli lps stimulated the release of significantly greater amounts of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 than the control unstimulated pmn (p < 0.01). the levels of il-1 beta, tnf-alpha and il-8 released from cells stimulated with p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps were significantly lower than those of cells stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans or e. coli lps (p < 0.05). on the other hand, substantially greater amounts of il-1ra were released from pmn stimulated with each lps and from control unstimulated pmn during the first 6 h, and then significantly greater amounts of il-1ra were secreted by pmn stimulated with a. actinomycetemcomitans and e.coli lps during the following 12 h (p < 0.01). the inhibitory effects of il-1ra on the biological activity of il-1 in the supernatants of pmn were examined by the thymocyte comitogen proliferation assay. the supernatants of pmn stimulated with each lps showed less biological il-1 activity as compared with the same doses of recombinant human il-1 beta detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. furthermore, no activity was detected in the supernatants of pmn stimulated with  p. gingivalis or c. ochracea lps. these findings demonstrated that lps from periodontopathic bacteria were capable of stimulating pmn to release not only pro-inflammatory cytokines but also their inhibitors such as il-1ra. different secretion levels of these cytokines and their biological activities induced by the various lps might be important in the onset and progression of periodontal diseases.

TI  == increase of heat-shock protein and induction of gamma/delta t cells in peritoneal exudate of mice after injection of live fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans are gram-negative rod periodontal pathogens. the peritoneal cavity of institute of cancer research (icr) mice was used as the local infection model. in vivo production of heat-shock proteins (hsp) was studied by injection of 1/10 minimum  lethal dose (mld) of each live bacteria into mice. heat-shock proteins 70 and 60  were examined in the extract of peritoneal exudate cells (pec) from mice injected intraperitoneally with either f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans by using sodium dodecylsulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting analysis. although hsp are present in pec without injection of the bacteria, both hsp increased and reached a peak on day 3 after f. nucleatum injection but not after a. actinomycetemcomitans. kinetic study of gamma/delta cells in pec after injection of bacteria showed that the increase of gamma/delta t cells was observed only in the pec from mice injected with f. nucleatum but not a. actinomycetemcomitans. the gamma/delta t cells in pec were either cd3+ and cd4+ or cd3+ and cd8+. the differential cell count of pec suggested that gamma/delta t-cell induction is related to the expansion of the macrophage population. the phagocytic and chemiluminescence responses of macrophages against the same bacteria were compared after intensive immunization with live f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans. elevations of chemiluminescence response and phagocytic function by immunization were observed in the macrophages of mice immunized with  f. nucleatum. these results suggest the sequential appearance of hsp, gamma/delta t cells and macrophage activation after fusobacterial infection.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == microbial findings of deep peri-implant bone defects.
AB  == the objective of this study was to examine inflammatory tissue in deep peri-implant bone pockets (> 5 mm) for anaerobic bacteria colonization. the peri-implant inflammatory tissue of bone defects from 12 edentulous patients with 18 unsuccessful implants (imz type) was removed after surgical opening of the defects. after grinding the tissue with glass beads in nutrient solution, an aliquot of the suspension was plated and incubated on appropriate culture media.  the quantitative and qualitative distribution of bacteria as a function of the tissue dry weight was determined (cell count/mg dry weight). the mean total cell  count was 67 x 10(3) cells/mg dry weight. the following bacteria dominated: species of the family bacteroidaceae (prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, prevotella oralis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola); actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; fusobacterium nucleatum; capnocytophaga spp; and eikenella corrodens. bacteroidaceae and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found particularly frequently. the increased colonization of these bacteria in deep peri-implant bone pockets is consistent with the currently held view of advanced periodontal lesions, whereby certain pathogens grow at a disproportionate rate in comparison with the total bacteria count under specific circumstances.

TI  == short-chain carboxylic acid concentration in human gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which can accumulate in the gingival crevice. it is of no small consequence, therefore, that 1- to 5-mm concentrations of these acids exhibit significant biological activity, including  the ability to alter cell proliferation and gene expression in cells of importance to the periodontium. this communication reports on the in vivo concentrations of propionic and butyric acid in the gingival crevices of periodontal subjects with severe and mild disease. the results indicated that severely diseased subjects exhibited a > 10-fold increase in the mm concentration of these acids when compared with mildly diseased subjects (mean propionic acid-severe = 9.5 +/- 1.8 mm, and mild = 0.8 +/- 0.3 mm; mean butyric acid-severe = 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm, and mild = 0.2 +/- 0.04 mm). these differences (mean +/- se) were significant (p < 0.0001). the propionic and butyric acid concentrations were below detection limits in healthy sites of mildly diseased subjects. the propionic and butyric acid concentrations also associated significantly with clinical measures of disease severity (e.g., pocket depth, attachment level) and  inflammation (e.g., subgingival temperature, % of sites bleeding when probed), and with the total microbial load (all p < 0.05). taken together, these data suggest that short-chain carboxylic acids play a mediating role in periodontal disease pathogenesis.

TI  == rheumatoid factor from periodontitis patients cross-reacts with epitopes on oral  bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the antigenic specificity of rheumatoid factor (rf) that had previously been reported in the serum of patients with periodontitis. design: igm-rf was isolated from the serum  of five rf-seropositive rheumatoid arthritis patients and 14 rf-seropositive periodontitis and examined for specificity to human igg and selected oral bacteria. methods: igm-rf was prepared by affinity chromatography on human igg columns. human igg antibody to capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was isolated by binding and elution of antibody from the bacteria, followed by purification using a rabbit anti-igg affinity column. main outcome measure: binding of the isolated igm-rf was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the antigens used for detection of binding included isolated human igg, human igg antibody bound to the bacteria, and the bacteria alone. inhibition of the igm-rf binding with igg or fc gamma was used to assess the specificity of the reactivity with igg and/or the bacteria. results: the results showed that the igm-rf reacted with polyclonal human igg nonspecifically bound to microtiter plates. the reactivity of the igm-rf was increased when incubated with igg that bound as antibody to c.  gingivalis, f. nucleatum or a. actinomycetemcomitans. however, the igm-rf did not bind with increased intensity to the specific igg antibody preparations or to igg preparations lacking antibody to these micro-organisms. additionally, the igm-rf  preparations bound to surface components of both c. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.  blocking studies showed that fc gamma but not igg inhibited igm-rf binding to both micro-organisms. conclusions: these findings indicate that the rf detected in the serum of some periodontitis patients may be elicited by certain micro-organisms in the subgingival plaque. furthermore, c. gingivalis and f. nucleatum appear to express surface antigen epitopes that are antigenically related to determinants on igg can induce cross-reactive igm-rf.

TI  == degradation of lactoferrin by periodontitis-associated bacteria.
AB  == the degradation of human lactoferrin by putative periodontopathogenic bacteria was examined. fragments of lactoferrin were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and measured by densitometry. the degradation of lactoferrin was more extensive by porphyromonas gingivalis and capnocytophaga sputigena, slow by capnocytophaga ochracea, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia, and very slow or absent by prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter sputorum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and peptostreptococcus micros. all strains of p. gingivalis tested degraded lactoferrin. the degradation was sensitive to protease inhibitors, cystatin c and albumin. the degradation by c. sputigena was not affected by the protease inhibitors and the detected lactoferrin fragments exhibited electrophoretic mobilities similar to those ascribed to deglycosylated forms of lactoferrin. furthermore a weak or absent reactivity of these fragments with sialic acid-specific lectin suggested that they are desialylated. the present data indicate that certain bacteria colonizing the periodontal pocket can degrade lactoferrin. the presence of other human proteins as specific inhibitors and/or as substrate competitors may counteract this degradation process.

AB  == periodontal probes have previously been shown to harbor several bacterial types or species after probing periodontally diseased pockets. this study aims to identify and quantify periodontopathogens that may adhere to a periodontal probe  by culturing techniques. it also examines the probe's roughness on its capability to collect bacteria, comparing merrit-b probes (with deep indentations) with tps  probes (with smooth surfaces). from the differential phase contrast microscopy findings it was seen that, while paper-points harbored nearly 50% motile rods or  spirochetes, the periodontal probes were just at, or below, the 20% threshold level for pathogenicity (23.6% for the merrit-b probe and 11.3% for the tps probe). the cultural data showed that paper-points had significantly higher (p <  0.05) numbers of anaerobic bacteria than the 2 probe types, which still harbored  up to 10(7) cfu. no significant differences could be detected between the probes. when specific periodontopathic species were considered, it was seen that for all  species, even for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or porphyromonas gingivalis, the detection frequency was comparable for the 3 sampling devices. however, the levels of prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus was significantly higher in samples from paper-points (p < 0.05), but still their numbers reached even 10(5) on the probes. differences among the 2 probe types were again negligible. periodontal probes harbor relatively high numbers of bacteria found in periodontal pockets and may be able to carry them over to other sites. further studies are needed to determine if, and to what extent, transmission occurs during periodontal probing.

TI  == risk indicators for periodontal disease in a racially diverse urban population.
AB  == a cross-sectional study of 117 subjects from a dental clinic serving a diverse population (i.e., whites, african-americans, native-americans, and asians) was performed to evaluate risk indicators of periodontal disease. gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and subgingival plaque were taken at the same visit from 4 posterior  sites of the most diseased sextant in each subject. age, smoking packyears, beta-glucuronidase (beta g), neutrophil elastase (ne), myeloperoxidase (mpo), fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum), and porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis) were significantly (p < 0.05-0.005) correlated with attachment loss.  probing depth was significantly correlated with smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum and prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia) (p < 0.05-0.005). mean ne value of whites was lower than the mean ne values of african-americans, native-americans and asians (p < 0.05). whites had a lower mean beta g value compared to african americans, and a lower mean mpo value compared to african americans and native americans. the %s of patients positive for f. nucleatum, p.  intermedia and eikenella corrodens (e. corrodens) were higher in native americans compared to whites. step-wise multiple regression analysis was performed to construct models for the estimation of probing depth and attachment loss. the most parsimonious regression models which had the best r2 values included the following variables and accounted for the indicated % of variability: models 1 and 2: beta g, race, and f. nucleatum accounted for 50% of the variability in mean probing depth and 39% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for  probing depth, respectively; model 3: age, beta g, and f. nucleatum accounted for 53% of the variability in mean attachment loss; model 4: age, ne, and f. nucleatum explained 35% of the variability in a single site (first molar) for attachment loss. the results suggest that age, race, smoking packyears, beta g, ne, mpo, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are risk indicators for periodontal disease in this racially diverse urban population. regression models  which include multiple variables (i.e., demographic factors, gcf enzymes and periodontopathic bacteria) can be used to estimate periodontal disease status.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-6 and soluble interleukin-6 receptor production.
AB  == to determine the effect of pathogenic oral bacteria on interleukin 6 (il-6) and soluble il-6 receptor production, we measured their release by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro. unseparated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, peripheral blood lymphocytes (monocyte depleted), pure t cells, or monocytes were cultured with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis for  24 h. supernatants were tested for il-6 and soluble il-6 receptor by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. only monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells responded with significant il-6 release in the presence of all  bacteria tested. however, peripheral blood lymphocytes were capable of producing  il-6 when activated by phytohemagglutinin or il-2 followed by bacteria, though substantially less than cultures containing monocytes. no bacteria tested increased soluble il-6 receptor release over spontaneous soluble il-6 receptor release. we conclude that monocytes release il-6 after contact with oral pathogens; however, soluble il-6 receptor from t cells and monocytes is constitutively produced and may modulate il-6 actions.

TI  == serum rheumatoid factor induced by intraperitoneal administration of periodontopathic bacterial lipopolysaccharide in mice.
AB  == serum rheumatoid factor (rf) level and peritoneal and splenic cd5+b (b-1) cells in mice were examined after intraperitoneal administration of purified lipopoly-saccharides (lps) from oral periodontopathic bacteria; porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga ochracea. f. nucleatum and c. ochracea lps induced higher levels of serum igm- and igg-rf, while p. gingivalis lps showed the least induction. in  addition, wet weights of spleen and serum igm and igg concentration were markedly increased in f. nucleatum lps injected group. on the other hand, the proportion of cd5+ b cells to lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity and spleen did not increase. the reason for this was not clear but conventional b cells (cd5- b cells) might increase more rapidly with splenic enlargement than cd5+ b cells. these results suggested that rf induced by bacterial lps may modulate immune responses against bacteria and plays an important role for defence and destruction of periodontal tissue.

TI  == strong cytotoxicity to human gingival fibroblasts by porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the cytotoxicity of some bacterial species associated with periodontal diseases. the specificity of cytotoxicity was estimated against cells of various origin and from different individuals. the reference bacteria were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. these bacteria were cultured for 24 h in  liquid media and the supernatants were used in cytotoxicity assays. the target cells used were human gingival fibroblasts (gf), dermal fibroblasts (k4), gingival epithelial cells (e) and hela-cells (hela). these cells were exposed at  4 h or 24 h, respectively, to various concentrations of culture supernatants from the selected bacteria. the influence on the viability and metabolism of the cells were estimated quantitatively as increase in neutral red uptake and lactic acid production. growth medium supernatants of p. gingivalis 33277 were strongly cytotoxic to gingival fibroblasts after 24 h incubation, compared to supernatants of p. gingivalis 381 or w 50, a. actinomycetemcomitans or f. nucleatum cultures.  the toxic effect of p. gingivalis 33277 decreased drastically after heat inactivation, which indicates effects of proteins. by adding anti-sera the cytotoxicity of p. gingivalis 33277 could be dose dependently neutralized, which  was not the case when supernatants of a. actino-mycetemcomitans was tested. target cells of epithelial origin did not show increased cytotoxicity to p. gingivalis 33277. the results of the present study strengthen the hypothesis that p. gingivalis remains as a suspect causative key component in periodontal diseases.

TI  == the relationship of gingival crevicular fluid short chain carboxylic acid concentration to gingival inflammation.
AB  == short-chain carboxylic acids (scca; c < or = 5; e.g., lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid) are metabolic by-products of bacterial metabolism which accumulate in the gingival crevice, and exhibit significant biological activity,  including the ability to alter gene expression. it has been hypothesized that among the activities of sccas are their ability to contribute to gingival inflammation. this concept complements the notion that specific periodontal pathogens are the causative agents of gingival inflammation. to begin testing these 2 hypotheses, we examined the relationship between scca concentrations, specific putative periodontal pathogens, and gingival inflammation in medically healthy periodontally diseased subjects. we reasoned that if sccas and/or specific periodontal pathogens were causative gingival inflammatory agents, gingival inflammation should increase with increasing concentration of the inflammatory mediator. we also recognized that other clinical variables needed to be controlled for, and an objective quantitative assessment of gingival inflammation used. to accomplish these tasks, sites within subjects were stratified by location and pocket depth, and the following quantified: bacterial  presence; scca concentration; and gingival inflammation. the results indicated that gingival inflammation directly and significantly correlated with scca concentrations in the maxillary and mandibular molars, incisors and canines (all  r > or = 0.47; all p < or = 0.015; too few bicuspids were available for complete  analysis). the relationship between gingival inflammation and scca concentration  was best described by a natural log relationship. gingival inflammation did not,  however, correlate positively with either the total number of specific putative periodontal pathogens, or the sum of subsets of these pathogens (-0.31 < or = r < or = 0.39; 0.08 < or = p < or = 0.75) for any of the locations. finally, the scca concentration did not correlate with the level of individual or groups of pathogens. these data, together with historical work and other preliminary data,  support the hypothesis that scca, rather than specific putative periodontal pathogens, may be a causative agent in gingival inflammation. this work may, in part, begin to explain the apparent lack of a direct relationship between current gingival inflammation and the prediction of bacterially mediated periodontal attachment loss.

TI  == treatment of periodontal disease based on microbiological diagnosis. relation between microbiological and clinical parameters during 5 years.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the clinical effect of treatment aimed to suppress actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis below  detection level and prevotella intermedia below 5% of the cultivable periodontal  pocket flora. sixteen patients and a total of 111 periodontal pockets with probing depth > or = 6 mm were included in the study. twelve patients and a total of 77 sites completed the 5-year study. the results demonstrated clinical improvement of probing depth and gain of clinical attachment level of 3.4 mm and  1.2 mm, respectively. treatment to eliminate indicator bacteria continued for 3 years before the aim was fulfilled. in order to eliminate a. actinomycetemcomitans from a majority of the sites, a combination of surgery and  generalized tetracycline treatment was performed. a recolonization or regrowth of the indicator bacteria exceeding detection levels took place in several sites. the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans. p. gingivalis, and p. intermedia, alone or in combination, correlated with attachment level change on the individual level. no such correlation was obtained by using presence of plaque, bleeding on  probing, or three other bacteria (campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and  fusobacterium nucleatum) not used as treatment goal markers.

TI  == effects of sublethal exposure to an antiseptic mouthrinse on representative plaque bacteria.
AB  == although the mechanism responsible for the clinical antiplaque efficacy of oral antiseptics is generally considered to be primarily one of bactericidal activity, it has been suggested that oral antiseptics may have additional effects on bacteria exposed to sublethal levels. studies reported herein, investigated the effects of sublethal levels of an essential oil-containing antiseptic mouthrinse  (listerine antiseptic, warner-lambert co., morris plains, nj) on selected activities of representative plaque microorganisms using in vitro models. these studies demonstrated that sublethal exposure to the tested oral antiseptic can have significant effects in reducing intergeneric coaggregation, increasing bacterial generation time, and extracting endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria.  these in vitro activities can be correlated with features of plaque formation and pathogenicity seen in vivo; however, additional studies will be necessary to confirm that these mechanisms are, in fact, operative clinically.

TI  == the interference of gingival cell cultures with growth of selected bacteria.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to analyze the interference of oral tissue cells or cell lines (effector cells) with growth of reference bacteria, and furthermore to investigate whether cells derived from different individuals differ in such activity. the reference bacteria were staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the effector cells used were gingival fibroblasts (gf) from 21 periodontally involved persons, gingival epithelial cells (e) from 2 such persons, hela cells (hela), and an amnion cell line (amnion). the cells were cultivated and their supernatants tested for antibacterial activity in a bioscreen robot analyzer (labsystems, finland). results suggest that the antibacterial activity of each tested primary cell line  of tissue had its own profile depending on cell type and donor, and that the composition of oral microbiota was influenced by oral cells, which might, in turn, contribute to the variations in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.

TI  == the effect of age on the development of gingivitis. clinical, microbiological and histological findings.
AB  == in the present "experimental gingivitis" study, the response of the marginal gingiva to plaque formation was studied in one group of young subjects, 20-25 years of age, and in one group of older subjects, aged 65-80 years. during a 4-week period, all subjects received a series of professional tooth cleaning to establish healthy gingival conditions. a baseline examination (day 0) included assessments of plaque and gingivitis. sites that were examined (the experimental  sites) included the mesio-palatal, palatal, and disto-palatal surfaces of all teeth present in the 15 ... 25 tooth region. among the experimental sites, microbial sampling and gingival fluid assessment were performed and one gingival  biopsy harvested from each subject. following the baseline examination, the participants abolished mechanical tooth cleaning measures in the palatal and approximal surfaces of 15 ... 25. the clinical examination and the gingival fluid measurement were repeated on days 7, 14 and 21 of no oral hygiene. the microbiological sampling and the biopsy procedure were repeated on days 7 and 21. the data collected demonstrated that old subjects, during a 3-week period of oral hygiene abstention, formed similar amounts of plaque as the young subjects, but developed more gingivitis than young subjects. thus, the clinical gingivitis assessments, the gingival fluid measurements and morphometric determinations made in the biopsy samples documented that the gingival lesion which formed in the old individuals was more pronounced and contained more inflammatory cells than the corresponding lesion in the young subject sample.

TI  == response to periodontal therapy in patients with high or low levels of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens and b. forsythus.
AB  == in a previous study, subjects receiving either adjunctive tetracycline or augmentin showed, on average, more attachment level gain 10 months post-therapy than subjects receiving either ibuprofen or a placebo, although some subjects in  each treatment group showed loss of attachment post-therapy. since differences in treatment response might have been due to differences in the subgingival microbiota, the response to different therapies in subjects with different pre-therapy subgingival microbiotas was evaluated. 29 subjects exhibiting loss of attachment > 2.5 mm at 1 or more sites during longitudinal monitoring were treated by modified widman flap surgery at deep sites, subgingival scaling at all other sites and were randomly assigned one of the following agents: augmentin, tetracycline, ibuprofen or a placebo. treatment was completed within 30 days, during which time the subject took the assigned agent. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of each tooth at each visit and evaluated for  their content of 14 subgingival species including p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia and b. forsythus using dna probes. 18 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 2 or more of these 4 species comprised the high test species group; 11 subjects with mean counts > 10(5) of 0 or 1 of the species, the low test species  group. because this was a post-hoc analysis, the number of subjects in some of the treatment/test species groups was small. however, the 8 high test species subjects who received tetracycline showed the most attachment level gain (0.83 +/- 0.20 mm), while the 3 tetracycline-treated, low test species subjects showed  minimal gain (0.05 +/- 0.28 mm) 10 months post-therapy. low test species subjects receiving augmentin (n = 2) showed a mean gain in attachment of 0.67 (+/- 0.59) mm. the mean % of sites showing either attachment gain or loss > or = 2 mm was computed for each treatment/test species group. high test species subjects receiving tetracycline exhibited the best ratio of gaining to losing sites (16.2), followed by low test species subjects receiving augmentin (14.1). periodontal pockets < 7 mm pre-therapy in low test species subjects treated with  augmentin and high test species subjects treated with tetracycline showed attachment gain more frequently than attachment loss. the greatest proportion of  gaining sites was seen at pockets > 6 mm, particularly in subjects receiving adjunctive tetracycline. overall, the data indicated that a gain in mean attachment level post-therapy was significantly associated (p < 0.001) with an increase in c. ochracea accompanied by a decrease in b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. the 4 test species were decreased more in subjects receiving tetracycline. in contrast, augmentin appeared to be effective  in decreasing the % sites colonized by a. actinomycetemcomitans and in increasing the proportion of sites colonized by c. ochracea. knowledge of the baseline microbiota should improve the choice of an appropriate adjunctive antibiotic for  periodontal therapy.

TI  == host defensive functions in a family manifesting early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == family case studies help us identify host risk factors in periodontal disease. in this study we examine a family consisting of a mother (40 years old, with rapidly progressive periodontitis), her elder daughter (14 years old, with localized juvenile periodontitis), and younger daughter (13 years old, with simple gingivitis). we examined 1) the peripheral neutrophil functions (chemotactic migration, phagocytosis, superoxide production); 2) lymphocyte functions (proliferative activity and cytokine productivity of t cells, immunoglobulin [ig] m productivity of b cells when stimulated with pokeweed mitogen); 3) phenotypic analyses of peripheral lymphocyte subpopulations; 4) serum igg antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria; and 5) serological type of hla class ii. all the subjects exhibited high t4/t8 ratios due to high percentage of cd4-positive cells, showed high igg titers to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and had a  hla dqw1 in common. the mother showed a slight deficiency of neutrophil chemotactic migration to n-formyl methyonyl leucyl phenylalanin (fmlp), raised interleukin-2 productivity of t cell, and high levels of igg titers to porphyromonus gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum. both daughters showed weak  t cell proliferative response to anti-cd3 monoclonal antibody and low igm productivity. low lymphocyte responsiveness may be involved in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease of these daughters; therefore, the lymphocyte dysfunctions shown should be considered in relation to the progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == prevalence of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from romanian adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine by standard cultivation procedures  the detection frequencies of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and capnocytophaga species as well as various enteric rods in subgingival plaque samples form romanian adult periodontitis patients. dna probe  analysis (affirm dp microbial identification test) was also used, parallel to cultivation, to identify p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus, in deep (> or = 6 mm) and intermediate (4-5 mm) pockets in some of the subjects investigated. paper points were used to sample 86 deep pockets in 36 patients and 27 intermediate pockets in 9 of the 36 patients. the chi 2 test was  used to test for significance of differences between results obtained by cultivation and dna analysis in both intermediate and deep pockets. p. gingivalis was recovered in a high percentage of the patients (75.8%) and sites (63.6%) examined, followed by p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans,  respectively. capnocytophaga species were present in almost all subjects. enteric rods were recovered in 61.1% of the patients and 55.8% of the sites. except for this high prevalence of enteric rods, the present group of patients had the periodontal species monitored in %s similar to those commonly perceived in the west. the affirm dp test and cultivation showed poor correlation in detecting p.  gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. forsythus. the cultivation prevalence of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in deep pockets was similar to their prevalence in intermediate ones. overall, the prevalence of the periodontal pathogens investigated in the present romanian periodontitis patients is similar  to what has been revealed in matching norwegian and other western periodontitis patient populations. the high prevalence of enteric rods in the romanian patients may have been an artifact resulting from prolonged transport of the samples in vmga iii.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil and monocyte defensive functions by nicotine.
AB  == to learn more about the effects of smokeless tobacco on the defensive functions of neutrophils, we studied the influence of nicotine on these cells in vitro, looking at their bactericidal activity against oral pathogens, and at their ability to produce microbicidal reactive oxygen species (oxygen radicals). exposure of human blood neutrophils to nicotine (0.01% to 0.1%) inhibited their ability to kill actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. although these concentrations of nicotine are high, such concentrations are relevant to phagocytes in the gingival sulcus, because smokeless tobacco contains 0.5% to 3.5% nicotine by dry weight. nicotine had no such inhibitory effect when the killing assay was performed in an anaerobic environment, implying that nicotine preferentially affected oxygen-dependent killing mechanisms. to further investigate the effects of nicotine on production  of oxygen radicals, neutrophils were primed with lipopolysaccharide and triggered with f-met-leu-phe or phorbol ester in the presence of nicotine. nicotine inhibited production of superoxide anion (measured by reduction of cytochrome c)  and hydrogen peroxide (measured by oxidation of phenol red). nicotine inhibition  of superoxide production was reversible by washing away the nicotine. by observing that nicotine inhibited the reduction of cytochrome c by reagent potassium superoxide, we determined that nicotine directly absorbed superoxide. in addition, by examining nicotine inhibition of the uptake of oxygen by neutrophils, we determined that nicotine also interfered with the production of oxygen radicals by these cells. nicotine also inhibited production of superoxide  and interleukin-1 beta by monocytes. nicotine did not affect the viability of neutrophils and monocytes, as determined by their ability to exclude trypan blue  dye. inhibition of the aerobic antimicrobial functions of neutrophils and monocytes by nicotine may alter the microbial ecology of the oral cavity, and this might be one mechanism by which nicotine compromises the oral health of users of tobacco products.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == comparative virulence of periodontopathogens in a mouse abscess model.
AB  == objective(s): this report compares the virulence of selected strains of p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum and t. denticola in a murine model as a measure of pathogenic potential of these oral microorganisms. the characteristics of the tissue destruction associated with these monoinfections were then related to a potential model for bacterial synergism in  progressing periodontitis. design and methods: all bacterial strains were grown to mid-logarithmic to early stationary growth phase, harvested and used at various doses to challenge balb/c normal and balb/c dexamethasone (dex) treated mice to mimic a neutrophil dysfunction. the characteristics of tissue destruction, and overt tissue destructive capacity of these species were examined as a function of challenge dose and time. outcome measures: the mice were examined for an interval of approximately 15 days post-challenge and the presence/absence of lesions, localized or generalized nature of the lesion (including size in mm2), and lethality of the infection were assessed. results: comparison of the virulence of the various p. gingivalis strains related to lethality and lesion size associated with destruction of the connective tissue, indicated a virulence capacity of p. gingivalis strains 53977>w50 = t22>3079>33277>381. c. rectus elicited localized necrotic lesions which were limited to the epithelial layers of the skin. the size of the lesions also indicated a graded difference in virulence, such that c. rectus strains 234>576>>33238. a. actinomycetemcomitans caused the formation of classic localized abscesses with a pmn infiltrate and inflammatory exudates. although each of the a. actinomycetemcomitans strains exhibited a similar virulence pattern in this murine model, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b representative  strains were potentially more pathogenic with a virulence capacity of 3113d-n = 3975a>jp2 > or = y4>29523>33384. both c. rectus and a. actinomycetemcomitans strains showed clear evidence that recent clinical isolates were more virulent than laboratory strains. challenge with f. nucleatum resulted in tissue destructive responses which were different from those observed with the other strains used in this study. a rapid onset of dose-dependent lesion development, related to the formation of either closed abscesses or open lesions, was observed with f. nucleatum. tissue involvement was also greater at lower f. nucleatum doses when compared to the other bacteria. f. nucleatum challenge of dex-treated  mice resulted in a shift to open lesions. t. denticola appeared to be more tissue invasive than the other species examined in this study. challenge of mice with t. denticola resulted in involvement of multiple tissues, including epithelial and connective tissues, as well as appearing to invade muscle layers and deeper tissues. in addition to invading deeper tissues, the resulting lesions took considerably longer to resolve. in the dex-treated mice (neutrophil depleted), p. gingivalis, c. rectus, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly more virulent. in contrast, while dex treatment altered the characteristics of lesions caused by f. nucleatum, the extent of lesions produced by f. nucleatum and t. denticola was not substantially enhanced. conclusions: the results obtained from  this study suggest that different microorganisms have the ability to provide individual pathologies which may act in an additive/synergistic fashion contributing to the tissue destruction noted in periodontitis.

AB  == in a 12-month multi-center study of 116 adult periodontitis subjects, six putative periodontal pathogens were monitored by dna probe methods in a subset of 31 subjects. monitored species included porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), eikenella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) with an  average detection limit of 1.8 x 10(4) bacterial colony forming units/sample. the microbiological response to four periodontal treatments was studied, one treatment in each quadrant; scaling and root planing (s), scaling and root planing with tetracycline (tc) fiber (sf), a single application of tc fiber (f) and two serial applications of tc fiber (ff). generally two sites were sampled in each quadrant, however, in some quadrants only one site was selected. these treatments were evaluated at baseline; immediately following therapy; and post-treatment at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. the study was conducted with a split-mouth design with no maintenance therapy over a 12-month period. at baseline, 70.8% of sites had detectable fn; 42.9% pg; 63.5% pi; 29.7% ec; 28.3% cr; and 5.5% aa. no significant differences were seen in baseline proportions of  these species between centers. numbers and proportions of detectable pathogens (with the exception of pg) exhibited a triphasic temporal response: a precipitous initial decrease immediately following therapy; a rise in proportions in the 1- to 3-month post-therapy period; and a spontaneous decline in the absence of therapy over the 3- to 12-month period.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == occurrence of certain bacterial species and morphotypes in juvenile periodontitis in chile.
AB  == the occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga species, and certain bacterial morphotypes was determined in 18 affected and 18 unaffected sites in 10 localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients, and in 10 affected and 10 unaffected sites in 5 generalized juvenile periodontitis (gjp) patients. the subgingival proportion of  the 7 bacterial species was determined by selective and nonselective culturing. the results showed that when considering the pure prevalence of bacteria ( > 0%)  there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in the subgingival plaque microflora of the affected sites versus those of the unaffected sites for p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, c. rectus, and f. nucleatum in ljp, and for p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum in gjp. the mean proportions of cocci, motile rods and spirochetes were also significantly different (p < 0.05) in affected sites compared to unaffected sites. capnocytophaga sp, f. nucleatum, p. intermedia, and e. corrodens were found in more than 75% of affected sites in ljp. when taking the approach that an organism, to be associated with periodontal disease, has to be detected above a certain minimum threshold, the results indicated that bacteria most frequently associated with ljp and gjp in chile are p. gingivalis (66% of ljp and 80% of gjp affected sites), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (44% of ljp and 50% in gjp affected sites). different bacterial species may be judged to be important in the disease  process depending upon whether a pure bacterial prevalence, or a prevalence above a certain detection level, is considered.

TI  == effect of whole oral bacteria and extracted lipopolysaccharides on peripheral blood leukocyte interleukin-2 receptor expression.
AB  == expression of the interleukin-2 receptor (il-2r) on t cells is the molecular mechanism that initiates the g0 to g1 transition and is the critical first step for t cell proliferation in response to antigen. the effect of whole periodontal  bacteria and lipopolysaccharides (lps) on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (pbmc) il-2r expression was examined in vitro. lps induced a modest but significant increase in high affinity il-2r alpha/beta (p55/p75 positive) expression on pbmc over untreated cells after 48 h culture. addition of lps to pbmc cultures depleted of monocytes had no effect on il-2r expression compared to untreated cultures. interleukin-1 (il-1) caused a similar effect to lps in 48 h pbmc cultures but il-1 also increased high affinity il-2r expression in cultures  depleted of adherent mononuclear cells. when antibody to il-1 was simultaneously  added with lps to pbmc cultures, the high affinity il-2r inductive effect was reversed at 48 h, suggesting that the lps effect on pbmc il-2r was indirect, via  monocytes. whole pathogenic oral bacteria cultured with pbmc at high (100:1), but not low (10:1) bacteria:pbmc ratios had a similar effect to lps, inducing high affinity il-2r expression at 48 h. increases in soluble il-2r alpha were also measured in supernatants of pbmc incubated with periodontal bacteria compared to  untreated controls. in this system, a critical threshold of bacteria was required to activate pbmc perhaps related to the quantity of cell-surface lps presented to adherent mononuclear cells.

TI  == effect of periodontal treatments on serum igg antibody titers against periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == serum igg antibody titers to 7 periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis patients were measured at the 1st visit and after various periodontal treatments  with clinically successful improvement, in order to evaluate what kind of factors are associated with changes of serum antibody titers. 20 patients (10 male and 10 female from 23 to 61 years old) with adult, rapidly progressive periodontitis were enrolled in this study. all patients received initial preparation and most of them also underwent surgical procedure. after the treatments, the mean probing pocket depths decreased from 3.72 mm to 1.56 mm. serum samples were collected from patients at the initial and final examinations. serum igg antibody titers against sonicated antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis fdc 381, prevotella intermedia atcc 25611, prevotella loescheii atcc 15930, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies nucleatum atcc 25586, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans fdc y4, eikenella corrodens fdc 1073 and capnocytophaga ochracea # m 12 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the mean antibody titers to p. gingivalis and p. intermedia decreased significantly after the treatment as compared to their pretreatment levels. the antibody titer to p. gingivalis, especially, decreased in all of the patients examined. a significant relationship was found between the decreased antibody titer to p. gingivalis and the number of teeth which received periodontal surgery, as well as treatment length, and the relationship between the decreased antibody titer to p. intermedia and the number of extracted teeth was also significant. these results suggest that the changes of serum igg titers against p. gingivalis and p. intermedia are related to the suppression of such pathogens in subgingival plague.

TI  == molecular and immunological characterization of a 64-kda protein of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == the 64-kda protein to which about half the sera from patients with localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis reacted strongly was purified from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4. determination of the n-terminal sequence of the protein revealed that it was a groel-like protein. the dna fragment containing the groel gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans was amplified  by polymerase chain reaction, and the groesl operon was cloned by using colony hybridization with the amplified fragment from a. actinomycetemcomitans chromosomal dna. sequence analysis revealed that structures of the operon and its products were typical in gram-negative bacteria. rabbit polyclonal antibodies to  the 64-kda protein cross-reacted with approximately 65-kda proteins of haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus influenzae, haemophilus paraphrophilus, escherichia coli and eikenella corrodens but not with any cellular proteins of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum. it is possible that antibodies reactive to the 64-kda protein in periodontitis patients are induced by the cross-reactivity with the hsp60 proteins of other bacteria.

TI  == some suspected periodontopathogens and serum antibody response in adult long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics.
AB  == the subgingival microflora and serum antibody response were examined in long-duration insulin-dependent diabetics and age- and sex-matched non-diabetics. the material consisted of 9 diabetics aged 40-49 years and 19 aged 50-59 years, 13 non-diabetics aged 40-49 years and 21 aged 50-59 years. the bacterial species  studied (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia) were recovered in diabetics as well as in non-diabetics. significantly more diabetics in both age groups harboured p. gingivalis compared to non-diabetics. prevalence of p. gingivalis was associated  with deepened periodontal pockets among non-diabetics but not among diabetics. in diabetics and non-diabetics, the serum antibody titres for most antigens were similar.

TI  == succession of putative peri-implant pathogens after root-form and plate-form implant placement in partially dentate adult monkeys.
AB  == this report describes the succession of putative peri-implant pathogens in partially dentate monkeys after dental implantation and prosthetic reconstruction. tooth and implant (6 root-end form, 4 blade-vent implants) sites  in eight monkeys were monitored microbiologically and clinically during the pre-implant stage, abutment connection stage, bridge placement stage, and three and six months after the bridge placement stage. tooth and implant sites were cleaned monthly post-extraction. microbiological studies included dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and primary phenotypic characterization of culture isolates. after implant surgery, the median proportion of several putative peri-implant pathogens studied were significantly  elevated. following fixture placement, p. intermedia replaced p. melaninogenica as the predominant black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (bpab) in the mouth. after abutment connection stage, levels of p. intermedia, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f.  nucleatun, haemophilus sp. and spirochetes were significantly elevated at implant and tooth sites. three months after bridge installations, p. intermedia and a. actinomycetemcomitans remained significantly elevated at implant sites. at six months after bridge installation, levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans declined significantly relative to levels at three months.  porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes were not significantly elevated although their  levels correlated with gingival redness. p. intermedia, porphyromonas sp. and spirochetes levels correlated significantly with probing depth. correlation was detected between p. gingivalis and spirochetes; and between a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum. our studies show a transitional increase  in levels of several organisms resembling putative pathogens of human peri-implant infection, associated with implant placements in partially edentulous mouths and supports early prophylactic interventions to control their  levels.

TI  == bacterial-stimulated cytokine production of peripheral mononuclear cells from patients of various periodontitis categories.
AB  == periodontitis is a general term for disease categories, including juvenile periodontitis (jp), rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp), and adult periodontitis (ap), which may or may not share a common etiology and pathogenesis. these disease categories are characterized by differences in progression of tissue destruction and differences in age group susceptibility, but not, to our knowledge, by differences in cytokine responses of inflammatory cells. the present study examined blood cell counts and interindividual variation in the ability of pbmc of patients in three different categories of periodontitis to produce cytokines after stimulation with different oral bacterial species in vitro. the ap group had a significantly lower production of il-1ra when stimulated with porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.) (p < 0.05). streptococcus sanguis (s.s.), which is associated with normal periodontal conditions, induced extremely high levels of il-1 alpha and tnf alpha production in all groups. the rpp group had a significantly higher number of monocytes (mc) than the ap group (p < 0.05). additionally, jp patients had a significantly higher concentration of polymorphonuclear granulocytes compared to juvenile controls (p < 0.05). in conclusion, il-1 alpha, tnf alpha, or il-6 production by peripheral blood mc after in vitro stimulation with oral bacterial type stains may not distinguish different categories of periodontitis. the results support the hypothesis that the cytokine il-1ra is produced in different concentrations in the two groups: rpp and ap. furthermore, elevated mc concentration in the rpp group compared to the ap group may be an important pathogenic feature in rpp.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == comparative detection frequency of 6 putative periodontal pathogens in sudanese and norwegian adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == cytotoxicity in bacterial cultures: interaction and cell-specificity, possible factors in periodontal disease.
AB  == cytotoxicity in culture media of various growing bacterial strains was estimated  by cr-51 release of labelled target-cells. interaction studies were made by adding each of the different uv-killed bacteria to the medium with viable bacteria. the reference oral bacterial strains were: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus mitis, which were compared with the reference bacteria staphylococcus aureus 209 and staphylococcus epidermidis. the target cells were:  gingival fibroblasts (gf), periodontal membrane fibroblasts (pmf), pulpal fibroblasts (pf), hela-cells (hela), and lymphoid neoplasm cells (ln). synergistic, as well as antagonistic, effects on target cells were observed. the  cytotoxicity of a. actinomycetemcomitans in presence of p. gingivalis is neutralized while in presence of s. aureus it was increased. bacterial interactions with f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis cytotoxicity were observed. the  cytotoxicity of f. nucleatum was increased when cultured together with a. actinomycetemcomitans. each cell type reacted differently to the toxicity of the  supernatant of growth medium in which the same bacterial strain had been cultivated, which indicates cell specificity of the toxins.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

AB  == the purposes of this study were two-fold: to compare the dna probe and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) microbial identification tests and correlate the levels of microorganisms with adult periodontitis. a single plaque sample were taken from each of 2 sites in 52 patients. twelve of these patients were also sampled during and after treatment. the experimental site had clinical indicators of disease (bleeding on probing, probing and attachment loss of > or = 6 mm) and the contralateral site (control) was clinically healthy. a total of 176 plaque samples were collected, divided, processed, and sent for both types of quantitative microbial analyses. all of these samples were used to compare the dna probe and elisa methods while only the initial 104 pretreatment sites were used to correlate microorganisms/method with clinical indicators of adult periodontitis. dna probes were used to assay for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, and c. rectus. an elisa utilizing monoclonal antibodies was used to assay for p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, t. denticola, and c. rectus. comparison of the two methods revealed that the elisa test identified p. gingivalis and c. rectus significantly more often than the dna probe method and that t. denticola was detected more frequently with the dna probe. the sensitivities and specificities  varied widely among organisms and by test. p. gingivalis, as identified by elisa, had the highest degree of sensitivity and specificity (0.90 and 0.82 respectively) to clinical indicators of adult periodontitis.

TI  == adherence of oral microorganisms to guided tissue membranes: an in vitro study.
AB  == microorganisms can adhere and colonize on an exposed guided tissue regeneration (gtr) membrane thus developing a nidus of infection. the purpose of this study was to compare early bacterial adhesion to three different gtr membranes. expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyglactin 910, and collagen were used as the  test membranes. in part i of this study 15 different oral microbes were used to compare their relative ability to adhere to the membranes. six of the most strongly adherent bacteria (actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and selenomonas sputigena) were selected for part ii of  this study. the membranes were placed in tubes containing broth cultures containing identical concentrations (1 x 10(8) cells/ml) of these bacteria at 37  degrees c. membranes were placed in tubes of media without bacteria as controls.  at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours, the bacterial cultures were decanted and the membranes in the tubes were agitated gently in reduced transfer fluid (rtf) 4 times to remove non-adherent bacteria. each tube was then sonicated for 30 seconds in 10 ml rtf to detach adherent bacteria. the detached adherent bacteria were counted using a petroff-hausser chamber. data were analyzed by using the sas program. analysis of variance was used to test for differences between multiple means. results showed s. mutans had the strongest attachment to the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours. selenomonas sputigena had the lowest adherence capability to all test membranes. polyglactin 910 had significantly (p < 0.05) lower s. mutants adherence than either the eptfe or the collagen membrane at 4 and 6 hours.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == relationship between salivary blood group antigens, microbial flora and periodontal condition in young adults.
AB  == to investigate a possible role for salivary blood-group antigens in the relative  frequencies of selected periodontal pathogens and commensal oral micro-organisms, we studied the clinical and microbiological condition in young adults with or without blood group reactive substances in saliva (secretors or non-secretors respectively). clinical measurements were recorded at the ramfjord teeth in 81 1st-year dental students. in addition, presence of interproximal loss of attachment (la) was assessed at sites with a pocket depth of > or = 4 mm. microbiological samples were taken from one of the ramfjord teeth (site without interproximal la), from interproximal sites of > or = 4 mm in conjunction with la, and from the saliva. the samples were analyzed for the presence of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. clinically, no statistically significant differences were found in the periodontal status between secretors (78% of our population) and non-secretors. furthermore, the occurrence of the monitored micro-organisms was not correlated to the secretor status. it is concluded that bacterial colonization with the micro-organisms tested in this study, apparently occurred independent of secretor status. among the periodontal  pathogens, only p. intermedia was more frequently recovered from the saliva of subjects with interproximal la (49%) than in those without (33%; p = 0.03). this  finding was irrespective of the secretor status. therefore, p. intermedia may be  an important micro-organism in relation to the onset of periodontal destruction in young adults.

AB  == a cross-sectional periodontal study of 74 subjects aged 65 to 75 years was performed. clinical data were collected and related to microbiological and immunological data. a statistical model (step-wise multiple regression) of factors related to bone loss was created initially using clinical data only; then by adding either the microbiologic or immunologic data; and then by using clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic data together. when only clinical data were considered, three factors were found to have significant positive correlations with bone loss. tooth mobility accounted for 17% of the variability  in the alveolar bone level measurements, probing depth for 12%(r2), and plaque index for 3%, for a total of 32% of the variability explained by these clinical factors. tooth mobility and probing depth were clinical factors which remained significant in the model when the microbiological data were also considered. as percentages of the total cultivable microbiota, e. corrodens (r2 = 14%) and black-pigmenting prevotella intermedia (r2 = 4%) correlated positively with alveolar bone loss. the addition of the microbiologic data only increased the r2  to 33%. when immunological data were considered with the clinical data, pocket depth and tooth mobility were the clinical parameters which remained in the model. igg antibody levels to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 24%) a. actinomycetemcomitans 627 (r2 = 2%) were the significant immunologic measures having a positive correlation with bone loss. anti-f. nucleatum levels had a significant negative correlation. a total of 50% of the variability in alveolar bone level was accounted for in the model by the addition of specific serum antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms. when clinical, microbiological, and immunological measurements were all considered together, antibody to p. gingivalis w83 and/or 381 (r2 = 42%), percentage of b-lymphocytes  (r2 = 3%), probing depth (r2 = 4%), anti-e. corrodens levels (r2 = 2%), and anti-p. gingivalis 33277 levels (r2 = 4%) all had significant positive correlation with loss of alveolar bone. the number of enteric bacteria, anti-f. nucleatum levels, and anti-p. intermedia levels each had a significant negative correlation with alveolar bone heights. the r2 for this model was 75%. these results indicated that antibody levels to subgingival plaque microorganisms and tooth mobility were the best predictors of bone loss in the elderly patients tested in this study.

TI  == dna probe detection of periodontopathogens in advanced periodontitis.
AB  == species-specific dna probes were used to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, prevotella  intermedia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and wolinella recta in subgingival plaque from deep pockets/sites of patients with advanced periodontitis. the subjects were 20 patients with severe adult periodontitis, 13 men and 7 women (mean age 45.6 +/- 6.7 yr). for each subject, 9-10 subgingival sites with the deepest probing depths from each quadrant were sampled by the paper point method, a total of 198 sites, with mean probing depth  7.2 +/- 1.6 mm and clinical attachment level 9.5 +/- 2.7 mm. a.a. was present in  at least one site in 75% of the subjects; p. gingivalis was found in 95%; p. intermedia and w. recta were found in 90%, respectively; and t. denticola, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were found in all subjects. in the 198 samples, a.a.  was detected in 25.8%, p. gingivalis in 51.5%, p. intermedia in 64.1%, t. denticola in 60.6%, e. corrodens in 72.9%, f. nucleatum in 74.7%, and w. recta in 65.7%. the predominant combination was the simultaneous presence of p. intermedia, t. denticola, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and w. recta in 89.5% of the subjects and 46.8% of the sites. of these sites, 51.1% showed the combined presence of p. gingivalis and 28.4% that of both a.a. and p. gingivalis. none of  the seven bacteria could be detected in 14.4% of the total sites sampled. the present study indicates that severe destructive adult periodontitis is a multibacterial infection and that certain combinations of periodontopathogens seem to be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == a comparison of two transport media for saliva and subgingival samples.
AB  == this study has shown that microorganisms associated with caries (mutans streptococci, lactobacilli) and marginal periodontitis (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) in pure culture can be stored in vmga or reduced transport fluid and be recovered sufficiently after 24 h. sufficient recovery after 24 h of mail transport was also obtained in 37 saliva samples obtained from adults and 80 subgingival samples from a group of patients before and 3, 6 and 15 months after periodontal treatment. the samples transported in vmga iii showed in comparison to the samples transported in reduced transport fluid a higher recovery rate as well as a higher percentage of  the total viable count for investigated anaerobic species. this was explained by  the different composition of the two media and also by the gel consistency of vmga iii, which maintains a low redox-potential even during transport after transferring a sample into the medium. in a few samples aerobic bacteria increased in both media.

TI  == association between cigarette smoking, bacterial pathogens, and periodontal status.
AB  == the purposes of this study were to determine if: 1) an association exists between cigarette smoking and signs of periodontal disease after controlling for the confounding variables of age, sex, plaque, and calculus; 2) the prevalence of 5 bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease differs between smokers and non-smokers; and 3) the presence of any of these bacteria or smoking are associated with a mean proximal posterior probing depth > or = 3.5 mm. plaque, calculus, gingivitis, and probing depth were measured at the proximal surfaces of all teeth in one randomly selected posterior dental sextant in 615 adults. subgingival plaque was sampled from the same sites and assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum. a subsample of non-smokers (n = 126), who were similar to smokers (n = 63) with respect to age,  sex, plaque, and calculus, was randomly drawn from the original sample. these two groups were then compared on the basis of clinical and microbial parameters. the  results indicated that the odds of having a mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm were 5 times greater for smokers than the non-smoker subsample (odds ratio = 5.3; 95%  ci = 2.0 to 13.8). no statistically significant difference in the prevalence of any of the bacteria was found between smokers and the non-smoker subsample. based on logistic regression analyses of each of the 5 bacteria and smoking, mean probing depth > or = 3.5 mm was significantly associated with the presence of a.  actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, e. corrodens, and smoking (p < 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == antiseptic mouthrinse-induced microbial cell surface alterations.
AB  == this study determined the effect of an essential oil-containing mouthrinse, listerine antiseptic, on microbial cell surface morphology using scanning electron microscopy. twenty-four hour cultures of c. albicans, a. viscosus, s. sanguis, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were harvested and washed in  buffer. triplicate samples were overlaid on poly-l-lysine coated coverslips, immersed in either listerine or buffer for 30 seconds, fixed in glutaraldehyde followed by post-fixing in 1% osmium tetroxide, dehydrated, and embedded in peldri ii. exposure of the microorganisms to listerine antiseptic for 30 seconds  resulted in distinct morphological alterations of cell surfaces suggestive of loss of cell surface integrity. the extent of alteration varied among the structurally different species; cell surface roughening was mild in s. sanguis but extensive in the other microorganisms which developed distinct surface blebs  and other abnormalities after the 30-second exposure. these results suggest that  a brief exposure to listerine produces significant morphological changes which may be associated with cell death and may help explain the alteration of surface-associated activities demonstrated in previous studies.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of prevention mouthrinse.
AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == role of suspected periodontopathogens in microbiological monitoring of periodontitis.
AB  == periodontal disease is the clinical result of a complex interaction between the host and plaque bacteria. although a specificity to some degree is found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), it has been difficult to obtain evidence for a specific etiological role of the bacteria associated with periodontal disease in adults. what we see is the net result of host-parasite interactions which in an unpredictable moment accumulate  and exceed the threshold of tissue integrity. this hypothesis is concomitant with the view of periodontal disease as a polymicrobial infection, predominantly anaerobic, which occurs commonly in the oral cavity or elsewhere in the body. some micro-organisms (risk markers) occur more frequently than others and may significantly determine the outcome of this host-parasite interaction. microbiological sampling and analysis seem to be of limited value in risk assessment; however, they can be used as tools in diagnosis in ljp patients and acute infections, and in treatment decision and therapy control in "refractory" patients. suspected pathogens (risk markers) are actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and some species of spirochetes, while the roles of prevotella intermedia, bacteroidesforsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and peptostreptococcus micros are more uncertain. the presence of periodontopathogens as well as enterics, staphylococcus aureus and candida especially, should be considered in patients with systemic individual disorders--e.g., diabetes mellitus, neutropenia, agranulocytosis, and aids--or with implants.

TI  == microbial associations in periodontitis sites before and after treatment.
AB  == duplicate samples from 110 periodontal sites of 6 mm or more pocket depth in 16 patients were analyzed for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga spp., campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and fusobacterium nucleatum. the sites  were sampled before and after nonsurgical periodontal treatment. no statistically significant associations were found before treatment between any of the analyzed  species. after treatment, statistically significant associations were found between e. corrodens and all the other species, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia; capnocytophaga spp. and c. rectus; p. intermedia vs capnocytophaga spp. and p. gingivalis; and c. rectus vs capnocytophaga spp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans. some of these associations could be explained either by patient-related factors or site-related characteristics such as the pocket depth. the proportion of p. gingivalis seemed to be unrelated to the proportion of p. intermedia in the samples. if one of the analyzed microbes was found in one of the sampled pockets  in a patient, the probability of finding that microbe in all the sampled sites in the same patient before treatment was more than 50%. this probability was reduced after treatment for many species, especially p. gingivalis, which showed a probability of zero. the probability of detecting a bacterial species on at least one additional site if it was present on one in the same individual was nearly 100%, both before and after treatment, for all species studied. this study has shown several potential microbial associations in the subgingival plaque flora of deep periodontal pockets.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == macaca nemestrina: a non-human primate model for studies of periodontal disease.
AB  == the non-human primate macaca nemestrina was evaluated for use as a potential model in periodontal research by study of 16 animals. using one incisor, premolar, and molar per quadrant, we measured supragingival plaque, severity of gingival inflammation, and pocket depth, and analyzed the subgingival flora. serum igg titers and avidities to antigens of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg) and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were also assessed. ten animals were between 13 and 24 years old, and six were between 4 and 5 years old. while mean gingival inflammation scores were significantly higher for older than for younger animals (2.2 vs 1.8, p < 0.05), mean plaque index scores and mean probing depths  did not differ significantly. the animals harbored a subgingival microflora considered to be pathogenic for humans including aa, pg, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia i and ii, campylobacter recta and fusobacterium nucleatum.  aa, however, was found only in the younger animals. all of the animals had serum  igg antibodies reactive with antigens of pg and aa, and titers for pg but not for aa were significantly higher in the older relative to the younger animals (t test p < 0.02). in contrast, antibody avidity did not significantly differ between the two groups. a combined clinical assessment index based on maximum probing depth,  gingival index score, and tooth loss was used to assess the overall disease severity. titers were positively associated with disease severity (spearman's rank correlation 0.57, p = 0.02).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sensitization of periodontopathogenic bacteria to killing by light from a low-power laser.
AB  == cultures of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans were treated with a range of photosensitizers and then exposed to light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon laser for up to 80 s. toluidine blue o (25 micrograms/ml) and methylene blue (25 micrograms/ml) were effective lethal photosensitizers of all 3 target organisms, enabling substantial light dose-related reductions in viable counts. dihaematoporphyrin ester and aluminium  disulphonated phthalocyanine were lethal photosensitizers only of p. gingivalis.  in the absence of a photosensitizer, exposure to laser light had no significant effect on the viability of the cultures. if such low doses of light (22 j/cm2) are effective at killing bacteria in vivo, the technique may be useful as a means of eliminating periodontopathogenic bacteria from diseased sites.

TI  == the effect of subgingival debridement on periodontal disease parameters and the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to analyse the effect of subgingival scaling and root planing in subjects who prior to treatment exercised meticulous  supragingival plaque control. 300 subjects were examined at baseline and after 1  and 2 years without treatment. after the year 2 examination, 62 subjects were randomly selected for therapy. they were given detailed instruction in proper self-performed toothcleaning measures and were carefully monitored during the subsequent 2 years. following the year-4 examination, 2 quadrants, 1 maxillary and 1 mandibular in each subject, were randomly selected for additional therapy.  the teeth in the selected quadrants were exposed to subgingival scaling and root  planing. the subgingival therapy was repeated until a site no longer bled on gentle probing. this basic therapy was completed within a 2-month period. all subjects were re-examined after another 12-month interval. the examinations at year 4 and 5 included assessment of plaque, gingivitis, probing pocket depth and  analysis of samples obtained from the subgingival microbiota at 134 selected sites. the findings from the present study demonstrated: (i) that subgingival scaling and root planing were effective in eliminating subgingival plaque and gingivitis; (ii) that professional therapy resulted in a pronounced reduction of  probing depth at sites which at year 4 had a probing depth > 3 mm; (iii) that in  non-scaled quadrants, the extension of self-performed plaque control resulted in  a continued improvement of the periodontal conditions at sites which at year 4 were < 5 mm deep.

AB  == subgingival plaque samples from patients with chronic periodontitis were exposed  to light from a 7.3 mw helium/neon laser for 30 s in the presence and absence of  50 micrograms/ml toluidine blue o as a photosensitizer. viable counts of various  groups and species of bacteria were carried out before and after irradiation. the median numbers of viable bacteria initially present in the 30-microliters aliquots irradiated were 1.13 x 10(5) cfu (aerobes), 4.08 x 10(5) cfu (anaerobes), 4.92 x 10(3) cfu (black-pigmented anaerobes), 4.75 x 10(2) cfu (porphyromonas gingivalis), 6.15 x 10(3) cfu (fusobacterium nucleatum) and 1.7 x  10(4) cfu (streptococci). the dye/laser combination achieved significant reductions in the viability of these organisms, the median reductions in the viable counts being 91.1% for aerobes, 96.6% for anaerobes, 100% for black-pigmented anaerobes, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and 94.2% for streptococci. overall, the viability of bacteria in the 20 plaque samples was not significantly decreased by the dye alone. however, in a small minority of samples there were indications of light-independent, dye-induced toxicity. low-power lasers, in conjunction with appropriate photosensitizers, may be a useful adjunct to mechanical debridement in the treatment of inflammatory periodontal diseases if a similar effectiveness against subgingival plaque bacteria can be achieved in vivo.

AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == monoclonal antibodies to lipopolysaccharide of four oral bacteria associated with periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is a common inflammatory disease which erodes the supporting  structures of the teeth, and is initiated by a subgingival infection with selected gram-negative bacteria. monoclonal antibodies (mab) to lipopolysaccharide (lps) of four periodontal pathogens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis were examined for specificity and their ability to bind these pathogens in a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay (pcfia). the mab selected were specific for their homologous bacteria and when tested against a large battery of other bacteria, including 16 genera and 46 species, were found not to cross-react with heterologous species. when each of the mab was challenged with 40 or more homologous freshly isolated bacteria, more than 90% were positive. non-cellular antigens in the form of soluble lps and extracellular vesicles were examined for their ability to bind to assay components and alter the apparent results of the assay. lps was found to have potential as an interfering agent if bound to assay components prior to sample treatment, but this non-specific binding was significantly reduced when a  surfactant was added to the buffers. extracellular vesicles had no significant effect on the estimation of p. gingivalis by the assay.

AB  == nutrient uptake may contribute to the survival of certain potential periodontopathogens in the competitive environment of the gingival sulcus. this study was conducted to assess the uptake of commercially available, key radiolabelled phosphorylated compounds by treponema denticola. there was a linear relationship in the uptake of atp and g-1-p with cell concentrations of 0.1-2.5 mg of cell dry weight. this uptake reached a steady state within 15 min, and at temperatures of 25-37 degrees c the uptake ranged between 13-21%. at 50 degrees c, or above 50 degrees c the assay cells took up 0-1% of the assay nutrients. the maximum uptake of atp was 47.5, 38 and 47.6 pmoles for serovars a, b and c. g-1-p yielded maximum uptake values of 306, 304, and 306 pmoles respectively. significant uptake of atp, or g-1-p occurred at ph 4.8 for serovars a, or c, while serovar b showed a broad ph range for the uptake of g-1-p. stannous fluoride at a concentration of 0.17 mm enhanced the uptake of atp while chlorhexidine digluconate inhibited the uptake of atp. at concentrations usually  employed (0.05-0.5 mm) the metabolic poisons 2,4-dinitrophenol, sodium azide, sodium arsenite and the atpase inhibitor n,n1-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide did not alter significantly the uptake of atp. the uptake of atp, by actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and t. denticola at ph 4.8 was 13.4, 1.5, 6.9, and 18-20.4%, respectively. at ph 6.5 the uptake for the microorganisms indicated above was 22, 1.3, 6.6 and 6.2%, respectively. g-1-p showed the same trend in its uptake by a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. denticola. this study provides for the first time specific examples of phosphorylated nutrient uptake by potential periodontopathogens, and that the uptake of phosphorylated nutrients can be suppressed by oral hygienic compounds.

TI  == dna probe and enzyme analysis in periodontal diagnostics.
AB  == recent research in periodontology has indicated that a finite number of bacterial species are associated with periodontal disease. this has generated the hypothesis that periodontal disease is essentially an infection due to one or more of the putative periodontopathogens; i.e., the specific plaque hypothesis (sph). this microbial specificity paradigm has already changed the way researchers and some clinicians view periodontal disease. the clinician must heed several cautions signs, however, if he is to use the sph to provide treatment options that could enhance the delivery of care. there are several diagnostic technologies that can be used to detect and semi-quantitate those bacterial species that have been identified as periodontopathogens. this paper discusses diagnostic tests based upon the detection in plaque of dna segments or enzyme activity(ies) that are unique for one or more of the suspected periodontopathogens.

TI  == bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) for the detection of periodontopathogens in plaque.
AB  == a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) was developed to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. the bcfia utilized fluorescent-tagged monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative bacteria. microorganisms identified  in plaque using the bcfia included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. the immunoassay procedure involved combining a patient's plaque sample with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mab and then incubating the mixture in a specialized microtiter plate allowing the mab to bind to its homologous bacteria. bound and unbound fluorescent-tagged mabs were separated by  filtration and total bound bacterial fluorescence was determined with a fluorimeter. the relative number of a bacterial species in a given plaque sample  was estimated by reference to a standard curve carried through the bcfia. the bcfia had a lower detection limit of near 10(4) specific bacterial cells in a mixed bacterial preparation or plaque sample. when compared to cultivable flora procedures in detecting the 4 periodontopathogens, the bcfia had high levels of statistical sensitivity, 97% to 100%, while statistical specificity ranged between 57% and 92%. there was a 71% to 82% agreement between bcfia and dna probe methodology in detecting periodontopathogens in plaque. the bcfia, when compared  to cultivable flora, offers the advantage of evaluating both live and dead bacterial cells in plaque. this may in part, if not fully, explain the lower specificity values of the bcfia when compared to cultivable flora. screening plaque samples for periodontopathic bacteria is considerably faster and results in a greater frequency of detection with bcfia than cultivable flora based methods.

AB  == fifty-one subjects (16-61 years old) with evidence of prior destructive periodontal disease were monitored clinically and immunologically at bi-monthly intervals for up to 5 yr. periodontal disease activity, determined as new attachment loss, was detected in 33 of these subjects. only 4 of 51 subjects failed to show an elevated serum antibody level to any of the 18 subgingival species tested. the antibody level threshold established for periodontally healthy subjects was exceeded most often in diseased subjects with serum antibody to actinobacillus sp., p. gingivalis, e. corrodens, c. concisus, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia in that order. in general, most serum antibody levels to subgingival species remained relatively consistent for periods as long as 5 yr. however, major increases and decreases in antibody could be detected to at most one or two species in individual subjects. in addition, prolonged, steady increases and decreases in antibody to specific species could be detected in certain subjects. these findings suggest that major changes occurring in serum antibody may reflect fluctuations in the nature of the infection. differences were observed in the antibody level to specific species when subjects were divided into subsets on the basis of clinical criteria. these included high levels of antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans y4 in ljp and rpp subjects and to  a. actinomycetemcomitans 29523 in ljp and gjp subjects.

AB  == our previous studies have shown that pyrophosphate (ppi), the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, inhibits the growth of organisms associated with coronal and root surface caries. the purposes of this investigation were to: 1) determine if periodontal pathogens are similarly susceptible to the growth-inhibitory properties of ppi; and 2) determine if combinations of pyrophosphate-sodium dodecyl sulfate (ppi-sds) inhibit growth synergistically. porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus (formerly  wolinella recta) were cultured in appropriate enriched media under anaerobic conditions. inhibition assays were performed in tubes containing media supplemented with ppi and/or sds. a range of concentrations of ppi and sds in 2-fold increments was employed, with each concentration assayed in triplicate. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) analyses revealed all of the bacteria were susceptible to ppi and sds, with mics of 0.67% (25 mm) and 0.01% w/v respectively. combination studies with ppi-sds showed much greater growth inhibition against p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans than achieved with  the agents individually. determination of fractional inhibitory concentration indices indicated a synergistic growth-inhibitory effect. under the constraints of the conditions employed, these studies demonstrate the efficacy of ppi-sds combinations in inhibiting the growth of periodontal pathogens. it is conceivable that these compounds may have clinical benefit as a subgingival irrigant.

TI  == subgingival temperature (iii). relation to microbial counts.
AB  == the present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. at each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species  detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. species enumerated were; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius i and ii, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, p.  micros, s. intermedius, s. sanguis i and ii, v. parvula and w. recta. total viable counts and counts of capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the  primary isolation plates. a total of 1581 samples were evaluated. subject visits  with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of b.  intermedius i and p. micros, and lower mean %s of capnocytophaga sp. sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of b. intermedius i and  ii, a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and b. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often  at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. the 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == microbiology of healthy and diseased periodontal sites in poorly controlled insulin dependent diabetics.
AB  == a group of poorly-controlled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (iddm) patients  were examined in a cross-sectional design for total microbial levels, microbial incidence, and the percent levels of selected periodontal microorganisms. these organisms were selected on the basis of prior reports that associated them with either periodontal disease or health. one periodontally-healthy and one periodontally-diseased site were examined in each iddm patient. increased levels  of the periodontal pathogens prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica spp., bacteroides gracilis, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus (formerly wolinella recta) were found at the periodontal diseased sites. increased prevalence of the organisms p. intermedia, p. melaninogenica spp., and c. rectus were found at the diseased sites. a significantly higher percentage of p. intermedia was found at the sites exhibiting deep pockets and attachment loss.

TI  == the use of dna probes to examine the distribution of subgingival species in subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction.
AB  == the present investigation examined the distribution of 14 subgingival species at  a total of 2299 sites in 90 subjects with different levels of periodontal destruction. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth were anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non selective media. after anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxygenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes. the mean total viable count for all sites in all subjects was 8.3 x 10(6). the probes accounted for an average of 27.8% of the total viable count. the % of subjects in which each species was detected was as follows; v. parvula, 98; b. intermedius i, 98; s. sanguis ii, 96; b. intermedius ii, 95; c. ochracea, 94; b. gingivalis, 91; s. sanguis i, 85; w. recta, 83; f. nucleatum ss. vincentii, 82; s. intermedius, 80; b. forsythus, 76; p. micros, 74; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a, 62 and  a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, 52. the % of sites colonized by each of the  14 test species varied considerably within different subjects. the median number  of sites colonized by different species ranged from 3.6% for a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b to 43.5% for v. parvula. in half the subjects, the mean % of the total viable counts for each of the test species was less than  4%. when subjects were divided on the basis of % of sites at baseline with greater than 3 mm attachment loss, the 14 probes accounted for 29.9% of the microbiota in the localized disease group and 25% in the widespread disease group.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the effect of 3 mouthrinses on plaque and gingivitis development.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 3 mouthrinses, listerine antiseptic (thymol), peridex (chlorhexidine), perimed (povidone iodine and hydrogen peroxide), and a placebo (water) on the development of dental plaque and gingivitis, when used as the only oral hygiene procedure for 14 days. 71 subjects were entered into a randomized, double-blind study. at the baseline examination,  papillary bleeding score (pbs), and plaque index (pi) were registered, after which subjects received supragingival prophylaxis and were assigned to 1 of 4 study cells. subjects were asked to refrain from all oral hygiene procedures except for the supervised 14-day 2 x daily rinsing with the assigned preparation. at day 14, the same clinical parameters were again registered. statistical analysis was performed by a one-way analysis of variance (anova) to compare the 4 groups, followed by duncan's multiple range test to determine specific group differences. at baseline, average pbs and pi scores were similar for all 4 groups. after 14 days, the average pbs for peridex and perimed was significantly  lower than for listerine antiseptic and water. the frequency of interdental units with a pbs greater than 2 was significantly lower for peridex and perimed than for listerine antiseptic and water. we concluded that both peridex and perimed were effective in reducing plaque and gingivitis when used as a 2 x daily mouthrinse by subjects refraining from other oral hygiene procedures. in vitro, a synergistic effect was assumed when inhibition was achieved with perimed at the same or greater dilution than was achieved with povidone-iodine alone.

TI  == relation of baseline microbial parameters to future periodontal attachment loss.
AB  == the relationship between the level of subgingival species at baseline and subsequent attachment loss in a subject was examined. 38 subjects (14-71 years) with prior evidence of periodontal destruction were monitored 2x for pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth at baseline and 2 months. a subject was considered to exhibit new attachment loss if 1 or more sites increased 3 mm or more in attachment level in 2 months. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the baseline visit from the mesial aspect of each tooth (28 sites) using gracey curettes. samples were dispersed, diluted and plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, the colonies were lifted onto nylon filters, lysed and the dna fixed to the filters.  digoxygenin-labeled dna probes were used to enumerate 14 subgingival species. 17  of 38 subjects (44.7%) exhibited new attachment loss in 2 months. the % of the total viable count of each species was averaged for each subject. the species enumerated and the mean % of the total cultivable microbiota averaged across the  active and inactive subjects were as follows; b gingivalis 2.3, 1.2; w. recta 1.3, 0.6; b. intermedius i 2.5, 2.0; b. forsythus 1.5, 1.2; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a 1.1, 0.8; f. nucleatum ss vincentii 1.1, 1.0; s. intermedius 2.0, 1.9; p. micros 1.5, 1.5; b. intermedius ii 1.6, 1.7; a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b 0.4, 0.6; s. sanguis i 1.8, 2.1; s. sanguis ii 2.7, 3.0; v. parvula 3.9, 4.2; c. ochracea 0.9, 1.8.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == fluorescence immunoassay for detecting periodontal bacterial pathogens in plaque.
AB  == a particle concentration fluorescence immunoassay has been modified into a bacterial concentration fluorescence immunoassay (bcfia) to rapidly detect periodontopathic bacteria in human plaque samples. the bcfia utilizes fluorescently tagged monoclonal antibodies (mabs) directed against the lipopolysaccharide of selected gram-negative plaque bacteria. microorganisms closely associated with periodontal disease that can be identified in plaque with the bcfia include porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens. briefly, the procedure involved mixing a patient's plaque sample or other bacterial preparation with a species-specific fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled mab in a specialized microtiter plate. this mixture was incubated to allow binding of the mab to its homologous bacteria. the bound and unbound fluorescent tagged mabs were separated by filtration in the modified microtiter plate, and the total bacterial bound fluorescence was determined with  a fluorimeter. the number of a specific bacterial species in a given plaque sample or other bacterial suspension was estimated by reference to a primary standard carried through the bcfia. the lower detection limit of the bcfia was 10(3) to 10(4) bacterial cells from single cultures of bacteria or 10(4) bacterial cells in mixed cultures. the coefficient of variation within and between plates for each of the five bacterium-specific mabs in screening plaque for the periodontal pathogens was less than 10%. these results demonstrate that microbes in plaque can be used as the solid phase in the bcfia to detect and quantitate mabs associated with specific bacteria quickly and reliably.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of flurbiprofen and ibuprofen in vitro against six common  periodontal pathogens.
AB  == nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (nsaids) such as flurbiprofen and ibuprofen,  have been shown to inhibit the inflammation and alveolar bone loss associated with chronic destructive periodontal disease. however, the direct effect of nsaids on the gingival crevice microflora has not been studied. the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of ibuprofen and flurbiprofen in vitro on six commonly isolated periodontal pathogens. the bacterial strains evaluated were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum and wolinella recta. pure cultures of these organisms were inoculated into broth, allowed to grow and inoculated again into sheep blood agar plates. for preliminary dose-response studies, antibiotic sensitivity blank  disks loaded with 10 microliters of flurbiprofen 250 micrograms, 50 micrograms and 5 micrograms, or ibuprofen 500 micrograms, 50 micrograms and 5 micrograms were placed on the seeded agar plates. clindamycin 2 micrograms disks were used as positive controls and discs loaded with only drug vehicle served as negative controls. in an attempt to estimate the minimal inhibitory concentrations of these nsaids on specific microorganisms, additional experiments employing intermediate drug dosages were also performed. clindamycin produced large zones of inhibition for all bacterial strains except for eikenella corrodens which is known to be resistant to the antibiotic and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  which appeared to be only moderately sensitive to the antibiotic. zones of inhibition were not produced by any of the negative control disks or by the 5 micrograms or 50 micrograms doses of either nsaid.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [subgingival microflora in children of early childhood, school age and circumpuberty. the proportion and frequency of gram-negative bacteria in periodontally healthy and gingivitis groups].
AB  == the present study characterized the microbial profiles of the gingival sulci in children. subgingival samples from 36 gingivitis lesions of 18 patients and 36 sites in 18 healthy persons were examined. the tested individuals were divided into three stages according to physiological maturation i.e. early childhood, school age, circumpuberty. puberty was confirmed through examination of wrist radiographs. using continuous anaerobic techniques, samples were dispersed, diluted and then inoculated on selective and nonselective media and cultured under the condition appropriate gaseous phase respectively. isolates were identified microbiologically and counted. all values were evaluated statistically. the samples were simultaneously examined by dark-field microscopy. changes in the proportions and the frequency of periodontophathic bacteria were distinct in different stages of physiological maturation. black-pigmented bacteroides species were commonly found in gingivitis lesions. bacteroides intermedius was frequently detected in the subgingival samples from children with gingivitis. in all stages, the proportion of black-pigmented bacteroides and b. intermedius in the gingivitis groups were found to be significantly higher than that of the healthy groups. statistical analysis revealed that levels of b. intermedius increased in circumpuberty stage compared with the 2 younger stages.  black-pigmented bacteroides and b. intermedius were closely related to gi, pli in 3 stages. bacteroides gingivalis was found only in two gingivitis sites of a circumpubertal child with gingivitis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 4 out of 12 sites in the school age group, and in 6 out of 12 sites in the circumpuberty group with gingivitis respectively. in the circumpuberty group, the proportion of a. actinomycetemcomitans in the gingivitis group was significantly higher than that of the healthy group, and a. actinomycetemcomitans was closely related to gi, pli, ci, ppd. eikenella corrodens was found to be associated with gingivitis in the school age and circumpuberty groups. no correlation was found in the detection of fusobacterium nucleatum in 3 stages. microscopic examination showed that the proportion of rods, fusiforms, filaments, motile rods, spirochetes in the gingivitis groups was significantly higher than that of the healthy groups, while the proportion of cocci in gingivitis groups was significantly lower than that of the healthy groups in 3 stages. spirochetes  were closely related to gi, pli, ppd in all stages.

TI  == suspected periodontopathic microorganisms and their oral habitats in young children.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque from 67 children, 5-7 years of age, were examined for the presence of certain suspected periodontal pathogenic species using the conventional technique of anaerobic sonification, dilution and spiral plating. when this technique was compared with a direct plating procedure which involved no preliminary dispersion and dilution of plaque specimens, it was found that the direct method resulted in double the frequency of children in whom black-pigmented bacteroides (bpb) were detected and a 10-times increase in the number of subjects harbouring actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. samples from  the tongue, tonsils and saliva were also plated using the direct technique. bpb were detected less commonly in the plaque specimens (61.3% of children) than in saliva (89.5%), or on the tongue (86.6%) and tonsils (97.1%). expressed as percentages of a pooled sample of the total bpb population, the most frequently detected species in plaque were bacteroides intermedius (44.4%) and bacteroides melaninogenicus (48.0%). the most prevalent isolate in all other oral sites was b. melaninogenicus. expressed as percentages of children in whom bpb were detected, the most frequently isolated species from plaque using the conventional dilution technique was b. intermedius (21.3%), whereas other bpb species were present in fewer than 5% of children. fusobacterium nucleatum and capnocytophaga  species were isolated most frequently from plaque but were also commonly detected in the various other oral sites.
