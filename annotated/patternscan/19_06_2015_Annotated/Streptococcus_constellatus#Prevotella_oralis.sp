TI  == development and pyrosequencing analysis of an in-vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == background: dental caries and periodontal disease are the commonest bacterial diseases of man and can result in tooth loss. the principal method of prevention  is the mechanical removal of dental plaque augmented by active agents incorporated into toothpastes and mouthrinses. in-vitro assays that include complex oral bacterial biofilms are required to accurately predict the efficacy of novel active agents in vivo. the aim of this study was to develop an oral biofilm model using the calgary biofilm device (cbd) seeded with a natural saliva inoculum and analysed by next generation sequencing. the specific objectives were to determine the reproducibility and stability of the model by comparing the composition of the biofilms over time derived from (i) the same volunteers at different time points, and (ii) different panels of volunteers. results: pyrosequencing yielded 280,093 sequences with a mean length of 432 bases after filtering. a mean of 320 and 250 otus were detected in pooled saliva and biofilm  samples, respectively. principal coordinates analysis (pcoa) plots based on community membership and structure showed that replicate biofilm samples were highly similar and clustered together. in addition, there were no significant differences between biofilms derived from the same panel at different times using analysis of molecular variance (amova). there were significant differences between biofilms from different panels (amova, p < 0.002). pcoa revealed that there was a shift in biofilm composition between seven and 14 days (amova, p < 0.001). veillonella parvula, veillonella atypica/dispar/parvula and peptostreptococcus stomatis were the predominant otus detected in seven-day biofilms, whilst prevotella oralis, v. parvula and streptococcus constellatus were predominant in 14-day biofilms. conclusions: diverse oral biofilms were successfully grown and maintained using the cbd. biofilms derived from the same panel of volunteers were highly reproducible. this model could be used to screen  both antimicrobial-containing oral care products and also novel approaches aiming to modify plaque composition, such as pre- or probiotics.

TI  == impact of periodontal therapy on the subgingival microbiota of severe periodontitis: comparison between good responders and individuals with refractory periodontitis using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compares the changes to the subgingival microbiota of individuals with "refractory" periodontitis (rp) or treatable periodontitis (good responders [gr]) before and after periodontal therapy by using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) analysis. methods: individuals with chronic periodontitis were classified as rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or >3 sites with al >/=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as gr (n  = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >/=2.5 mm after treatment. subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and 15 months after  treatment and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim analysis. significant differences in taxa before and post-therapy were sought using the wilcoxon test. results: the majority of species evaluated decreased in prevalence in both groups after treatment; however, only a small subset of organisms was significantly affected. species that increased or persisted in high frequency in  rp but were significantly reduced in gr included bacteroidetes sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., tannerella forsythia, dialister spp., selenomonas spp., catonella morbi, eubacterium spp., filifactor alocis, parvimonas micra, peptostreptococcus sp. ot113, fusobacterium sp. ot203,  pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, streptococcus intermedius or streptococcus constellatus, and shuttlesworthia satelles. in contrast, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, gemella haemolysans, haemophilus parainfluenzae, kingella oralis, lautropia mirabilis, neisseria elongata, rothia  dentocariosa, streptococcus australis, and veillonella spp. were more associated  with therapeutic success. conclusion: persistence of putative and novel periodontal pathogens, as well as low prevalence of beneficial species was associated with chronic refractory periodontitis.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == a microbiological study of papillon-lefevre syndrome in two patients.
AB  == aim: to analyse the microflora of subgingival plaque from patients with papillon-lefevre syndrome (pls), which is a very rare disease characterised by palmar-plantar hyperkeratosis with precocious periodontal destruction. methods: bacterial isolates were identified using a combination of commercial identification kits, traditional laboratory tests, and gas liquid chromatography. some isolates were also subjected to partial 16s rdna sequencing. plaque samples  were also assayed for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in a quantitative enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) using monoclonal antibodies. results: the culture results showed that most isolates were capnophilic and facultatively anaerobic species-mainly capnocytophaga spp and streptococcus spp. the latter included s. constellatus, s. oralis, and s. sanguis. other facultative bacteria belonged to the genera gemella, kingella, leuconostoc, and stomatococcus. the aerobic bacteria isolated were species of neisseria and bacillus. anaerobic species included prevotella intermedia, p. melaninogenica, and p. nigrescens, as  well as peptostreptococcus spp. elisa detected p gingivalis in one patient in all sites sampled, whereas a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in only one site from the other patient. prevotella intermedia was present in low numbers. conclusions: patients with pls have a very complex subgingival flora including recognised periodontal pathogens. however, no particular periodontopathogen is invariably associated with pls.

TI  == characterization of bacterial orofacial infections using a new murine model.
AB  == we devised a new murine orofacial infection model using bacteria from odontogenic infection origins and characterized the experimental infections. in this model, bacteria were injected into the submandible of mice. streptococcus constellatus and peptostreptococcus micros produced a single abscess at the injection site and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were low: the median abscess-forming dose (af(50)) of s. constellatus and p. micros were 10(8.5-10.7)and 10(10.2-10.6)cfu/mouse, and their median lethal dose (ld(50)) were >11 and 10(10.6-11)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum produced multiple abscesses and their abscess-forming and lethal abilities were strong: af(50)of p. oralis and f. nucleatum were 10(6.0-6.4)and 10(7. 0-8.7)cfu/mouse, and their ld(50)were 10(7.0-7.7)and 10(8.3-9. 9)cfu/mouse, respectively. ld(50)of p. intermedia and p. gingivalis were 10(9.4->11)and 10(8.9-9.1)cfu/mouse, respectively. prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis generated a necrotizing lesion, which progressed rapidly. we conclude  that this murine model could reflect human orofacial odontogenic infections and is useful to investigate the pathogenicity of causative bacteria of such infections.

TI  == profile of subgingival microbiota in children with primary dentition.
AB  == eruption of primary teeth has a great influence on the oral environment by providing suitable niches for bacterial colonization. the aim of the study was to investigate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of primary incisors, canines and molars in 40 systemically healthy children aged 4-5 yr, chosen randomly. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal sites of primary incisors (61, 81), canines (53, 73) and molars (64, 84). the samples were cultured for bacterial isolation anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air using selective and non-selective media. forty-one different microbial species were isolated. gemella morbillorum and peptostreptococcus magnus were statistically significantly more frequently detected in incisors while p. micros, streptococcus intermedius, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loeschei, p. melaninogenica and selenomonas sputigena were more frequently detected in molars. the bacterial species s. constellatus, g. morbillorum and p. magnus were  isolated in greater numbers in incisors and p. micros, s. intermedius, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides egertheii, b. forsythus, p. oralis and s. sputigena were isolated in greater numbers in molars, respectively. cluster analysis revealed 4 clusters in which 6-7 bacterial species were elevated above mean levels. cluster i was predominated by s. constellatus, s. mitis, s. sanguis, g. morbillorum, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; cluster ii was predominated by s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea and p. intermedia; cluster iii was predominated by s. mitis, c. ochracea, f. nucleatum,  p. loeschei, p. melaninogenica and p. oralis; and finally cluster iv was predominated by s. sanguis, c. gingivalis, veillonella parvula, campylobacter gracilis, f. nucleatum and p. intermedia. the bacterial species s. constellatus,  p. micros, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, eikenella corrodens and f. nucleatum were associated with non-bleeding sites while s. intermedius, c. concisus, p. intermedia and p. loescheii were found more frequently in bleeding sites.

TI  == serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum igg antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based  on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. on average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. differences  in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). the data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting  for multiple comparisons). serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel neisseria sp., enterococcus faecalis, prevotella loescheii and prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. high levels of serum antibody to a microbacterium lacticum-like organism, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus constellatus, actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.
