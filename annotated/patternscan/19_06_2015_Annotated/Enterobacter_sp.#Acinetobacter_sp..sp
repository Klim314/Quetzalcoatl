TI  == ndm-1 encoded by a pndm-bj01-like plasmid p3sp-ndm in clinical enterobacter aerogenes.
AB  == a carbapenem-nonsusceptible enterobacter aerogenes strain named 3-sp was isolated from a human case of pneumonia in a chinese teaching hospital. ndm-1 carbapenemase is produced by a pndm-bj01-like conjugative plasmid designated p3sp-ndm to account for carbapenem resistance of 3-sp. p3sp-ndm was fully sequenced and compared with all publically available pndm-bj01-like plasmids. the genetic differences between p3sp-ndm and pndm-bj01 include only 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms, a 1 bp deletion and a 706 bp deletion. p3sp-ndm and pndm-bj01 harbor an identical tn125 element organized as isaba125, bla ndm-1, ble mbl, deltatrpf, dsbc, cuta, deltagroes, groel, iscr27, and isaba125. the bla ndm-1 surrounding regions in these pndm-bj01-like plasmids have a conserved linear organization isaba14-apha6-tn125-unknown is, with considerable genetic differences identified within or immediately downstream of tn125. all reported pndm-bj01-like plasmids are exclusively found in acinetobacter, whereas this is the first report of identification of a pndm-bj01-like plasmid in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == production of humic substances through coal-solubilizing bacteria.
AB  == in this paper, the production of humic substances (hs) through the bacterial solubilization of low rank coal (lrc) was evaluated. the evaluation was carried out by 19 bacterial strains isolated in microenvironments with high contents of coal wastes. the biotransformed lrc and the hs produced were quantified in vitro  in a liquid growth medium. the humic acids (ha) obtained from the most active bacterial strain were characterized via elemental composition (c, h, n, o), ir analyses, and the e4/e6 ratio; they were then compared with the ha extracted chemically using naoh. there was lrc biotransformation ranged from 25 to 37%, and hs production ranged from 127 to 3100 mg . l(-1). more activity was detected in the isolated strains of bacillus mycoides, microbacterium sp, acinetobacter sp, and enterobacter aerogenes. the ha produced by b. mycoides had an ir spectrum and an e4/e6 ratio similar to those of the ha extracted with naoh, but their elemental composition and their degree of aromatic condensation was different. results suggest that these bacteria can be used to exploit the lrc resulting from coal mining activities and thus produce hs in order to improve the content of humified organic matter in soils.

TI  == ecological competition and the incidence of acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in a teaching hospital in southeastern brazil.
AB  == introduction: recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated infections (hais). acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important agents known to cause hais.  it is widespread in healthcare settings and exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. little is known about the impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii infection. methods: we conducted an ecological study, enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (ha-bsis) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in brazil. ha-bsis were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were recovered  from blood cultures collected at least three days after admission. monthly incidence rates were calculated for all ha-bsis (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens). multivariate poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of a. baumannii. results: the overall incidence rate of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was 2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. in the multivariate analysis, the incidence of ha-bsi caused by a. baumannii was negatively associated with the incidence rates of ha-bsi due to staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio [rr]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [ci]=0.80-0.97), enterobacter spp. (rr=0.84; 95%ci=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common gram-negative pathogens. conclusions: our results suggest that competition between pathogens influences the etiology of ha-bsis. it would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection control policies.

TI  == microstructure, microbial profile and quality characteristics of high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets.
AB  == high-pressure processing (300 mpa for 5 min) as a non-thermal post-processing intervention was employed to improve the shelf life and qualities of cooked refrigerated chicken nuggets. pomegranate peel extract (1%) was also used as a source of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial in chicken nuggets. microstructure, microbial profile, instrumental colour, texture profile and lipid oxidation were evaluated. high-pressure treatment and pomegranate peel extract did not influence significantly the colour and textural properties of cooked chicken nuggets. thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values significantly (p < 0.05) increased in pressure-treated nuggets. microstructural studies revealed shrinkage in the structure and loosening of the dense network of meat emulsion due to high-pressure treatment. pressure treatment resulted in a reduction of 2-3.0 log10 cfu/g in total plate count and enterobacteriaceae count. molecular characterization studies revealed that enterobacter amnigenus and enterobacter sp. in control and bacillus licheniformis, enterococcus gallinarum and acinetobacter baumannii in high-pressure-treated chicken nuggets were the major spoilage bacteria.

TI  == screening of plant growth-promoting traits in arsenic-resistant bacteria isolated from agricultural soil and their potential implication for arsenic bioremediation.
AB  == twelve arsenic (as)-resistant bacteria (minimum inhibitory concentration ranging  from 10 to 30mm and 150 to 320mm for as(iii) and as(v), respectively) were isolated from the agricultural soil of the chianan plain in southwestern taiwan using enrichment techniques. eight isolates capable of oxidizing as(iii) (rate of oxidation from 0.029 to 0.059mumh(-1) 10(-9) cell) and exhibiting as(iii)-oxidase enzyme activity belong to pseudomonas, acinetobacter, klebsiella and comamonas genera, whereas four isolates that did not show as(iii)-oxidizing activity belong to geobacillus, bacillus, paenibacillus, and enterobacter genera. assessment of the parameters of plant growth promotion revealed that pseudomonas sp. asr1, asr2 and asr3, geobacillus sp. asr4, bacillus sp. asr5, paenibacillus sp. asr6, enterobacter sp. asr10 and comamonas sp. asr11, and asr12 possessed some or all of the studied plant growth-promoting traits, including phosphate-solubilization, siderophore, iaa-like molecules and acc deaminase production. in addition, the ability of as-resistant isolates to grow over wide ranges of ph and temperatures  signify their potential application for sustainable bioremediation of as in the environment.

TI  == are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  == background: hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. methods: cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in brooklyn, ny. as a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr method. results: of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. cephalosporin-resistant citrobacter freundii (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 2), and enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not  from control sites. one isolate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated vim-2. acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6  miles (p = .004). eleven a baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr and were also related to a known clinical isolate. conclusions: strains of a baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand  cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. the finding of integron-associated vim-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further  vigilance is warranted.

TI  == identification of polybacterial communities in patients with postoperative, posttraumatic, and endogenous endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries.
AB  == endophthalmitis is a potential vision-threatening complication following surgical procedures (postoperative endophthalmitis [poe]), trauma (posttraumatic endophthalmitis [pte]), and bacteremic seeding of the eye from a distant infection site (endogenous endophthalmitis [ee]). several studies have revealed the polybacterial characteristics of endophthalmitis, which make the administration of antibiotics to treat the disease challenging. however, until now, the polybacterial communities of poe, pte, and ee have not been precisely studied. hence, the present study was designed to identify the bacterial community of endophthalmitis through 16s rrna gene libraries. of the 40 intraocular samples tested, 30 libraries were constructed with bacterial nested-pcr-positive samples. the obtained recombinant clones were screened through amplified rrna gene restriction analysis (ardra) to identify unique clones. the multiple types of ardra patterns (p=0.345) and diverse bacterial sequences (p=0.277) within the libraries revealed the polybacterial nature of infection in poe, pte, and ee. moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on polybacterial infection in ee. gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus spp. (n=19), streptococcus spp. (n=18), staphylococcus spp. (n=6), exiguobacterium spp. (n=3), gemella spp. (n=2), enterococcus spp. (n=2), a lysinibacillus sp. (n=1), a clostridium sp. (n=1), and a nocardia sp. (n=1), and  gram-negative bacteria, including serratia spp. (n=18), pseudomonas spp. (n=10),  enterobacter spp. (n=8), acinetobacter spp. (n=3), pantoea spp. (n=3), a haemophilus sp. (n=1), and a massilia sp. (n=1), were identified. interestingly,  among them, 10 bacterial species were not previously reported to be associated with endophthalmitis or other ocular infections. besides, the presence of 4 unidentifiable clones suggests the possibility of novel organisms that might cause eye infections. therefore, it is recommended that, in addition to the polybacterial nature of poe, pte, and ee infections, the spectrum of the pathogenic bacterial community identified in this work should be considered while administering antibiotic therapy in suspected endophthalmitis cases.

TI  == acanthamoeba and bacteria produce antimicrobials to target their counterpart.
AB  == background: in the microbial ecosystem, microbes compete for space and nutrients. consequently, some have developed the ability to kill or inhibit the growth of other competing microbes by producing antimicrobial substances. as the 'producer' species are generally immune to these substances, their compounds act on the competing microbial species and give the producer more space and access to nutrients for growth. many currently used antibiotics were developed by exploiting this potential of certain microbes. findings: here, the free-living amoeba, acanthamoeba castellanii, was investigated for its antibacterial activity against representative gram positive and gram negative bacteria, while bacterial  isolates were tested for their anti-amoebic properties. conditioned medium from a. castellanii showed remarkable bactericidal properties against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) exhibiting almost 100% kill rate, but had limited effect against acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). similarly, the conditioned  medium of e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., exhibited potent anti-acanthamoebic effects in a concentration-dependent manner. conditioned media of acanthamoeba, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp. showed no cytotoxicity in vitro when tested against human brain microvascular endothelial cells. active molecule/s in aforementioned amoebic and two bacterial conditioned media were 5 - 10 kda, and <5 kda respectively. conclusions: a. castellanii conditioned medium showed potent bactericidal properties against mrsa. the active molecule(s) are heat- and pronase-resistant, and in the 5 to 10 kda molecular mass range. contrary to this, e. coli k1 and enterobacter sp., conditioned medium showed anti-amoebic effects that are <5 kda in molecular mass, suggestive of active metabolites.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime-avibactam against gram-negative organisms collected from u.s. medical centers in 2012.
AB  == the activities of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination ceftazidime-avibactam and comparator agents were evaluated against a contemporary collection of clinically significant gram-negative bacilli. avibactam is a novel  non-beta-lactam beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits ambler class a, c, and some d enzymes. a total of 10,928 gram-negative bacilli-8,640 enterobacteriaceae, 1,967 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 321 acinetobacter sp. isolates-were collected from 73 u.s. hospitals and tested for susceptibility by reference broth microdilution methods in a central monitoring laboratory (jmi laboratories, north liberty, ia, usa). ceftazidime was combined with avibactam at a fixed concentration of 4 mug/ml. overall, 99.8% of enterobacteriaceae strains were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=4 mug/ml. ceftazidime-avibactam was active against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-phenotype escherichia  coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, meropenem-nonsusceptible (mic>/=2 mug/ml) k. pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-nonsusceptible enterobacter cloacae. among esbl-phenotype k. pneumoniae strains, 61.1% were meropenem susceptible and 99.3%  were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=4 mug/ml. among p. aeruginosa strains, 96.9% were inhibited at a ceftazidime-avibactam mic of </=8 mug/ml, and  susceptibility rates for meropenem, ceftazidime, and piperacillin-tazobactam were 82.0, 83.2, and 78.3%, respectively. ceftazidime-avibactam was the most active compound tested against meropenem-nonsusceptible p. aeruginosa (mic50/mic90, 4/16 mug/ml; 87.3% inhibited at </=8 mug/ml). acinetobacter spp. (ceftazidime-avibactam mic50/mic90, 16/>32 mug/ml) showed high rates of resistance to most tested agents. in summary, ceftazidime-avibactam demonstrated  potent activity against a large collection of contemporary gram-negative bacilli  isolated from patients in u.s. hospitals in 2012, including organisms that are resistant to most currently available agents, such as k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing enterobacteriaceae and meropenem-nonsusceptible p. aeruginosa.

TI  == physical impaction injury effects on bacterial cells during spread plating influenced by cell characteristics of the organisms.
AB  == aims: to understand the factors that contribute to the variations in colony-forming units (cfu) in different bacteria during spread plating. methods and results: employing a mix culture of vegetative cells of ten organisms varying in cell characteristics (gram reaction, cell shape and cell size), spread plating to the extent of just drying the agar surface (50-60 s) was tested in comparison  with the alternate spotting-and-tilt-spreading (sats) approach where 100 mul inoculum was distributed by mere tilting of plate after spotting as 20-25 microdrops. the former imparted a significant reduction in cfu by 20% over the spreader-independent sats approach. extending the testing to single organisms, gram-negative proteobacteria with relatively larger cells (escherichia, enterobacter, agrobacterium, ralstonia, pantoea, pseudomonas and sphingomonas spp.) showed significant cfu reduction with spread plating except for slow-growing methylobacterium sp., while those with small rods (xenophilus sp.) and cocci (acinetobacter sp.) were less affected. among gram-positive nonspore formers, staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant cfu reduction while staphylococcus haemolyticus and actinobacteria (microbacterium, cellulosimicrobium and brachybacterium spp.) with small rods/cocci were unaffected. vegetative cells of bacillus pumilus and b. subtilis were generally unaffected while others with larger rods (b. thuringiensis, brevibacillus, lysinibacillus and paenibacillus spp.) were significantly affected. a simulated plating study coupled with live-dead bacterial staining endorsed the chances of cell disruption with spreader impaction in afflicted organisms. conclusions: significant reduction in cfu could occur during spread plating due to physical impaction injury to bacterial cells depending on the spreader usage and the variable effects on different organisms are determined by gram reaction, cell size and cell shape. the inoculum spreader could impart physical disruption of vegetative cells against a hard surface. significance and impact of study: possibility of cfu reduction in sensitive organisms and the skewed selection of hardier organisms during spread plating, and the recommendation of sats as an easier and safer alternative for cfu enumerations.

TI  == [diversity analysis of biofilm bacteria on tracheal tubes removed from intubated  neonates].
AB  == objective: the catheter-related infections caused by mechanical ventilation have  become a intractable clinical problem, and it is related to the formation of bacterial biofilm (bf) on the surface of the implanted material. the majority of  natural biofilms are formed by multiple bacterial species. however, there always  only one or limited species were detected on tracheal tubes removed from intubated neonates by using traditional methods including bacterium culture and antigen detection. the aims of this study were to observe the bacterial communities diversity of bf on endotracheal tube (ett), and discuss the difference between traditional bacterium culture methods and the use of molecular biology techniques on the basis of denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), to provide new ideas for clinical prevention, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial infections. method: thirty-five etts were obtained from 26 neonates on  mechanical ventilator (from october 2012 to march 2013) in department of neonatology of children's hospital. among the patients, 18 were boys and 8 girls, and 19 patients were < 37 weeks gestational age and 7 patients >/= 37 weeks. dgge profiling of 16s rdna gene amplicons was used to assess the diversity of the bacterial population by using the software of quantity one. ta cloning kit and sequencing were used to investigate the distribution of bacteria and common dominant bacteria in ett-bf. result: the mean bands of 35 etts cases were 13.8 +/- 5.4 from 16s rdna pcr-dgge, and the mean shanon-wiener indexes was 2.42 +/- 0.38. the 16 etts were collected in different stages of diseases from the 7 patients. the indwelling days of 6/7 patients' etts increased, the shanon-siener  indexes were decreased. among the 6 cases from different basic illnesses, and there were different shanon-siener indexes. the result of molecular cloning and sequencing for 24 dominant bands showed that 35 cases (100%) contained klebsiella sp., 28 cases (80%) had pseudomonas sp., 27 cases (77%) had streptococcus sp., and 32 cases (91%) had uncultured bacterium, while more than 2 bacterial species  were found in 34 cases (97%). 28/35 (80%) klebsiella sp. and 22/27(82%) streptococcus sp. were accompanied by pseudomonas sp.. there were 22 positive results of sputum culture from 26 newborns, including 10 strains (45%) of klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 strains (9%) of acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and non-cultured bacterium in each patient (5%), but only one bacterium isolated from every sputum. eight sputum samples had normal flora only, corresponding to the etts on which klebsiella and other bacterial genuses were found. conclusion: the diversity of microbiota in bf on ett was confirmed. 16s rdna pcr-dgge could produce a more complete picture of bacterial community than traditional bacterium culture method. klebsiella, pseudomonas and streptococcus were common dominant bacteria in ett-bf, and there might be interactions among them in the formation of bf.

TI  == effect of herbicide adjuvants on the biodegradation rate of the methylthiotriazine herbicide prometryn.
AB  == a microbial community, selected by its ability to degrade triazinic herbicides was acclimatized by successive transfers in batch cultures. initially, its ability to degrade prometryn, was evaluated using free cells or cells attached to fragments of a porous support. as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur sources, prometryn, (98.8 % purity), or gesagard, a herbicide formulation containing 44.5 % prometryn and 65.5 % of adjuvants, were used. in batch cultures, a considerable delay in the degradation of prometryn, presumptively caused by the elevated concentration  of inhibitory adjuvants, occurred. when pure prometryn was used, volumetric removal rates remarkably higher than those obtained with the herbicide formulation were estimated by fitting the raw experimental data to sigmoidal decay models, and differentiating them. when the microbial consortium was immobilized in a continuously operated biofilm reactor, the negative effect of adjuvants on the rate and removal efficiency of prometryn could not be detected.  using the herbicide formulation, the consortium showed volumetric removal rates greater than 20 g m(-3) h(-1), with prometryn removal efficiencies of 100 %. the  predominant bacterial strains isolated from the microbial consortium were microbacterium sp., enterobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., and flavobacterium sp. finally, by comparison of the prometryn removal rates with others reported in the literature, it can be concluded that the use of microbial consortia immobilized in a biofilm reactor operated in continuous regime offer better results than batch cultures of pure microbial strains.

TI  == characterization of bacterial isolates from water reclamation systems on the basis of substrate utilization patterns and regrowth potential in reclaimed water.
AB  == microbial regrowth causes problems during water reuse. comprehensive understanding of the microorganisms that can regrow in reclaimed water and their  substrate requirements are necessary. in this study, potential regrowth organisms were isolated from seven water reclamation plants in japan. based on 16s rdna analysis, the isolates were grouped into 34 operational taxonomic units, belonging to alphaproteobacteria, betaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, and firmicutes. substrate utilization profiling using biolog microplate classified the isolates into four groups. bacteria in cluster 1 (e.g., methylobacterium sp. and acinetobacter sp.) mainly utilized polymers, esters, amides, and alcohol. isolates in cluster 2 (e.g., flavobacterium sp. and microbacterium sp.) preferred to utilize polymers, carbohydrates, and esters. isolates in cluster 3 (e.g., pseudomonas sp. and acidovorax sp.) mainly utilized esters, carboxylic acids, and amino acids. isolates in cluster 4 (e.g., enterobacter sp. and rhodococcus sp.) utilized carbohydrates, esters, and amino acids. all isolates grew in reclaimed water treated by sand filtration, whereas some isolates could not grow in reclaimed water treated by coagulation and ozonation. most bacteria in the same biolog clusters exhibited similar growth characteristics in water samples. the potential of bacteria to regrow in reclaimed water likely depended on substrate requirement.

AB  == purpose: to examine the status and clinical outcome of de-escalating antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to hospital-acquired, gram-negative bacilli that are difficult to treat. methods: among 1,610 patients presenting with positive blood cultures collected at our medical centre over a 6-year period, 133 were infected with serratia, pseudomonas, acinetobacter, citrobacter  or enterobacter sp. (spaces). we examined the appropriateness of an empiric initial administration of antimicrobials based on in vitro sensitivity, and the success and outcomes of a pathogen-directed de-escalation of therapy. the treatment was considered to be successfully de-escalated when the antimicrobial spectrum was narrowed according to a spectrum ranking or when >/= 2 antimicrobials prescribed initially were lowered to one agent. outcome measures included persistent, recurrent and metastatic infections, infection-related deaths and cost of antimicrobials. results: the treatment was initially appropriate in 79 of 133 patients (59 %), of whom 49 (62 %) were candidates for and 28 (57 %) underwent treatment de-escalation. no treatment failure was observed among these 28 patients, while 2 of 11 patients (18 %) whose treatment was not de-escalated died (p = 0.13). the median cost of antimicrobials was <euro>250/patient lower in the de-escalated than in the non-de-escalated group (p < 0.001). conclusions: antimicrobial therapy for bacteraemia due to hard-to-treat spaces was de-escalated in 57 % of candidates, based on the in vitro sensitivity, with no deaths and significantly lower costs of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == diversity of the bacterial and fungal microflora from the midgut and cuticle of phlebotomine sand flies collected in north-western iran.
AB  == background: phlebotomine sand flies are the vectors of the leishmaniases, parasitic diseases caused by leishmania spp. little is known about the prevalence and diversity of sand fly microflora colonizing the midgut or the cuticle. particularly, there is little information on the fungal diversity. this information is important for development of vector control strategies. methodology/principal findings: five sand fly species: phlebotomus papatasi, p. sergenti, p. kandelakii, p. perfiliewi and p. halepensis were caught in bileh savar and kaleybar in north-western iran that are located in endemic foci of visceral leishmaniasis. a total of 35 specimens were processed. bacterial and fungal strains were identified by routine microbiological methods. we characterized 39 fungal isolates from the cuticle and/or the midgut. they belong  to six different genera including penicillium (17 isolates), aspergillus (14), acremonium (5), fusarium (1), geotrichum (1) and candida (1). we identified 33 gram-negative bacteria: serratia marcescens (9 isolates), enterobacter cloacae (6), pseudomonas fluorescens (6), klebsiella ozaenae (4), acinetobacter sp. (3),  escherichia coli (3), asaia sp. (1) and pantoea sp. (1) as well as gram-positive  bacteria bacillus subtilis (5) and micrococcus luteus (5) in 10 isolates. conclusion/significance: our study provides new data on the microbiotic diversity of field-collected sand flies and for the first time, evidence of the presence of asaia sp. in sand flies. we have also found a link between physiological stages (unfed, fresh fed, semi gravid and gravid) of sand flies and number of bacteria that they carry. interestingly pantoea sp. and klebsiella ozaenae have been isolated in old world sand fly species. the presence of latter species on sand fly cuticle and in the female midgut suggests a role for this arthropod in dissemination of these pathogenic bacteria in endemic areas. further experiments  are required to clearly delineate the vectorial role (passive or active) of sand  flies.

TI  == comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: india.
AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. materials and methods: seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating  isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of salmonella typhi and candida  albicans. reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. a very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. results: the highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by  desnet (5.05) and bacillocid special (5.02). a comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for lysol, bacillocid sp. and desnet, respectively. in the discard jars, bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, desnet for 3 days and hi-giene germitol for 1 day. the remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on day 1. phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like desnet and bacillocid special. conclusions: newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.

TI  == verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential pcr gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  == aims: to verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (late-pcr) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., klebsiella sp., acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus,  enterobacter sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, enterococcus sp., candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. methods and results: clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the university of california, davis medical center (ucdmc) microbiology laboratory. five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. dna extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), ac. baumannii (57%) and ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). all clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two ac. baumannii, two klebsiella oxytoca and two candida parapsilosis isolates. conclusions: sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex late-pcr assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. the multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with dna extracted from 70 different target strains. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the potential of late-pcr to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

TI  == gram-negative osteomyelitis: clinical and microbiological profile.
AB  == introduction: despite the growing interest in the study of gram-negative bacilli  (gnb) infections, very little information on osteomyelitis caused by gnb is available in the medical literature. objectives and methods: to assess clinical and microbiological features of 101 cases of osteomyelitis caused by gnb alone, between january 2007 and january 2009, in a reference center for the treatment of high complexity traumas in the city of sao paulo. results: most patients were men (63%), with median age of 42 years, affected by chronic osteomyelitis (43%) or acute osteomyelitis associated to open fractures (32%), the majority on the lower limbs (71%). the patients were treated with antibiotics as inpatients for 40 days (median) and for 99 days (median) in outpatient settings. after 6 months follow-up, the clinical remission rate was around 60%, relapse 19%, amputation 7%, and death 5%. nine percent of cases were lost to follow-up. a total of 121 gnb was isolated from 101 clinical samples. the most frequently isolated pathogens were enterobacter sp. (25%), acinetobacter baumannii (21%) e pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). susceptibility to carbapenems was about 100% for enterobacter sp., 75% for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 60% for acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: osteomyelitis caused by gnb remains a serious therapeutic  challenge, especially when associated to nonfermenting bacteria. we emphasize the need to consider these agents in diagnosed cases of osteomyelitis, so that an ideal antimicrobial treatment can be administered since the very beginning of the therapy.

TI  == host plant induced variation in gut bacteria of helicoverpa armigera.
AB  == helicoverpa are important polyphagous agricultural insect pests and they have a worldwide distribution. in this study, we report the bacterial community structure in the midgut of fifth instar larvae of helicoverpa armigera, a species prevalent in the india, china, south asia, south east asia, southern & eastern africa and australia. using culturable techniques, we isolated and identified members of bacillus firmus, bacillus niabense, paenibacillus jamilae, cellulomonas variformis, acinetobacter schindleri, micrococcus yunnanesis, enterobacter sp., and enterococcus cassiliflavus in insect samples collected from host plants grown in different parts of india. besides these the presence of sphingomonas, ralstonia, delftia, paracoccus and bacteriodetes was determined by  culture independent molecular analysis. we found that enterobacter and enterococcus were universally present in all our helicoverpa samples collected from different crops and in different parts of india. the bacterial diversity varied greatly among insects that were from different host plants than those from the same host plant of different locations. this result suggested that the type of host plant greatly influences the midgut bacterial diversity of h. armigera, more than the location of the host plant. on further analyzing the leaf from which the larva was collected, it was found that the h. armigera midgut bacterial community was similar to that of the leaf phyllosphere. this finding indicates that the bacterial flora of the larval midgut is influenced by the leaf surface bacterial community of the crop on which it feeds. additionally, we found that laboratory made media or the artificial diet is a poor bacterial source for these insects compared to a natural diet of crop plant.

TI  == isolation and identification of chromium-resistant bacteria: test application for prevention of chromium toxicity in plant.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to isolate chromium resistant bacteria and characterize in depth before being applied for bioremediation or construction of  chromium biosesnors. one of the major objectives was to identify the most useful  strains with respect to chromium removal efficiency. chromium resistant bacteria  were isolated from tannery waste samples. these were characterized through biochemical tests and antibiotic assays. cross metal reactivity, plasmid curing and cysteine quantifications were also performed. gene sequencing was done for all the isolates and accession numbers received after submission to national center for biotechnology information (ncbi). the removal capacity was also studied in broth cultures. the results were very encouraging since six new bacteria were recognised to withstand high concentrations of chromium. out of these six bacteria, three i.e. enterobacter aerogenes, aeromonas sp., acinetobacter sp. pd 12 performed very well by removing about 99% (average) from  initial 19.8 ppm of cr(vi) from a synthetic culture media. enterobacter aerogenes, being the most efficient strain, was used to remediate hexavalent chromium from soil of potted plants- very encouraging results were obtained. these bacteria may be exploited for bioremediation of cr (vi) and construction of microbial sensor in future.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of doripenem against gram-negative pathogens: results from invita-a-dori brazilian study.
AB  == in vitro activity of doripenem and comparator antimicrobial agents was evaluated  against gram-negative bacilli recently isolated from brazilian private hospitals  that were enrolled in the invita-a-dori brazilian study. a total of 805 unique gram-negative bacilli were collected from patients hospitalized at 18 medical centers between may/08 and march/09. each hospital was asked to submit 50 single  gram-negative bacilli isolated from blood, lower respiratory tract or intraabdominal secretions. bacterial identification was confirmed and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) microdilution method at a central laboratory. clsi m100-s21 (2011) or us-fda package insert criteria (tigecycline) was used for interpretation of the antimicrobial susceptibility results. doripenem was as active as meropenem and more active than imipenem against e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates. a total of 50.0% of enterobacter spp. isolates were resistant to ceftazidime but 85.7% of them were inhibited at doripenem mics < 1 microg/ml. polymyxin b was the only agent to show potent activity against acinetobacter spp. (mic50/90, < 0.5/1 microg/ml) and p. aeruginosa (mic50/90, 1/2 microg/ml). although high rates of imipenem (53.1%) and meropenem (44.5%) resistance were detected among p. aeruginosa, doripenem showed mic50 of 16 microg/ml against imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and inhibited a greater number of imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (10.5%) at mic values of < 4 microg/ml than did meropenem (0.0%). in this study, doripenem showed similar in vitro activity to that of meropenem and retained some activity against imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa isolated from brazilian medical centers.

TI  == bioremediation of chromium by novel strains enterobacter aerogenes t2 and acinetobacter sp. pd 12 s2.
AB  == purpose: this study had an objective to identify the most potent chromium-resistant bacteria isolated from tannery effluent and apply them for bioremediation of chromium in tannery effluents. methods: two such strains (previously characterized and identified by us)--enterobacter aerogenes (ncbi genbank usa accession no. gu265554) and acinetobacter sp. pd 12 (ncbi genbank usa accession no. gu084179)--showed powerful chromium resistivity and bioremediation  capabilities among many stains isolated from tannery waste. parameters such as ph, concentration of hexavalent chromium or cr (vi), and inoculum volume were varied to observe optimum bioconversion and bioaccumulation of cr (vi) when the said strains were grown in m9 minimal salt media. e. aerogenes was used to remediate chromium from tannery effluents in a laboratory level experiment. results: observation by scanning electron microscope and chromium peak in energy  dispersive x-ray spectroscopic microanalysis revealed that e. aerogenes helped remediate a moderate amount of cr (vi) (8-16 mg l(-1)) over a wide range of ph values at 35-37 degrees c (within 26.05 h). high inoculum percentage of acinetobacter sp. pd 12 also enabled bioremediation of 8-16 mg l(-1) of cr (vi) over a wide range of temperature (25-37 degrees c), mainly at ph 7 (within 63.28  h). the experiment with real tannery effluent gave very encouraging results. conclusion: the strain e. aerogenes can be used in bioremediation of cr (vi) since it could work in actual environmental conditions with extraordinarily high  capacity.

TI  == antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  == resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. tigecycline (tygacil, wyeth) is a relatively new fda and emea approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. in this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. in overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/l, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean mic values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/l, respectively). mic50 and mic90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/l for e. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/l for klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/l for various enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/l for pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/l for  acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/l for serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/l for streptococcus sp. the mic values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for acinetobacter sp. (included a. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for klebsiella, serratia and enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.

AB  == culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a german dairy company and a spanish dry cured ham company. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised dgge dna bands.  more specifically, real-time pcr was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus spp., salmonella spp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. due to the detection limits of the  real-time pcr method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the german dairy company. enterococci and p.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. some opportunistic bacteria as enterobacter sp.,  acinetobacter, sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic bacillus, were also detected after dna sequencing of dgge bands.

TI  == robustness of the bacterial community in the cabbage white butterfly larval midgut.
AB  == microbial communities typically vary in composition and structure over space and  time. little is known about the inherent characteristics of communities that govern various drivers of these changes, such as random variation, changes in response to perturbation, or susceptibility to invasion. in this study, we use 16s ribosomal rna gene sequences to describe variation among bacterial communities in the midguts of cabbage white butterfly (pieris rapae) larvae and examine the influence of community structure on susceptibility to invasion. we compared communities in larvae experiencing the same conditions at different times (temporal variation) or fed different diets (perturbation). the most highly represented phylum was proteobacteria, which was present in all midgut communities. the observed species richness ranged from six to 15, and the most abundant members affiliated with the genera methylobacteria, asaia, acinetobacter, enterobacter, and pantoea. individual larvae subjected to the same conditions at the same time harbored communities that were highly similar in structure and membership, whereas the communities observed within larval populations changed with diet and over time. in addition, structural changes due  to perturbation coincided with enhanced susceptibility to invasion by enterobacter sp. nab3r and pantoea stewartii cwb600, suggesting that resistance to invasion is in part governed by community structure. these findings along with the observed conservation of membership at the phylum level, variation in structure and membership at lower taxonomic levels, and its relative simplicity make the cabbage white butterfly larval community an attractive model for studying community dynamics and robustness.

TI  == novel insights about class 2 integrons from experimental and genomic epidemiology.
AB  == in order to contribute to the knowledge of the architecture and epidemiology of class 2 integrons, we performed a class 2 integron molecular survey in which we analyzed 726 isolates in two bacterial populations from environmental and nonepidemiologically related clinical samples, respectively, collected from 1982  to 2007. we recovered the inti2 gene from 130 of 726 isolates, most of which were clinical isolates, and only 1 (a psychrophilic pseudomonas sp.) was from a water  sample. unlike the widespread distribution of class 1 integrons within gram-negative bacilli, only acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae harbored class 2 integrons at a high frequency in our collection. class 2 integrons with six novel cassette arrays were documented. characterization of the transposition module of tn7, the genetic platform in which class 2 integrons have always been reported, showed tns modules with a mosaic genetic structure. a bioinformatic analysis performed with the tns genes present in sequence databases, the finding of inti2 not associated with tns genes, and the genetic examination of novel tns-like genes found in three isolates indicated the possibility of the independent evolution of the two components related to horizontal gene transfer, the class 2 integrons and the tn7 transposons.

TI  == the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  == background: in effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. methodology: the antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 35218, enterobacter aerogenes atcc 29751, e. aerogenes atcc 13048, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853 and enterococcus hirae atcc 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. results: the crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). the most active plant extracts were  from dortenia picta and bridelia micrantha (mic: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from b. micrantha, mallotus oppositifolius, garcinia lucida, garcinia. kola, campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and c. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant gram-positive cocci (mic: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). conclusion: of the 17 plant extracts studied,  seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. the stem bark of b. micrantha and the leaves of d. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli. this study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.

TI  == comparison of the bacterial community and characterization of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria from different genotypes of chrysopogon zizanioides (l.) roberty (vetiver) rhizospheres.
AB  == molecular approaches [pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge)] were used to determine whether three different vetiver (chrysopogon zizanioides) genotypes, commercially used in brazil and considered economically important over the world, select specific bacterial populations to coexist in their rhizospheres. dgge profiles revealed that the predominant rhizospheric bacterial  community hardly varies regarding the vetiver genotype. moreover, using traditional cultivation methods, bacterial strains were isolated from the different rhizospheres. colonies presenting different morphologies (83) were selected for determining their potential for plant growth promotion. more than half of the strains tested (57.8%) were amplified by pcr using nifh-based primers, specific for the enzyme nitrogenase reductase. the production of siderophores was observed in 88% of the strains, while the production of antimicrobial substances was detected in only 14.5% of the isolates when micrococcus sp. was used as the indicator strain. production of indole-3-acetic acid and the solubilization of phosphate were observed in 55.4% and 59% of the isolates, respectively. in total, 44 strains (53%) presented at least three characteristics of plant growth promotion and were submitted to amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. twenty-four genetic groups were formed at 100% similarity and one representative of each group was selected for their identification by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. they were affiliated with the genera acinetobacter, comamonas, chryseobacterium, klebsiella, enterobacter, pantoea, dyella, burkholderia, or pseudomonas. these strains can be considered of great importance as possible biofertilizers in vetiver.

TI  == arsenic detoxification potential of aox genes in arsenite-oxidizing bacteria isolated from natural and constructed wetlands in the republic of korea.
AB  == arsenic is subject to microbial interactions, which support a wide range of biogeochemical transformations of elements in natural environments such as wetlands. the arsenic detoxification potential of the bacterial strains was investigated with the arsenite oxidation gene, aox genotype, which were isolated  from the natural and constructed wetlands. the isolates were able to grow in the  presence of 10 mm of sodium arsenite (as(iii) as naaso(2)) and 1 mm of d: +glucose. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequencing indicated that  these isolated strains resembled members of the genus that have arsenic-resistant systems (acinetobacter sp., aeromonas sp., agrobacterium sp., comamonas sp., enterobacter sp., pantoea sp., and pseudomonas sp.) with sequence similarities of 81-98%. one bacterial isolate identified as pseudomonas stutzeri strain gist-bdan2 (ef429003) showed the activity of arsenite oxidation and existence of  aoxb and aoxr gene, which could play an important role in arsenite oxidation to arsenate. this reaction may be considered as arsenic detoxification process. the  results of a batch test showed that p. stutzeri gist-bdan2 (ef429003) completely  oxidized in 1 mm of as(iii) to as(v) within 25-30 h. in this study, microbial activity was evaluated to provide a better understanding of arsenic biogeochemical cycle in both natural and constructed wetlands, where ecological niches for microorganisms could be different, with a specific focus on arsenic oxidation/reduction and detoxification.

TI  == changes in bacterial isolates from burn wounds and their antibiograms: a 20-year  study (1986-2005).
AB  == background: our aim is to elucidate shifts in the bacterial spectrum colonising burn wounds and corresponding antibiotic susceptibilities during a 20-year study  period. methods: microbiological results from burn patients collected between 1986 and 2005 were analysed retrospectively. results: staphylococcus aureus was isolated most frequently (20.8%), followed by escherichia coli (13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (11.8%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) (10.9%), enterococcus sp. (9.7%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5%), acinetobacter sp. (3.2%), proteus mirabilis (2%) and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (1.4%). susceptibility of s. aureus to broad-spectrum substances such as ciprofloxacin or penicillinase-stable penicillins has waned, others such as cotrimoxazole or netilmicin remained effective. not a single resistance against vancomycin was recorded. increases in methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) were pronounced (3% in 1986-1997 (the first of the three study periods) to 16% in 1998-2001 and 13% in 2002-2005). results for methicillin-resistant cns (mrcns) show an even greater increase. p. aeruginosa has shown increasing susceptibility  against netilmicin (1986-1989: 84%, 2002-2005: 95%). susceptibility of p. aeruginosa to ceftazidime has decreased markedly. s. maltophilia has shown clinically relevant susceptibility mainly against ciprofloxacin. acinetobacter sp. have shown little susceptibility to most antibiotics. imipenem or meropenem have been very reliable reserve antibiotics throughout the study period for the fermenting enterobacteriaceae (e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae and p. mirabilis), with susceptibilities of or near 100%. conclusion: in-depth knowledge of the bacteria causing infectious complications and of their antibiotic susceptibilities is a prerequisite for treating burn patients. our study shows shifts in the microbial spectrum and their antibiogram, which mandate frequent reassessments.

TI  == microbial diversity of soil bacteria in agricultural field contaminated with heavy metals.
AB  == in this study we evaluated the bacterial diversity in a soil sample from a site next to a chemical industrial factory previously contaminated with heavy metals.  analysis of 16s rdna sequences amplified from dna directly extracted from the soil revealed 17 different bacterial types (genera and/or species). they included polyangium spp., sphingomonas spp., variovorax spp., hafina spp., clostridia, acidobacteria, the enterics and some uncultured strains. microbes able to tolerate high concentrations of cadmium (500 micromol/l and above) were also isolated from the soil. these isolates included strains of acinetobacter (strain  cd06), enterobacter sp. (strains cd01, cd03, cd04 and cd08) (similar strains also identified in culture-independent approach) and a strain of stenotrophomonas sp.  the results indicated that the species identified from direct analysis of 16s rdna of the soil can be quite different from those strains obtained from enrichment cultures and the microbial activities for heavy metal resistance might be more appropriately addressed by the actual isolates.

TI  == bacterial contamination of random-donor platelets in a university hospital in the midwestern region of brazil.
AB  == background: bacterial blood contamination was probably the first recognized transfusion-transmitted disease. although the transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis has been known for a long time, it remains an important health problem. at present it is the most frequently reported cause of infectious transfusion-related fatalities. the aims of the study were to determine the prevalence of microbiologic contamination in random-donor platelets (rdps) and to identify the isolated microorganism obtained from a brazilian university hemotherapy service. study design and methods: a total of 2000 rdps were analyzed from november 2004 to june 2005. the time of storage of the platelet (plt) concentrates studied ranged from the day of donation (day 0) to the fifth day of  storage (day 5). the rdp cultures were initially performed in pools with bottles  containing brain heart infusion (bhi) growth medium, and cultures were incubated  aerobically at 37 degrees c for up to 7 days and subcultured onto chocolate agar  at 37 degrees c for 48 hours under conditions of microaerophilia. in the cases of positivity of one pool, the culture was individually performed for all the samples of that pool. results: eight units (0.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.31-0.49) were found to be contaminated. isolated microorganisms were three acinetobacter lwoffii, one enterobacter intermedium, one serratia phymuthica, one staphylococcus haemolyticus, one staphylococcus hominis, and one bacillus sp. conclusion: plt concentrates were contaminated with bacteria in 0.4 percent of tested units, which represents a potential risk to patients and a public health problem. regarding the contaminant microorganisms, a predominance of gram-negative agents was observed (62.5%).

TI  == bacteria fauna from the house fly, musca domestica (l.).
AB  == the house fly, musca domestica has long been considered a potential agent for disease transmission ever since its existence. the general truth of this assertion remains undisputed till the present day in spite of increasing awareness toward an improved sanitation and better hygiene. the habitual movement of house fly from filthy substrata such as human faeces, animal excreta, carcasses, garbage, etc. makes them ideal candidates for disease transmission such as cholera, shigellosis, salmonellosis and others when settling on food. fly as a potential mechanical vector of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated in this study by examining flies from various breeding sites such as food courts, dumping ground, food processing areas and poultry farm in peninsular malaysia. the flies  were baited with 10% sugar solution on a glass slide in the field. all materials  used for collection of samples were sterile. bacteria from fly sample were isolated using the normal isolation technique. bacillus sp., coccobacillus sp., staphylococcus sp., microccus sp., streptococcus sp., acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp., proteus sp., escherichia sp., klebsiella sp. and yeast cells were isolated from feaces, vomitus, external surfaces and internal organs of house fly. newly emerged house fly did not harbour any bacteria.

(n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == [analysis of bacterial diversity of kefir grains by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna sequencing].
AB  == kefir is an acidic, mildly alcoholic dairy beverage produced by the fermentation  of milk with a grain-like starter culture. these grains usually contain a relatively stable and specific balance of microbes that exist in a complex symbiotic relationship. kefir grains can be considered a probiotic source as it presents anti-bacterial, anti-mycotic, anti-neoplasic and immunomodulatory properties. the microorganisms in kefir grains are currently identified by traditional methods such as growth on selective media, morphological and biochemical characteristics. however, the microorganisms that isolate by these methods can not revert to kefir grains which indicate that there are some other bacteria that are not isolate from it. in this study, pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(dgge) and sequence analysis of 16s ribosomal rna gene (16s rdna) clone libraries was used for the rapid and accurate identification of microorganisms from kefir grains. the pcr primers were designed from conserved nucleotide sequences on region v3 of 16s rdna with gc rich clamp at the 5'-end. pcr was performed using the primers and genomic dnas of kefir grains bacteria. the generated region v3 of 16s rdna fragments were separated by  denaturing gel, and the dominant 16s rdna bands were cloned, sequenced and subjected to an online similarity search. research has shown that regions v3 of 16s rdnas have eight evident bands on the dgge gel. the sequence analysis of these eight bands has indicated that they belong to different four genera, among  them three sequences are similar to sphingobacterium sp. whose similarities with  database sequences are over 98%, three sequences are similar to lactobacillus sp. whose similarities with database sequences are over 96%, the other two sequence are similar to enterobacter sp., and acinetobacter sp. whose similarities with database sequences are over 99% respectively. although the dgge method may have a lower sensitivity than the ordinary pcr methods, because when universal bacterial pcr primers are used, only the dominant microbiota of an ecosystem will be visualized on a dgge gel, producing complex banding patterns. however, it could visualize the bacterial qualitative compositions and reveal the major species of  the kefir grains. among them sphingobacterium can be found in kefir grains as the predominant flora which is reported for the first time. pcr-based dgge and sequence analysis of 16s rdna proved to be a valuable culture-independent approach for the rapid and specific identification of the microbial species present in microecosystem and probiotic products.

TI  == comparison of pcr-dgge and selective plating methods for monitoring the dynamics  of a mixed culture population in synthetic brewery wastewater.
AB  == enrichment of an activated sludge inoculum in synthetic brewery wastewater, which included glucose, maltose, and ethanol, was conducted in batch experiments to identify the dominant microbes present, to determine methodologies capable of monitoring the mixed culture population dynamics, and to determine the consortium's substrate degradation behavior. these results and methodologies were subsequently used in the determination of the population dynamics of suspended and attached microorganisms in a sequencing batch system in the second part of this research work. the three-membered microbial community comprised two bacterial and one fungal species that were identified as acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp., and candida sp. pcr-dgge and plating on selective media were used to track the population dynamics of the consortium during the degradation of different substrates in synthetic wastewater containing glucose, maltose, and ethanol. enterobacter sp. could degrade glucose and maltose but not ethanol, whereas acinetobacter and candida could degrade all three carbon sources. in buffered batch mixed culture experiments, enterobacter was the predominant bacterium until the sugar concentrations decreased to levels that enabled acinetobacter and candida to degrade ethanol. pcr-dgge was effective for detecting the dominant species, but culture-based methods were more accurate for  monitoring the population dynamics of these microorganisms during growth in the wastewater medium.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. five university clinics and/or regional hospitals in the slovak republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (19%), staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli (13.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter sp. all cons and s. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the cons and only for 4% of s. aureus isolates. a higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in cons in comparison to s. aureus. enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against e. coli. although 17% of k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against k. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == characterization of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in rendered animal products.
AB  == antibiotics are used in food animal production to treat diseases and also to improve performance. antibiotics are not used on all farms, and antibiotic resistance is occasionally found on farms that do not use antibiotics. rendered animal protein products are often included in poultry feeds and could potentially serve as a source of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. one hundred sixty-five rendered animal protein products from cattle, poultry, and fish were aseptically  collected from poultry feed mills. fifty-five percent of the poultry meal samples had detectable levels of gram-negative bacteria ranging from 40 to 10,440 colony-forming units/g of sample. poultry meal and meat and bone meal had the greatest number of samples with bacteria resistant to five or more antibiotics. a high percentage of feed samples (85%) contained bacteria resistant to amoxicillin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid, or cephalothin, whereas few samples contained bacteria resistant to ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. acinetobacter calcoaceticus, citrobacter freundii, and enterobacter cloacae were the most commonly isolated antibiotic-resistant bacteria. isolation for salmonella was also performed, with 14% of the meat and bone meal samples containing salmonella sp. only one of the meat and bone meal isolates, salmonella livingstone, was resistant to five or more antibiotics. many of the antibiotic-resistant bacteria contained integrons, genetic elements that mediate multiple drug resistance.

TI  == pathogen frequency and resistance patterns in brazilian hospitals: summary of results from three years of the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program.
AB  == background: pathogen frequency and resistance patterns may vary significantly from country to country and also in different hospitals within a country. thus, regional surveillance programs are essential to guide empirical therapy and infection control measures. methods: rank order of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogenic species causing bloodstream infections (bsi), lower  respiratory tract infections (lrti), wound or skin and soft tissue infections (wssti), and urinary tract infections (uti) in hospitalized patients were determined by collecting consecutive isolates over a specified period of time, as part of the sentry antimicrobial resistance surveillance program (sentry). all isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution. results and conclusions: a total of 3,728 bacterial strains were obtained from january, 1997, to december, 1999, from 12 brazilian hospitals located in 4 states. the largest number of isolates were obtained from patients with bsi (2,008), followed by lrti (822 cases), uti (468 cases), and wssti (430 cases). staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated pathogen in general (22.8% - 852 isolates), followed by  e. coli (13.8% - 516 cases) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.3% - 496 cases). staphylococcus aureus was also the most common species isolated from bsi (23.6%)  and wssti (45.8%), and p. aeruginosa was the most frequent species isolated from  patients with lrti (29.4%). the main bacterial resistance problems found in this  study were: imipenem resistance among p. aeruginosa (69.8% susceptibility) and acinetobacter spp. (88.1% susceptibility); esbl production among k. pneumoniae (48.4%) and e. coli (8.9%); resistance to third generation cephalosporins among enterobacter spp. (68.1% susceptible to ceftazidime) and oxacillin resistance among s. aureus (34.0%) and coagulase negative staphylococci (80.1%). only the carbapenems (88.1% to 89.3% susceptibility) showed reasonable activity against the acinetobacter spp. isolates evaluated.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic findings in dogs with bronchoscopically diagnosed tracheal collapse: 37 cases (1990-1995).
AB  == objective: to investigate the role of bacteria in bronchoscopically diagnosed tracheal collapse in dogs by evaluating qualitative results of bacteriologic cultures. design: retrospective study. animals: 37 dogs with tracheal collapse. procedure: clinical records for dogs with tracheal collapse confirmed with bronchoscopy were reviewed. a protected catheter brush was used to obtain samples for bacteriologic culture from the large airways. results: results of bacterial culture were negative for 5 of 29 dogs. for 24 dogs, 1 (n = 10), 2 (6), or > or = 3 (8) species of bacteria were isolated. pseudomonas spp were isolated most frequently (17/29), and a single pseudomonas sp grew in 7 samples. other bacteria included enterobacter spp (4/29), citrobacter spp (3/29), and moraxella spp, klebsiella spp, bordetella spp, or acinetobacter spp (2/29 dogs each). anaerobic  and aerobic cultures yielded positive results in samples from 2 dogs. cytologic results were available for 13 dogs with positive results of bacteriologic culture; epithelial cells were reported most commonly. five samples had a small number of neutrophils; bacteria were identified cytologically in 2 of 5 samples that contained neutrophils. bacteria were also seen in 2 samples that lacked inflammatory cells. conclusions and clinical relevance: bacteria are commonly isolated from samples obtained via airway brushing in dogs with tracheal collapse; however, in the absence of cytologic confirmation of inflammation or infection, an association between bacteria and clinical signs of tracheal collapse cannot be established.

TI  == multiple organ failure in septic patients.
AB  == multiple organ failure (mof) is the main cause of death in icus, especially affecting septic patients. it is strongly related to number of systems with failure, type of system involved, risk factors such as age, previous chronic diseases, delayed or inadequate resuscitation, persistent infection, immune suppression, and others. the prognoses is worse for patients rather than in elective or emergency surgical patients. the objective of this article is to provide data from our university teaching hospital icu related to the incidence of septic patients, the distribution of mof, and distribution of failure among each of the organs. the mortality rate, relationship between mortality and age, and mortality and types of organs affected were evaluated. the main bacterial causes of sepsis were also identified. a retrospective evaluation was done of 249 patients admitted to the icu in a 4 month period during 1999. fifty four patients had sepsis diagnosed by accs/sccm criteria. there were 37 men and 17 women; 24 medical and 30 post-surgical patients (9 after elective surgery and 21 emergency  patients). apache ii score was calculated on admission and mof, measured for the  first five days, was diagnosed using marshall and meakins criteria. the statistical method used was non-parametric mann-whitney test, p<0.05 was considered significant. the incidence of sepsis was recorded in 54/249 patients (22%). thirty of these 54 patients (56%) died. death occurred in 2 of 11 patients with one organ failure (18%), in 14/27 with 2 or 3 organ failures (52%), and 14/16 with 4 or more organ failures (88%). none of the three patients 15 to 20 years old died, 17/32 (55%) patients age 21-60 years, and >61 years 13/19 (68%),  died. there were 23 patients with positive bacterial culture. the most frequent bacteria found were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (5), multiresistant acinetobacter baumanii (3), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), enterobacter aerogenes (3), klebsiella pneumoniae (2) and multiresistant staphylococcus aureus (2). the mean  value +/- sd of apache ii (mortality risk) for survivors was 21 +/- 18 and for non-survivors 42 +/- 26 (p<0.001). we conclude that mof due to sepsis in an icu is frequent, with high mortality related to the number of failing organs, age and high apache ii.

TI  == comparison of the antimicrobial tolerance of oxytetracycline-resistant heterotrophic bacteria isolated from hospital sewage and freshwater fishfarm water in belgium.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between antimicrobial tolerance and taxonomic diversity among the culturable oxytetracycline-resistant  (ot(r)) heterotrophic bacterial population in two belgian aquatic sites receiving wastewater either from human medicine or from aquaculture. the study of ot(r) heterotrophs and mesophilic aeromonas spp. allowed comparison of tolerance data at the intergenus as well as at the intragenus level. in total, 354 independently obtained ot(r) isolates were subjected to antimicrobial tolerance testing and identified by glc analysis of their cellular fatty acid methyl esters (fames), by api 20e profiling and/or by fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (faflp) dna fingerprinting. in general, ot(r) hospital heterotrophs displayed a higher frequency (84%) of ampicillin (amp) tolerance compared to the ot(r) heterotrophs from the freshwater fishfarm site (22%). fame results indicated that this effect was linked to the predominance of intrinsically ampicillin-resistant  ot(r) aeromonas strains over representatives of acinetobacter and escherichia coli within the hospital strain set. among the ot(r) mesophilic aeromonas strain  set, the global tolerance profiles of the two sites only differed in a higher number of kanamycin (kan) -tolerant strains (43%) for hospital aeromonads in comparison with the fishfarm aeromonads (8%). to some extent, this finding was correlated with the specific presence of aeromonas caviae dna hybridisation group (hg) 4. collectively, these results suggest that the profiles for amp and kan tolerance observed in both sites arose from taxonomic differences in the culturable ot(r) bacterial population at the generic or subgeneric level. in addition, our identification data also revealed that enterobacter sp., stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and a. veronii biovar sobria hg8 may be considered  potential indicator organisms to assess microbial tolerance in various compartments of the aquatic environment.

TI  == [hospital acquired pneumonia--analysis of frequency and etiology in polish hospitals in 1998].
AB  == hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap) is one of the most frequently occurring hospital infections in the world. this study describes the incidence of hap in poland, as well as the specific risk factors leading to this type of infection in polish hospitals; including those of patient age, length of hospitalization, and  use of mechanical ventilation. the epidemiology of hap as well as treatment resistance of various causal organisms was studied. data for this study was acquired from the registry of hospital-acquired infectious diseases for the year  1998. out of 329,608 hospital-acquired infections in all patients except newborns, 920 were found to be hap. this study showed that of every 1000 hospital admissions three patients developed hap (0.3%). death occurred in 260 of 920 hap  cases or 30%; and hap found to be the direct cause of death in 66 of the 260 cases (25%). the greatest incidence of hap was found to occur in patients older than 75 years, was directly related to the length of hospital stay, and was higher in patients on mechanical ventilation longer than 10 days. the most frequently isolated causal agents were the gram-negative rods (pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp., klebsiella sp., enterobacter sp.), and staphylococcus aureus. streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae were found in only 2% and 4% of cases, respectively, and thus were the least likely causes of hap in this population. it was found that the percentage of methicillin-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus was very high (55% to 60%); vancomycin-resistant enterococci were only found in patients who did not undergo surgery. the isolated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa showed marked resistance to chinolones (58-76%) and to imipen (approximately 20%). in the enterobacteriaceae family, klebsiella sp. was found to be resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (56-73%) and enterobacter sp. resistant in 55% to 81% of the isolates.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == incidence and susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria vary between intensive care units within a single hospital: implications for empiric antibiotic strategies.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to determine whether the incidence of recovery and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria vary between intensive care units (icus) in a single teaching hospital. methods: culture and susceptibility results were collected prospectively for a 3-month period (april through june 1999) in each of the surgical, trauma, and medical icus. the number of unique isolates and susceptibility patterns were determined.  susceptibility of isolates among icus was compared with chi2. results: statistically significant differences between icus in susceptibility to various antibiotics were found for staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus sp, acinetobacter  sp, enterobacter sp, klebsiella sp, and pseudomonas sp. notably, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus was not seen in the medical icu, whereas it was seen in both the surgical and trauma icus. klebsiella spp resistant to ceftazidime were seen only in the trauma icu. the aminoglycosides and quinolones  had attenuated activity against pseudomonas sp in the surgical icu, whereas they  remained highly effective in the trauma icu. cefazolin had no activity against the enterobacter sp in either of the surgical icus, but was highly effective in the medical icu. conclusion: although the microbiologic results of this study should not be extrapolated to other institutions, the principle is of value. there is variability between icus in a single large teaching hospital in susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to various antibiotics. this may have implications in the design of empiric antibiotic strategies and the planning of the hospital formulary. hospital wide or composite icu antibiograms are inadequate for planning empiric therapy in the icu.

TI  == microbiological investigation on black crusts from open-air stone monuments of bologna (italy).
AB  == samples of black crusts taken from open-air stone monuments in bologna dating back to between the twelfth and the nineteenth century were considered. the microbiological test procedures isolated from a high number of chemoorganotrophic bacteria, each of the samples although it was expected to find chemo-lithotrophic (specially sulfur-oxidizing and nitrifying) bacteria on account of the great amounts of sulphur, carbon, nitrogen dioxides and ammonia in the air. sporogenous and asporogenous species were found among the isolated bacteria: the first were recognized as bacillus subtilis, bacillus brevis, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus mycoides and bacillus megaterium; the latter were corynebacterium glutamicum, actinomyces sp., alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, flavobacterium breve, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas stutzeri. these species were differently associated in the samples studied with a frequency of more than sixty-four per cent. this finding leads us  to believe that their presence in the black crusts is not occasional, but the result of an ecologically significant process of colonization. although behavioural tests (solubilization of calcium carbonate, of calcium sulphate and marble dust) did not reveal lithic activity among the bacteria studied, one can presume that their behaviour in nature - as a more or less complex microbial consortium - can be totally different and exert a decomposing action with regard  to several minerals, most of them acidify the media in which they develop.

AB  == the purposes of this study were to determine whether microorganisms can be isolated from the membranes of stethoscopes used by clinicians and nurses, and to analyse whether or not the degree of bacterial colonization could be reduced with different cleaning methods. we designed a transversal before-after study in which 122 stethoscopes were examined. coagulase negative staphylococci (which are also  potentially pathogenic microorganisms) were isolated together with 13 other potentially pathogenic microorganisms, including s. aureus, acinetobacter sp. and enterobacter agglomerans. the most effective antiseptic was propyl alcohol. analysis of the cleaning habits of the emergency department (ed) staff, showed that 45% cleaned the stethoscope annually or never. the isolation of potentially  pathogenic microorganisms suggests that the stethoscope must be considered as a potential vector of infection not only in the ed but also in other hospital wards and out-patient clinics.

AB  == the urine from 210 patients with acute urinary tract infection (uti) was examined to study the in vitro effect of ciprofloxacin on fimbriae production by uropathogenic escherichia coli isolates. forty-nine bacterial samples of density  10(5) cfu/ml were not considered. from the resulting 161 samples, e. coli was the major strain found, present in 54 samples. other microoganisms found were: enterococcus sp. (34 samples), staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), proteus sp. (11), pseudomonas sp. (11), klebsiella sp. (8), enterobacter sp. (6), citrobacter sp. (3), and acinetobacter sp. (1). the uropathogenic e. coli strains found were p-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, sds-page of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (tem). all e. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 mic). our results showed that: 1) p-fimbriated e. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute uti (34%); 2) exposure to sub-mics of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production  in 79% of e. coli strains; 3) the pattern of sds-page fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the  protein at 18 kd known as p-fimbriae.

AB  == a compost mixture amended with soybean oil was enriched in microorganisms that transformed unsaturated fatty acids (ufas). when oleic acid or 10-ketostearic acid was the selective fatty acid, sphingobacterium thalpophilum (nrrl b-23206, nrrl b-23208, nrrl b-23209, nrrl b-23210, nrrl b-23211, nrrl b-23212), acinetobacter spp. (nrrl b-23207, nrrl b-23213), and enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23264, nrrl b-23265, nrrl b-23266) represented isolates that produced either hydroxystearic acid, ketostearic acid, or incomplete decarboxylations. when ricinoleic (12-hydroxy-9-octadecenoic) acid was the selective ufa, enterobacter cloacae (nrrl b-23257, nrrl b-23267) and escherichia sp. (nrrl b-23259) produced  12-c and 14-c homologous compounds, and pseudomonas aeruginosa (nrrl b-23256, nrrl b-23260) converted ricinoleate to a trihydroxyoctadecenoate product. also, various enterobacter, pseudomonas, and serratia spp. appeared to decarboxylate linoleate substrate incompletely. these saprophytic, compost bacteria were aerobic or facultative anaerobic gram-negative and decomposed ufas through decarboxylation, hydroxylation, and hydroperoxidation mechanisms.

AB  == objective: to evaluate the in vitro activity of the fourth-generation cephalosporin cefpirome in comparison to that of ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime and imipenem in a multicenter study involving nine hospitals from six  cities (four states). material and method: a total of 804 isolates from patients  hospitalized in either intensive care units or oncology/hematology units was evaluated. the isolates were collected between june and november of 1995, i.e. before cefpirome became commercially available in brazil, and susceptibility tested by broth microdilution following the nccls procedures. all isolates resistant to cefpirome were retested by e-test. results: against enterobacteriaceae (n = 344), cefpirome demonstrated an activity 2 to 32-fold higher than that of the third-generation cephalosporins (tgcs) and similar to that of imipenem. the percentages of enterobacteriaceae susceptible were: 88%, 69% and 96% for cefpirome, tgcs and imipenem, respectively. the cefpirome spectrum was greater or equal than that of imipenem against citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, morganella morganii and serratia marcescens. against acinetobacter sp. (n = 77), cefpirome was slightly more active than ceftazidime;  however, the percentages of isolates resistant to these compounds were high (84%  and 88%, respectively). the activities of cefpirome, ceftazidime and imipenem were very similar against p. aeruginosa isolates (n = 128), with mic50(mg/ml)/percent susceptible of 8/59%, 8/62% and 4/62% respectively. against  aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the cefpirome activity was 4 to 16-fold higher than that of tgcs but 2 to 8-fold lower than that of imipenem. conclusion: the results suggest that, in brazil, cefpirome has a spectrum of activity which is higher than that of the tgcs against aerobic gram-negative (enterobacteriaceae and non-enterobacteriaceae) and gram-positive bacteria and similar to that of imipenem against some enterobacteriaceae species and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [the role of meropenem in bacterial meningitis].
AB  == meropenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic of with an antibacterian spectrum similar to that of imipenem, but from which it may mainly be differentiated by the possibility of its administration at high doses and it has no demonstrated proconvulsive effect, properties which make it applicable in the treatment of bacterial meningitis. the clinical and experimental experience in the treatment of bacterial meningitis with this antibiotic is herein reviewed. it has been observed that the efficacy and safety of meropenem in meningitis caused by n. meningitidis, h. influenzae and pneumococci sensitive to penicillin may be similar to that of cefotaxime or ceftriaxone in both the pediatric and adult population. there are very few reports on the treatment of meningitis caused by pneumococci resistant to penicillin. however, given that the activity of meropenem on these pneumococci is similar to that of cefotaxime and that the doses administered are much lower, it does not appear to be recommendable in the  treatment of this indication, although it should be tested in all meningeal strain to these characteristics isolated. it may currently be considered that the main indication of meropenem in the infections of the central nervous system is in nosocomial meningitis by multiresistant gram negative bacilli such as those of the klebsiella-serratia-enterobacter and acinetobacter sp. group. therefore a limited, albeit favorable, report on the clinical experience with meropenem is herein presented. meropenem may also be useful in the treatment of meningitis by  pseudomonas aeruginosa in which other treatments have failed.

AB  == background: the new cephalosporins with heterocyclic positively charged substituent at position c3 belong to the 4th generation cephalosporins. it is not evident, whereas these antibiotics are effective against cefotaxime-ceftazidime-resistant bacteria. we investigated the efficiency of the  cefepime (maxipime, bms) against acinetobacter sp., x. maltophilia, pseudomonas sp., flavobacterium sp., sphingobacterium sp. and against strains with production of esbl (extended spectrum beta-lactamases) (enterobacter sp., citrobacter sp., klebsiella sp.). methods and results: we determined the susceptibility of the 54  strains resistant to 50 mg/l and more of ceftazidime. the majority of the strains (35) are susceptible to cefepime and mic is the range 1.65-3.15 mg/l of cefepime. 17 strains have mic = 6.25 mg/l. two strains (one strain p. aeruginosa a one strain k. pneumoniae) were resistant to cefepime and mic = 12.5 mg/l. the activity of beta-lactamases was determined by quantitative macroiodometric method in one strain of p. cepacia and two strains of sphingobacterium multivorum. they  hydrolyse actively imipenem (they produce metallo-beta-lactamase) and ceftazidime (they are highly resistant to this antibiotic), but cefepime is more slowly hydrolysed than ceftazidime. conclusions: at the present time cefepime is effective against ceftazidime-resistant strains in so-called "problematic" species of bacteria. however, it is important to protect its efficiency in the future, this requires its rational use.

AB  == nosocomial infections encountered in intensive care units are frequently due to gram negative bacilli among which stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter sp., and enterobacter sp. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the new broad spectrum cephalosporins cefepime (fep) and cefpirome (cpo) alone or in combination with amikacin (akn), gentamicin (gtn) or ciprofloxacin (cip) against acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and enterobacter cloacae producing a derepressed cephalosporinase. this study was performed by using the time-kill curve method on 24 h with a starting inoculum of 10(6) - 10(7) cfu/ml. the combination of fep (4 mg/l) with akn (4 mg/l) against a. baumanii only results in about 1 log decrease at 24 h, but when fep is combined at 8 mg/l, the decrease reaches 4 log in 24 h. the combination of fep (16 and 32 mg/l) clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) resulted in 3 log decrease at 24 h. when combined with cip 2 mg/l, fep (16 and 32 mg) resulted in 5 and 6 log decrease in 24 h respectively. there were no survival bacteria at 6 h when fep (32 mg/l) was combined with clavulanic acid (4 mg/l) and gtn (8 mg/l) at 6 h. used alone fep (1 mg/l) or cpo (1 mg/l) against e. cloacae, a 3 log decrease occurs at 6 h followed by a regrowth at 24 h. combined with akn (2 mg/l), fep (1  mg/l) results in a 6 log decrease at 24 h, when cpo at 2 mg/l is needed for an equivalent result. these data show synergistic bactericidal activity of both new  extended cephalosporins combined with akn, gtn or cip at concentrations achievable in biological fluid with adaptative dosage regimen.

TI  == [variation in transfer resistance to cefotaxime, ceftazidime and aztreonam in strains of acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp. and citrobacter sp. isolated from  the same university hospitals].
AB  == background: in the last decade were in sr documented new problems in resistance to the newer antibiotics that with regard to their structure and antibacterial properties resisted to the known mechanism of bacterial resistance. the emergence of multiple drug resistance to the new betalactams is connected both with frequent application of these drugs in the hospitals and transfer of r plasmids.  methods and results: we studied composition and transferability of resistance to  newer betalactam antibiotics in strains of acinetobacter sp., enterobacter sp, and citrobacter sp. isolated during one month in patients from two teaching university hospitals. all strains studied were resistant to cefotaxime (ctx), ceftazidime (caz) and aztreonam (atm) but acinetobacter strains, although resistant also to caz and atm transferred the resistance to ctx only. thus, resistance to caz and atm has a chromosomal origin in these strains. a strain of  citrobacter sp., resistant to ctx, caz and atm, produced a esbl betalactamase detectable in a double-disk diffusion method (fig. 1). an enterobacter cloacae strain transfers directly the resistance to all new betalactams indicated. their  hydrolysis by these strains points to their production of new types of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases esbl). conclusions: we strongly recommend to be strictly rational in the use of new betalactams of ctx, cza or atm type because it is suspected that, especially in so-called empirical prophylaxis or treatment, they exert a strong selective pressure toward the prevalence of mutants with transferable esbl-producing nosocomial bacteria resistant to these drugs.

TI  == development of resistance during antimicrobial therapy: a review of antibiotic classes and patient characteristics in 173 studies.
AB  == the incidence of emergent resistance and clinical factors affecting its development were evaluated by retrospective review of 173 studies encompassing over 14,000 patients. eight antibiotic classes and 225 individual treatment regimens were evaluated. emergent resistance occurred among 4.0% of all organisms and 5.6% of all infections treated. it appeared to be significantly more frequent with penicillin and aminoglycoside monotherapy, with significantly lower rates associated with imipenem-cilastatin, aztreonam, and combination therapy. clinical failure also appeared to be significantly more likely to occur after emergence of resistance among organisms treated with fluoroquinolones or aminoglycosides. infections associated with higher resistance rates were cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and lower respiratory tract infections. resistance was most common in patients in intensive care units or receiving mechanical ventilation. it was also significantly frequent among studies performed in university or teaching hospitals. organisms associated with high resistance rates were pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia, enterobacter, and acinetobacter sp. factors such as infection type, underlying diseases, type of institution, and specific pathogens  warrant consideration when examining emergent resistance.

AB  == resistance to third-generation, or extended-spectrum, cephalosporins caused by induction of class i beta-lactamases has been reported rarely from developing countries. seven isolates of cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative rods were recovered recently from urine, burns and ulcers in the queen elizabeth hospital,  barbados. the isolates were identified as acinetobacter calcoaceticus (2), citrobacter freundii (1), enterobacter cloacae (1), morganella morganii (1), providencia stuartii (1) and proteus sp. (1). induction of beta-lactamase by cefoxitin was demonstrated, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined by agar dilution. beta-lactamases were demonstrated by isoelectric focusing; the presence of chromosomal beta-lactamases was confirmed in at least three of the resistant isolates. the only antibiotics which were uniformly active against these resistant strains were imipenem and ciprofloxacin. these data confirm the existence of resistance to the third-generation cephalosporins in barbados, and emphasise the necessity for continuous surveillance of resistance patterns in the caribbean region.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

AB  == newer beta-lactam antibiotics with high levels of activity against gram-negative  aerobic bacilli (including pseudomonas aeruginosa) such as cefoperazone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and aztreonam may be suitable for monotherapy of gram-negative pneumonia. aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin are also highly active against these same organisms and have been more extensively used, but are both ototoxic and nephrotoxic. key therapeutic questions are whether beta-lactams can safely replace aminoglycosides for the treatment of gram-negative pneumonia, and whether monotherapy or aminoglycoside and beta-lactam combination antibiotic treatment is superior. there is remarkably little definitive clinical data in the literature to answer these questions, but  available studies suggest that beta-lactam monotherapy may be adequate for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonias, but that combination therapy may be preferred for pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, enterobacter sp, and acinetobacter sp, largely based on rates of bacterial persistence and emergence of resistance. at this time, there are more data available to support aminoglycoside monotherapy than beta-lactam monotherapy in gram-negative pneumonia and remarkably little data to suggest superiority of two antibiotics over single agents when they have been compared prospectively. thus, combination  therapy remains a conservative recommendation until better studies are available.

TI  == in-vitro and in-vivo antimicrobial activities of a novel cephalosporin derivative, cp6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the c-3 side chain.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of a novel cephalosporin derivative, cp6162, possessing a dihydroxypyridone moiety at the c-3 side chain, was evaluated in vitro and in vivo, with ceftazidime, aztreonam and cefoperazone as the reference  antibiotics. cp6162 showed weak or little activity against gram-positive bacteria, but potent activity against clinical isolates of the gram-negative species including strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, ps. cepacia, acinetobacter sp., xanthomonas maltophilia, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii, which were resistant to the reference antibiotics. the mics of cp6162 were only slightly affected by the high producers of beta-lactamases except for cephalosporinase-producing c. freundii. it was, however, affected by the presence of ferric ion. cp6162 showed in-vivo activity paralleling the in-vitro activity, and also showed pharmacokinetic parameters similar to those of ceftazidime in mice and rats.

TI  == cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms.
AB  == we reviewed cases of gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at texas children's hospital from january, 1984, through june, 1989. seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. the etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were klebsiella sp, 9;  escherichia coli, 4; enterobacter cloacae, 3; citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2.  with the exception of one isolate of acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. in addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. children with meningitis caused by klebsiella sp. or non-klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). the mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the klebsiella and non-klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against  gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.

TI  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage.
AB  == the effect of physical and microbiological factors on food container leakage was  investigated in a container leakage model system (clms). the leakage of acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp., pseudomonas sp., bacillus sp., a coryneform, staph. aureus, and two biotest organisms (enterobacter cloacae nc1b 8151 and ent. aerogenes mb31) was studied. the rate of bacterial leakage (log10 cells/channel/s) was greater in the presence of a partial vacuum of 51-305 mm hg  than at atmospheric pressure. fluid flow (ml) through leakage channels was increased by the application of vacuum. leakage varied with vacuum, bacterial morphology, cell concentration, leakage channel size (0.78-120 micron 2) and channel shape (straight or convoluted). the number of leaked cells was not proportional to vacuum or channel size. the effect of channel shape varied with bacterial species. increased container medium viscosity decreased bacterial leakage. fluid flow through leakage channels was generally reduced by the most viscous solution. cells from biofilms and monolayers of ac. calcoaceticus or staph. aureus attached to nylon (hyfax) or stainless steel surfaces underwent leakage. mixed bacterial populations had characteristic leakage rates against vacuum different from the leakage pattern of individual species in the population. the composition of the leaked population was different from the original inoculum. the results indicated that container leakage is a complex process involving a range of interdependent factors.

TI  == bacterial growth rates and competition affect nodulation and root colonization by rhizobium meliloti.
AB  == the addition of streptomycin to nonsterile soil suppressed the numbers of bacterial cells in the rhizosphere of alfalfa (medicago sativa l.) for several days, resulted in the enhanced growth of a streptomycin-resistant strain of rhizobium meliloti, and increased the numbers of nodules on the alfalfa roots. a  bacterial mixture inoculated into sterile soil inhibited the colonization of alfalfa roots by r. meliloti, caused a diminution in the number of nodules, and reduced plant growth. enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and klebsiella pneumoniae suppressed the colonization by r. meliloti of roots grown on agar and reduced nodulation by r. meliloti, the suppression of nodulation being statistically significant for the first three species. bradyrhizobium sp. and "sarcina lutea" did not suppress root colonization nor nodulation by r. meliloti. the doubling times in the rhizosphere for e. aerogenes, p. marginalis, acinetobacter sp., and k. pneumoniae were less and the doubling times for bradyrhizobium sp. and "s. lutea" were greater than the doubling time of r. meliloti. under the same conditions, arthrobacter citreus injured alfalfa roots. we suggest that competition by soil bacteria reduces nodulation by rhizobia in soil and that the extent of inhibition is related to the growth rates of the rhizosphere bacteria.

AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == amifloxacin activity against well-defined gentamicin-resistant, gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == amifloxacin (win 49375) activity against a well-defined group of gentamicin-resistant gram-negative bacilli was compared with the activity of 11 other antimicrobial agents. for all strains, amifloxacin and norfloxacin were the most active agents, followed by cefotaxime and moxalactam. for acinetobacter sp.  only amifloxacin had an achievable mic for 90% of the strains. amifloxacin joins  other newly developed dna gyrase inhibitors as potentially useful agents for infections due to aminoglycoside-resistant gram-negative bacilli.

AB  == susceptibility of 16 056 strains isolated in 1982 and 1983 to fosfomycin (fos) was tested with mueller-hinton medium and discs 50 micrograms fos + 25 micrograms glucose-6-phosphate (g6p) (cutoff diameter 14 mm). for 3 411 strains, inhibition  zone diameters were recorded. almost all e. coli, citrobacter, salmonella and s.  aureus were susceptible to fos as well as 70% of serratia, e. cloacae, p. mirabilis and 50% of klebsiella and enterobacter sp. only 27% of p. aeruginosa, 20% of indole positive proteus and 8% of acinetobacter were sensitive to fos. e.  coli, citrobacter and s. aureus seem to exhibit the highest susceptibilities to fos. sensitivity rates of e. cloacae, serratia, p. aeruginosa, and especially klebsiella seemed slightly underestimated by the disk diffusion method, but differentiation between susceptible and resistant strains was facilitated by rating as susceptible those strains with inhibition zone diameters between 12 and 14 mm. this method also seemed to underrate the sensitivity of susceptible enterobacteriaceae, probably because of inadequate g6p concentrations at this point of the disk.

TI  == [multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: cm 40874].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cm were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. cm demonstrated high activity on enterobacteriaceae, the mic being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. mode mic varies little among the different groups of enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of serratia sp. (mode mic : 0.25) and klebsiella oxytoca (mode mic : 0.03). most of  enterobacter, serratia, and citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by cm at the same concentrations than susceptible strains.  cm has less activity on p. aeruginosa (mic 2-32 micrograms/ml) and acinetobacter  sp. (mic 8-128). staphylococci (mic 32) and enterococci are not susceptible. variable activity is found against other streptococci. cm inhibits haemophilus sp. at mics of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and gonococci at mics of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). meningococci have a mode mic of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). thus, cm 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on haemophilus sp.  and neisseria sp. this additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.

TI  == [pathogen distribution in waste water sprinkler irrigation].
AB  == the spray irrigation with pretreated wastewater was investigated on the sewage farm of the braunschweig sewage utilization association. the emission of airborne bacteria was measured by means of andersen sampler (as), reuter centrifugal sampler (rcs), and sedimentation plates (sp). there was a good correlation of results obtained by parallel measurings of as and rcs. the rcs was more effective by the factor 11.5 than the as sampling airborne microorganisms. however, the as  gaves the distribution curve of differently big airborne particulates (table 1).  the medium decrease of bacteria from the sprinkler determined by as and sp was similar (fig. 1). with low wind velocity, an aerosol containing enterobacteria was yet detectable at a distance of 60-160 m down-wind from the spray sprinkler.  the transport of bacteria as a function of the wind velocity is given in fig. 2 increasing about 25 m for an increase of the wind velocity of 1 m/sec. during the spray irrigation, the composition of bacteria in the airborne particles is varying continuously. the following order of succession of die-away rates was found: aeromonas, plesiomonas, vibrio greater than acinetobacter, pseudomonas greater than enterobacter greater than citrobacter greater than e. coli greater than klebsiella greater than gram-positive bacteria (table 3). only seldom and under extreme conditions, gram-negative bacteria were detected in a range between 200-300 m beyond of concentrations as they were found also in controls without irrigation. this result substantiates a minimum protective distance of 300 m between sprinkler and human settlements.

TI  == [in vitro activity of ceftizoxime on hospital bacteria. results of a multicenter  study].
AB  == the susceptibility to ceftizoxime of all bacterial strains isolated from seven university-affiliated hospitals over one month was tested with disk-diffusion technique. additionally, the mic of 1937 strains selected at random was evaluated by the agar dilution method. the majority of enterobacteriaceae are inhibited at  a concentration of less than 1 microgram/ml with a mode mic varying from 0.008 to 0.12 among the various groups. a few enterobacter and citrobacter strains are resistant. little activity was demonstrated by ceftizoxime on pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic 32 and 8 micrograms/ml respectively).  haemophilus sp. (mic 0.01-0.03) and neisseria (mic less than 0,008-0,016) are very susceptible to the drug. the mic of methicillin-sensitive strains of staphylococcus aureus varies from 1 to 4 micrograms/ml ; enterococci are less susceptible, whereas other streptococci and pneumococci have low mics (less than  0.008-0.025). the susceptibility of anaerobic pathogens varies widely between species, and within species ; mic ranges from 0.008 to 32 micrograms/ml for clostridium sp. and 0.25 to 128 micrograms/ml for bacteroides sp.

TI  == inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. the minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for escherichia coli and klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml),  enterobacter sp and citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia sp, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). when compared with the ranges of activity of seven  reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for p aeruginosa, citrobacter sp, proteus sp, and a calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against enterobacter sp. for amikacin-resistant p aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. the mics and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of amifloxacin were similar. for all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.

TI  == direct dilution sampling, quantitation, and microbial assessment of open-system ventilation circuits in intensive care units.
AB  == in a systematic approach, 37 duplicate samples of open system circuits (bennett ma-1 ventilators) of patients in medical and surgical intensive care units were processed by direct and serial (apha guidelines) dilutions. the paired difference test on 15 of the in-use circuitry solution samples indicated no difference between the direct and serial dilution methods (p less than 0.001). seventy-seven additional respiratory therapy circuitry samples from similar intensive care patients were analyzed via a direct dilution method alone and processed microbiologically. the direct dilution procedure was a rapid and accurate means of evaluation of microbial contamination in the range of greater than or equal to 10 to less than or equal to 10(6) cfu/ml. high densities of organisms frequently  were found. sites of contamination included the proximal or patient end of the circuitry (heaviest), the nebulizer trap, and the distal or humidifier portions of the circuitry. the contaminants found were predominantly gram-negative nonfermenters: acinetobacter calcoaceticus var. antitratus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas maltophilia, and flavobacterium meningosepticum. fermenters were klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus sp., enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter diversus, and enterobacter agglomerans. infrequently, gram-positive streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. were noted.

TI  == plasmids encoding trimethoprim resistance in bacterial isolates from man and pigs.
AB  == trimethoprim (tp) resistant gram negative bacteria were isolated from humans and  pigs. the bacterial hosts were characterized by their resistance pattern and biotype. the presence of transferable tp plasmids was demonstrated in 86% of 59 porcine isolates and 37% of 49 human isolates. the tp r-plasmids carried a diversity of resistance determinants such as tc, cm, sp, sm and su. incompatibility tests distinguished two major groups, inc fiv and inc n. thirty of 99 tp r-plasmids isolated from humans were grouped as inc fiv and eight as inc n. the results of molecular weight determination of tp r-plasmids performed by agarose gel electrophoresis were consistent with the existence of two groups--larger r-plasmids (76 to 104 md) belonging to inc fiv and lower molecular weight r-plasmids (25 to 35 md) belonging to inc n. results from this study indicate that the tp r-plasmids isolated in perth have evolved independently from those described in europe and the united kingdom. there is also evidence for their local spread between escherichia, klebsiella, enterobacter, citrobacter and acinetobacter from man and animals.

TI  == bacterial and fungal isolates from equidae with ulcerative keratitis.
AB  == gram-negative bacteria were the most common microbial isolates from 38 eyes of 37 horses with ulcerative keratitis. pseudomonas sp, enterobacter group, and acinetobacter sp were the most prevalent. fungi were cultured from 15 eyes and included 7 genera, with aspergillus sp being the most prevalent. ten of the eyes  with fungal keratitis had been treated with corticosteroids. eleven of 38 eyes had mixed bacterial and fungal infections. clinically, the most severe cases were those in which aspergillus and gram-negative bacteria existed in a mixed infection. on the basis of susceptibility testing, gentamicin was highly efficacious (88.4%) against all bacterial isolates. cephaloridine was slightly more efficacious than gentamicin against the gram-positive organisms. only 32.3%  of the gram-negative isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. of the relatively small number of gram-positive organisms isolated, streptococci were more often susceptible to chloramphenicol, whereas staphylococci were more often  susceptible to gentamicin.

TI  == nitrous oxide production by organisms other than nitrifiers or denitrifiers.
AB  == heterotrophic bacteria, yeasts, fungi, plants, and animal breath were investigated as possible sources of n(2)o. microbes found to produce n(2)o from no(3) but not consume it were: (i) all of the nitrate-respiring bacteria examined, including strains of escherichia, serratia, klebsiella, enterobacter, erwinia, and bacillus; (ii) one of the assimilatory nitrate-reducing bacteria examined, azotobacter vinelandii, but not azotobacter macrocytogenes or acinetobacter sp.; and (iii) some but not all of the assimilatory nitrate-reducing yeasts and fungi, including strains of hansenula, rhodotorula, aspergillus, alternaria, and fusarium. the no(3)-reducing obligate anaerobe clostridium kdhs2 did not produce n(2)o. production of n(2)o occurred only in stationary phase. the nitrate-respiring bacteria produced much more n(2)o than the other organisms, with yields of n(2)o ranging from 3 to 36% of 3.5 mm no(3).  production of n(2)o was apparently not regulated by ammonium and was not restricted to aerobic or anaerobic conditions. plants do not appear to produce n(2)o, although n(2)o was found to arise from some damaged plant tops, probably due to microbial growth. concentrations of n(2)o above the ambient level in the atmosphere were found in human breath and appeared to increase after a meal of high-nitrate food.

AB  == a quantitative culture technique (hand washed in a glove containing broth for 30  s) was used to determine the frequency of hand carriage of aerobic gram-negative  rods by various groups of health care workers and 104 control subjects. overall,  31% of health care workers carried aerobic gram-negative rods on their hands compared to 59% of control subjects (p < 0.001). enterobacter agglomerans accounted for 40% of the isolates, and other enterobacter spp. 7%. other organisms included acinetobacter calcoaceticus 21%, serratia spp. 11%, klebsiella spp. 10%, moraxella spp. 3%, pseudomonas spp. 3%, proteus spp. 1.5%, escherichia  coli 1%; morganella morganii, citrobacter freundii, aeromonas sp. and an isolate  that was not speciated accounted for 0.5% each. we conclude that endemic hand carriage of aerobic gram-negative rods by health care personnel is common, but significantly less than that of control subjects. enterobacter agglomerans is found so frequently on the hands of control subjects that it must be considered part of the normal hand flora.

TI  == reliability of early identifications obtained with enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

TI  == homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the mrna for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the ecori and one of the hindiii restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total dna from nine bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae: e. coli, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella aerogenes, enterobacter aerogenes,  edwardsiella tarda, serratia marcescens, and erwinia amylovora. however, among the enterobacteriaceae, dna from two species of proteus (p. mirabilis and p. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized  with the e. coli lipoprotein mrna. furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in  four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae: pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter sp. ho1-n, caulobacter crescentus, and myxococcus xanthus. envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified e. coli free-form lipoprotein in the ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. both species of proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. all of the above four bacteria outside the family enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-e. coli lipoprotein serum. from these results, the rate of  evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that  observed for various soluble enzymes of the enterobacteriaceae.
