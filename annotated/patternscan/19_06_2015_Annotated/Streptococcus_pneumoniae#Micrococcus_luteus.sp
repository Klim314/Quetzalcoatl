TI  == site-directed mutations in the lanthipeptide mutacin 1140.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans, strain jh1140, produces the antibiotic mutacin 1140. mutacin 1140 belongs to a group of antibiotics called lanthipeptides. more specifically, mutacin 1140 is related to the epidermin type  a(i) lanthipeptides. mutagenesis experiments of this group of lanthipeptides have been primarily restricted to the posttranslationally modified meso-lanthionine and 3-methyllanthionine residues. site-directed mutagenesis of the core peptide of mutacin 1140 was performed using the suicide vector pva891. substitutions of the n-terminal residue, the charged residue in the hinge region, and residues in  ring a and intertwined rings c and d were investigated. a truncation and insertion of residues in ring a and intertwined rings c and d were also performed to determine whether or not they would alter the antimicrobial activity of the producing strain. bioassays revealed that five of 14 mutants studied had improved antimicrobial activity against the indicator strain micrococcus luteus atcc 10240. mics against streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus pneumoniae atcc 27336, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, clostridium difficile uk1, and micrococcus luteus atcc 10240 were determined for three mutacin 1140 variants that had the most significant increases in bioactivity in the m. luteus bioassay. this mutagenesis study of the epidermin group of lanthipeptides shows that antimicrobial activity can be significantly improved.

TI  == oxidation of lanthionines renders the lantibiotic nisin inactive.
AB  == the peptide antibiotic nisin a belongs to the group of antibiotics called lantibiotics. they are classified as lantibiotics because they contain the structural group lanthionine. lanthionines are composed of a single sulfur atom that is linked to the beta-carbons of two alanine moieties. these sulfur atoms are vulnerable to environmental oxidation. a mild oxidation reaction was performed on nisin a to determine the relative effects it would have on bioactivity. high-mass-accuracy fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry data revealed the addition of seven, eight, and nine oxygens. these  additions correspond to the five lanthionines, two methionines, and two histidines that would be susceptible to oxidation. subsequent bioassays revealed  that the oxidized form of nisin a had a complete loss of bactericidal activity. in a competition study, the oxidized nisin did not appear to have an antagonistic affect on the bioactivity of nisin a, since the addition of an equal molar concentration of the oxidized variant did not have an influence on the bactericidal activity of the native antibiotic. electron microscopy data revealed that the oxidized forms were still capable of assembling into large circular complexes, demonstrating that oxidation does not disrupt the lateral assembly mechanism of the antibiotic. affinity thin-layer chromatography and fluorescence  microscopy experiments suggested that the loss of activity is due to the inability of the oxidized form of nisin to bind to the cell wall precursor lipid  ii. given the loss of bioactivity following oxidation, oxidation should be an important factor to consider in future production, purification, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic studies.

TI  == mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  == the crude extract and the hexane, ch(2)cl(2), etoac, n-buoh, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of leishmania (l. chagasi and l. amazonensis),  11 strains of bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica sorovar tythimurium, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, enterococcus faecalis, enterobacter cloacae, streptococcus pyogenes and bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (candida albicans and  cryptococcus neoformans). the antioxidant activity (dpph radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. all samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. s. sonnei, b. cereus and c. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-buoh and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. the lowest mic was recorded for the ch(2)cl(2) fraction against c. neoformans (mic of 10 microg/ml), followed by b. cereus, s. sonnei, and e. cloacae (mic of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). the ch(2)cl(2) fraction was the most effective against l. chagasi (ic(50) of 6.7  microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against  l. amazonensis (ic(50) of 9 microg/ml). a cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and ch(2)cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. these results suggest that m. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.

TI  == comparative distribution of azithromycin in lung tissue of patients given oral daily doses of 500 and 1000 mg.
AB  == objectives: the administration of antibacterial agents should be optimized on the basis of their distribution to enhance drug exposure and obtain bacterial eradication. this study examines the pharmacokinetics of azithromycin in plasma,  lung tissue and bronchial washing in patients after oral administration of 500 mg versus 1000 mg once daily for 3 days. patients and methods: samples of plasma, lung tissue and bronchial washing were obtained from a cohort of 48 patients during open-chest surgery for lung resection up to 204 h after the last drug dose, and assayed for antibiotic concentrations. results: azithromycin was widely distributed within the lower respiratory tract and sustained levels of the drug were detectable at the last sampling time in lung tissue. doubling the dose of the antibiotic resulted in a proportional increase in lung area under the curve (auc, 1245.4 versus 2514.2 h x mg/kg) and peak tissue concentration (cmax, 8.93 +/- 2.05 versus 18.6 +/- 2.20 mg/kg). the pharmacodynamic parameter auc/mic for susceptible and intermediate strains of streptococcus pneumoniae (mics 0.5 and 2  mg/l, respectively) increased after administration of the 1000 mg schedule compared with 500 mg (auc/mic0.5 2414 versus 1144 and auc/mic2 2112 versus 814.1  h x mg/kg, respectively) in pulmonary tissue. conclusions: lung exposure to azithromycin is increased proportionally by doubling the dose, which results in a predictable pharmacokinetic behaviour of the drug in the lower respiratory tract.

TI  == a variety of gram-positive bacteria carry mobile mef genes.
AB  == the mefe gene codes for a membrane bound efflux protein, which confers resistance to macrolides, and has been identified in streptococcus pneumoniae. a variety of  gram-positive organisms were examined. twenty-six isolates of s. pneumoniae carried mefe and were resistant to erythromycin (mic of 2-16 mg/l). two additional isolates of emr s. pneumoniae carried both ermb and mefe(mic of 16-128 mg/l). one micrococcus luteus, one corynebacterium jeikeium, three corynebacterium spp., two viridans streptococci and seven enterocccus spp. also carried mef genes. it was possible to move the mef gene from all 11 s. pneumoniae tested to susceptible s. pneumoniae and/or enterococcus faecalis recipients. the  addition of dnase (1 g/l) did not affect the gene transfer. it was also possible  to move the mef gene from donor enterococcus spp., viridans streptococci, m. luteus, c. jeikeium and corynebacterium spp. to e. faecalis recipients. transconjugant isolates were resistant to erythromycin (mic = 16 mg/l). hybridization with a labelled mef oligonucleotide probe against southern blots and bacterial dot blots confirmed the presence of the mef genes. this is the first time that a mobile mef gene has been identified in four different genera, from three distinct geographical locations.

TI  == a promoter associated with the neisserial repeat can be used to transcribe the uvrb gene from neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == a recombinant plasmid capable of restoring uv resistance to an escherichia coli uvrb mutant was isolated from a genomic library of neisseria gonorrhoeae. sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame whose deduced amino acid sequence displayed significant similarity to those of the uvrb proteins of e. coli, micrococcus luteus, and streptococcus pneumoniae. a gonococcal uvrb mutant  was constructed and found to be extremely sensitive to uv radiation. transcriptional fusions between portions of the gonococcal uvrb upstream region and a reporter gene were used to localize promoter activity, and the transcriptional start point of the gonococcal uvrb gene was mapped in e. coli by  primer extension. a corresponding sigma 70 promoter was identified within a copy  of the 26-bp neisserial repeat, and this identification provided the first evidence of a promoter associated with this repetitive element in n. gonorrhoeae.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

TI  == structure of the gene complementing uvr-402 in streptococcus pneumoniae: homology with escherichia coli uvrb and the homologous gene in micrococcus luteus.
AB  == the repair ability for uv-induced damage observed for streptococcus pneumoniae proceeds through a system similar to the uvr-dependent system in escherichia coli. the dna sequence of a gene complementing uvr-402, a mutation conferring uv  sensitivity, was determined. alignments of the deduced amino acid sequence revealed an extensive sequence homology of 55% with the uvrb protein of e. coli and 59% with the uvrb-homologous protein of micrococcus luteus. nucleotide-binding site consensus was observed. the high conservation of the uvrb-like gene among these three species suggests that the role of the uvrb protein and excision repair in general might be very important for cell survival.

TI  == excision-repair capacity of uv-irradiated strains of escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, estimated by plasmid recovery.
AB  == although the biological role of many bacterial repair genes is known, there is still an interest in evaluating the capacity of repair pyrimidine dimers in some  strains. for this purpose, we have developed a rapid assay. cells bearing a plasmid are uv irradiated and incubated to allow recovery. the plasmid dna is extracted, purified and treated with uv endonuclease from micrococcus luteus that specifically produces single strand breaks at the site of pyrimidine dimers. the  amount of open circular and covalently closed circular forms of the plasmid dna after treatment and post-incubation provides an estimate of the repair capability of the host strain. the wild type strain and the uvra mutant of escherichia coli  were used to adjust the assay. the lexa mutant of e. coli has been tested and its repair capability is equivalent to that of wild-type strain. the assay has been extended to streptococcus pneumoniae, which is naturally deficient in photoreactivation and sos-like functions. this strain is efficient in the repair  of pyrimidine dimers, formed after uv irradiation.
