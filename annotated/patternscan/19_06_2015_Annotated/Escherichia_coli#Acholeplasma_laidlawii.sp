TI  == membrane remodeling capacity of a vesicle-inducing glycosyltransferase.
AB  == intracellular vesicles are abundant in eukaryotic cells but absent in the gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli. however, strong overexpression of a monotopic glycolipid-synthesizing enzyme, monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase from acholeplasma laidlawii (almgs), leads to massive formation of vesicles in the cytoplasm of e. coli. more importantly, almgs provides a model system for the regulation of membrane properties by membrane-bound enzymes, which is critical for maintaining cellular integrity. both phenomena depend on how almgs binds to cell membranes, which is not well understood. here, we carry out a comprehensive  investigation of the membrane binding of almgs by combining bioinformatics methods with extensive biochemical studies, structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations. we find that almgs binds to the membrane in a fairly upright manner, mainly by residues in the n-terminal domain, and in a way that induces local enrichment of anionic lipids and a local curvature deformation. furthermore, several almgs variants resulting from substitution of residues in the membrane anchoring segment are still able to generate vesicles, regardless of enzymatic activity. these results clarify earlier theories about the driving forces for vesicle formation, and shed new light on the membrane binding properties and enzymatic mechanism of almgs and related monotopic gt-b fold glycosyltransferases.

TI  == heterologous overexpression of a monotopic glucosyltransferase (mgs) induces fatty acid remodeling in escherichia coli membranes.
AB  == the membrane protein monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase (mgs) from acholeplasma  laidlawii is responsible for the creation of intracellular membranes when overexpressed in escherichia coli (e. coli). the present study investigates time  dependent changes in composition and properties of e. coli membranes during 22h of mgs induction. the lipid/protein ratio increased by 38% in mgs-expressing cells compared to control cells. time-dependent screening of lipids during this period indicated differences in fatty acid modeling. (1) unsaturation levels remained constant for mgs cells (~62%) but significantly decreased in control cells (from 61% to 36%). (2) cyclopropanated fatty acid content was lower in mgs  producing cells while control cells had an increased cyclopropanation activity. among all lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) was detected to be the most affected species in terms of cyclopropanation. higher levels of unsaturation, lowered cyclopropanation levels and decreased transcription of the gene for cyclopropane fatty acid synthase (cfa) all indicate the tendency of the mgs protein to force e. coli membranes to alter its usual fatty acid composition.

TI  == nonthermal plasma affects viability and morphology of mycoplasma hominis and acholeplasma laidlawii.
AB  == aim: to study the effects exerted by argon microwave nonthermal plasma (ntp) on cell wall-lacking mollicutes bacteria. methods and results: 10(8) cfu ml(-1) agar plated mycoplasma hominis and acholeplasma laidlawii were treated with the nonthermal microwave argon plasma for 30-300 s. the maximal 10- and 100-fold drop was observed for a. laidlawii and myc. hominis, respectively. similarly treated escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus demonstrated the 10(5) and 10(3) drop, respectively. removal of cholesterol affected resistance of a. laidlawii. 10 mmol l(-1) antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene decreased mortality by a factor of 25-200. uv radiation alone caused 25-85% mortality in comparison with the whole ntp. exogenously added hydrogen peroxide h2o2 did not cause mortality. ntp treatment of myc. hominis triggered growth of microcolonies, which were several tenfold smaller than a typical colony. conclusions: despite the lack of cell wall, a. laidlawii and myc. hominis were more resistant to argon microwave ntp than other tested bacteria. mycoplasma hominis formed microcolonies upon ntp treatment. a role of uv and active species was demonstrated. significance and impact of the study: the first study of ntp effects on mollicutes revealed importance of a membrane composition for bacterial resistance to ntp. new specific myc. hominis morphological forms were observed. the study confirmed importance of the concerted action of reactive oxygen species (ros) with uv and other plasma bioactive agents for ntp bactericidal action.

TI  == anionic lipid binding to the foreign protein mgs provides a tight coupling between phospholipid synthesis and protein overexpression in escherichia coli.
AB  == certain membrane proteins involved in lipid synthesis can induce formation of new intracellular membranes in escherichia coli, i.e., intracellular vesicles. among  those, the foreign monotopic glycosyltransferase mgs from acholeplasma laidlawii  triggers such massive lipid synthesis when overexpressed. to examine the mechanism behind the increased lipid synthesis, we investigated the lipid binding properties of mgs in vivo together with the correlation between lipid synthesis and mgs overexpression levels. a good correlation between produced lipid quantities and overexpressed mgs protein was observed when standard lb medium was supplemented with four different lipid precursors that have significant roles in  the lipid biosynthesis pathway. interestingly, this correlation was highest concerning anionic lipid production and at the same time dependent on the selective binding of anionic lipid molecules by mgs. a selective interaction with anionic lipids was also observed in vitro by (31)p nmr binding studies using bicelles prepared with e. coli lipids. the results clearly demonstrate that the discriminative withdrawal of anionic lipids, especially phosphatidylglycerol, from the membrane through mgs binding triggers an in vivo signal for cells to create a "feed-forward" stimulation of lipid synthesis in e. coli. by this mechanism, cells can produce more membrane surface in order to accommodate excessively produced mgs molecules, which results in an interdependent cycle of lipid and mgs protein synthesis.

TI  == characterization of a laminaribiose phosphorylase from acholeplasma laidlawii pg-8a and production of 1,3-beta-d-glucosyl disaccharides.
AB  == we identified a glycoside hydrolase family 94 homolog (acl0729) from acholeplasma laidlawii pg-8a as a laminaribiose (1,3-beta-d-glucobiose) phosphorylase (ec 2.4.1.31). the recombinant acl0729 produced in escherichia coli catalyzed phosphorolysis of laminaribiose with inversion of the anomeric configuration in a typical sequential bi bi mechanism releasing alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate and d-glucose. laminaritriose (1,3-beta-d-glucotriose) was not an efficient substrate for acl0729. the phosphorolysis is reversible, enabling synthesis of 1,3-beta-d-glucosyl disaccharides by reverse phosphorolysis with strict regioselectivity from alpha-d-glucose 1-phosphate as the donor and suitable monosaccharide acceptors (d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-arabino-hexopyranose, d-xylose, d-glucuronic acid, 1,5-anhydro-d-glucitol, and d-mannose) with c-3 and c-4 equatorial hydroxyl groups. the d-glucose and 2-deoxy-d-arabino-hexopyranose caused significantly strong competitive substrate inhibition compared with other  glucobiose phosphorylases reported, in which the acceptor competitively inhibited the binding of the donor substrate. by contrast, none of the examined disaccharides served as acceptor in the synthetic reaction.

TI  == purification and functional analysis of recombinant acholeplasma laidlawii histone-like hu protein.
AB  == hu is a most abundant dna-binding protein in bacteria. this protein is conserved  either in its heterodimeric form or in one of its homodimeric forms in all bacteria, in plant chloroplasts, and in some viruses. hu protein non-specifically binds and bends dna as a hetero- or homodimer and can participate in dna supercoiling and dna condensation. it also takes part in some dna functions such  as replication, recombination, and repair. hu does not recognize any specific sequences but shows some specificity to cruciform dna and to repair intermediates, e.g., nick, gap, bulge, 3'-overhang, etc. to understand the features of hu binding to dna and repair intermediates, a fast and easy hu proteins purification procedure is required. here we report overproduction and purification of the hu homodimers. the method of hu purification allows obtaining a pure recombinant non-tagged protein cloned in escherichia coli. we applied this method for purification of acholeplasma laidlawii hu and demonstrated that this protein possesses a dna-binding activity and is free of contaminating nuclease activity. besides that we have shown that expression of a. laidlawii ihf_hu gene  in a slow-growing hupab e. coli strain restores the wild-type growth indicating that aclhu can perform the basic functions of e. coli hu in vivo.

TI  == [oligomeric forms, functions and cellular localization of alpha-crystallin type protein from acholeplasma laidlawii].
AB  == alpha-crystallin type heat shock protein (alpha-hsp) ibpa from acholeplasma laidlawii was expressed in escherichia coil and isolated from cell extract on ni-sepharose column. recombinant ibpa, like other alpha-hsps, spontaneously formed oligomeres in vitro. high resolution electron microscopy revealed regular  structures with 15 nm in diameter. evaluation of molecular mass of ibpa oligomers was performed by gel filtration. most of oligomers consist of 24 subunits. recombinant ibpa prevents heat denaturation of soluble proteins in cell extract of e. coli and displays a mild positive effect on thermotolerance of e. coli cells during severe heat shock. we investigated a localization of ibpa in a. laidlawii cell by immunocytochemistry. we suppose that ibpa may protect various intracellular structures from damage during heat shock.

TI  == sensitive and selective detection of mycoplasma in cell culture samples using cantilever sensors.
AB  == in this article we report a new biosensor-based method that is more sensitive and rapid than the current approach for detecting mycoplasma in cell culture samples. piezoelectric-excited millimeter-sized cantilever (pemc) sensors respond to mass  change via resonant frequency change. they are sensitive at femtogram level and can be used directly in liquid for label-free detection. common cell culture contaminant, acholeplasma laidlawii was detected in both buffer and cell culture  medium. two different sources (positive control from a commercial kit and atcc 23206) were analyzed using antibody-immobilized pemc sensor. resonant frequency decrease caused by binding of a. laidlawii was monitored in real-time using an impedance analyzer. positive detection was confirmed by a second antibody binding. the limit of detection (lod) was lower than 10(3) cfu/ml in cell culture medium using pemc sensor while parallel elisa assays showed lod as 10(7) cfu/ml.  this study shows that pemc sensor can be used for sensitive and rapid mycoplasma  detection in cell culture samples.

TI  == high-yield expression and purification of a monotopic membrane glycosyltransferase.
AB  == membrane proteins are essential to many cellular processes. however, the systematic study of membrane protein structure has been hindered by the difficulty in obtaining large quantities of these proteins. protein overexpression using escherichia coli is commonly used to produce large quantities of protein, but usually yields very little membrane protein. furthermore, optimization of the expressing conditions, as well as the choice of  detergent and other buffer components, is thought to be crucial for increasing the yield of stable and homogeneous protein. herein we report high-yield expression and purification of a membrane-associated monotopic protein, the glycosyltransferase monoglucosyldiacylglycerol synthase (almgs), in e. coli. systematic optimization of protein expression was achieved through controlling a  few basic expression parameters, including temperature and growth media, and the  purifications were monitored using a fast and efficient size-exclusion chromatography (sec) screening method. the latter method was shown to be a powerful tool for fast screening and for finding the optimal protein-stabilizing  conditions. for almgs it was found that the concentration of detergent was just as important as the type of detergent, and a low concentration of n-dodecyl-beta-d-maltoside (ddm) (approximately 1x critical micelle concentration) was the best for keeping the protein stable and homogeneous. by using these simply methods to optimize the conditions for almgs expression and purification, the final expression level increase by two orders of magnitude, reaching 170 mg of pure protein per litre culture.

TI  == lipid-engineered escherichia coli membranes reveal critical lipid headgroup size  for protein function.
AB  == escherichia coli membranes have a substantial bilayer curvature stress due to a large fraction of the nonbilayer-prone lipid phosphatidylethanolamine, and a mutant (ad93) lacking this lipid is severely crippled in several membrane-associated processes. introduction of four lipid glycosyltransferases from acholeplasma laidlawii and arabidopsis thaliana, synthesizing large amounts  of two nonbilayer-prone, and two bilayer-forming gluco- and galacto-lipids, (i) restored the curvature stress with the two nonbilayer lipids, and (ii) diluted the high negative lipid surface charge in all ad93 bilayers. surprisingly, the bilayer-forming diglucosyl-diacylglycerol was almost as good in improving ad93 membrane processes as the two nonbilayer-prone glucosyl-diacylglycerol and galactosyl-diacylglycerol lipids, strongly suggesting that lipid surface charge dilution by these neutral lipids is very important for e. coli. increased acyl chain length and unsaturation, plus cardiolipin (nonbilayer-prone) content, were  probably also beneficial in the modified strains. however, despite a correct transmembrane topology for the transporter lacy in the diglucosyl-diacylglycerol  clone, active transport failed in the absence of a nonbilayer-prone glycolipid. the corresponding digalactosyl-diacylglycerol bilayer lipid did not restore ad93  membrane processes, despite analogous acyl chain and cardiolipin contents. chain  ordering, probed by bis-pyrene lipids, was substantially lower in the digalactosyl-diacylglycerol strain lipids due to its extended headgroup. hence, a low surface charge density of anionic lipids is important in e. coli membranes, but is inefficient if the headgroup of the diluting lipid is too large. this strongly indicates that a certain magnitude of the curvature stress is crucial for the bilayer in vivo.

TI  == high cationic charge and bilayer interface-binding helices in a regulatory lipid  glycosyltransferase.
AB  == in the prokaryote acholeplasma laidlawii, membrane bilayer properties are sensed  and regulated by two interface glycosyltransferases (gts), synthesizing major nonbilayer- (almgs gt) and bilayer-prone glucolipids. these enzymes are of similar structure, as many soluble gts, but are sensitive to lipid charge and curvature stress properties. multivariate and bioinformatic sequence analyses show that such interface enzymes, in relation to soluble ones of similar fold, are characterized by high cationic charge, certain distances between small and cationic amino acids, and by amphipathic helices. varying surface contents of lys/arg pairs and trp indicate different membrane-binding subclasses. a predicted potential (cationic) binding helix from almgs was structurally verified by solution nmr and cd. the helix conformation was induced by a zwitterionic as well as anionic lipid environment, and the peptide was confined to the bilayer interface. bilayer affinity of the peptide, analyzed by surface plasmon resonance, was higher than that for soluble membrane-seeking proteins/peptides and rose with anionic lipid content. interface intercalation was supported by phase equilibria in membrane lipid mixtures, analyzed by 31p nmr and dsc. an analogous, potentially binding helix has a similar location in the structurally determined escherichia coli cell wall precursor gt murg. these two helices have little sequence conservation in almgs and murg homologues but maintain their amphipathic character. the evolutionary modification of the almgs binding helix and its location close to the acceptor substrate site imply a functional importance in enzyme catalysis, potentially providing a mechanism by which glycolipid synthesis will be sensitive to membrane surface charge and intrinsic curvature strain.

TI  == phosphatidylethanolamine and monoglucosyldiacylglycerol are interchangeable in supporting topogenesis and function of the polytopic membrane protein lactose permease.
AB  == to determine the specific role lipids play in membrane protein topogenesis in vivo, the orientation with respect to the membrane bilayer of escherichia coli lactose permease (lacy) transmembrane (tm) domains and their flanking extramembrane domains was compared after assembly in native membranes and membranes with genetically modified lipid content using the substituted cysteine  accessibility method for determining tm domain mapping. lacy assembled in the absence of the major membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) does not carry  out uphill transport of substrate and displays an inverted orientation for the n-terminal six-tm domain helical bundle (bogdanov, m., heacock, p. n., and dowhan, w. (2002) embo j. 21, 2107-2116). strikingly, the replacement of pe in vivo by the foreign lipid monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (mglcdag), synthesized by the acholeplasma laidlawii mglcdag synthase, restored uphill transport and supported the wild type tm topology of the n-terminal helical bundle of lacy. an  interchangeable role in defining membrane protein tm domain orientation and supporting function is played by the two most abundant lipids, pe and mglcdag, in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. therefore, these structurally diverse lipids endow the membrane with similar properties necessary  for the proper organization of protein domains in lacy that are highly sensitive  to lipids as topological determinants.

TI  == monoglucosyldiacylglycerol, a foreign lipid, can substitute for phosphatidylethanolamine in essential membrane-associated functions in escherichia coli.
AB  == the mechanisms by which lipid bilayer properties govern or influence membrane protein functions are little understood, but a liquid-crystalline state and the presence of anionic and nonbilayer (nb)-prone lipids seem important. an escherichia coli mutant lacking the major membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (nb-prone) requires divalent cations for viability and cell integrity and is impaired in several membrane functions that are corrected by introduction of the  "foreign" nb-prone neutral glycolipid alpha-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (mglcdag)  synthesized by the mglcdag synthase from acholeplasma laidlawii. dependence on mg(2+) was reduced, and cellular yields and division malfunction were greatly improved. the increased passive membrane permeability of the mutant was not abolished, but protein-mediated osmotic stress adaptation to salts and sucrose was recovered by the presence of mglcdag. mglcdag also restored tryptophan prototrophy and active transport function of lactose permease, both critically dependent on phosphatidylethanolamine. three mechanisms can explain the observed  effects: nb-prone mglcdag improves the quenched lateral pressure profile across the bilayer; neutral mglcdag dilutes the high anionic lipid surface charge; mglcdag provides a neutral lipid that can hydrogen bond and/or partially ionize.  the reduced dependence on mg(2+) and lack of correction by high monovalent salts  strongly support the essential nature of the nb properties of mglcdag.

TI  == irreversible binding and activity control of the 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase from acholeplasma laidlawii at an anionic lipid bilayer surface.
AB  == 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase is associated with the membrane surface  catalyzing the synthesis of the major nonbilayer-prone lipid alpha-monoglucosyl diacylglycerol (mglcdag) from 1,2-dag in the cell wall-less acholeplasma laidlawii. phosphatidylglycerol (pg), but not neutral or zwitterionic lipids, seems to be essential for an active conformation and function of the enzyme. surface plasmon resonance analysis was employed to study association of the enzyme with lipid bilayers. binding kinetics could be well fitted only to a two-state model, implying also a (second) conformational step. the enzyme bound less efficiently to liposomes containing only zwitterionic lipids, whereas increasing molar fractions of the anionic pg or cardiolipin (cl) strongly promoted binding by improved association (k(a1)), and especially a decreased rate of return (k(d2)) from the second state. this yielded a very low overall dissociation constant (k(d)), corresponding to an essentially irreversible membrane association. both liposome binding and consecutive activity of the enzyme correlated with the pg concentration. the importance of the electrostatic  interactions with anionic lipids was shown by quenching of both binding and activity with increasing nacl concentrations, and corroborated in vivo for an active enzyme-green fluorescent protein hybrid in escherichia coli. nonbilayer-prone lipids substantially enhanced enzyme-liposome binding by promoting a changed conformation (decreasing k(d2)), similar to the anionic lipids, indicating the importance of hydrophobic interactions and a curvature packing stress. for cl and the nonbilayer lipids, effects on enzyme binding and consecutive activity were not correlated, suggesting a separate lipid control of  activity. similar features were recorded with polylysine (cationic) and polyglutamate (anionic) peptides present, but here probably dependent on the selective charge interactions with the enzyme n- and c-domains, respectively. a lipid-dependent conformational change and pg association of the enzyme were verified by circular dichroism, intrinsic tryptophan, and pyrene-probe fluorescence analyses, respectively. it is concluded that an electrostatic association of the enzyme with the membrane surface is accompanied by hydrophobic interactions and a conformational change. however, specific lipids, the curvature packing stress, and proteins or small molecules bound to the enzyme can modulate  the activity of the bound a. laidlawii mglcdag synthase.

TI  == structural features of glycosyltransferases synthesizing major bilayer and nonbilayer-prone membrane lipids in acholeplasma laidlawii and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == in membranes of acholeplasma laidlawii two consecutively acting glucosyltransferases, the (i) alpha-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (mglcdag) synthase (almgs) (ec ) and the (ii) alpha-diglucosyl-dag (dglcdag) synthase (aldgs) (ec ), are involved in maintaining (i) a certain anionic lipid surface charge density and (ii) constant nonbilayer/bilayer conditions (curvature packing stress), respectively. cloning of the aldgs gene revealed related uncharacterized sequence analogs especially in several gram-positive pathogens, thermophiles and archaea,  where the encoded enzyme function of a potential streptococcus pneumoniae dgs gene (cpoa) was verified. a strong stimulation of aldgs by phosphatidylglycerol (pg), cardiolipin, or nonbilayer-prone 1,3-dag was observed, while only pg stimulated cpoa. several secondary structure prediction and fold recognition methods were used together with swiss-model to build three-dimensional model structures for three mgs and two dgs lipid glycosyltransferases. two escherichia  coli proteins with known structures were identified as the best templates, the membrane surface-associated two-domain glycosyltransferase murg and the soluble glcnac epimerase. differences in electrostatic surface potential between the different models and their individual domains suggest that electrostatic interactions play a role for the association to membranes. further support for this was obtained when hybrids of the n- and c-domain, and full size almgs with green fluorescent protein were localized to different regions of the e. coli inner membrane and cytoplasm in vivo. in conclusion, it is proposed that the varying abilities to bind, and sense lipid charge and curvature stress, are governed by typical differences in charge (pi values), amphiphilicity, and hydrophobicity for the n- and (catalytic) c-domains of these structurally similar membrane-associated enzymes.

TI  == regulation of lipid composition in acholeplasma laidlawii and escherichia coli membranes: nmr studies of lipid lateral diffusion at different growth temperatures.
AB  == lipid lateral diffusion coefficients have been directly determined by pulsed field gradient nmr spectroscopy on macroscopically aligned, fully hydrated lamellar phases containing dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and total lipid extracts from acholeplasma laidlawii and escherichia coli. the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient was of the arrhenius type in the temperature interval studied. the sharp increase in the diffusion coefficient at  the growth temperature of e. coli obtained by frap measurements, using a fluorescent probe molecule (jin, a. j., edidin, m., nossal, r., and gershfeld, n. l. (1999) biochemistry 38, 13275-13278), was not observed. thus, we conclude that the lipid structural properties (i.e., those affecting the lipid phase behavior), rather than the lipid dynamics, are involved in the adjustment of the membrane lipid composition. further support for this conclusion is given by the finding that lipid extracts from a. laidlawii grown at different temperatures have about  the same diffusion coefficients. finally, the lipid lateral diffusion in bilayers of phospholipids was found to be much faster than that in bilayers of mainly glucolipids, which can be understood in terms of a free volume theory for the diffusion process.

TI  == another cut for lysine trna: application of the hyperprocessing reaction reveals  another stabilization strategy in metazoan lysine trnas.
AB  == recently, we revealed that the cloverleaf structure of some eukaryotic trnas is not always stable in vitro, and the denatured structures of these trnas are sometimes detected in bacterial rnase p reactions. we have designated the unusual internal cleavage reaction of these trnas as hyperprocessing. we have developed this hyperprocessing strategy as a useful tool for examining the stability of the trna cloverleaf structure. there are some common features in such unstable, hyperprocessible trnas, and the criteria for the hyperprocessing reaction of trna are extracted. metazoan initiator methionine trnas and lysine trnas commonly fit  the criteria, and are predicted to be hyperprocessible. the rnase p reactions of  two metazoan lysine trnas from homo sapiens and caenorhabditis elegans, which fit the criteria, resulted in resistance to the internal cleavage reaction, while one bacterial lysine trna from acholeplasma laidlawii, which also fits the criteria,  was internally cleaved by the rnase p. the results showed that the metazoan lysine trnas examined are very stable without base modifications even under in vitro conditions. we also examined the 3'-half short construct of the human lysine trna, and the results showed that this rna was internally cleaved by the enzyme. the results indicated that the human lysine trna has the ability to be hyperprocessed but is structurally stabilized in spite of lacking base modifications. a comparative study suggested, moreover, that the acceptor-stem bases should take part in the stabilization of metazoan lysine trnas. our data strongly suggest that the cloverleaf shape of other metazoan lysine trnas should  also be stabilized by means of similar strategies to in the case of human trna(lys3).

TI  == novel deoxynucleoside-phosphorylating enzymes in mycoplasmas: evidence for efficient utilization of deoxynucleosides.
AB  == mycoplasmas are unable to synthesize purine and pyrimidine bases de novo. therefore, salvage of existing nucleosides and bases is essential for their survival. four mycoplasma species were studied with regard to their ability to phosphorylate deoxynucleosides. high levels of thymidine kinase (tk), deoxycytidine kinase (dck), deoxyguanosine kinase (dgk) and deoxyadenosine kinase (dak) activities were detected in extracts from mycoplasma pneumoniae, mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides sc (m. mymysc), acholeplasma laidlawii (a. laidlawii) and mycoplasma arginini (m. arginini). nucleoside phosphotransferase activities were found at high levels in a. laidlawii and low levels in m. arginini. pyrophosphate-dependent deoxynucleoside kinase activities were detected mainly in a. laidlawii and m. mymysc extracts. two open reading frames were identified in the m. mymysc genome; one showed 25% sequence identity to human dgk and the other one had about 26% sequence identity to human tk1. the m. mymysc dgk-like enzyme was cloned, expressed in escherichia coli and affinity-purified. this enzyme phosphorylated dado, dguo and dcyd, and the highest catalytic rate was with dado  as substrate. therefore, we suggest that this enzyme should be named deoxyadenosine kinase. the physiological role of mycoplasma dak and tk may be to  support the unusually large datp and dttp pools required for replication of mycoplasma genomes.

TI  == sequence properties of the 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-glucosyltransferase from acholeplasma laidlawii membranes. recognition of a large group of lipid glycosyltransferases in eubacteria and archaea.
AB  == synthesis of the nonbilayer-prone alpha-monoglucosyldiacylglycerol (mglcdag) is crucial for bilayer packing properties and the lipid surface charge density in the membrane of acholeplasma laidlawii. the gene for the responsible, membrane-bound glucosyltransferase (almgs) (ec ) was sequenced and functionally cloned in escherichia coli, yielding mglcdag in the recombinants. similar amino acid sequences were encoded in the genomes of several gram-positive bacteria (especially pathogens), thermophiles, archaea, and a few eukaryotes. all of these contained the typical ex(7)e catalytic motif of the cazy family 4 of alpha-glycosyltransferases. the synthesis of mglcdag by a close sequence analog from streptococcus pneumoniae (spmgs) was verified by polymerase chain reaction cloning, corroborating a connection between sequence and functional similarity for these proteins. however, almgs and spmgs varied in dependence on anionic phospholipid activators phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin, suggesting certain  regulatory differences. fold predictions strongly indicated a similarity for almgs (and spmgs) with the two-domain structure of the e. coli murg cell envelope glycosyltransferase and several amphipathic membrane-binding segments in various  proteins. on the basis of this structure, the almgs sequence charge distribution, and anionic phospholipid dependence, a model for the bilayer surface binding and  activity is proposed for this regulatory enzyme.

TI  == x-ray studies on the interaction of the antimicrobial peptide gramicidin s with microbial lipid extracts: evidence for cubic phase formation.
AB  == we have investigated the effect of the interaction of the antimicrobial peptide gramicidin s (gs) on the thermotropic phase behavior of model lipid bilayer membranes generated from the total membrane lipids of acholeplasma laidlawii b and escherichia coli. the a. laidlawii b membrane lipids consist primarily of neutral glycolipids and anionic phospholipids, while the e. coli inner membrane lipids consist exclusively of zwitterionic and anionic phospholipids. we show that the addition of gs at a lipid-to-peptide molar ratio of 25 strongly promotes the formation of bicontinuous inverted cubic phases in both of these lipid model  membranes, predominantly of space group pn3m. in addition, the presence of gs causes a thinning of the liquid-crystalline bilayer and a reduction in the lattice spacing of the inverted cubic phase which can form in the gs-free membrane lipid extracts at sufficiently high temperatures. this latter finding implies that gs potentiates the formation of an inverted cubic phase by increasing the negative curvature stress in the host lipid bilayer. this effect may be an important aspect of the permeabilization and eventual disruption of the lipid bilayer phase of biological membranes, which appears to be the mechanism by which gs kills bacterial cells and lysis erythrocytes.

TI  == characterization of acholeplasma laidlawii ftsz gene and its gene product.
AB  == the ftsz gene was found among representatives of all bacterial groups. ftsz protein is an essential component of cell division ring. contraction of this cytoskeleton-like ring is believed to be the universal way of bacterial division. acholeplasma laidlawii possesses all features of the minimal mycoplasma cell and  some traits of cell-wall bacteria and seems to be a promising object for study of basic principles of the bacterial division process. we cloned an a. laidlawii chromosomal fragment containing ftsz gene and two flanking orf which also were identified. a. laidlawii ftsz protein has been determined with polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbit. it was demonstrated that ftsz gene of a. laidlawii could be expressed in e. coli cells. we also revealed that a. laidlawii ftsz had  a low similarity to proteins of mycoplasma genitalium and m. pneumoniae. the comparison of ftsz structures may be used for investigation of bacterial phylogenetic relations.

TI  == molecular analysis of the cytolytic protein clya (shea) from escherichia coli.
AB  == escherichia coli k-12 carries a gene for a protein denoted clya or shea that can  mediate a cytolytic phenotype. the clya protein is not expressed at detectable levels in most strains of e. coli, but overproduction suitable for purification was accomplished by cloning the structural gene in an hns mutant strain. highly purified clya protein was cytotoxic to macrophage cells in culture and caused detachment and lysis of the mammalian cells. results from osmotic protection assays were consistent with the suggestion that the protein formed pores with a diameter of up to 3 nm. using acholeplasma laidlawii cells and multilamellar liposomes, we studied the effect of clya on membranes with varying compositions and in the presence of different ions. clya induced cytolytic release of the fluorescent tracer from carboxyfluorescein-loaded liposomes, and the release was  stimulated if cholesterol was present in the membranes whereas addition of calcium had no effect. pretreatment of the clya protein with cholesterol inhibited the pore formation, suggesting that clya could bind to cholesterol. efficient coprecipitation of clya with either cholesterol or 1,2,3-trioctadecanoylglycerol in aqueous solutions showed that clya directly interacted with the hydrophobic molecular aggregates. we tested the possible functional importance of selected clya protein regions by site-directed mutagenesis. defined mutants of clya were obtained with alterations in postulated transmembrane structures in the central part and in a postulated membrane-targeting domain in the c-terminal part. our results were consistent with the suggestion that particular amphiphilic segments are required for clya activity. we propose that these domains are necessary for clya to form pores.

AB  == gene ftsz responsible for division of bacterial cells was revealed in most prokaryote groups. a 520-bp fragment of the ftsz gene was amplified on the template of a. laidlawii dna using degenerate primers. this fragment was sequenced and served as a hybridization probe for cloning of the full-sized copy  of the a. laidlawii ftsz gene. the amplified fragment was cloned in a pgex3x vector and expressed in e. coli cells. polyclonal antibodies derived from the chimeric polypeptide containing a fragment of a. laidlawii ftsz protein interacted only with the a. laidlawii protein with molecular mass of 40 kda. comparison of nucleotide sequences of the ftsz-gene region of a. laidlawii and other bacterial species showed that they were highly homologous in a. laidlawii,  e. coli, and bac. subtilis, while low homology was revealed between the a. laidlawii sequence and those of the members of the genus mycoplasma. analysis of  the ftsz-gene nucleotide sequences is suggested as a means to study the evolutionary relatedness of prokaryotes.

TI  == nonlamellar phases induced by the interaction of gramicidin s with lipid bilayers. a possible relationship to membrane-disrupting activity.
AB  == the interactions of the cyclic peptide gramicidin s (gs) with a variety of single-component lipid bilayers, and with membrane polar lipid extracts of acholeplasma laidlawii b and escherichia coli, were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (dsc), 31p-nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. the dsc data indicate that the effects of gs on the thermotropic phase behavior of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine dispersions are compatible with those expected of peptides interacting primarily  with the polar headgroup and/or the polar/apolar interfaces of lipid bilayers. these dsc studies also suggest that gs exhibits stronger interactions with the more fluid bilayers. for mixtures of gs with lipids such as phosphatidylcholine,  phosphatidylserine, cardiolipin, and sphingomyelin, axially symmetric 31p-nmr powder patterns are observed throughout the entire temperature range examined (0-90 degrees c), and there is little evidence for significant destabilization of the lipid bilayer with respect to nonlamellar phases. with mixtures of gs with either phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, or a nonlamellar phase-forming phosphatidylcholine, axially symmetric 31p-nmr powder patterns are  also observed at low temperatures. however, at high temperatures, an isotropic component is observed in their 31p-nmr spectra, and the relative intensity of this component increases significantly with temperature and with gs concentration. once formed at high temperatures, this isotropic component exhibits a marked cooling hysteresis and in most cases disappears only when the sample is recooled to temperatures well below the lipid hydrocarbon chain-melting phase transition temperature. we also show that gs induces the formation of isotropic components in the 31p-nmr spectra of heterogeneous lipid mixtures such  as occur in a. laidlawii b and e. coli membranes. these observations suggest that gs induces the formation of cubic or other three dimensionally ordered inverted nonlamellar phases when it interacts with some types of lipid bilayers, a suggestion strongly supported by our x-ray diffraction studies. our results also  suggest that the capacity of gs to induce the formation of such phases increases  with the intrinsic nonlamellar phase-preferring tendencies of the lipids with which it interacts probably by producing localized increases in membrane monolayer curvature stress. the latter effect could be part of the mechanism through which this peptide exhibits its antimicrobial and hemolytic activities.

TI  == sequence and organization of genes encoding enzymes involved in pyruvate metabolism in mycoplasma capricolum.
AB  == the region of the genome of mycoplasma capricolum upstream of the portion encompassing the genes for enzymes i and iiaglc of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar  phosphotransferase system (pts) was cloned and sequenced. examination of the sequence revealed open reading frames corresponding to numerous genes involved with the oxidation of pyruvate. the deduced gene organization is naox (encoding nadh oxidase)-lpla (encoding lipoate-protein ligase)-odpa (encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase ei alpha)-odpb (encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase ei beta)-odp2(encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase eii)-dldh (encoding dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase)-pta (encoding phosphotransacetylase)-ack (encoding acetate kinase)-orfa (an unknown open reading frame)-kdtb-ptsi-crr. analysis of the dna sequence suggests that the naox and lpla genes are part of a single operon, odpa  and odpb constitute an additional operon, odp2 and dldh a third operon, and pta and ack an additional transcription unit. phylogenetic analyses of the protein products of the odpa and odpb genes indicate that they are most similar to the corresponding proteins from mycoplasma genitalium, acholeplasma laidlawii, and gram-positive organisms. the product of the odp2 gene contains a single lipoyl domain, as is the case with the corresponding proteins from m. genitalium and numerous other organisms. an evolutionary tree places the m. capricolum odp2 gene product in close relationship to the corresponding proteins from a. laidlawii and m.genitalium. the dldh gene encodes an unusual form of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase that contains an aminoterminal extension corresponding to a lipoyl  domain, a property shared by the corresponding proteins from alcaligenes eutrophus and clostridium magnum. aside from that feature, the protein is related phylogenetically to the corresponding proteins from a. laidlawii and m. genitalium. the phosphotransacetylase from m. capricolum is related most closely  to the corresponding protein from m. genitalium and is distinguished easily from  the enzymes from escherichia coli and haemophilus influenzae by the absence of the characteristic amino-terminal extension. the acetate kinase from m. capricolum is related evolutionarily to the homologous enzyme from m. genitalium. map position comparisons of genes encoding proteins involved with pyruvate metabolism show that, whereas all the genes are clustered in m. capricolum, they  are scattered in m. genitalium.

TI  == characterization of the ftsz gene from mycoplasma pulmonis, an organism lacking a cell wall.
AB  == the ftsz gene is required for cell division in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis. in these organisms, ftsz is located in a ring at the leading edge of the septum. this ring is thought to be responsible for invagination of the septum, either causing invagination of the cytoplasmic membrane or activating septum-specific peptidoglycan biosynthesis. in this paper, we report that the cell division gene ftsz is present in two mycoplasma species, mycoplasma pulmonis and acholeplasma laidlawii, which are eubacterial organisms lacking a cell wall.  sequencing of the ftsz homolog from m. pulmonis revealed that it was highly homologous to other known ftsz proteins. the m. pulmonis ftsz gene was overexpressed, and the purified m. pulmonis ftsz bound gtp. using antisera raised against this purified protein, we could demonstrate that it was expressed in m. pulmonis. expression of the m. pulmonis ftsz gene in e. coli inhibited cell division, leading to filamentation, which could be suppressed by increasing expression of the e. coli ftsz gene. the implications of these results for the role of ftsz in cell division are discussed.

TI  == expression of foreign genes and selection of promoter sequences in acholeplasma laidlawii.
AB  == the stable maintenance and expression of foreign genes in mollicutes (mycoplasmas) have been difficult to achieve due to the lack of suitable vectors. in this paper we show for the first time that a replicating vector can been used  to express foreign genes other than antibiotic resistance genes in acholeplasma laidlawii. plasmids derived from the lactococcal vector pnz18 could introduce and maintain four different genes for many generations in a. laidlawii. one of these, encoding the dominant membrane lipoprotein spiralin from the mollicute spiroplasma citri, was expressed; however, expression was weak, the signal peptide of spiralin was not cleaved and the protein was not covalently modified by fatty acids. this resulted in a hydrophilic character of spiralin and its cytoplasmic localization in a. laidlawii. to increase the expression of foreign genes, random a. laidlawii dna fragments were cloned into a pnz18-related plasmid and expression signals were selected using the bacillus licheniformis alpha-amylase gene as a probe. selection was done in escherichia coli as well as  directly in a. laidlawii. active recombinants from e. coli were also able to express alpha-amylase activities and an enzyme of native size in a. laidlawii. the highest activity was obtained from a recombinant selected directly in a. laidlawii. this is the first example of a promoter sequence selected in a mollicute. analysis of the putative promoters in seven clones revealed similar -10 and -35 regions, and similar spacer distances in a. laidlawii, acholeplasma oculi, lactococcus and e. coli. vectors related to pnz18 should be useful for the genetic analysis of specific a. laidlawii proteins and functions.

TI  == identification and analysis of the genes coding for the putative pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex in acholeplasma laidlawii.
AB  == a monospecific antibody recognizing two membrane proteins in acholeplasma laidlawii identified a plasmid clone from a genomic library. the nucleotide sequence of the 4.6-kbp insert contained four sequential genes coding for proteins of 39 kda (e1 alpha, n terminus not cloned), 36 kda (e1 beta), 57 kda (e2), and 36 kda (e3; c terminus not cloned). the n termini of the cloned e2, e1  beta, and native a. laidlawii e2 proteins were verified by amino acid sequencing. computer-aided searches showed that the translated dna sequences were homologous  to the four subenzymes of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes from gram-positive bacteria and humans. the plasmid-encoded 57-kda (e2) protein was recognized by antibodies against the e2 subenzymes of the pyruvate and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes from bacillus subtilis. a substantial fraction of the e2  protein as well as part of the pyruvate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity was associated with the cytoplasmic membrane in a. laidlawii. in vivo complementation with three different escherichia coli pyruvate dehydrogenase-defective mutants showed that the four plasmid-encoded proteins were able to restore pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme activity in e. coli. since a. laidlawii lacks oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and most likely branched-chain dehydrogenase enzyme complex activities, these results strongly suggest that the sequenced genes code for the  pyruvate dehydrogenase complex.

AB  == mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, the principal aetiological agent of porcine enzootic pneumonia, synthesizes a 36 kda protein (p36) which is an early and strong immunogenic factor in experimentally and naturally infected swine. polyclonal antibodies were made against the recombinant p36 protein in rabbits and used for  the identification of m. hyopneumoniae by the immunoblot technique. the proteins  from the m. hyopneumoniae reference strains and from 13 m. hyopneumoniae field strains isolated from naturally infected pigs in switzerland, hungary, france and canada were analysed by the immunoblot technique using anti-p36 antibodies. all 13 field strains and the three reference j strains of m. hyopneumoniae, received  from different collections and laboratories, exhibited a strong reaction with a protein of 36 kda indicating that the p36 protein is a common m. hyopneumoniae antigen. none of the different porcine mycoplasma species including m. flocculare, m. hyorhinis, m. hyosynoviae, a. axanthum, a. laidlawii and a. granularum showed any reaction on the immunoblot with the anti-p36 antibodies. in addition, we have found no reaction with anti-p36 antibodies using 47 different mycoplasma or acholeplasma species isolated from human, mice, rat, poultry, ruminant, dog and cat. in conclusion we have shown that p36 is a protein that is  a common antigen of m. hyopneumoniae strains and is not found in other mycoplasma or acholeplasma species tested. because of its high specificity, p36 protein, or  antibodies made against this protein can be used for the identification of m. hyopneumoniae strains.

AB  == the serial endosymbiotic theory (set) for the spirochete origin of undulipodia (cilia and eukaryotic flagella) predicts that a greater number of axonemal proteins will show homology to spirochete than to other bacterial proteins. to continue testing, the set proteins associated with eukaryotic motility (tektin, centrin and calmodulin) were sought in spirochaeta halophila. western blot immunological detection techniques (for tektin and centrin) and two-dimensional gel analysis (for calmodulin) were used. tektins are filamentous proteins extending the length of the axoneme in sperm tails and other undulipodia. whole cell extracts of s. halophila were probed with antibodies made against three sea  urchin (lytechinus pictus) sperm axonemal tektins (tektins a, b, and c). in the spirochetes, one tektin-like protein was detected as a band on western blots (a c tektin.) an antibody made against lytechinus pictus sperm tail axonemes, affinity-purified against the c tektin of another sea urchin, stronglyocentrotus  purpuratus, bound to a 30 kda protein from spirochaeta halophila. the c tektin epitope was not detected in escherichia coli. both the poly- and monoclonal anti-centrin antibodies cross-reacted with multiple proteins in the control alga  (tetraselmis striata) and in the putatively negative control bacterium e. coli. no cross reaction was seen between any anti-centrin antibody and s. halophila. neither did a two-dimensional gel analysis reveal the presence of calmodulin in these spirochetes or in the two other prokaryotes tested (spiroplasma citri, acholeplasma laidlawii). although neither centrin nor calmodulin were detected, a 30 kda tektin-like protein apparently is present in these spirochetes.

AB  == infection of cell cultures by mycoplasmas can be detected by hybridization of the dna of suspected cell cultures with recombinant plasmids containing fragments of  the mycoplasma dna. the test is very sensitive and allows detection of as little  as 1 ng of mycoplasmal dna, roughly equivalent to the dna amount of 10(6) mycoplasmas. this approach turns out to be effective for detection and identification of mycoplasmas in clinical material, plant and insect tissues. a set of dna probes for detection of mycoplasmas infecting cell cultures by dot hybridization has been constructed. this set consists of specific dna probes and  universal dna probe. recombinant plasmids, pal32, pma13, pmh9, containing specific dna fragments of acholeplasma-laidlawii, mycoplasma arginini, mycoplasma hominis (the prevalent mycoplasma contaminants of home cell cultures) are species-specific dna probes. recombinant plasmid pmg16 containing rrna genes of mycoplasma gallisepticum is the universal dna probe for detection of any mycoplasma (or any prokaryote) contaminations. these two classes of dna probes may be considered as complementing each other. these 32p labeled probes do not hybridize with eukaryotic dna. the set of dna probes allows not only to detect infection of cell cultures by mycoplasmas but also to identify the species of mycoplasmas and to evaluate the multiplicity of mycoplasma infection.

AB  == cell extracts of acholeplasma laidlawii b-pg9, acholeplasma morum s2, mycoplasma  capricolum 14, and mycoplasma gallisepticum s6 were examined for 37 cytoplasmic enzyme activities involved in the salvage and biosynthesis of purines. all of these organisms had adenine phosphoribosyltransferase activity (ec 2.4.2.7) and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase activity (ec 2.4.2.8). all of these organisms had purine-nucleoside phosphorylase activity (ec 2.4.2.1) in the synthetic direction using ribose-1-phosphate (r-1-p) or deoxyribose-1-phosphate (dr-1-p); this activity generated ribonucleosides or deoxyribonucleosides, respectively. the pyrimidine nucleobase uracil could also be ribosylated by using either r-1-p or dr-1-p as a donor. the synthesis of deoxyribonucleosides from nucleobases and dr-1-p has been reported from only one other procaryote, escherichia coli (l. a. mason and j. o. lampen, j. biol. chem. 193:539-547, 1951). the reverse of this phosphorylase reaction is more widely known, and we found such activity in all mollicutes studied. some acholeplasma species but not  the mycoplasma species can phosphorylate deoxyribonucleosides to deoxyribomononucleotides by a ppi-dependent deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity,  which was first reported in this group for the ribose analogs (v. v. tryon and j. d. pollack, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 35:497-501, 1985). this is the first report  of ppi-dependent purine deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity. an atp-dependent purine deoxyribonucleoside kinase activity is known only in salmon milt extracts  (h. l. a. tarr, can. j. biochem. 42:1535-1545, 1964). deoxyribomononucleotidase activity was also found in cytoplasmic extracts of these mollicutes. this is the  first report of deoxyribomononucleotidase activity.

AB  == the effect of rifampin on five mollicutes (spiroplasma citri, spiroplasma melliferum, spiroplasma apis, acholeplasma laidlawii, and mycoplasma mycoides) was compared with that on escherichia coli. we found that, in contrast to wild-type e. coli, mollicutes were insensitive to rifampin. dna-dependent rna polymerases from s. melliferum and s. apis were purified to the stage where the enzymes were dependent on the addition of exogenous templates for activity. the enzymes were then tested for their sensitivity to rifampin. spiroplasmal enzymes  were at least 1,000 times less sensitive to rifampin than the corresponding e. coli enzyme. this result provides a molecular basis for the resistance of mollicutes to rifampin. the rna polymerase of s. melliferum was further purified  and its subunit composition was investigated. the rna polymerase has one small and two large subunits. the structure of s. melliferum rna polymerase therefore resembles that of the eubacterial enzymes in spite of its insensitivity to rifampin.

TI  == selective acylation of membrane proteins in acholeplasma laidlawii.
AB  == in membranes of the cell-wall-less prokaryote acholeplasma laidlawii most proteins are of the integral type. a substantial fraction of these proteins are enriched in hydrophilic amino acid residues. approximately 20 different major as  well as minor proteins were found to be covalently modified with acyl chains. the same set of proteins are acylated when cells are grown in different fatty-acid-supplemented media. in individual proteins the ratio of palmitoyl/oleoyl acyl chains was 12-14 times larger than the acyl chain ratio in  polar membrane lipids. the transmembrane protein d12 has close to two acyl chains per molecule. proteins t2 and t4a, localized in the outer and inner leaflet of the membrane, respectively, occur each as pairs with a difference in relative molecular mass within each pair of approximately 2000. each of these proteins as  well as the other acyl proteins, except the light form of t4a, has close to one acyl chain per molecule. the extent of acylation was increased for certain proteins and decreased for others by treatment with globomycin or phenethylalcohol. the relative amounts of the t2 and t4a pairs were affected by these drugs. it is concluded that the mechanism of acylation is different from that in escherichia coli lipoprotein and bacillus penicillinase. the mean hydrophobicity [kyte & doolittle (1982) j. mol. biol. 157, 105-132] of the a. laidlawii acyl proteins are similar to those of other bacterial acyl proteins but significantly lower than for non-acylated integral membrane proteins, supporting  an anchoring function of the acyl chains. the number of membrane acyl proteins in a. laidlawii and two other mycoplasmas are at least twice that in other bacteria.

TI  == effects of mercury (ii) compounds on the activity of dutpases from various sources.
AB  == the deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolases (dutpases, ec 3.6.1.23) from escherichia coli k-12-,acholeplasma laidlawii b-pg9-, human kb cell-, and the herpes simplex virus (hsv) type 1- and 2-induced dutpases were purified and used  to determine the effect of various mercury (ii) compounds on their activities. mercuric acetate, 5-mercuri-dutp (hgdutp), and 5-mercuri-dctp (hgdctp) acted as irreversible active site-directed inhibitors of the dutpases purified from eukaryotic organisms but not those from prokaryotic organisms. the inhibition constants (ki) were estimated for the kb, hsv-1, and hsv-2 dutpases to be 8 +/- 2, 12 +/- 3, and 9 +/- 2 microm for mercuric acetate, 204 +/- 25, 121 +/- 15, and 111 +/- 10 microm for hgdutp, and 775 +/- 25 and 651 +/- 23 microm for hgdctp, respectively. the conversion of hgdutp to its mercurithio-derivative resulted in  a decrease in the affinity of the derivative for the eukaryotic dutpases. the 5-mercurithioethylene glycol derivative of dutp did not act as a substrate for the kb dutpase but it did act as a substrate for the hsv-1- and hsv-2-induced dutpases with ki values of 526 +/- 47 and 483 +/- 32 microm, respectively. these  results demonstrate that the eukaryotic dutpases can be distinguished based upon  differences in their affinities for the mercurithio-derivatives of dutp and suggest that there are differences in the steric binding properties of the nucleotide-binding site of these enzymes.

AB  == a two-dimensional fingerprinting technique has been developed that allows large,  cell genome-size dna's to be analyzed by restriction endonuclease cleavage and separation of dna fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis. equations have been derived to determine the genome size and number of cleavage sites from analysis of the distribution of fragment lengths. genome sizes of escherichia coli strain  jm101 and two strains of the mycoplasma acholeplasma laidlawii measured by this method are in agreement with published values. other uses of two-dimensional fingerprinting for studies of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genome structure and organization are described.

TI  == mycoplasmal ribosomal rna genes and their use as probes for detection and identification of mollicutes.
AB  == the number and organization of ribosomal rna (rrna) genes in the genome of mycoplasma, ureaplasma, acholeplasma and spiroplasma species were studied by the  southern hybridization technique. restriction endonuclease-digested dnas of the organisms were hybridized with nick-translated probes consisting of defined portions of the rrnb rrna operon of escherichia coli and with a recombinant plasmid pmc5 constructed of pbr325 and an insert containing m. capricolum genes for 23s, 5s and most of the 16s rrna gene. the hybridization data indicate the presence of only one or two sets of rrna genes in the mollicutes tested, a number lower than in eubacteria. the rrna genes in mollicutes appear to be organized as  clusters (acting apparently as operons) in the typical prokaryotic fashion, 5'-16s-23s-5s-3'. despite the marked sequence homology shared by the rrna operons of the different mollicutes and of e. coli, the operons are not identical. thus,  there is an ecori restriction site in the 16s rrna genes in only 8 of the 13 species tested. the recombinant plasmid pmc5 has provided a sensitive probe for detection and identification of mollicutes in contaminated cell cultures. the purified dna of the tested cell culture, or its supernatant fluid, was digested by ecori, and southern blot hybridization of the products was performed with nick-translated pmc5. the probe did not hybridize with eukaryotic dna. each of the mollicutes species examinated exhibited a species-specific hybridization pattern. the hybridization tests enabled the identification of the four most prevalent mycoplasma contaminants of cell cultures, m. orale, m. hyorhinis, m. arginini and a. laidlawii. the test is capable of detecting 1 ng of mycoplasmal dna, roughly equivalent to the dna content of 10(5) mycoplasmas. the possibility  of using this approach for detection and identification of noncultivable mycoplasmas in plant and insect tissues is under investigation.

TI  == purine metabolism in acholeplasma laidlawii b: novel ppi-dependent nucleoside kinase activity.
AB  == acholeplasma laidlawii b-pg9 was examined for 16 cytoplasmic enzymes with activity for purine salvage and interconversion. phosphoribosyltransferase activities for adenine, guanine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine were shown. adenine,  guanine, xanthine, and hypoxanthine were ribosylated to their nucleoside. adenosine, inosine, xanthosine, and guanosine were converted to their base. no atp-dependent phosphorylation of nucleosides to mononucleotides was found. however, ppi-dependent phosphorylation of adenosine, inosine, and guanosine to amp, inosine monophosphate, and gmp, respectively, was detected. nucleotidase activity for amp, inosine monophosphate, xanthosine monophosphate, and gmp was also found. interconversion of gmp to amp was detected. enzyme activities for the interconversion of amp to gmp were not detected. therefore, a. laidlawii b-pg9 cannot synthesize guanylates from adenylates or inosinates. de novo synthesis of  purines was not detected. this study demonstrates that a. laidlawii b-pg9 has the enzyme activities for the salvage and limited interconversion of purines and, except for purine nucleoside kinase activity, is similar to mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides. this is the first report of a ppi-dependent nucleoside kinase activity in any organism.

TI  == effects of manganese on the growth and morphology of ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  == all of the 14 serotype standard strains of ureaplasma urealyticum were inhibited  to varying degrees by manganese. a 1 mm concentration of this cation either stopped growth or reduced the rate of growth in liquid medium. the presence of manganese also altered colonial morphology and cellular ultrastructure. inhibition was dose dependent and strain specific. this differential response allowed the serotype strains to be divided into two broad biotypes. for the first biotype (serotypes 1, 3, 6, and 14), inhibition of growth in broth was temporary. for the second biotype (serotypes 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12), inhibition was permanent. serotype 13 gave an intermediate response and was not classified.  the effect of manganese could be at least partially blocked by magnesium but not  by calcium, cobalt, copper, iron, potassium, sodium, or zinc. the concentration of magnesium yielding the maximum blocking effect was directly related to manganese sensitivity. wild-type isolates of ureaplasma and mycoplasma hominis also showed a differential response to manganese. laboratory-adapted strains representing species of the genus mycoplasma (m. hominis, m. fermentans, and m. pneumoniae) were inhibited by 5 but not by 1 mm manganese. the latter concentration inhibited the growth of acholeplasma laidlawii and staphylococcus aureus, and 5 mm manganese had no effect on escherichia coli.

TI  == yet another improved silver staining method for the detection of proteins in polyacrylamide gels.
AB  == silver staining is very sensitive for detection of proteins in polyacrylamide gels and different procedures have been published. by combining and modifying some of the recipes, a very reproducible method, which is based upon staining with diamine complexes of silver, has been developed. the background staining is  negligible and reduced silver does not precipitate on the gel surface. the technique works very well for sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in both homogeneous and in gradient gels as well as for two-dimensional (2-d) page. it was possible to detect 1-10 ng of protein corresponding to approximately 50 pg/mm2, provided that a discontinuous buffer system was used, which gives sharp bands.

TI  == ribosomal rna genes in mycoplasma.
AB  == using southern blotting analysis with labelled mycoplasmal ribosomal rna as probe, two fragments (1 kb and 5 kb) were detected in an ecor i digest of mycoplasma capricolum dna. this analysis revealed that the 5 kb fragment carries  both 16s rrna sequences and the entire 23s rrna gene of this mycoplasma. the 1 kb fragment contains 16s rrna sequences only. the 5 kb ecor i fragment has been cloned and used to characterize the structure of rrna cistrons in various mycoplasma strains. these experiments clearly demonstrate a substantial homology  of mycoplasma capricolum rrna sequences with the e. coli rrna cistron on one hand, and with mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri and acholeplasma laidlawii on the other hand. this analysis also reveals two rrna cistrons in mycoplasma mycoides subsp. capri and acholeplasma laidlawii whereas one rrna cistron is present in mycoplasma capricolum.

TI  == endotoxin-like activities of mycoplasmal lipopolysaccharides (lipoglycans).
AB  == lipoglycans (previously designated lipopolysaccharides) from several species of acholeplasma and from thermoplasma acidophilum were examined for endotoxin-like activities as measured by the standard rabbit fever test and the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. the lipoglycans from acholeplasma granularum, achloplasma laidlawii, acholeplasma modicum, and acholeplasma oculi caused a febrile response at concentrations of 1 ng/ml per kg or greater, whereas with control escherichia coli ec-2 lipopolysaccharides, 6.25 ng/ml per kg was required. similar results were obtained in the limulus amoebocyte lysate test. the minimum concentrations in nanograms per milliliter required to stimulate formation of a solid clot were: acholeplasma axanthum, 0.22; a. granularum, 0.85; a. modicum, 0.51; a. laidlawii, 1.05; a. oculi, 0.74. standard e. coli 1b lipopolysaccharide required a concentration of 0.125 ng/ml. thermoplasma lipoglycan was least active, requiring 4.25 ng/ml. clotting of the limulus lysate proceeds by the activation by lipopolysaccharide plus ca(2+) of a proenzyme which cleaves an arginine-lysine peptide bond of the coagulogen. the clotting and amidase activities are inactivated by deoxycholate and can be reactivated by addition of lipopolysaccharide and ca(2+). as with e. coli 1b lipopolysaccharide, acholeplasmal lipoglycans were shown to restore both clotting and amidase activities of the deoxycholate-inactivated limulus clotting enzyme. the degree of restoration of amidase activity by mycoplasmal lipoglycans relative to e. coli lipopolysaccharide (1.00) were: a. axanthum, 1.71; a. modicum, 1.22; a. granularum, 0.61; and thermoplasma, 0.37. the coagulating enzyme, restored with either e. coli lipopolysaccharide or mycoplasmal lipoglycans, was able to react with the synthetic peptide benzoyl-ile-glu-(gamma-och(3))-gly-p-nitroaniline (an  analog of the coagulogen) or with the purified coagulogen itself to form the clot. the mycoplasmal lipoglycans alone were incapable of promoting these reactions when incubated with the synthetic peptide or with the purified coagulogen, thereby ruling out the contamination of these lipoglycans with proteases capable of cleaving the same arg-lys peptide bond of the coagulogen. these results show that acholeplasmal lipoglycans possess endotoxin-like activities. their passive or active role in disease remains to be established.

TI  == recognition of different pools of phosphatidylglycerol in intact cells and isolated membranes of acholeplasma laidlawii by phospholipase a2.
AB  == phospholipase a2 (ec 3.1.1.4) from pig pancreas hydrolyzes phosphatidylglycerol in intact cells and isolated membranes of acholeplasma laidlawii. complete degradation of phosphatidylglycerol in intact cells at 37 degrees c does not result in lysis as shown by the retention of intracellular k+ ions and the cytoplasmic glucose-6-phosphatase, as well as the inability to detect activity of membrane-bound intracellular nadh-oxidase. a. laidlawii was grown on linoleic acid. phospholipase a2 treatment of these cells at 5 degrees c, at which temperature the lipids are still in the liquid-crystalline state, results in a rapid breakdown of 50% of the phosphatidylglycerol. the residual phosphatidylglycerol can be hydrolyzed only at elevated temperatures and at much  smaller rates, depending strongly on the incubation temperature. when membranes isolated from these cells are incubated at 5 degrees c, 70% of the phosphatidylglycerol is hydrolyzed immediately. the hydrolysis of the residual 30% is again strongly temperature dependent. cells were grown on palmitate, elaidate, or oleate to investigate possible effects of the lipid phase transition on the accessibility of phosphatidylglycerol for phospholipase a2. under conditions in which all the lipid is in the solid state, no hydrolysis occurs. when solid and liquid-crystalline lipid phases coexist, a limited hydrolysis of phosphatidylglycerol can be observed. the results demonstrate the disposition of  phosphatidylglycerol in three different pools in the membrane of a. laidlawii. phospholipase a2 has been used to discriminate between these pools and to estimate the amount of phosphatidylglycerol which is present in the liquid-crystalline phase. the present data, however, do not allow a definite localization of the phosphatidylglycerol pools.

AB  == acyl carrier protein (acp) activity was determined by the malonyl-coenzyme a-co(2) exchange reaction. it was highest in acholeplasma laidlawii, lower in a.  granularum, and lowest in a. axanthum. the sterol-requiring mycoplasma species examined showed little or negligible acp activity. a. laidlawii was capable of utilizing pantetheine or coenzyme a but not beta-alanine as precursor for acp synthesis. its acp could thus be labeled by growing the organisms with radioactive coenzyme a. the acp of a. laidlawii appears to be a soluble cytoplasmic protein, which could be purified about 40-fold by treatment of the cytoplasmic fluid with streptomycin sulfate and chromatography of the supernatant fluid on a biogel p-10 column. its molecular weight, determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is low (about 10,900) resembling that of escherichia coli, but it is much more sensitive to heat.
