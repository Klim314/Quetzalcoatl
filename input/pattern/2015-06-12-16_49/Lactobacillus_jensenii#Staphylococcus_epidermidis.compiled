TI  - Commensal bacteria modulate innate immune responses of vaginal epithelial cell multilayer cultures.
AB  - The human vaginal microbiome plays a critical but poorly defined role in reproductive health. Vaginal microbiome alterations are associated with increased susceptibility to sexually-transmitted infections (STI) possibly due to related changes in innate defense responses from epithelial cells. Study of the impact of commensal bacteria on the vaginal mucosal surface has been hindered by current vaginal epithelial cell (VEC) culture systems that lack an appropriate interface between the apical surface of stratified squamous epithelium and the air-filled vaginal lumen. Therefore we developed a reproducible multilayer VEC culture system with an apical (luminal) air-interface that supported colonization with selected commensal bacteria. Multilayer VEC developed tight-junctions and other hallmarks of the vaginal mucosa including predictable proinflammatory cytokine secretion following TLR stimulation. Colonization of multilayers by common vaginal commensals including Lactobacillus crispatus, L. jensenii, and L. rhamnosus led to intimate associations with the VEC exclusively on the apical surface. Vaginal commensals did not trigger cytokine secretion but Staphylococcus epidermidis, a skin commensal, was inflammatory. Lactobacilli reduced cytokine secretion in an isolate-specific fashion following TLR stimulation. This tempering of inflammation offers a potential explanation for increased susceptibility to STI in the absence of common commensals and has implications for testing of potential STI preventatives.
TI  - A rapid procedure for isolating chromosomal DNA from Lactobacillus species and other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - This study describes a rapid procedure for the isolation of genomic DNA from various Gram-positive bacteria. Species tested included Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797, Lact. acidophilus N2, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Propionibacterium jensenii P126, Bacillus pumilus and Enterococcus faecalis. Our technique for chromosomal DNA isolation circumvents the need for phenol-chloroform extractions and caesium chloride gradients. Isolated DNA is consistently greater than 25 kb in size and can be used directly for subcloning, polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction digestions and library construction.
