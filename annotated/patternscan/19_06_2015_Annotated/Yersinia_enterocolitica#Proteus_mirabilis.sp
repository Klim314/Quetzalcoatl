TI  == empirical prediction and validation of antibacterial inhibitory effects of various plant essential oils on common pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == in this study, fractional compound composition, antioxidant capacity, and phenolic substance content of 14 plant essential oils-anise (pimpinella anisum),  bay leaves (laurus nobilis), cinnamon bark (cinnamomum verum), clove (eugenia caryophyllata), fennel (foeniculum vulgare), hop (humulus lupulus), istanbul oregano (origanum vulgare subsp. hirtum), izmir oregano (origanum onites), mint (mentha piperita), myrtus (myrtus communis), orange peel (citrus sinensis), sage  (salvia officinalis), thyme (thymbra spicata), and turkish oregano (origanum minutiflorum)--were related to inhibition of 10 bacteria through multiple linear  or non-linear (m(n)lr) models-four gram-positive bacteria of listeria innocua, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus subtilis, and six gram-negative bacteria of yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli o157:h7, and klebsiella oxytoca. a total of 65 compounds with different antioxidant capacity, phenolic substance content and antibacterial properties were detected with 14 plant essential oils. the best-fit m(n)lr models indicated that relative  to anise essential oil, the essential oils of oreganos, cinnamon, and thyme had consistently high inhibitory effects, while orange peel essential oil had consistently a low inhibitory effect. regression analysis indicated that beta-bisabolene (turkish and istanbul oreganos), and terpinolene (thyme) were found to be the most inhibitory compounds regardless of the bacteria type tested.

TI  == aerobic bacterial microbiota isolated from the cloaca of the european pond turtle (emys orbicularis) in poland.
AB  == we conducted a comparative analysis of the aerobic cloacal bacteria of european pond turtles (emys orbicularis) living in their natural environment and juvenile  turtles reared under controlled conditions in a breeding center. we included 130  turtles in the study. the aerobic bacteria isolated from the cloaca of the juvenile turtles were less diverse and more prevalent than the bacteria isolated  from free-living adults. we isolated 17 bacterial species from juvenile captive turtles, among which the dominant species were cellulomonas flavigena (77/96), enterococcus faecalis (96/96), escherichia coli (58/96), and proteus mirabilis (41/96). from the adult, free-living turtles, we isolated 36 bacterial species, some of which are a potential threat to public health (e.g., salmonella enterica  serovars newport, daytona, and braenderup; listeria monocytogenes; yersinia enterocolitica; yersinia ruckeri; klebsiella pneumoniae; vibrio fluvialis; and serratia marcescens), and pathogens that are etiologic agents of diseases of ectothermic animals (e.g., aeromonas sobria, aeromonas caviae, hafnia alvei, edwardsiella tarda, and citrobacter braakii; the last two species were isolated from both groups of animals). the cloacal bacterial biota of the european pond turtle was characterized by numerous species of bacteria, and its composition varied with turtle age and environmental conditions. the small number of isolated bacteria that are potential human pathogens may indicate that the european pond turtle is of relatively minor importance as a threat to public health.

TI  == effects of subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials on gene acquisition events in yersinia, proteus, shigella, and salmonella recipient organisms in isolated ligated intestinal loops of swine.
AB  == objective: to assess antimicrobial resistance and transfer of virulence genes facilitated by subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials in swine intestines. animals: 20 anesthetized pigs experimentally inoculated with donor and recipient bacteria. procedures: 4 recipient pathogenic bacteria (salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri, or proteus mirabilis) were incubated with donor bacteria in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of 1 of 16 antimicrobials in isolated ligated intestinal loops in swine. donor escherichia coli contained transferrable antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes. after coincubations, intestinal contents were removed and assessed for pathogens that acquired new antimicrobial  resistance or virulence genes following exposure to the subtherapeutic concentrations of antimicrobials. results: 3 antimicrobials (apramycin, lincomycin, and neomycin) enhanced transfer of an antimicrobial resistance plasmid from commensal e coli organisms to yersinia and proteus organisms, whereas 7 antimicrobials (florfenicol, hygromycin, penicillin g, roxarsone, sulfamethazine, tetracycline, and tylosin) exacerbated transfer of an integron (salmonella genomic island 1) from salmonella organisms to yersinia organisms. sulfamethazine induced the transfer of salmonella pathogenicity island 1 from pathogenic to nonpathogenic salmonella organisms. six antimicrobials (bacitracin, carbadox, erythromycin, sulfathiazole, tiamulin, and virginiamycin) did not mediate any transfer events. sulfamethazine was the only antimicrobial implicated in 2 types of transfer events. conclusions and clinical relevance: 10 of 16 antimicrobials at subinhibitory or subtherapeutic concentrations augmented specific antimicrobial resistance or transfer of virulence genes into pathogenic  bacteria in isolated intestinal loops in swine. use of subtherapeutic antimicrobials in animal feed may be associated with unwanted collateral effects.

TI  == use of a dna microarray for detection and identification of bacterial pathogens associated with fishery products.
AB  == we established a microarray for the simultaneous detection and identification of  diverse putative pathogens often associated with fishery products by targeting specific genes of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio  vulnificus, and yersinia enterocolitica and the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) region of proteus mirabilis and proteus vulgaris. the microarray contained 26 specific probes and was tested against a total of 123 target bacterial strains that included 55 representative strains, 68 clinical isolates, and 45 strains of other bacterial species that belonged to 8 genera and 34 species, and it was shown to be specific and reproducible. a detection sensitivity of 10 ng dna or 10 cfu/ml for pure cultures of each target organism demonstrated that the assay was highly sensitive and reproducible. mock and real  fishery product samples were tested by the microarray, and the accuracy was 100%. the dna microarray method described in this communication is specific, sensitive, and reliable and has several advantages over traditional methods of bacterial culture and antiserum agglutination assays.

TI  == adhesion, invasion, and agglutination mediated by two trimeric autotransporters in the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis.
AB  == fimbriae of the human uropathogen proteus mirabilis are the only characterized surface proteins that contribute to its virulence by mediating adhesion and invasion of the uroepithelia. pmi2122 (aipa) and pmi2575 (taap) are annotated in  the genome of strain hi4320 as trimeric autotransporters with "adhesin-like" and  "agglutinating adhesin-like" properties, respectively. the c-terminal 62 amino acids (aa) in aipa and 76 aa in taap are homologous to the translocator domains of yada from yersinia enterocolitica and hia from haemophilus influenzae. comparative protein modeling using the hia three-dimensional structure as a template predicted that each of these domains would contain four antiparallel beta sheets and that they formed homotrimers. recombinant aipa and taap were seen as approximately 28 kda and approximately 78 kda, respectively, in escherichia coli, and each also formed high-molecular-weight homotrimers, thus supporting this model. e. coli synthesizing aipa or taap bound to extracellular matrix proteins with a 10- to 60-fold-higher level of affinity than the control strain.  inactivation of aipa in p. mirabilis strains significantly (p < 0.01) reduced the mutants' ability to adhere to or invade hek293 cell monolayers, and the functions were restored upon complementation. a 51-aa-long invasin region in the aipa passenger domain was required for this function. e. coli expressing taap mediated autoagglutination, and a taap mutant of p. mirabilis showed significantly (p < 0.05) more reduced aggregation than hi4320. gly-247 in aipa and gly-708 in taap were indispensable for trimerization and activity. aipa and taap individually offered advantages to p. mirabilis in a murine model. this is the first report characterizing trimeric autotransporters in p. mirabilis as afimbrial surface adhesins and autoagglutinins.

TI  == transfer of a phage t4 gene into enterobacteriaceae, determined at the single-cell level.
AB  == the transfer range of phage genes was investigated at the single-cell level by using an in situ dna amplification technique. after absorption of phages, a phage t4 gene was maintained in the genomes of non-plaque-forming bacteria at frequencies of 10(-2) gene copies per cell. the gene transfer decreased the mutation frequencies in nonhost recipients.

TI  == eca-immunogenicity of proteus mirabilis strains.
AB  == introduction: bacteria of the genus proteus are opportunistic pathogens and cause mainly urinary tract infections. they also play a role in the pathogenesis of reactive arthritis (ra). patients suffering from yersinia-triggered ra often carry high titers of antibodies specific to enterobacterial common antigen (eca). the immunogenicity of eca has not received much attention thus far and studies have focused mainly on the eca of escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica. in this paper the eca-immunogenicity of proteus mirabilis is elucidated using two wild-type strains (s1959 and o28) as well as their rough (r) derivative strains r110/1959, which expresses lipopolysaccharide (lps) with a full core, and r4/o28, which expresses lps with only an inner core. materials and methods: rabbit polyclonal antisera were produced by immunization with boiled suspensions of the  four p. mirabilis strains. the antisera were tested for the presence of antibodies specific to eca by western blotting using glycerophospholipid- linked  eca (eca(pg)) of salmonella montevideo as antigen. lipopolysaccharide (lps) was isolated from the four strains by the hot phenol/water procedure in which eca(pg) is co-extracted with lps and by the phenol/chloroform/petroleum ether extraction  that results in the isolation of lps and/or lps-linked eca (eca(lps)) free of eca(pg). the lps preparations were tested for the presence of eca by western blotting using eca-specific antibodies. results: the results demonstrated that all four p. mirabilis strains were eca immunogenic. the rabbit antisera immunized by the four strains all contained eca-specific antibodies. analysis of the lps preparations demonstrated that the p. mirabilis wild-type strains o28 and s1959 and the ra mutant strain r110/1959 expressed eca(lps), suggesting that it induced the anti-eca antibody responses. only the presence of eca(pg) could be demonstrated in the rc mutant strain r4/o28. conclusions: these results therefore suggest that, similar to e. coli, lps with a full core is also required as the acceptor of eca for p. mirabilis strains to produce eca(lps). since eca(pg) is not immunogenic unless combined with some proteins, it is likely that eca(pg)-protein complexes formed during the intravenous immunization with the rc  mutant strain r4/o28.

TI  == isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == [pyrazinamidase activity of bacteria from enterobacteriaceae family as characteristic for taxonomy].
AB  == pyrazinamidase activity in 330 strains of bacteria from enterobacteriaceae family (14 genus, 27 species) has been assessed. pyrazinamidase activity detected in species from following genuses: citrobacter, escherichia, klebsiella, kluyvera, morganella, providencia, raourtella, salmonella, shigella, and also in proteus mirabilis, and nonpathogenic serovars of yersinia enterocolitica, y. frederiksenii. pirasinamidase was absent in serratia (s. marcescens, s. liguefaciens), hafnia alvei, p. vulgaris, p. penneri, y. pseudotuberculosis and pathogenic serovars of y. enterocolitica. absence of pyrazinamidase activity in bacteria from hafnia and serratia genus is a key taxonomic characteristic for identification of enterobacteria with microvolume assay technology.

TI  == the xaxab genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.
AB  == xenorhabdus nematophila, a member of the enterobacteriaceae, kills many species of insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the entire body. a peptide cytotoxin has been purified from x. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red  blood cells of this toxin have been described (ribeiro, c., vignes, m., and brehelin, m. (2003) j. biol. chem. 278, 3030-3039). we show here that this toxin, xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. we also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxab, encoding this toxin in x. nematophila. the expression of both genes in recombinant escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. however, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxab genes in x. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called c1. we also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera xenorhabdus and photorhabdus, in pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens yersinia enterocolitica and proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen pseudomonas syringae. this toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. it is, therefore, probably  the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.

TI  == a microbial diagnostic microarray technique for the sensitive detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria in a background of nonpathogens.
AB  == a major challenge in microbial diagnostics is the parallel detection and identification of low-bundance pathogens within a complex microbial community. in addition, a high specificity providing robust, reliable identification at least at the species level is required. a microbial diagnostic microarray approach, using single nucleotide extension labeling with gyrb as the marker gene, was developed. we present a novel concept applying competitive oligonucleotide probes to improve the specificity of the assay. our approach enabled the sensitive and specific detection of a broad range of pathogenic bacteria. the approach was tested with a set of 35 oligonucleotide probes targeting escherichia coli, shigella spp., salmonella spp., aeromonas hydrophila, vibrio cholerae, mycobacterium avium, mycobacterium tuberculosis, helicobacter pylori, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni. the introduction of competitive oligonucleotides in the labeling reaction successfully suppressed cross-reaction by closely related sequences, significantly improving the performance of the assay. environmental applicability was tested with environmental and veterinary samples harboring complex microbial communities. detection sensitivity in the range of 0.1% has been demonstrated, far below the 5% detection limit of traditional microbial diagnostic microarrays.

TI  == the family of serratia type pore forming toxins.
AB  == the serratia marcescens hemolysin represents the prototype of a growing family of pore forming toxins. the available bacterial genome sequences reveal serratia hemolysin homologues in additional species. however, only s. marcescens hemolysin has been studied in great molecular detail. this family of toxins has nothing in  common with the pore forming toxins of e. coli type (rtx toxins), the staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin or the thiol activated toxin of group a beta-hemolytic streptococci (streptolysin o). studies on erythrocytes, eukaryotic cells and artificial black lipid membranes, have shown that the mechanism of pore formation of shla is different form other pore forming toxins. the s. marcescens  hemolysin proteins shlb and shla, exhibit protein sequence homologues in proteus  mirabilis, haemophilus ducreyi, yersinia pestis, yersinia enterocolitica, edwardsiella tarda, photorhabdus luminescens and xylella fastidiosa . the family  of serratia type pore forming toxins show a unique secretory mechanism which has  been described as a two partner secretion system (tpss) or type v-secretion system. not only serratia type pore forming toxins are secreted via tpss but also adhesins from bordetella pertussis, erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. the uniqueness of the serratia family is underlined by the fact that  activation of shla by shlb strictly requires phosphatidylethanolamine as a cofactor. and, quite unusual, shla undergoes a conformational change during activation.

TI  == the inner-core lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic waae gene: function and genetic distribution among some enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == to determine the function of the waae gene in the biosynthesis of the inner-core  lps of klebsiella pneumoniae, a waae non-polar mutant has been constructed. data  obtained from the comparative chemical analysis of lps samples obtained from the  wild-type, the mutant strain and the complemented mutant demonstrated that the waae gene is involved in substitution of alpha-l-glycero-d-manno-heptopyranose i  (l,d-heppi) at the o-4 position by a beta-d-glucopyranose (beta-d-glcp) residue.  in addition, dna amplification and nucleotide sequence determination studies revealed that waae homologues located between the waaa and coad genes are present in clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae containing the structure beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi (k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and yersinia enterocolitica), as well as in strains of serratia marcescens and enterobacter aerogenes of unknown lps-core structures. complementation studies using non-polar waae mutants prove that all the waae homologues perform the same  function. furthermore, k. pneumoniae, ser. marcescens and p. mirabilis non-polar  waae mutants showed reduced adhesion and pathogenicity. in addition, the ser. marcescens and p. murabilis waae mutants showed reduced swarming motility and ability to form biofilms in vitro. all these characteristics were rescued by reintroduction of the waae gene independently of its origin. an easy dna amplification method to detect this gene was established, which also helps in finding the potential presence of this structural feature [beta-d-glcp-(1-->4)-alpha-l,d-heppi] in the inner-core lps of enterobacteriaceae members with unknown lps-core structures.

TI  == development of an elisa using a recombinant 41 kda partial protein (p45n') for the detection of riemerella anatipestifer infections in ducks.
AB  == riemerella anatipestifer, a gram-negative bacillus, is the causative agent of duck septicemia, a disease which could incur much economic loss in the duck industry. an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) has been developed to facilitate early detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks. the antigen used was a recombinant 41 kda n-terminal fragment (rp45n') of a newly characterized r. anatipestifer potential surface protein, p45, which was expressed in escherichia coli as an n-terminal gst fusion protein. the rp45n'-based elisa successfully detected p45 antibodies in the sera of 20 ducks immunized with bacterin preparations of r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 10 15, 19 and the atcc11845 strain. antibodies to p45 were also detected in the sera of 25% (75/296) of white pekin ducks which were imported into singapore from three different farms. successful discrimination was obtained between sera from infected ducks and that of specific-pathogen free ducks (p<0.01). the rp45n'-gst  antigen did not cross-react with antibodies in sera from guinea pigs which were infected with other gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including aeromonas hydrophila, citrobacter freundii, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pastuerella multocida, proteus mirabilis, salmonella spp., serratia maccescens, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica. in addition, the dna sequence encoding p45 was detected in r. anatipestifer serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and the atcc11845 strain, suggesting that  p45 is probably also universally expressed in these r. anatipestifer serotypes. thus, the elisa described is applicable to the detection of r. anatipestifer infection in ducks.

TI  == site-directed mutagenesis and phylogenetic comparisons of the escherichia coli tus protein: dna-protein interactions alone can not account for tus activity.
AB  == the tus protein of escherichia coli is capable of arresting dna replication in an orientation-dependent manner when bound to specific sequences in the bacterial chromosome called ter sites. arrest of dna replication has been postulated to occur either by a barrier mechanism, where tus acts as a physical block to replication fork progression, or through protein-protein interactions between tus and some component of the replication fork. a previous mutational analysis of tus suggested that the amino acids in the l1 loop might play a role in replication arrest. site-directed mutagenesis of amino acids in the l1 loop and other amino acid residues on the "non-permissive" face of tus was performed to identify residues that affected tus function. one mutant, e47q, gave results that are inconsistent with the barrier model, showing a greater affinity for the ter site  (with a t 1/2 of 348 min versus 150 min for wild-type tus) but a reduced ability  to arrest dna replication in vivo. in addition to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, the tus genes of salmonella, klebsiella, and yersinia were sequenced and the proteins expressed in e. coli to assess their ability to arrest dna replication. the results presented here support a role for protein-protein interactions in tus function, and suggest that residues e47 and e49 participate in replication fork arrest.

AB  == a recombinant cosmid containing genes involved in klebsiella pneumoniae c3 core lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis was identified by its ability to confer bacteriocin 28b resistance to escherichia coli k-12. the recombinant cosmid contains 12 genes, the whole waa gene cluster, flanked by kbl and coad genes, as  was found in e. coli k-12. pcr amplification analysis showed that this cluster is conserved in representative k. pneumoniae strains. partial nucleotide sequence determination showed that the same genes and gene order are found in k. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, for which the core chemical structure is known. complementation analysis of known waa mutants from e. coli k-12 and/or salmonella enterica led to the identification of genes involved in biosynthesis of the inner core backbone that are shared by these three members of the enterobacteriaceae. k. pneumoniae orf10 mutants showed a two-log-fold reduction in a mice virulence assay and a strong decrease in capsule amount. analysis of a constructed k. pneumoniae waae deletion mutant suggests that the waae protein is involved in the transfer of the branch beta-d-glc to the o-4 position of l-glycero-d-manno-heptose i, a feature shared by k. pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and yersinia enterocolitica.

AB  == a transferable beta-lactamase produced by a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate  of enterobacter cloacae was studied. the bla gene was carried by a large (>80-kb) transmissible plasmid. nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned fragments revealed  that it was part of a gene cassette carried by a class 1 integron along with other resistance genes, including aac(6')-ib. the encoded beta-lactamase, designated ibc-1, was a novel class a enzyme that hydrolyzed ceftazidime and cefotaxime and was inhibited by tazobactam and, to a lesser extent, by clavulanate. also, imipenem exhibited potent inhibitory activity against ibc-1. the enzyme consisted of 287 amino acid residues, including ser-237, cysteines at  positions 69 and 237a, and arg-244, which may be implicated in its interaction with beta-lactams. in amino acid sequence comparisons, ibc-1 displayed the highest similarity with the chromosomal penicillinase of yersinia enterocolitica, a carbenicillinase from proteus mirabilis gn79, the species-specific beta-lactamases of klebsiella oxytoca, and the carbapenemase sme-1. however, a phylogenetic association with established beta-lactamase clusters could not be conclusively shown.

TI  == biochemical sequence analyses of ges-1, a novel class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamase, and the class 1 integron in52 from klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae ori-1 was isolated in 1998 in france from a rectal swab of  a 1-month-old girl who was previously hospitalized in cayenne hospital, cayenne,  french guiana. this strain harbored a ca. 140-kb nontransferable plasmid, ptk1, that conferred an extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance profile antagonized  by the addition of clavulanic acid, tazobactam, or imipenem. the gene for ges-1 (guiana extended-spectrum beta-lactamase) was cloned, and its protein was expressed in escherichia coli dh10b, where this pi-5. 8 beta-lactamase of a ca. 31-kda molecular mass conferred resistance to oxyimino cephalosporins (mostly to  ceftazidime). ges-1 is weakly related to the other plasmid-located ambler class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls). the highest percentage of amino acid identity was obtained with the carbenicillinase gn79 from proteus mirabilis; with yent, a chromosome-borne penicillinase from yersinia enterocolitica; and with l-2, a chromosome-borne class a cephalosporinase from stenotrophomonas maltophilia (36% amino acid identity each). however, a dendrogram analysis showed that ges-1 clustered within a class a esbl subgroup together with esbls veb-1 and per-1. sequencing of a 7,098-bp dna fragment from plasmid ptk1 revealed that the  ges-1 gene was located on a novel class 1 integron named in52 that was characterized by (i) a 5' conserved segment containing an inti1 gene possessing two putative promoters, p(1) and p(2), for coordinated expression of the downstream antibiotic resistance genes and an atti1 recombination site; (ii) five antibiotic gene cassettes, bla(ges-1), aac(6')ib' (gentamicin resistance and amikacin susceptibility), dfrxvb (trimethoprim resistance), a novel chloramphenicol resistance gene (cmla4), and aada2 (streptomycin-spectinomycin resistance); and (iii) a 3' conserved segment consisting of qacedelta1 and suli.  the bla(ges-1) and aada2 gene cassettes were peculiar, since they lacked a typical 59-base element. this work identified the second class a esbl gene of a non-tem, non-shv series which was located in the plasmid and integron, thus providing it additional means for its spread and its expression.

AB  == two monoclonal antibodies (mabs), designated as h9 (igg2a) and h20 (igm), directed against heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) of helicobacter pylori strain tk1029 were established. affinity-purified antigens cross-reacted in immunoblots  with mab h9 and mab h20 respectively. these antigens also reacted with the 3c8 mab previously established in this laboratory, which recognised yersinia enterocolitica hsp60. by amino-acid sequence analysis, the n-terminal amino-acid  sequence of the protein recognised by both h9 and h20 mabs was confirmed as the amino-acid sequence of h. pylori hsp60 reported previously. both mabs reacted with nine strains of h. pylori in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and immunoblot analysis. in addition, mab h9 reacted with extracts of other bacteria  including h. mustelae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio cholerae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli and shigella sonnei. in contrast, mab h20 reacted only with strains h. pylori. these results suggest that both the  species-specific epitope recognised by mab h20 and the common epitope recognised  by mab h9 exist on hsp60 of the bacterial cell. both mabs also reacted with the 60-kda protein in the lysate of human gastric carcinoma (mkn45) cells. it was shown by immunohistochemical staining that gastric epithelial cells of four out of six biopsy specimens examined stained positively with mab h20. these results suggest that there is a common epitope in h. pylori hsp60 and human gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == molecular biology of microbial ureases.
AB  == urease (urea amidohydrolase; ec 3.5.1.5) catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to yield ammonia and carbamate. the latter compound spontaneously decomposes to yield another molecule of ammonia and carbonic acid. the urease phenotype is widely distributed across the bacterial kingdom, and the gene clusters encoding this enzyme have been cloned from numerous bacterial species. the complete nucleotide sequence, ranging from 5.15 to 6.45 kb, has been determined for five species including bacillus sp. strain tb-90, klebsiella aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, helicobacter pylori, and yersinia enterocolitica. sequences for selected genes have been determined for at least 10 other bacterial species and the jack bean enzyme. urease synthesis can be nitrogen regulated, urea inducible, or constitutive. the crystal structure of the k. aerogenes enzyme has been determined. when combined with chemical modification studies, biophysical and spectroscopic analyses, site-directed mutagenesis results, and kinetic inhibition experiments, the structure provides important insight into the mechanism of catalysis. synthesis of active enzyme requires incorporation of both carbon dioxide and nickel ions into the protein. accessory genes have been shown to be required for activation of urease apoprotein, and roles for the accessory proteins in metallocenter assembly have been proposed. urease is central to the virulence of p. mirabilis and h. pylori. urea hydrolysis by p. mirabilis in the urinary tract leads directly to urolithiasis (stone formation) and contributes to the development of acute pyelonephritis. the urease of h. pylori is necessary for colonization of the gastric mucosa in experimental animal models of gastritis and serves as the major antigen and diagnostic marker for gastritis and peptic ulcer  disease in humans. in addition, the urease of y. enterocolitica has been implicated as an arthritogenic factor in the development of infection-induced reactive arthritis. the significant progress in our understanding of the molecular biology of microbial ureases is reviewed.

TI  == 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinose in lps of enterobacterial r-mutants and its possible  role for their polymyxin reactivity.
AB  == the content of 4-amino-4-deoxy-l-arabinopyranose (l-arap4n) and the phosphate substitution pattern of the lps of various strains from salmonella minnesota, yersinia enterocolitica and proteus mirabilis was determined by gc/ms, hplc and 31p-nmr. these data allowed us to examine the possible role of these components for the polymyxin b-binding capacity of lps and for the minimal inhibiting concentration (mic) and the minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) of polymyxins b and e towards the respective r-mutants. contrary to other investigated re-, rd- and rc-mutants of s. minnesota, strain r595 (re-mutant) showed about a 90% substitution of the ester-linked phosphate-group with l-arap4n, whereas the l-arap4n content of the other s. minnesota strains amounted to 17-25%. neither the binding capacity of lps to polymyxin b, determined by a bioassay, nor the mic- and mbc-values of the r-mutants were significantly affected by this alteration. similar results were obtained after using the temperature-dependent changes in the l-arap4n-content and phosphate substitution  pattern of y. enterocolitica 75r. in order to explore the relevant polymyxin b binding site, lipid a samples with or without substitution of their ester-linked  phosphate group were prepared and subjected to the polymyxin-binding assay. the results obtained so far indicated that the inner core bound l-arap4n, detected in all resistant strains investigated, may play a decisive role in the decreased binding of polymyxin b, responsible for the bacterial resistance towards polymyxin(s).

TI  == evaluation of rapid one system for identification of 379 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.
AB  == the ability of the rapid one system (innovative diagnostic systems, inc., norcross, ga.) to identify 364 strains in the family enterobacteriaceae and 15 oxidase-negative, gram-negative, nonfermentative rods was evaluated. kits were inoculated with no. 2 mcfarland standard suspensions, and reactions were interpreted after 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c. overall, the method correctly identified (to the species level or to the genus level for salmonellas  and non-shigella sonnei shigella species) 363 strains (95.8%) without additional  tests. for four strains (1.0%), additional tests were required to delineate the correct identification from a range of two or more possibilities; these included  one serratia liquefaciens (serratia marcescens or serratia liquefaciens), one serratia rubidaea (serratia rubidaea or serratia odorifera), one salmonella typhi (leminorella richardii or salmonella sp.) and one yersinia enterocolitica (yersinia frederiksenii, yersinia intermedia, or yersinia enterocolitica). twelve strains (3.2%) were misidentified or yielded codes with no identification; these  comprised one citrobacter amalonaticus (no identification), three enterobacter hormaechei (not in the rapid one database; two enterobacter amnigenus, one enterobacter sp.), one serratia liquefaciens (enterobacter cloacae), one serratia rubidaea (no identification), four serratia fonticola (not in rapid one database; two enterobacter aerogenes, one serratia marcescens, one not identified), one proteus mirabilis (proteus penneri), and one proteus vulgaris (providencia rustigianii). if the seven strains not included in the database had been excluded, correct identification rates would have risen to 97.6% without additional tests and 98.7% with additional tests, with misidentification rates dropping to 1.3%. the rapid one system is easy to set up and the results are easy to read, and the system provides an accurate, nonautomated commercially available method for the same-day identification of members of the family enterobacteriaceae and oxidase-negative, gram-negative nonfermenters.

TI  == listeria isolations from feces of patients with diarrhea and from healthy food handlers.
AB  == a study was undertaken on the presence and frequency of listeria sp. in feces from 1,000 patients suffering from diarrheal diseases and from 2,000 healthy persons. furthermore, the feces of patients were examined for other well-documented enteropathogens such as campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, protozoa and rotavirus as well as for organisms of questionable enteropathogenic potency such as fungi, i.e. candida. finally, in continuation of previously described investigations of the enteropathogenic role of proteus mirabilis but not of proteus vulgaris, both these species were studied too. only listeria innocua and listeria monocytogenes  could be detected in the investigated fecal specimens. there were no differences  of the frequencies of l. innocua, and l. monocytogenes between patients and healthy persons. 17 strains (= 1.7%) of l. innocua and six strains (= 0.6%) of l. monocytogenes were isolated from 1,000 samples of patients. as a comparison 2,000 fecal samples from healthy people contained 40 strains (= 2.0%) of l. innocua and 16 strains (= 0.8%) of l. monocytogenes. a coincidence study showed that there were no statistically significant correlations between well-known enteropathogens and listeria sp., proteus sp. or any of the other isolates. significant correlations were found only between harmless species such as l. innocua and p. vulgaris.

TI  == optimization of a medium for the rapid urease test for detection of campylobacter pylori in gastric antral biopsies.
AB  == we developed a buffered azide-free urea medium which is sensitive, specific, and  nontoxic for rapid detection of campylobacter pylori in gastric biopsies. detection of urease produced by the organism provides the basis for the test. the substrate is urea in monobasic sodium phosphate buffer, and phenol red provides indication of the ph change that results from urease activity. a rapid change from yellow to red occurs in the presence of c. pylori, even at low concentrations of the organism. a slower color change occurs with higher concentrations of other urease producers, such as yersinia enterocolitica and proteus mirabilis. experience with 51 patients with our medium showed excellent results in detection of c. pylori in gastric mucosal biopsies. in clinical research and practice, a rapid bedside test will be helpful for rapid diagnosis of c. pylori-positive patients.

AB  == two patients exhibited reactive arthropathy in association with chronic diarrhoea and abdominal pain. rising titres of agglutinating antibody to yersinia enterocolitica o3 were observed in association with arthropathy. morganella morganii was isolated from faeces of one patient in heavy growth. in both patients, absorption of the sera with morganella antigen abolished yersinia reactivity. morganella titres were more than 8 times the yersinia titres and were unaffected by absorption with yersinia. neither patient had detectable antibody to the predominant enterobacterial species present in faeces. one patient developed acute cystitis with proteus mirabilis and had no serological response to the proteus isolate. we conclude that the elevated morganella titres were specific. the role of m. morganii in intestinal disorders remains to be established, but from our findings, it should be added to the list of organisms associated with reactive arthropathy.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ticarcillin in the presence of clavulanate potassium.
AB  == the antibacterial effects produced by ticarcillin disodium plus clavulanate potassium, a combination of the broad-spectrum penicillin ticarcillin, and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid as the potassium salt, have been measured in vitro and in experimental infection studies. the presence of clavulanic acid resulted in a significant enhancement of the activity of ticarcillin against a wide range of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. these included ticarcillin-resistant strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis. in addition, beta-lactamase-producing isolates of  hemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to ticarcillin and clavulanate. clavulanic acid did not influence the activity of ticarcillin against ticarcillin-susceptible bacteria. the bactericidal effects of the antibiotic combination were measured in an in vitro kinetic model in which the drug concentrations were varied to simulate those measured in humans after intravenous dosing with ticarcillin (3.0 g) and clavulanate potassium (100 mg clavulanic acid). in these tests, ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid had pronounced bactericidal activity against ticarcillin-resistant bacteria. the protection of ticarcillin by clavulanic acid from inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases in  vivo was demonstrated in experimental infection models in which the efficacy of the ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid combination against infections caused by beta-lactamase-producing bacteria was correlated with the presence of effective concentrations of both antibiotic and inhibitor at the site of infection.

TI  == in-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. it inhibited 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella sp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus sp., neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l.  pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than  or equal to 6.3 mg/l. although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher mic values, and most bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. the overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant  to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. the activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid ph and in urine, but serum had no effect on mics or mbcs. increase in ofloxacin mics for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.

TI  == comparative activity of cefotaxime and selected beta-lactam antibiotics against haemophilus influenzae and aerobic gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == the activity of cefotaxime was compared with that of ampicillin, moxalactam, and  cefoperozone against 50 isolates of haemophilus influenzae and with that of ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefazolin, and several other established and investigational beta-lactam antibiotics against several hundred isolates of gram-negative aerobic enteric bacilli. minimal inhibitory concentrations of the drugs were determined by the agar plate dilution technique for h. influenzae and by the microtiter broth dilution technique for the other pathogens. cefotaxime was the most active agent against h. influenzae;  it was 20 times more active than ampicillin. it was also the most active agent against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, nontyphoid salmonella species, and yersinia enterocolitica. cefotaxime was among the most active agents against  enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter species, shigella species, proteus mirabilis, and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. none of the new cephalosporins or penicillin inhibited greater than 90% of the isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations of less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; these drugs were, however, more active than carbenicillin.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of cefotiam against various pathogens isolated from clinical materials (author's transl)].
AB  == bacteriological evaluation was made on cefotiam (ctm), a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic, and the following results wer obtained. 1) ctm has shown very potent antibacterial activities against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, edwardsiella tarda, citrobacter intermedius, salmonella, klebsiella, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri, proteus inconstans, yersinia enterocolitica, aeromonas hydrophila, plesiomonas shigelloides and pseudomonas putrefaciens. 2) streptococcus faecalis, enterobacter and proteus morganii isolated from urine, serratia and glucose non fermentative gram-negative bacilli  except pseudomonas putrefaciens, were almost insusceptible to cefotiam.

TI  == [utilization and fermentation of 2-ketogluconate by "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == two methods were compared: 1) the ability to use 2-ketogluconate (2-kg) as source of carbon and energy in defined medium, and 2) the ability to produce acid by fermentation of 2-kg (0.5 g/100 ml) in peptone water with phenol red. results of  growth on, and acid production from, 2-kg were identical. a total of 990 strains  was studied. no strain of escherichia coli, shigella (4 species), salmonella (4 sub-genera), yersinia pestis, y. pseudotuberculosis, edwardsiella (2 species), proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, providencia (2 species) could utilize 2-kg. all strains of citrobacter (2 species), levinea amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter (5 species), serratia (6 species) utilize 2-kg as sole carbon source. different reactions were given by strains of p. rettgeri, y. enterocolitica and k. rhinoscleromatis.

TI  == [interest of gamma-glutamyltransferase in "enterobacteriaceae" (author's transl)].
AB  == gamma-glutamyltransferase (gammagt) could be detected in 86,6% of 3,027 strains of enterobacteriaceae, by the use of gamma-l-glutamin-p-nitranilide acid for substrate. the following species produced gamma gt: citrobacter freundii, levinea malonatica, l. amalonatica, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, k. ozaenae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, e. agglomerans, e. gergoviae, hafnia alvei, erwinia carotovora, serratia marcescens, s. liquefaciens, s. plymuthica, s. marinorubra, s. odorifera, s. ficaria, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. morganii, p. rettgeri, providencia alcalifaciens, p. stuartii, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. most strains of escherichia coli and alkalescens dispar group are gamma gt+. the following species did not produce gammagt: shigella sonnei, edwardsiella tarda, klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and yersinia pestis. within the salmonella, most strains of subgenus i, ii and iv, and diphasic strains of subgenus iii (s. arizonae) produced gamma gt, whereas monophasic strains of subgenus iii did not produce gammagt. salmonella enteritidis (gammagt+) and s. dublin (gammagt-) can readily be distinguished. this test (gammagt) could also serve as a biochemical marker for s. typhi-murium  strains. shigella dysenteriae serotypes 3 to 9 were gammagt+ whereas other serotypes were gammagt-. within s. flexneri serotype 6, varieties boyd 88 and newcastle were found gammagt+; and varieties sussex and manchester were gammagt-. the use of gammagt test as an epidemiological marker for other shigella serotypes is suggested.

TI  == synthesis of a selective agar medium for yersinia enterocolitica.
AB  == a new agar medium for isolation of yersinia enterocolitica was formulated based on growth studies which defined an optimum basal, and the evaluation of selective chemical agents, dyes, and antibiotics. the final formulation, designated cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin(cin) agar, provided quantitative recovery of 40 different strains of y. enterocolitica in 24 h using incubation at 32 degrees c or with 48 h of incubation at 22 degrees c. the medium was highly selective, especially against pseudomonas aeruginosa. escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. colony morphology coupled with a differential  reaction resulting from mannitol fermentation permitted discrimination of y. enterocolitica from most of those gram-negative bacteria that were able to grow on the medium. recovery and selective characteristics of cin agar were stable during storage at room temperature for 9 days. cin agar gave a higher recovery of y. enterocolitica from feces both direct and with cold enrichment (0.4/1.5%) than salmonella-shigella (0.0/0.7%) and macconkey (0.0/0.9%) agars while significantly reducing the level of background organisms.

TI  == absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids present in lipopolysaccharides from various bacterial groups.
AB  == the absolute configuration of 3-hydroxy fatty acids has been studied, which are present in the lipopolysaccharides of the following bacteria: phodopseudomonas gelatinosa, rh. viridis, rhodospirillum tenue, chromobacterium violaceum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bordetella pertussis, vibrio metchnikovii, vibrio cholerae, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica and fusobacterium nucleatum. the 3-hydroxy acids were liberated by strong alkaline hydrolysis, converted to 3-methoxy acid l-phenylethylamides and analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography. with the aid of authentic d-3-hydroxy fatty acids it was shown for all lipopolysaccharides that the 3-hydroxy acids, regardless of chain lengths, branching, 3-o-substitution or  type of linkage, possess the d-configuration. 2-hydroxydodecanoic acid, which is  present in some lipopolysaccharides, was analyzed in an analogous way and shown to possess the l-configuration.

TI  == properties of r factors from bordetella bronchiseptica.
AB  == genetic properties and host ranges of r factors derived from bordetella bronchiseptica of pig origin were examined. all of 61 r factors tested could confer resistance to streptomycin, sulfonamide, and aminobenzyl penicillin on their host bacteria. all of them were identified as fi(-) (no fertility inhibition) type and were found to exhibit no restriction of phages lambda, phi80, p1, p2, t1, t3, t6, t7, w31, and bf-23. they could confer macarbomysin susceptibility on their host cells when infected. an rte16, a representative r factor, was incompatible with both rp4 and r40a, which are classified as compatibility groups p and c, respectively. an rte16 was conjugally transmissible to b. bronchiseptica, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, but not to shigella flexneri, s. sonnei, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, p. rettgeri, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
