TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - Apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  Experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  - In six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species Streptococcus milleri, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. All strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. After 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. From 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. The two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. Apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. Endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. The chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. The facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. The five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.
TI  - Circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  - Root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with Streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, Actinomyces bovis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides oralis in various combinations. After 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. In 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with Strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. Sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (HA), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. Detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of B. oralis in all five monkeys. Agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of B. oralis in titers between 1:40 and 1:320. A marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of IgM-class. The study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.
TI  - Bacterial interference by oropharynegeal and clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobic isolates were tested for bacterial inhibitory activity. Of 144 isolates, 102 were from oropharynegeal washings, and 42 were from clinical specimens. Thirteen facultative bacterial species (seven members of the Enterobacteriaceae and six species of gram-positive cocci) were used as indicators of inhibition. Eleven anaerobic species were isolated from oral secretions. All isolates of Bacteroides melaninogenicus, the most commonly recovered species, consistently inhibited several species of indicator bacteria. Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides oralis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius had unprecictable inhibitory activity, whereas most of the other oral anaerobes were noninhibitory. The 42 clinical species were generally noninhibitory.
