TI  - Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria Community From Raw Milk of Iranian One Humped Camel and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in Iran. On the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the Golestan province of Iran under aseptic conditions. Bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. Isolates were identified by amplification of the 16S rDNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and were then screened and grouped by the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) method. To evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ARDRA profiles were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against Pediococcus pentosaceus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. Acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. The most frequently isolated LAB was Enterococci. Weissella, Leuconostoc, Lactobacilli and Pediococci were less frequently found. Based on restriction analysis of the ITS, the isolates were grouped into nine different ARDRA patterns that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as P. pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium strain Y-2, E. faecium strain JZ1-1, E. faecium strain E6, E. durans, E. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus casei and Weissella cibaria. The results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and P. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. In addition, E. durans, E. lactis, L. casei and P. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the Golestan province of Iran.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  - A total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. According to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences and recA gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these LAB isolates were identified as five species: Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus mundtii, Weissella cibaria and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. Those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. Based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two L. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains ZZU 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited Salmonella enterica ATCC 43971(T), Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698(T) and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775(T) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, pH and protease. Cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees C), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (pH 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (pH 7.0 to 9.0). In addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease K. These results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains ZZU 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. The nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
TI  - Construction of a shuttle vector based on the small cryptic plasmid pJY33 from Weissella cibaria 33.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid, pJY33, from Weissella cibaria 33 was characterized. pJY33 was  2365 bp in size with a GC content of 41.27% and contained two putative open reading frames (ORFs). orf1 encoded a putative hypothetical protein of 134 amino acids. orf2 was 849 bp in size, and its putative translation product exhibited 87% identity with a replication initiation factor from a plasmid from W. cibaria KLC140. A Weissella-Escherichia coli shuttle vector, pJY33E (6.5 kb, Em(r)), was constructed by ligation of pJY33 with pBluescript II SK(-) and an erythromycin resistance gene (Em(r)). pJY33E replicated in Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Weissella confusa. A single-stranded DNA intermediate was detected from Lb. brevis 2.14 harbouring pJY33E, providing evidence for rolling-circle replication of pJY33. Most Lb. brevis 2.14 cells (85.9%) retained pJY33E after one week of daily culturing in MRS broth without Em. An aga gene encoding alpha-galactosidase (alpha-Gal) from Leuconostoc mesenteroides was successfully expressed in Lb. brevis 2.14 using pJY33E, and the highest level of alpha-Gal activity (36.13 U/mg protein) was observed when cells were grown on melibiose.
TI  - Halotolerance and survival kinetics of lactic acid bacteria isolated from jalapeno pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) fermentation.
AB  - The microbiota associated with spontaneous fermentation of vegetables in a saline substrate may represent an important group of bacteria in the food industry. In this work, the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paraplantarum, and Leuconostoc citreum were identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. In addition, entophytic bacteria such as Pantoea eucalypti, Pantoea anthophila, Enterobacter cowanii, and Enterobacter asburiae were detected, but they were irrelevant for the fermentation process and were inhibited after 12 h of fermentation when the pH decreased from 6.5 to 4.9. Moreover, 2 species of yeast were isolated and identified as Hanseniaspora pseudoguilliermondii and Kodamaea ohmeri by their partial 26S rRNA gene sequence. The growth of LAB was evaluated at different sodium chloride contents. L. citreum was the most halotolerant species followed by L. plantarum and W. cibaria with a concentration index to obtain a 50% population reduction (IC(50)) of 7.2%, 6.6%, and 5.2%, respectively. Furthermore, the growth of LAB and Escherichia coli O157:H7 was evaluated in the presence of the main phenylpropanoids from chilli peppers such as p-coumaric and ferulic acid. It was determined that LAB can grow in both acids at 4 mM, unlike E. coli O157:H7, whose growth is inhibited in the presence of these acids.
TI  - Sequence analysis of a cryptic plasmid pKW2124 from Weissella cibaria KLC140 and  construction of a surface display vector.
AB  - Plasmid isolation of kimchi-derived Weissella cibaria KLC140 revealed six different plasmids. The smallest plasmid, pKW2124, was DNA sequenced and characterized, showing 2,124 bp with a GC content of 36.39% and five putative open reading frames (ORFs). In silico analysis of these ORFs showed ORF1 encodes a putative replication protein similar to rolling circular replication proteins from other lactic acid bacteria. However, a single-stranded intermediate was not detected when S1 nuclease was treated, suggesting it may follow theta replication. Interestingly, the replication initiation site of this plasmid is 100% identical to other plasmids from lactic acid bacteria, suggesting it may function for replication initiation. To construct a surface layer expression vector, pTSLGFP, slpA encoding the surface layer protein from Lactobacillus acidophilus was PCR amplified and fused with the gfp gene, forming a SLGFP fused gene. The plasmid pKW2124 was cloned into the XbaI site of pUC19, forming an Weissella-E. coli shuttle vector pKUW22. NheI-linearized pTSLGFP was ligated into pKUWCAT containing pKUW22 and the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene from pEK104, resulting in an 8.6 kb pKWCSLGFP surface layer expression vector. After transformation of this vector into W. cibaria KLC140, a GFP fluorescence signal was detected on the surface of the transformant, substantiating production of SLGFP fused protein and its secretion. This is the first report for construction of a Weissella surface layer expression vector, which may be useful for surface layer production of beneficial proteins in Weissella.
TI  - Purification and characterization of beta-glucosidase from Weissella cibaria 37.
AB  - A gene encoding beta-glucosidase was cloned from Weissella cibaria 37, an isolate from human feces. Sequence analysis showed that the gene could encode a protein of 415 amino acids in length, and the translated amino acid sequence showed homology (34-31%) with glycosyl hydrolase family 1 beta-glucosidases. The gene was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pET26b(+) and a 50 kDa protein was overproduced, which matched well with the calculated size of the enzyme, 49,950.87 Da. Recombinant beta-glucosidase was purified by using a his-tag affinity column. The purified beta-glucosidase had an optimum pH and a temperature of 5.5 and 45oC, respectively. Among the metal ions (5mM concentration), Ca2+ slightly increased the activity (108.2%) whereas Cu2+ (46.1%) and Zn2+ (56.7%) reduced the activity. Among the enzyme inhibitors (1 mM concentration), SDS was the strongest inhibitor (16.9%), followed by pepstatin A (45.2%). The Km and Vmax values of purified enzyme were 4.04 mM and 0.92 micromol/min, respectively, when assayed using pNPG (p-nitrophenyl-beta- D-glucopyranoside) as the substrate. The enzyme liberated reducing sugars from carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC).
TI  - Characterization of a novel dextransucrase from Weissella confusa isolated from sourdough.
AB  - Weissella confusa and Weissella cibaria isolated from wheat sourdoughs produce, from sucrose, linear dextrans due to a single soluble dextransucrase. In this study, the first complete gene sequence encoding dextransucrase from a W. confusa strain (LBAE C39-2) along with the one from a W. cibaria strain (LBAE K39) were reported. Corresponding gene cloning was achieved using specific primers designed on the basis of the draft genome sequence of these species. Deduced amino acid sequence of W. confusa and W. cibaria dextransucrase revealed common structural features of the glycoside hydrolase family 70. Notably, the regions located in the vicinity of the catalytic triad (D, E, D) are highly conserved. However, comparison analysis also revealed that Weissella dextransucrases form a distinct phylogenetic group within glucansucrases of other lactic acid bacteria. We then cloned the W. confusa C39-2 dextransucrase gene and successfully expressed the mature corresponding enzyme in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme rDSRC39-2 catalyzed dextran synthesis from sucrose with a K m of 8.6 mM and a V max of 20 mumol/mg/min. According to (1)H and (13)C NMR analysis, the polymer is a linear class 1 dextran with 97.2 % alpha-(1-->6) linkages and 2.8 % alpha-(1-->3) branch linkages, similar to the one produced by W. confusa C39-2 strain. The enzyme exhibited optimum catalytic activity for temperatures ranging from 35 to 40 degrees C and a pH of 5.4 in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer. This novel dextransucrase is responsible for production of dextran with predominant alpha-(1-->6) linkages that could find applications as food hydrocolloids.
TI  - Exopolysaccharide synthesized by Lactobacillus reuteri decreases the ability of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli to bind to porcine erythrocytes.
AB  - This study investigated the therapeutic potential of bacterial polysaccharides by employing a model system based on enteroxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC)-induced hemagglutination of erythrocytes. Exopolysaccharides produced by strains of Lactobacillus reuteri inhibited ETEC-induced hemagglutination of porcine erythrocytes. No effect was observed for dextran produced from Weissella cibaria and commercially available oligo- and polysaccharides.
