TI  == antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  == introduction: to date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. however, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. in this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. methods: antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin g, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized etest method (bio merieux, marcy-1'etoile, france). the antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. results: different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus fermentum, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella buccae, and propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. conclusions: these results suggest that the  clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.

TI  == the predominant bacteria isolated from radicular cysts.
AB  == purpose: to detect predominant bacteria associated with radicular cysts and discuss in light of the literature. material and methods: clinical materials were obtained from 35 radicular cysts by aspiration. cultures were made from clinical  materials by modern laboratory techniques, they underwent microbiologic analysis. results: the following are microorganisms isolated from cultures: streptococcus milleri group (smg) (23.8%) [streptococcus constellatus (19.1%) and streptococcus anginosus (4.7%)], streptococcus sanguis (14.3%), streptococcus mitis (4.7%), streptococcus cremoris (4.7%), peptostreptococcus pevotii (4.7%), prevotella buccae (4.7%), prevotella intermedia (4.7%), actinomyces meyeri (4.7%), actinomyces viscosus (4.7%), propionibacterium propionicum (4.7%), bacteroides capillosus (4.7%), staphylococcus hominis (4.7%), rothia denticariosa (4.7%), gemella haemolysans (4.7%), and fusobacterium nucleatum (4.7%). conclusions: results of this study demonstrated that radicular cysts show a great variety of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial flora. it was observed that all isolated microorganisms were the types commonly found in oral flora. although no  specific microorganism was found, streptococcus spp. bacteria (47.5%) - especially smg (23.8%) - were predominantly found in the microorganisms isolated. furthermore, radicular cysts might be polymicrobial originated. although radicular cyst is an inflammatory cyst, some radicular cyst fluids might be sterile.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == soft-tissue abscess involving actinomyces odontolyticus and two prevotella species in an intravenous drug abuser.
AB  == skin and soft-tissue infections in intravenous users comprise a variety of microorganisms and anaerobic bacteria are frequently involved in these suppurative infections. a case of subcutaneous abscess into anterior femoral muscles involving actinomyces odontolyticus and two prevotella species (prevotella buccae and prevotella melaninogenica) in an intravenous drug abuser is presented. this combination of microorganisms has not previously been described in soft-tissue infections. the patient volunteering that he licked his  hypodermic needle prior to cocaine injection supports that the implicating bacteria originated from the oral cavity. eventually, the patient recovered and at a 6-month follow-up a gradual improvement of his subcutaneous infection was noticed.

TI  == growth and molecular characterization of dental plaque microcosms.
AB  == aims: (i) to compare the effects of feeding protocols upon the composition and stability of dental plaque microcosms formed in constant-depth film fermenters (cdff). (ii) to evaluate the utility of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and culture methodologies for the investigation of such models. methods and results: microcosms were established anaerobically in the cdffs from freshly  collected saliva. these were fed either with artificial saliva alone (famine) or  combined with discontinuous feeding (feast-famine). culture and 16s rdna sequencing indicated that supplemental feeding gave ca. 2 log increases in lactobacillus rhamnosus and prevotella buccae. feast-famine microcosms were then  further characterized by dgge using primers specific for the v2-v3 region of eubacterial rdna. these gave single major bands with pure cultures (eight species) and resolved all strains apart from lact. rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii. whilst culture with selective media indicated a degree of stability and reproducibility between replicate microcosms, dgge showed a considerable degree of variability that related to several putatively uncultured bacteria. conclusions: feast-famine regimes altered community composition. dgge analyses identified putatively unculturable species and demonstrated variability between replicate fermenters. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrates the utility of dgge for the analysis of dental plaque, especially with respect to unculturable bacteria. results question the assumptions of reproducibility of plaque microcosms established in non-replicated cdffs made on  the basis of selective media. feeding regimes, particularly those involving complex nutrients, will dramatically affect population dynamics.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  == the activities of gemifloxacin (sb 265805, lb20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions.  peptostreptococci (peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, peptostreptococcus magnus, peptostreptococcus micros, and peptostreptococcus prevotii) and porphyromonas spp. (porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, and porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. the mics of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, clostridium innocuum, clostridium clostridioforme, anaerobiospirillum spp., bacteroides tectum, bacteroides ureolyticus, bacteroides gracilis (now campylobacter gracilis), prevotella intermedia, prevotella heparinolytica, and the prevotella oris-buccae  group. fusobacterium naviforme and fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while fusobacterium varium  strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other fusobacterium species, such as fusobacterium ulcerans and fusobacterium russii, as well as veillonella spp., the prevotella melaninogenica group, prevotella bivia, clostridium difficile, and bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (mic(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).

TI  == beta-lactamase producing bacteria in adult periodontitis.
AB  == in 23 untreated adult periodontitis patients, the occurrence of beta-lactamase producing periodontal bacteria was determined. in addition to non-selective isolation media, selective isolation and growth of beta-lactamase positive subgingival bacterial species was carried out on blood agar plates supplemented with amoxicillin and plates with amoxicillin+clavulanic acid. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides forsythus and campylobacter rectus isolates from the non-selective medium were tested for beta-lactamase activity by a nitrocefin disk method (dryslide) and by a laboratory chromogenic nitrocefin-based test. isolates from the amoxicillin plates that were absent on the amoxicillin/clavulanic acid plates were identified and tested for beta-lactamase production. based on the non-selective plates, six  of 23 p. intermedia isolates, 2 of 19 b. forsythus isolates and 3 of 23 f. nucleatum isolates were beta-lactamase positive. the beta-lactamase positive species prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, prevotella buccalis and actinomyces spp were recovered from the selective amoxicillin plates. beta-lactamase positive subgingival species were recovered from 17 of 23 patients (74%) but usually comprised low proportions of the subgingival microbiota (range  < 0.01-15%). comparison of the dryslide test and the nitrocefin-based laboratory  test revealed full agreement of test results. beta-lactamase activity in whole subgingival plaque was detected in 12 patient samples (52%). it was concluded that beta-lactamase activity in subgingival bacteria in adult periodontitis is a  common feature. however, since the majority of the samples showed only low-level  enzymatic activity, the clinical relevance of this observation with regard to therapy with unprotected enzyme-susceptible beta-lactams is uncertain, though failure on the other hand, is difficult to rule out when a mechanism of resistance is present. the majority of beta-lactamase positive strains was found  among species of the prevotella genus.

TI  == cell envelope and cell wall immunization of macaca fascicularis: effect on the progression of ligature-induced periodontitis.
AB  == the nonhuman primate, macaca fascicularis, was used to study the role of immunization with selected members of the periodontopathic microbiota in the longitudinal progression of ligature-induced periodontitis. animals were immunized with cell envelope antigens prepared from porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia, and a mixture prepared from fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and actinomyces viscosus. serum immunoglobulin g (igg), igm and iga isotype antibodies increased significantly in all immunization groups and were specific for each of the immunogens. p. gingivalis and p. intermedia immunization resulted in a stabilization of the proportions of these species throughout most of the experiment. the high p. gingivalis antibody titer resulted in low p. gingivalis numbers being recovered. p. gingivalis immunization, while lowering recoverable viable p. gingivalis, resulted in significantly increased levels of prevotella loescheii, prevotella buccae, bacteroides macacae and prevotella melaninogenica compared with preligation and preimmunization levels. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp. and eikenella spp. remained at preligation levels postimmunization. campylobacter spp. increased significantly during the course of the experiment in all groups, whereas the levels of fusobacterium spp. decreased. plaque indices and bleeding on probing showed significant increases in all groups following ligation, with the placebo group showing the greatest increase. pocket depth measurements revealed that , whereas the placebo animals showed an approximate 5% increase, the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed nearly a 20% increase in pocket depth.  attachment level measurements showed significantly greater attachment loss in the p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups, and the f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus immunization appeared to prevent significant changes in pocket depth/attachment level loss. radiographic measurement of bone loss by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis revealed that the placebo group lost bone throughout the experiment. p. gingivalis- and p. intermedia-immunized groups showed an exacerbated loss of bone density and the group immunized with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus exhibited significantly lower amounts of bone loss when analyzed by computer-assisted densitometric image analysis, compared with the other immunized groups. although immunization with p. gingivalis and p.  intermedia cell envelope antigens had an effect on their emergence in the complex microbiota of the developing periodontal pocket, this immunization also resulted  in greater bone loss than immunization with f. nucleatum + c. rectus + a. viscosus, suggesting that, whereas selective members of the putative periodontopathic microbiota may play a direct role in periodontal tissue destruction, the complexity of the subgingival microbiota dictates that considerable scrutiny is required to select useful immunogens that can elicit functional protection from periodontal tissue destruction induced by oral microorganisms that already colonize or infect the host.

TI  == a retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the wadsworth anaerobic bacteriology clinical research laboratory (los angeles). anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. a total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. the most common isolates were as follows: fusobacterium nucleatum (19); prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were p. oris); bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were b. fragilis); pigmented prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were peptostreptococcus micros); eubacterium species (7); lactobacillus species (8); actinomyces species (7); and  clostridium species (7). nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: f. nucleatum (five cases); b. fragilis (two cases); and prevotella mangus (one case). of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group d nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. the susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of  these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (mics ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/ml vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/ml for beta-lactamase-negative strains).

TI  == human root caries: microbiota in plaque covering sound, carious and arrested carious root surfaces.
AB  == the plaque microbiota covering sound or carious root surfaces were studied and compared with that covering arrested root caries lesions. from each of these categories five extracted teeth were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed us to relate the qualitative and quantitative microbial composition to the degree of integrity of the root surface. plaque was sampled by a newly developed 'mowing' technique. plaque samples were cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci of the mutans group. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, api zym, and api 50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. regardless of the state of mineralization, the microbiota on all surfaces resembled marginal plaque associated with gingivitis. in addition to the gram-positive predominant facultative anaerobic genera streptococcus, staphylococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces, gram-negative anaerobes, predominantly bacteroides, prevotella, selenomonas, fusobacterium, leptotrichia,  and capnocytophaga, showed the highest isolation frequencies. on all surfaces actinomyces spp. predominated, with streptococci and lactobacilli forming a minor part of the microbiota. with respect to the detected proportions of anaerobes, microaerophiles, actinomyces naeslundii, prevotella buccae and selenomonas dianae, significant differences were observed between the three categories of root surfaces. the total cfu's on both caries-free and caries-active surfaces were significantly higher than on arrested lesions. in general, the results support a polymicrobial etiology for caries initiation on root surfaces, with a.  naeslundii, capnocytophaga spp., and prevotella spp. making specific contributions to the processes of cementum and dentin breakdown.

TI  == peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  == peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. on occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or  to the mediastinum. we describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess  that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, lactobacillus catenaforme, another lactobacillus species, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded p. intermedia and p. buccae plus p. anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group f streptococci, and citrobacter diversus. culture of  the retropharyngeal abscess yielded fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. the patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. this case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that  this infection may lead to.
