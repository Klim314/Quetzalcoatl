TI  == increased dietary zinc oxide changes the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the ileum of piglets.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of increased dietary zno on the bacterial core and enterobacterial composition in the small intestine of piglets that were fed diets containing a total of 124 or 3,042 mg of zn per kilogram of diet, respectively. zinc was supplemented to the basal diet as zno. bacterial 16s rrna genes of ileal dna extracts were pcr-amplified with 2 bar-coded primer sets and sequenced by 454 pyrosequencing. the bacterial core species were calculated from the relative abundances of reads present in 5 of 6 samples per group and at a minimum of 5 sequences per sample. the reference database silva was used to assign sequence reads at an alignment minimum of 200 bases and 100% identity. lactic acid bacteria dominated the bacterial core, but showed diverse responses to dietary zno. of the dominant lactobacillus spp., lactobacillus reuteri was reduced due to increased dietary zno (44.7 vs. 17.9%; p=0.042), but l. amylovorus was not influenced. however, the changes of relative  abundances of other lactic acid bacteria were more noteworthy; weissella cibaria  (10.7 vs. 23.0%; p=0.006), w. confusa (10.0 vs. 22.4%; p=0.037), leuconostoc citreum (6.5 vs. 14.8%; p=0.009), streptococcus equinus (0.14 vs. 1.0%; p=0.044), and s. lutetiensis (0.01 vs. 0.11%; p=0.016) increased in relative abundance. nonlactic acid bacteria that were influenced by increased dietary zno included the strict anaerobic species, sarcina ventriculi, which showed a strong numerical decrease in relative abundance (14.6 vs. 5.1%). species of the enterobacteriaceae increased their relative abundance, as well as species diversity, in the high dietary zno experimental group. bacterial diversity indices were increased due to increased dietary zno (p < 0.05), which was traced back to the increase of sequences from subdominant species. increased dietary zno led to an increase of less prominent species and, thus, had a major impact on the bacterial composition and diversity in piglets. this effect may help to stabilize the intestinal microbiota in the sensitive postweaning period.

TI  == biological and genetic classification of canine intestinal lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to investigate the distribution of lactic acid bacteria (lab) inhabiting canine intestines, a total of 374 gram-positive lab and bifidobacteria (bf) isolated from large intestinal contents in 36 dogs were classified and identified by phenotypic and genetic analyses. based on cell morphological sizes, these isolates were divided into seven biotypes containing the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, and streptococcus. the lab and bf isolates were classified into 38 chemotypes based on sds-page protein profile analysis of whole cells. furthermore, partial 16s rdna sequencing analysis demonstrated the presence of 24 bacterial species in the 38 chemotypes from 36 dogs. the identified species consisted of ten species belonging to the genus lactobacillus  (78.8%), seven species to the genus bifidobacterium (6.8%), five species to the genus enterococcus (11.6%), one species of streptococcus bovis (2.0%), and one species of pediococcus acidilactici (0.8%). in particular, the most predominant species in canine intestines were l. reuteri, l. animalis, and l. johnsonii and were found in the high frequency of occurrence of 77.8, 80.6, and 86.1%, respectively. besides these, enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, pediococcus acidilactici, and streptococcus bovis were also isolated in the present study. the sequences of the isolates also showed high levels of similarity to those of the reference strains registered previously in the ddbj and the similarity was above 97.2%. their partial 16s rrna genes were registered in the ddbj.

TI  == high prevalence of inducible erythromycin resistance among streptococcus bovis isolates in taiwan.
AB  == susceptibilities to 13 antimicrobial agents were determined by measurement of mics for 60 isolates of streptococcus bovis from blood cultures. thirty-eight isolates (63.3%) had high-level resistance to erythromycin (mics, >or=128 microg/ml). among the 38 erythromycin-resistant strains, 21 isolates (55%) had inducible resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (imls isolates) and 17 (45%) had constitutive resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (cmls isolates). tetracycline resistance was also found among all of the erythromycin-resistant strains. none of the strains displayed resistance to penicillin, chloramphenicol, or vancomycin. detection of erythromycin resistance  genes by pcr and sequencing indicated that all 17 cmls isolates were positive for the ermb gene and that 7 of 21 imls isolates carried the ermb gene and the remaining 14 imls isolates carried the ermt gene. sequence analysis of amplified  partial ermb fragments (594 bp) from s. bovis isolates revealed a 99.8% nucleotide identity and a 100% amino acid homology compared with the sequences from gene banks. the sequences of amplified fragments with primers targeted for ermc were shown to be very similar to that of ermgt (ermt) from lactobacillus reuteri (98.5% nucleotide identity). this is the first report to describe the detection of the ermt class of erythromycin resistance determinants in s. bovis.  the high rate of inducible erythromycin resistance among s. bovis isolates in taiwan was not reported before. the imls s. bovis isolates were shown to be heterogeneous by randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis. these results indicate that the prevalence of inducible erythromycin resistance in s. bovis in  taiwan is very high and that most of the resistant strains carry the ermt or the  ermb gene.
