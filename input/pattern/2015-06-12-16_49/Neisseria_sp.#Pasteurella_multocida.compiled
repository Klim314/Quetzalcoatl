TI  - Aldolase-catalyzed synthesis of beta-D-galp-(1-->9)-D-KDN: a novel acceptor for sialyltransferases.
AB  - [reaction: see text] beta-D-Galp-(1-->9)-D-KDN, a disaccharide component of the cell wall of Streptomyces sp. MB-8, was synthesized from beta-D-Galp-(1-->6)-D-Manp and pyruvate using a sialic acid aldolase. The obtained KDN-containing compound was a novel acceptor for bacterial sialyltransferases. Unusual alpha2,3- and alpha2,6-linked sialyltrisaccharides and a tetrasaccharide were synthesized using a one-pot two-enzyme system containing a Neisseria meningitidis CMP-sialic acid synthetase and a Pasteurella multocida sialyltransferase or a Photobacterium damsela alpha2,6-sialyltransferase.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibility of Pasteurella and related bacteria to five orally administered antibiotics].
AB  - Tetracyclines and beta-lactam antibiotics are usually recommended for the treatment of pasteurellosis following bite wounds. However other oral antimicrobial agents could be proposed. In vitro susceptibility of 94 Pasteurella strains [P. multocida (79), P. stomatis (11), P. dagmatis (2), P. canis (1), P. "SP" (1)], 20 group EF-4 strains and 28 Neisseria weaveri strains (formerly group M-5), that are bacteria often isolated after animal-inflicted wounds, was studied towards five antibiotics: clarithromycin, azithromycin, pristinamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. MICs were determined by the agar dilution method using HTM medium (Oxoid), and for pristinamycin using both HTM and Mueller-Hinton agar supplemented with 5% horse blood (BMH). Most of Pasteurella isolates showed intermediate susceptibility to clarithromycin (63%) and to azithromycin (90.5%) with lower MICs for azithromycin. Fourty-two and thirty-two percent of Pasteurella strains were susceptible to pristinamycin respectively on HTM and on BMH. EF-4 and N. weaveri were more sensitive than Pasteurella to macrolides and to pristinamycin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was active against all isolates, with higher MICs for EF-4 and N. weaveri. On all strains tested, the lowest MICs were observed for ciprofloxacin. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin could be proposed as a therapeutic alternative in case of pasteurellosis following animal bites.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial flora of oral and nasal fluids of canines with reference to bacteria associated with bites.
AB  - Oral and nasal fluids of 50 dogs were examined to determine the prevalence of aerobic bacteria frequently associated with animal bite wounds. The most frequently isolated microorganisms included: IIj, EF-4, Pasteurella multocida, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, group D streptococci, Corynebacterium sp., Enterobacteria, Neisseria sp., Moraxella sp., and Bacillus sp. Other species and genera were infrequently recovered and may represent transient flora. The high incidence of IIj, EF-4, P. multocida, and S. aureus, all known human pathogens, suggests that they should be considered as probably contaminants in bite wounds.
