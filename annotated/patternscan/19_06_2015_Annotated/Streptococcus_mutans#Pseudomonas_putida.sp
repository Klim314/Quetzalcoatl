TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == survival rate of microbes after freeze-drying and long-term storage.
AB  == the survival rates of 10 species of microorganisms were investigated after freeze-drying and preserving in a vacuum at 5 degrees c. the survival rates varied with species. the survival rates immediately after freeze-drying were different among yeast, gram-positive bacteria, and gram-negative bacteria, and the change in the 10-year survival rate was species-specific. the survival rate of yeast, saccharomyces cerevisiae, was about 10% immediately after drying, and the rate did not decrease significantly during the 10-year storage period. survival rates after the drying of gram-positive bacteria, i.e., brevibacterium flavum, b. lactofermentum, corynebacterium acetoacidophilum, c. gultamicum, and streptococcus mutans, were around 80%. the survival rate of brevibacterium and corynebacterium did not decrease greatly during the storage period, whereas the rate of s. mutans decreased to about 20% after 10 years. survival rates after the drying of gram-negative bacteria, i.e., escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, serratia marcescens, and alcaligenes faecalis, were around 50%. the survival rate decreased for the first 5 years and then stabilized to around 10% thereafter.
