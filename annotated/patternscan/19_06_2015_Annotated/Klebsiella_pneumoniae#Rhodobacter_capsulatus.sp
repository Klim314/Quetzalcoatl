TI  == yeast two-hybrid studies on interaction of proteins involved in regulation of nitrogen fixation in the phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus contains two pii-like proteins, glnb and glnk, which play  central roles in controlling the synthesis and activity of nitrogenase in response to ammonium availability. here we used the yeast two-hybrid system to probe interactions between these pii-like proteins and proteins known to be involved in regulating nitrogen fixation. analysis of defined protein pairs demonstrated the following interactions: glnb-ntrb, glnb-nifa1, glnb-nifa2, glnb-drat, glnk-nifa1, glnk-nifa2, and glnk-drat. these results corroborate earlier genetic data and in addition show that pii-dependent ammonium regulation  of nitrogen fixation in r. capsulatus does not require additional proteins, like  nifl in klebsiella pneumoniae. in addition, we found interactions for the protein pairs glnb-glnb, glnb-glnk, nifa1-nifa1, nifa2-nifa2, and nifa1-nifa2, suggesting that fine tuning of the nitrogen fixation process in r. capsulatus may involve the formation of glnb-glnk heterotrimers as well as nifa1-nifa2 heterodimers. in  order to identify new proteins that interact with glnb and glnk, we constructed an r. capsulatus genomic library for use in yeast two-hybrid studies. screening of this library identified the atp-dependent helicase pcra as a new putative protein that interacts with glnb and the ras-like protein era as a new protein that interacts with glnk.

TI  == rhodobacter capsulatus nifa mutants mediating nif gene expression in the presence of ammonium.
AB  == expression of nitrogen fixation genes in rhodobacter capsulatus is repressed by ammonium at different regulatory levels including an ntrc-independent mechanism controlling nifa activity. in contrast to r. capsulatus nifa, heterologous nifa proteins of klebsiella pneumoniae and rhizobium meliloti, respectively, were not  subjected to this posttranslational ammonium control in r. capsulatus. the characterization of ammonium-tolerant r. capsulatus nifa1 mutants indicated that  the n-terminal domain of nifa was involved in posttranslational regulation. analysis of a double mutant carrying amino acid substitutions in both the n-terminal domain and the c-terminal dna-binding domain gave rise to the hypothesis that an interaction between these two domains might be involved in ammonium regulation of nifa activity. western analysis demonstrated that both constitutively expressed wild-type and ammonium-tolerant nifa1 proteins exhibited high stability and accumulated to comparable levels in cells grown in the presence of ammonium excluding the possibility that proteolytic degradation was responsible for ammonium-dependent inactivation of nifa.

TI  == identification and characterization of a two-component sensor-kinase and response-regulator system (dcus-dcur) controlling gene expression in response to  c4-dicarboxylates in escherichia coli.
AB  == the dcub gene of escherichia coli encodes an anaerobic c4-dicarboxylate transporter that is induced anaerobically by fnr, activated by the cyclic amp receptor protein, and repressed in the presence of nitrate by narl. in addition,  dcub expression is strongly induced by c4-dicarboxylates, suggesting the presence of a novel c4-dicarboxylate-responsive regulator in e. coli. this paper describes the isolation of a tn10 mutant in which the 160-fold induction of dcub expression by c4-dicarboxylates is absent. the corresponding tn10 mutation resides in the yjdh gene, which is adjacent to the yjdg gene and close to the dcub gene at approximately 93.5 min in the e. coli chromosome. the yjdhg genes (redesignated dcusr) appear to constitute an operon encoding a two-component sensor-regulator system (dcus-dcur). a plasmid carrying the dcusr operon restored the c4-dicarboxylate inducibility of dcub expression in the dcus mutant to levels exceeding those of the dcus+ strain by approximately 1.8-fold. the dcus mutation  affected the expression of other genes with roles in c4-dicarboxylate transport or metabolism. expression of the fumarate reductase (frdabcd) operon and the aerobic c4-dicarboxylate transporter (dcta) gene were induced 22- and 4-fold, respectively, by the dcus-dcur system in the presence of c4-dicarboxylates. surprisingly, anaerobic fumarate respiratory growth of the dcus mutant was normal. however, under aerobic conditions with c4-dicarboxylates as sole carbon sources, the mutant exhibited a growth defect resembling that of a dcta mutant. studies employing a dcua dcub dcuc triple mutant unable to transport c4-dicarboxylates anaerobically revealed that c4-dicarboxylate transport is not required for c4-dicarboxylate-responsive gene regulation. this suggests that the  dcus-dcur system responds to external substrates. accordingly, topology studies using 14 dcus-blam fusions showed that dcus contains two putative transmembrane helices flanking a approximately 140-residue n-terminal domain apparently located in the periplasm. this topology strongly suggests that the periplasmic loop of dcus serves as a c4-dicarboxylate sensor. the cytosolic region of dcus (residues  203 to 543) contains two domains: a central pas domain possibly acting as a second sensory domain and a c-terminal transmitter domain. database searches showed that dcus and dcur are closely related to a subgroup of two-component sensor-regulators that includes the citrate-responsive cita-citb system of klebsiella pneumoniae. dcus is not closely related to the c4-dicarboxylate-sensing dcts or dctb protein of rhodobacter capsulatus or rhizobial species, respectively. although all three proteins have similar topologies and functions, and all are members of the two-component sensor-kinase  family, their periplasmic domains appear to have evolved independently.

TI  == molybdate transport and regulation in bacteria.
AB  == molybdate is transported in bacteria by a high-affinity transport system composed of a periplasmic binding protein, an integral membrane protein, and an energizer  protein. these three proteins are coded by moda, modb, and modc genes, respectively. the moda, modb, and modc proteins from various organisms (escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, azotobacter vinelandii, and rhodobacter capsulatus) are very similar. the lowest km value reported for molybdate in the molybdate transport process is approximately 50 nm. in a mod mutant, molybdate is transported by the sulfate transport system or by a nonspecific anion transporter. molybdate transport is tightly coupled to utilization in e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, while other dinitrogen-fixing organisms appear to have a molybdenum storage protein. in all organisms studied so far, molybdate transport genes are regulated by a repressor protein, mode. the mode-molybdate complex binds to the sequences tayat (y = t or c) in the operator/ promoter region in e. coli and prevents transcription of the modabcd operon. the  mode-molybdate complex binds to dna as a homodimer in e. coli and possibly in other organisms as well. in r. capsulatus, however, two mode homologues (mopab proteins) are required for repression.

TI  == comparative in-vivo and in-vitro 99mo-time-differential-perturbed-angular-correlation studies on the nitrogenase mofe protein and on other mo species of different n2-fixing bacteria.
AB  == klebsiella pneumoniae, azotobacter vinelandii and rhodobacter capsulatus were cultivated in media containing 99moo4(2-) . the distribution of 99mo in cells grown under conditions of repression and derepression of nitrogenase synthesis, was investigated by anion-exchange (deae-sephacel) chromatography. cells of k. pneumoniae took up moo4(2-) only under conditions of derepression of nitrogenase  thus serving the formation of the femo cofactor of the mofe protein (kp1) as the  predominant mo-containing species. in the case of a. vinelandii, under diazotrophic growth conditions, molybdenum was preferably incorporated into the nitrogenase mofe protein (av1). however, if excess amounts of molybdate were present in the medium, molybdenum was also bound to the mo-storage protein. in the presence of 20 mm nh4+, conditions which completely repress nitrogenase formation, molybdenum accumulated in the mo-storage protein exclusively. this protein proved to be unstable towards deae-sephacel, apparently releasing all the molybdenum in form of moo4(2-) during the fractionation procedure. r. capsulatus  contained, in addition to the mofe protein (rc1), significant amounts of other not-yet-identified mo species, which partially are formed under conditions of both, repression and derepression of nitrogenase. the mo centers of all these compounds were characterized by measuring the nuclear quadrupole interaction of the process 99mo(beta-)99tc using time differential perturbed angular correlation spectroscopy. the quadrupole coupling constant (v(q)) determined for the mo center in mofe proteins was consistently in the range 66-81 mhz. the values of the coupling constants determined with intact cells and with the isolated, partially purified, mofe proteins were in very good agreement. for the mo-storage protein of a. vinelandii, a quadrupole coupling constant of approximately 180 mhz was determined by measurements performed with nitrogenase-repressed cells as well as with gel-filtered cell-free extracts. our work proves that the relevant study  of hyperfine interactions allows the identification of the mofe protein and also  other mo proteins in vivo as well as in vitro.

TI  == purification and activities of the rhodobacter capsulatus rpon (sigma n) protein.
AB  == the rpon-encoded sigma factors (sigma n) are a distinct class of bacterial sigma  factors, with no obvious homology to the major sigma 70 class. the sigma n-containing rna polymerase holoenzyme functions in enhancer-dependent transcription to allow expression of positively controlled genes. we have purified the rhodobacter capsulatus sigma n protein, which is distinctive in lacking an acidic region implicated in the melting of promoter dna by the escherichia coll sigma n holoenzyme, and may represent a minor subclass of sigma  n proteins. assays of promoter recognition and holoenzyme formation and function  showed that the purified r. capsulatus sigma n protein is distinct in activity compared to the enteric proteins, but retains the broad functions described for these proteins. as first described for the klebsiella pneumoniae protein, promoter recognition in the absence of core rna polymerase was detected, but contact of certain promoter bases by the r. capsulatus sigma n protein and its response to core rna polymerase was clearly different from that determined for the k. pneumoniae and e. coli proteins. results are discussed in the context of a requirement to modulate the activity of the dna-binding surfaces of sigma n to regulate sigma n function. circular dichroism was used to evaluate the structure  of the r. capsulatus protein and revealed differences in the tertiary signals as  compared to the k. pneumoniae protein, some of which are attributable to the dna-binding domain of sigma n.

TI  == cloning, characterization, and regulation of niff from rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the rhodobacter capsulatus niff gene and upstream sequence were cloned by using a probe based on the n-terminal sequence of niff. niff was found to not be contained in the previously described nif regions i, ii, and iii. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence showed that it is highly similar to niff from azotobacter vinelandii and niff from klebsiella pneumoniae. analysis of translational fusions demonstrated that the regulation of transcription was the same as previously reported at the protein level. insertional mutagen esis showed that niff contributes significantly to nitrogenase activity under normal nitrogen-fixing conditions and that it is absolutely required for nitrogen fixation under iron limitation.

TI  == purification and properties of a nif-specific flavodoxin from the photosynthetic  bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == a flavodoxin was isolated from iron-sufficient, nitrogen-limited cultures of the  photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus. its molecular properties, molecular weight, uv-visible absorption spectrum, and amino acid composition suggest that it is similar to the nif-specific flavodoxin, niff, of klebsiella pneumoniae. the results of immunoblotting showed that r. capsulatus flavodoxin is nif specific, since it is absent from ammonia-replete cultures and is not synthesized by the mutant strain j61, which lacks a nif-specific regulator (nifr1). growth of cultures under iron-deficient conditions causes a small amount of flavodoxin to be synthesized under ammonia-replete conditions and increases its synthesis under n2-fixing conditions, suggesting that its synthesis is under  a dual system of control with respect to iron and fixed nitrogen availability. here we show that flavodoxin, when supplemented with catalytic amounts of methyl  viologen, is capable of efficiently reducing nitrogenase in an illuminated chloroplast system. thus, this nif-specific flavodoxin is a potential in vivo electron carrier to nitrogenase; however, its role in the nitrogen fixation process remains to be established.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and genetic analysis of the rhodobacter capsulatus orf6-nifui svw gene region: possible role of nifw in homocitrate processing.
AB  == dna sequence analysis of a 3494-bp hindiii-bcli fragment of the rhodobacter capsulatus nif region a revealed genes that are homologous to orf6, nifu, nifs, nifv and nifw from azotobacter vinelandii and klebsiella pneumoniae. r. capsulatus nifu, which is present in two copies, encodes a novel type of nifu protein. the deduced amino acid sequences of nifui and nifuii share homology only with the c-terminal domain of nifu from a. vinelandii and k. pneumoniae. in contrast to nifa and nifb, which are almost perfectly duplicated, the predicted amino acid sequences of the two nifu proteins showed only 39% sequence identity.  expression of the orf6-nifuisvw operon, which is preceded by a putative sigma 54-dependent promoter, required the function of nifa and the nif-specific rpon gene product encoded by nifr4. analysis of defined insertion and deletion mutants demonstrated that only nifs was absolutely essential for nitrogen fixation in r.  capsulatus. strains carrying mutations in nifv were capable of very slow diazotrophic growth, whereas orf6, nifui and nifw mutants as well as a nifui/nifuii double mutant exhibited a nif+ phenotype. interestingly, r. capsulatus nifv mutants were able to reduce acetylene not only to ethylene but also to ethane under conditions preventing the expression of the alternative nitrogenase system. homocitrate added to the growth medium repressed ethane formation and cured the nifv phenotype in r. capsulatus. higher concentrations of homocitrate were necessary to complement the nifv phenotype of a polar nifv mutant (nifv-nifw-), indicating a possible role of nifw either in homocitrate transport or in the incorporation of this compound into the iron-molybdenum cofactor of nitrogenase.

TI  == purification and characterization of a catalase-peroxidase from the fungus septoria tritici.
AB  == three classes of heme proteins, commonly designated hydroperoxidases, are involved in the metabolism of hydrogen peroxide: catalases, peroxidases, and catalase-peroxidases. while catalases and peroxidases are widely spread in animals, plants, and microorganisms, catalase-peroxidases were characterized only in prokaryotes. we report here, for the first time, on a catalase-peroxidase in a eukaryotic organism. the enzyme was purified from the fungal wheat pathogen septoria tritici, and is one of three different hydroperoxidases synthesized by this organism. the s. tritici catalase-peroxidase, designated stcp, is similar to the enzymes previously isolated from the bacteria rhodobacter capsulatus, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae, although it is significantly more sensitive to denaturing conditions. in addition to its catalatic activity stcp catalyzes peroxidatic activity with o-dianisidine, diaminobenzidine, pyrogallol,  nadh, and nadph as electron donors. the enzyme is a tetramer with identical subunits of 61,000 da molecular weight. stcp shows a typical high-spin ferric heme spectrum with a soret band at 405 nm and a peak at 632 nm, and binding of cyanide causes a shift of the soret band to 421 nm, the appearance of a peak at 537 nm, and abolition of the peak at 632 nm. reduction with dithionite results in a decrease in the intensity of the soret band and its shift to 436 nm, and in the appearance of a peak at 552 nm. the ph optimum is 6-6.5 and 5.4 for the catalatic and peroxidatic activities, respectively. fifty percent of the apparent maximal activity is reached at 3.4 mm and 0.26 mm for the catalatic and peroxidatic activities, respectively. the enzyme is inactivated by ethanol/chloroform, and is inhibited by kcn and nan3, but not by the typical catalase inhibitor 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole.

TI  == mapping and characterization of the promoter elements of the regulatory nif genes rpon, nifa1 and nifa2 in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == the promoter elements responsible for the expression of the regulatory nif genes  rpon, nifa1 and nifa2 of rhodobacter capsulatus were mapped by exonuclease-iii-mediated deletions and by primer extension analysis. the rpon promoter maps 600 bp upstream of rpon and has the characteristic features of a -24/-12 promoter. the upstream activator sequence (uas) displays two mismatches with the nifa consensus sequence and is located 37 bp upstream of a perfect -24/-12 promoter element. the spacing and/or the helical phasing of these two promotor elements was found to be important for promoter function. in addition, an uas half-site may contribute to optimal promoter function. the rpon uas can partially substitute for the uas of the nife promoter. an open reading frame with homology to klebsiella pneumoniae nifu was identified between the rpon promoter and rpon and termed nifu2 since another nifu-like gene (nifu1) is located in a conventional nifusvw operon in nif region a. thus, rpon, encoding an alternative  sigma factor for rna polymerase, is cotranscribed with a nifu analogous gene from an rpon-dependent promoter. mapping of the promoter elements involved in the expression of nifa copy 1 and copy 2 identified a novel promoter type. a conserved distal promoter element is likely to represent the binding site of ntrc in r. capsulatus. the dna region preceding the mapped 5' ends of the nifa transcripts displays much less homology. the distance between the distal and proximal elements is about 100 bp.

TI  == expression of regulatory nif genes in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == translational fusions of the escherichia coli lacz gene to rhodobacter capsulatus nif genes were constructed in order to determine the regulatory circuit of nif gene expression in r. capsulatus, a free-living photosynthetic diazotroph. the expression of nifh, nifa (copies i and ii), and nifr4 was measured in different regulatory mutant strains under different physiological conditions. the expression of nifh and nifr4 (the analog of ntra in klebsiella pneumoniae) depends on the nifr1/r2 system (the analog of the ntr system in k. pneumoniae), on nifa, and on nifr4. the expression of both copies of nifa is regulated by the  nifr1/r2 system and is modulated by the n source of the medium under anaerobic photosynthetic growth conditions. in the presence of ammonia or oxygen, moderate  expression of nifa was detectable, whereas nifh and nifr4 were not expressed under these conditions. the implications for the regulatory circuit of nif gene expression in r. capsulatus are discussed and compared with the situation in k. pneumoniae, another free-living diazotroph.

TI  == selective removal of molybdenum traces from growth media of n2-fixing bacteria.
AB  == a new method for the selective removal of traces of molybdenum from growth media  of n2-fixing bacteria (rhodobacter capsulatus and klebsiella pneumoniae) was developed. this method is based on the filtration of nutrient solutions through a layer of activated carbon (pulverized charcoal). the adsorption of mo (molybdate) to activated carbon was optimal if a charcoal suspension (50 g/liter) was degassed by boiling before use and if the ph of the solutions, which had to be purified, was adjusted to values between 1.5 and 4. in this ph region no or only  negligible amounts of other metal ions were adsorbed. the activated carbon method was compared with other mo-eliminating procedures, including 8-hydroxyquinoline/dichloromethane extraction, chelex 100 chromatography, and treatment with mo-starved azotobacter vinelandii cells. the activated carbon filtration appeared to be the most effective, specific, and rapid method. whereas the untreated rhodobacter growth medium was contaminated with 1.2 ppb mo, as analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icp-ms), the activated  carbon-treated medium was below the icp-ms detection limit (less than 0.05 ppb).  a similarly effective removal of mo impurities was obtained by the azotobacter treatment. even at low optical densities (2-5 at 436 nm) mo traces were removed very rapidly within 10-15 min. however, because the mo uptake/mo adsorption capacity of a. vinelandii depended on freshly cultivated cells and on the growth  phase at which the cells were harvested, this microbiological method was generally more time-consuming and less reproducible than the activated carbon method.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the fixabc region of azorhizobium caulinodans ors571: similarity of the fixb product with eukaryotic flavoproteins, characterization of fixx, and identification of nifw.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 4.1 kb dna fragment containing the fixabc region of  azorhizobium caulinodans was established. the three gene products were very similar to the corresponding polypeptides of rhizobium meliloti. the c-terminal domains of both fixb products displayed a high degree of similarity with the alpha-subunits of rat and human electron transfer flavoproteins, suggesting a role for the fixb protein in a redox reaction. two open reading frames (orf) were found downstream of fixc. the first orf was identified as fixx on the basis of sequence homology with fixx from several rhizobium and bradyrhizobium strains. the second orf potentially encoded a 69 amino acid product and was found to be homologous to a dna region in the rhodobacter capsulatus nif cluster i. insertion mutagenesis of the a. caulinodans fixx gene conferred a nif- phenotype to bacteria growth in the free-living state and a fix- phenotype in symbiotic association with the host plant sesbania rostrata. a crude extract from the fixx  mutant had no nitrogenase activity. furthermore, data presented in this paper also indicate that the previously identified nifo gene located upstream of fixa was probably a homologue of the nifw gene of klebsiella pneumoniae and azotobacter vinelandii.

TI  == transcriptional regulatory cascade of nitrogen-fixation genes in anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria: oxygen- and nitrogen-responsive factors.
AB  == many photosynthetic bacteria from aquatic and terrestrial habitats reduce atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia. the synthesis of proteins required for nitrogen fixation in these microorganisms is repressed by fixed nitrogen or oxygen. studies on the purple non-sulphur phototroph rhodobacter capsulatus have  helped to clarify this transcriptional control and to define the factors involved in this regulation. the molecular mechanisms by which the nitrogen and oxygen status of the cell are relayed into nif gene expression or repression involve many trans- and cis-acting factors. the roles of these factors in the nif regulatory cascade of r. capsulatus are summarized. two levels of control are present. the first level of control involves the nitrogen sensing circuitry in which at least four proteins act in a cascade. upon nitrogen deficiency, genes involved in the second level of control are transcriptionally activated. these genes encode regulatory proteins that subsequently activate transcription of all  other nif genes under anaerobic conditions. the r. capsulatus cascade is compared to the nif regulatory cascade in klebsiella pneumoniae, highlighting both common  and unique aspects.

TI  == open reading frame 5 (orf5), encoding a ferredoxinlike protein, and nifq are cotranscribed with nife, nifn, nifx, and orf4 in rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == dna sequence analysis of a 1,600-base-pair fragment located downstream of nifenx  in nif region a of rhodobacter capsulatus revealed two additional open reading frames (orfs): orf5, encoding a ferredoxinlike protein, and nifq. the ferredoxinlike gene product contained two cysteine motifs, typical of ferredoxins coordinating two 4fe-4s clusters, but the distance between these two motifs was unusual for low-molecular-weight ferredoxins. the r. capsulatus nifq gene product shared a high degree of homology with klebsiella pneumoniae and azotobacter vinelandii nifq, including a typical cysteine motif located in the c-terminal part. nifq insertion mutants and also an orf5-nifq double deletion mutant showed  normal diazotrophic growth only in the presence of high concentrations of molybdate. this demonstrated that the gene encoding the ferredoxinlike protein is not essential for nitrogen fixation. no nifa-activated consensus promoter could be found in the intergenic region between nifenx-orf4 and orf5-nifq. analyses of  a nifq-laczya fusion revealed that transcription of nifq was initiated at a promoter in front of nife. in contrast to other nitrogen-fixing organisms, r. capsulatus nife, nifn, nifx, orf4, orf5, and nifq were organized in one transcriptional unit.

AB  == rhodobacter capsulatus genes homologous to klebsiella pneumoniae nife, nifn and nifx were identified by dna sequence analysis of a 4282 bp fragment of nif region a. four open reading frames coding for a 51,188 (nife), a 49,459 (nifn), a 17,459 (nifx) and a 17,472 (orf4) dalton protein were detected. a typical nifa activated consensus promoter and two imperfect putative nifa binding sites were located in  the 377 bp sequence in front of the nife coding region. comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of r. capsulatus nife and nifn revealed homologies not only  to analogous gene products of other organisms but also to the alpha and beta subunits of the nitrogenase iron-molybdenum protein. in addition, the r. capsulatus nife and nifn proteins shared considerable homology with each other. the map position of nifx downstream of nifen corresponded in r. capsulatus and k. pneumoniae and the deduced molecular weights of both proteins were nearly identical. nevertheless, r. capsulatus nifx was more related to the c-terminal end of nify from k. pneumoniae than to nifx. a small domain of approximately 33 amino acid residues showing the highest degree of homology between nify and nifx  was also present in all nifb proteins analyzed so far. this homology indicated an evolutionary relationship of nifx, nify and nifb and also suggested that nifx and nify might play a role in maturation and/or stability of the iron-molybdenum cofactor. the open reading frame (orf4) downstream of nifx in r. capsulatus is also present in azotobacter vinelandii but not in k. pneumoniae.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the dna sequence of the rhodobacter capsulatus ntra, ntrb and ntrc gene analogues required for nitrogen fixation.

TI  == genetic characterization and sequence analysis of the duplicated nifa/nifb gene region of rhodobacter capsulatus.
AB  == a dna region showing homology to klebsiella pneumoniae nifa and nifb is duplicated in rhodobacter capsulatus. the two copies of this region are called nifa/nifb copy i and nifa/nifb copy ii. deletion mutagenesis demonstrated that either of the two copies is sufficient for growth in nitrogen-free medium. in contrast, a double deletion mutant turned out to be deficient in nitrogen fixation. the complete nucleotide sequence of a 4838 bp fragment containing nifa/nifb copy i was determined. two open reading frames coding for a 59,653 (nifa) and a 49,453 (nifb) dalton protein could be detected. comparison of the amino acid sequences revealed that the r. capsulatus nifa and nifb gene products  are more closely related to the nifa and nifb proteins of rhizobium meliloti and  rhizobium leguminosarum than to those of k. pneumoniae. a rho-independent termination signal and a typical nif promoter region containing a putative nifa binding site and a consensus nif promoter are located within the region between the r. capsulatus nifa and nifb genes. the nifb sequence is followed by an open reading frame (orf1) coding for a 27721 dalton protein in nifa/nifb copy i. dna sequence analysis of nifa/nifb copy ii showed that both copies differ in the dna  region downstream of nifb and in the noncoding sequence in front of nifa. all other regions compared, i.e. the 5' part of nifa, the intergenic region and the 3' part of nifb, are identical in both copies.

AB  == in vivo genetic engineering by r' plasmid formation was used to isolate an escherichia coli gene that restored the ntr+ phenotype to ntr- mutants of the photosynthetic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus (formerly rhodopseudomonas capsulata; j. f. imhoff, h. g. truper, and n. pfenning, int. j. syst. bacteriol.  34:340-343, 1984). nucleotide sequencing of the gene revealed no homology to the  ntr genes of klebsiella pneumoniae. furthermore, hybridization experiments between the cloned gene and different f' plasmids indicated that the gene is located between 34 and 39 min on the e. coli genetic map and is therefore unlinked to the known ntr genes. the molecular weight of the gene product, deduced from the nucleotide sequence, was 30,563. after the gene was cloned in an expression vector, the gene product was purified. it was shown to have a pi of 5.8 and to behave as a dimer during gel filtration and on sucrose density gradients. antibodies raised against the purified protein revealed the presence of this protein in r. capsulatus strains containing the e. coli gene, but not in  other strains. moreover, elimination of the plasmid carrying the e. coli gene from complemented strains resulted in the loss of the ntr+ phenotype. complementation of the r. capsulatus mutations by the e. coli gene therefore occurs in trans and results from the synthesis of a functional gene product.

TI  == organization and regulation of nitrogen fixation genes of rhodopseudomonas capsulata.
AB  == the nitrogen fixation (nif) genes of rhodopseudomonas capsulata appear to be much more widely dispersed than those of the well-studied klebsiella pneumoniae. in both organisms the genes coding for the structural components of the nitrogenase  complex, nifhdk, comprise a single unit of transcription. only in the photosynthetic bacterium, however, are there multiple copies of these genes. the  extra copies are normally silent but they can be activated by mutation, detected  as nif+ pseudorevertants of nif- deletions of the expressed nifhdk genes. glutamine is required for the repression of nif gene transcription in r. capsulata.
