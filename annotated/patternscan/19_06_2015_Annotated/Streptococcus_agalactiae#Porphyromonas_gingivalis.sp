TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == the changing faces of streptococcus antigen i/ii polypeptide family adhesins.
AB  == streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii (agi/ii) protein was one of the first cell wall-anchored adhesins identified in gram-positive bacteria. it mediates attachment of s. mutans to tooth surfaces and has been a focus for immunization studies against dental caries. the agi/ii family polypeptides recognize salivary  glycoproteins, and are also involved in biofilm formation, platelet aggregation,  tissue invasion and immune modulation. the genes encoding agi/ii family polypeptides are found among streptococcus species indigenous to the human mouth, as well as in streptococcus pyogenes, s. agalactiae and s. suis. evidence of functionalities for different regions of the agi/ii proteins has emerged. a sequence motif within the c-terminal portion of streptococcus gordonii sspb (agi/ii) is bound by porphyromonas gingivalis, thus promoting oral colonization by this anaerobic pathogen. the significance of other epitopes is now clearer following resolution of regional crystal structures. a new picture emerges of the central v (variable) region, predicted to contain a carbohydrate-binding trench,  being projected from the cell surface by a stalk formed by an unusual association between an n-terminal alpha-helix and a c-terminal polyproline helix. this presentation mode might be important in determining functional conformations of other gram-positive surface proteins that have adhesin domains flanked by alpha-helical and proline-rich regions.
