TI  == in vitro evaluation of g1: a novel antimicrobial compound.
AB  == g1 (1-[5-bromofur-2-il]-2-bromo-2-nitroethene) is a novel antimicrobial compound  developed in cuba with reported broadspectrum activity against gram-positive and  -negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi. a compound of this nature may have considerable therapeutic potential. we tested the in vitro activity of this novel compound against 3595 organisms using microbroth dilution. the following are mic50, mic90 and range respectively for some of the microorganisms tested: e. coli 16, 16, 4 32; klebsiella sp. 16, 16, 8 32; citrobacter sp. 16, 16, 8 16; enterobacter sp. 16, 16, 8-16; proteus sp. 16, 16, 8-16; coagulase-negative staphylococci 16, 32, 4-32; enterococcus sp. 16, 32, 2-32; staphylococcus aureus  8, 16, 4-16; streptococcus agalactiae 4, 8, 4 8; streptococcus pyogenes 4, 8, 0.25-16; candida albicans 2, 2, 1-4; candida tropicalis 4, 4, 2-4; candida sp. 2,4, 1-4. mic values appear lower for gram-positive microorganisms and yeasts. g1 appears to be a novel antimicrobial agent with broad spectrum activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens. defining the activity of this compound against multi-resistant bacteria is a priority.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. a study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). reported by the research group for testing ofloxacin susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == [antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the yokohama city university hospital].
AB  == minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the  standard method of the japanese congress of chemotherapy. the results obtained are summarized below. cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against enterococcus sp., b. fragilis and s. marcescens. s. pneumoniae, s. agalactiae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against citrobacter sp. and e. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against h. influenzae and indole positive proteus group. cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against p. aeruginosa. resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among staphylococcus sp., while the mics of other antibiotics against staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing  because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.

TI  == in vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  == norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. we examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including  anaerobic species. it inhibited 90% (mic90) of strains of escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, salmonella and shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. the mics of proteus mirabilis, morganella sp., proteus vulgaris, proteus rettgeri, and providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic90 of serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. for pseudomonas aeruginosa the mic50, the mic75, and the mic90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. the mic50 of pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the mic90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. yersinia, arizona, and aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was campylobacter. the activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the mic90s of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. all listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. the activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, ph, or inoculum size. there was no major difference between mic and minimum bactericidal concentration values. norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
