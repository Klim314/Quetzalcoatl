TI  - Characterization of N-linked protein glycosylation in Helicobacter pullorum.
AB  - The first bacterial N-linked glycosylation system was discovered in Campylobacter jejuni, and the key enzyme involved in the coupling of glycan to asparagine residues within the acceptor sequon of the glycoprotein is the oligosaccharyltransferase PglB. Emerging genome sequence data have revealed that pglB orthologues are present in a subset of species from the Deltaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria, including three Helicobacter species: H. pullorum, H. canadensis, and H. winghamensis. In contrast to C. jejuni, in which a single pglB gene is located within a larger gene cluster encoding the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the N-linked glycan, these Helicobacter species contain two unrelated pglB genes (pglB1 and pglB2), neither of which is located within a larger locus involved in protein glycosylation. In complementation experiments, the H. pullorum PglB1 protein, but not PglB2, was able to transfer C. jejuni N-linked glycan onto an acceptor protein in Escherichia coli. Analysis of the characterized C. jejuni N-glycosylation system with an in vitro oligosaccharyltransferase assay followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry demonstrated the utility of this approach, and when applied to H. pullorum, PglB1-dependent N glycosylation with a linear pentasaccharide was observed. This reaction required an acidic residue at the -2 position of the N-glycosylation sequon, as for C. jejuni. Attempted insertional knockout mutagenesis of the H. pullorum pglB2 gene was unsuccessful, suggesting that it is essential. These first data on N-linked glycosylation in a second bacterial species demonstrate the similarities to, and fundamental differences from, the well-studied C. jejuni system.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of the gyrA gene of Helicobacter pullorum and identification of a point mutation leading to ciprofloxacin resistance in poultry isolates.
AB  - To assess the molecular basis of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance in Helicobacter pullorum, the gyrA gene of H. pullorum CIP 104787T was sequenced. In addition, 9 isolates (2 susceptible to ciprofloxacin and resistant to nalidixic acid, 3 susceptible and 4 resistant to both antibiotics) were selected from 44 poultry isolates and the nucleotide sequences of their quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) were compared. The 2490 bp gyrA gene showed an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 829 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of gyrA showed>or=72% identity to Helicobacter hepaticus, Helicobacter pylori and Wolinella succinogenes. Moreover, >or=98% amino acid sequence identity was found comparing the QRDR of the H. pullorum type strain with the QRDRs of the aforementioned bacterial species. All ciprofloxacin-resistant poultry isolates showed an ACA-->ATA (Thr-->Ile) substitution at codon 84 of gyrA, corresponding to codons 86, 87 and 83 of Campylobacter jejuni, H. pylori and Escherichia coli gyrA genes, respectively. This substitution was functionally confirmed to be associated with the ciprofloxacin-resistant phenotype of poultry isolates. This is the first report describing the complete 2490 bp nucleotide sequence of H. pullorum gyrA and confirming the involvement of the Thr84Ile substitution of GyrA in ciprofloxacin resistance of H. pullorum.
TI  - Relationship between the severity of hepatitis C virus-related liver disease and  the presence of Helicobacter species in the liver: a prospective study.
AB  - AIM: To determine the presence of Helicobacter species DNA in the liver of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with and without cirrhosis as compared to controls, and to identify the bacterial species involved. METHODS: Seventy-nine consecutive patients (HBV and HIV negative) with a liver sample obtained after liver biopsy or hepatic resection were studied: 41 with CHC without cirrhosis, 12 with CHC and cirrhosis, and 26 controls (HCV negative). Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) targeting Helicobacter 16S rDNA and species-specific were performed on DNA extracted from the liver. A gastric infection with H pylori was determined by serology and confirmed by 13C-urea breath test. RESULTS: Overall, Helicobacter 16S rDNA was found in 16 patients (20.2%). Although positive cases tended to be higher in CHC patients with cirrhosis (41.6%) than in those without cirrhosis (17.0%) or in controls (15.4%), the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.08). H pylori-like DNA was identified in 12 cases and H. pullorum DNA in 2, while 2 cases remained unidentified. Gastric infection with H pylori was found in only 2 of these patients. CONCLUSION: Our results do not confirm the association of Helicobacter species DNA in the liver of CHC patients with advanced liver disease. The lack of correlation between positive H pylori serology and the presence of H pylori-like DNA in the liver may indicate the presence of a variant of this species.
TI  - Association of Helicobacter species with hepatitis C cirrhosis with or without hepatocellular carcinoma.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies have suggested that bacterial coinfection with Helicobacter species in patients already infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) could be involved in the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A retrospective cross sectional study was performed in order to explore the association between Helicobacter species and HCV associated liver diseases. METHODS: The presence of Helicobacter species was tested by polymerase chain reaction on liver samples from four groups of patients. RESULTS: Helicobacter 16S rDNA was found in only 4.2% of liver samples from control patients (n=24) and in 3.5% of liver samples from patients with non-cirrhotic chronic hepatitis C (n=29) while it was found in 68.0% of liver samples from patients with HCV positive cirrhosis without HCC (n=25) as well as in 61.3% of cirrhotic liver samples from patients with HCV positive cirrhosis and HCC (n=31). In addition, when the HCC tumour tissue was tested (n=21), 90.5% of samples were positive. DNA from Helicobacter pylori- and Helicobacter pullorum-like organisms was found. CONCLUSIONS: There is an association between the presence of Helicobacter species DNA in the liver and hepatitis C cirrhosis, with or without HCC. Indeed, the presence of these bacteria could be the result of structural changes in the liver. Alternatively, Helicobacter species could be a co-risk factor in HCV chronic liver diseases. This result warrants prospective studies to determine the possible causal role of these bacteria in the progression of chronic hepatitis C.
