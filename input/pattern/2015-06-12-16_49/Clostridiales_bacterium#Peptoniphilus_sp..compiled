TI  - Complete genome sequence of Peptoniphilus sp. strain ING2-D1G isolated from a mesophilic lab-scale completely stirred tank reactor utilizing maize silage in co-digestion with pig and cattle manure for biomethanation.
AB  - The bacterium Peptoniphilus sp. strain ING2-D1G (DSM 28672), a mesophilic and obligate anaerobic bacterium belonging to the order Clostridiales was isolated from a biogas-producing lab-scale completely stirred tank reactor (CSTR) optimized for anaerobic digestion of maize silage in co-fermentation with pig and cattle manure. In this study, the whole genome sequence of Peptoniphilus sp. strain ING2-D1G, a new isolate potentially involved in protein breakdown and acidogenesis during biomass degradation, is reported. The chromosome of this strain is 1.6Mb in size and encodes genes predicted to be involved in the production of acetate, lactate and butyrate specifying the acidogenic metabolism of the isolate.
TI  - Peptoniphilus rhinitidis sp. nov., isolated from specimens of chronic rhinosinusitis.
AB  - Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is an inflammatory disorder of the nasal cavity and  paranasal sinus related to bacterial infection. A previous study suggested that a specific bacterial group may have an important role in the course of CRS. In this study, bacteria isolated from CRS patients were characterized. A total of 15 strains were identified as Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC), which were able to utilize peptone as a sole carbon source. Sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene revealed that the isolates were closely related to members of the genus Peptoniphilus (>97% similarity) within the Clostridiales Family XI. Incertae Sedis. Genotypic and phenotypic characterization suggests that these isolates represent a novel species of the genus Peptoniphilus associated with CRS. The type strain of Peptoniphilus rhinitidis is 1-13T (=KCTC 5985T=JCM 17448T).
TI  - Peptoniphilus stercorisuis sp. nov., isolated from a swine manure storage tank and description of Peptoniphilaceae fam. nov.
AB  - A species of a previously unknown Gram-positive-staining, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacterium recovered from a swine manure storage tank was characterized using phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing studies and biochemical characteristics demonstrated that this organism is genotypically and phenotypically distinct, and represents a previously unknown sub-line within the order Clostridiales, within the phylum Firmicutes. Pairwise sequence analysis demonstrated that the novel organism clustered within the genus Peptoniphilus, most closely related to Peptoniphilus methioninivorax sharing a 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity of 95.5%. The major long-chain fatty acids were found to be C14:0 (22.4%), C16:0 (15.6%), C16:1omega7c (11.3%) and C16 : 0 ALDE (10.1%) and the DNA G +C content was 31.8 mol%. Based upon the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings presented, a novel species Peptoniphilus stercorisuis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SF-S1(T) ( = DSM 27563(T) = NBRC 109839(T)). In addition, it is proposed to accommodate the genera Peptoniphilus, Anaerococcus, Anaerosphaera, Finegoldia, Gallicola, Helcococcus, Murdochiella and Parvimonas in a new family of the order Clostridiales, for which the name Peptoniphilaceae fam. nov. is proposed; the type genus of the family is Peptoniphilus.
TI  - Peptoniphilus duerdenii sp. nov. and Peptoniphilus koenoeneniae sp. nov., isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  - Two previously uncharacterized strains of Gram-reaction-positive, anaerobic, coccus-shaped bacteria, designated strains WAL 18896(T) and WAL 18898(T), were recovered from human wound specimens and characterized using phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular taxonomic methods. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and chemotaxonomic and biochemical characteristics demonstrated that these organisms are genotypically and phenotypically distinct and represent previously unidentified sublines within the order Clostridiales in the phylum Firmicutes. Pairwise sequence analysis demonstrated that the novel organisms had 91.9% sequence similarity to each other and were most closely related to members of the genus Peptoniphilus. The major long-chain fatty acids of both strains were C(16:0,) C(18:0), C(18:1)omega9c and C(18:2)omega6,9c. Based on the phenotypic and phylogenetic findings, strains WAL 18896(T) ( = CCUG 56065(T) = ATCC BAA-1640(T)) and WAL 18898(T) ( = CCUG 56067(T) = ATCC BAA-1638(T) = DSM 22616(T)) represent two novel species, for which the names Peptoniphilus duerdenii sp. nov. and Peptoniphilus koenoeneniae sp. nov. are proposed, respectively.
