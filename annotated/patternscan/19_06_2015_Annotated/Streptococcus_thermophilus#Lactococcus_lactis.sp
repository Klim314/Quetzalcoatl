TI  == impact of cell-free supernatant of lactic acid bacteria on putrescine and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens in ornithine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == conversion of ornithine to putrescine by salmonella paratyphi a, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli was investigated in ornithine decarboxylase broth (odb) using cell-free supernatants (cfss) obtained  from leuconostoc mesenterodies subsp. cremoris, pediococcus acidilactici, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, streptococcus thermophilus. two groups of cell-free supernatants (25 or 50%) and control (only odb) were prepared to investigate putrescine (put) and other polyamine formation by foodborne pathogens (fbps). significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed among the species for each amine. all of the cfss reduced the formation of put by >/=65%. the production of cadaverine (cad) was scarcely affected by the presence of cfss, with the exception of the samples inoculated with l. monocytogenes. the variation in polyamine was found with respect to the control samples. spermidine (spd) was  produced in lower amount in many samples, especially in gram-negative fbps, whereas spermine (spn) increased drastically in the major part of the samples concerning the control. histamine (his) was characterized by a marked concentration decrease in all of the samples, and tyramine (tyr) was accumulated  in very low concentrations in the controls. therefore, the ability of bacteria to produce certain biogenic amines such as his, tyr, put, and cad has been studied to assess their risk and prevent their formation in food products. the results obtained from this study concluded that the lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains with non-decarboxylase activity are capable of avoiding or limiting biogenic amine formation by fbp.

TI  == proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria grown in goat milk.
AB  == we examined 62 strains and 21 trade starter cultures from the collection of lb bulgaricum plc for proteolytic and antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) grown in goat milk. the aim of this study was to investigate the fermentation of caseins, alpha-lactalbumin and beta-lactoglobulin by lab, using the o-phthaldialdehyde (opa) spectrophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page). the proteolysis targeted mainly caseins, especially beta-casein. whey proteins were proteolyzed, essentially beta-lactoglobulin. the proteolytic activity of lactococcus lactis l598, streptococcus thermophilus t3d1, dt1, lactobacillus lactis 1043 and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus b38, b122 and b24 was notably high. the proteolysis process gave rise to medium-sized peptide populations. most of the examined strains showed antimicrobial activity against some food pathogens, such as escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella cholere enteridis, listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua and enterobacter aerogenes. the most active producers of antimicrobial-active peptides were strains of l. delbrueckii subsp.  bulgaricus and s. thermophilus, which are of practical importance. the starter cultures containing the examined species showed high proteolytic and antimicrobial activity in skimmed goat milk. the greatest antimicrobial activity  of the cultures was detected against e. aerogenes. the obtained results demonstrated the significant proteolytic potential of the examined strains in goat milk and their potential for application in the production of dairy products from goat's milk. the present results could be considered as the first data on the proteolytic capacity of strains and starter cultures in goat milk for the purposes of trade interest of lb bulgaricum plc.

TI  == bacteria and yeast microbiota in milk kefir grains from different italian regions.
AB  == kefir grains are a unique symbiotic association of different microrganisms, mainly lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and occasionally acetic acid bacteria, cohabiting in a natural polysaccharide and a protein matrix. the microbial composition of kefir grains can be considered as extremely variable since it is strongly influenced by the geographical origin of the grains and by the sub-culturing method used. the aim of this study was to elucidate the bacteria and yeast species occurring in milk kefir grains collected in some italian regions by combining the results of scanning electron microscopy analysis, viable counts on selective culture media, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing. the main bacterial species found was lactobacillus kefiranofaciens while dekkera anomala was the predominant yeast. the presence of sub-dominant species ascribed to streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis and acetobacter genera was also highlighted. in addition, lc. lactis, enterococcus sp., bacillus sp., acetobacter fabarum, acetobacter lovaniensis and acetobacter orientalis were identified as part of the cultivable community. this work further confirms both the importance  of combining culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches to study microbial diversity in food and how the combination of multiple 16s rrna gene targets strengthens taxonomic identification using sequence-based identification  approaches.

TI  == nisin-induced expression of a recombinant antihypertensive peptide in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == objective: to improve the process for the production of milk-derived antihypertensive peptides, including a 12-residue peptide (ffvapfpecvgk) from alphas1-casein. results: a synthetic gene encoding this peptide was cloned within the pediocin operon, replacing the nucleic acid sequence encoding the mature pediocin peptide (papa) and resulting in a translational fusion between the pediocin leader peptide and the 12-residue hypotensive (c-12) peptide. the recombinant operon was subsequently cloned immediately downstream of the nisa promoter to allow for inducible gene expression within streptococcus thermophilus st128, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 and lactobacillus casei c2. rt-pcr was used to confirm recombinant gene expression in complex medium; and sds-page analysis showed that the pediocin secretion machinery, encoded by papc and papd,  allowed for secretion of the recombinant peptide from both l. lactis ml3 and l. casei c2 in a chemically defined medium. conclusion: the use of a nisin as a "food-grade" inducer molecule, and generally-regarded-as-safe lab species suggests that this system could be used for the production of functional food ingredients.

TI  == biodiversity and gamma-aminobutyric acid production by lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional alpine raw cow's milk cheeses.
AB  == "nostrano-cheeses" are traditional alpine cheeses made from raw cow's milk in trentino-alto adige, italy. this study identified lactic acid bacteria (lab) developing during maturation of "nostrano-cheeses" and evaluated their potential  to produce gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba), an immunologically active compound and neurotransmitter. cheese samples were collected on six cheese-making days, in three dairy factories located in different areas of trentino and at different stages of cheese ripening (24 h, 15 days, and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 months). a total  of 1,059 lab isolates were screened using random amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and differentiated into 583 clusters. lab strains from dominant clusters (n = 97) were genetically identified to species level by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. lab species most frequently isolated were lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus, and leuconostoc mesenteroides. the 97 dominant clusters were also characterized for their ability in producing gaba by  high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc). about 71% of the dominant bacteria clusters evolving during cheeses ripening were able to produce gaba. most gaba producers were lactobacillus paracasei but other gaba producing species included  lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, pediococcus pentosaceus, and streptococcus thermophilus. no enterococcus faecalis or sc. macedonicus isolates produced gaba. the isolate producing the highest amount of gaba (80.0+/-2.7 mg/kg) was a sc. thermophilus.

TI  == excess of threonine compared with serine promotes threonine aldolase activity in  lactococcus lactis il1403.
AB  == lactococcus lactis is an important lactic acid starter for food production as well as a cell factory for production of food grade additives, among which natural flavour production is one of the main interests of food producers. flavour production is associated with the degradation of amino acids and comprehensive studies are required to elucidate mechanisms behind these pathways. in this study using chemically defined medium, labelled substrate and steady-state cultivation, new data for the catabolism of threonine in lc. lactis  have been obtained. the biosynthesis of glycine in this organism is associated with the catabolic pathways of glucose and serine. nevertheless, if threonine concentration in the growth environment exceeds that of serine, threonine becomes the main source for glycine biosynthesis and the utilization of serine decreases. also, the conversion of threonine to glycine was initiated by a threonine aldolase and this was the principal pathway used for threonine degradation. as in streptococcus thermophilus, serine hydroxymethyltransferase in lc. lactis may possess a secondary activity as threonine aldolase. other catabolic pathways of threonine (e.g. threonine dehydrogenase and threonine dehydratase) were not detected.

TI  == acquisition through horizontal gene transfer of plasmid psma198 by streptococcus  macedonicus aca-dc 198 points towards the dairy origin of the species.
AB  == background: streptococcus macedonicus is an intriguing streptococcal species whose most frequent source of isolation is fermented foods similarly to streptococcus thermophilus. however, s. macedonicus is closely related to commensal opportunistic pathogens of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex. methodology/principal findings: we analyzed the psma198 plasmid  isolated from the dairy strain streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 in order to provide novel clues about the main ecological niche of this bacterium. psma198 belongs to the narrow host range pci305/pwv02 family found primarily in lactococci and to the best of our knowledge it is the first such plasmid to be reported in streptococci. comparative analysis of the psma198 sequence revealed a high degree of similarity with plasmids isolated from lactococcus lactis strains  deriving from milk or its products. phylogenetic analysis of the psma198 rep showed that the vast majority of closely related proteins derive from lactococcal dairy isolates. additionally, cloning of the psma198 ori in l. lactis revealed a  100% stability of replication over 100 generations. both psma198 and the chromosome of s. macedonicus exhibit a high percentage of potential pseudogenes,  indicating that they have co-evolved under the same gene decay processes. we identified chromosomal regions in s. macedonicus that may have originated from psma198, also supporting a long co-existence of the two replicons. psma198 was also found in divergent biotypes of s. macedonicus and in strains isolated from dispersed geographic locations (e.g. greece and switzerland) showing that psma198's acquisition is not a recent event. conclusions/significance: here we propose that s. macedonicus acquired plasmid psma198 from l. lactis via an ancestral genetic exchange event that took place most probably in milk or dairy products. we provide important evidence that point towards the dairy origin of this species.

TI  == effect of adjuncts on microbiological and chemical properties of scamorza cheese.
AB  == scamorza is a semi-hard, pasta filata cheese resembling low-moisture mozzarella cheese, with a short ripening time (<30d). scamorza has a bland flavor and, to provide diversification from similar cheeses, it was manufactured using 2 types of milk in the current study: 100% italian friesian milk (f) or 90% f and 10% jersey cow milk (mixed, m), and 2 types of starter: streptococcus thermophilus or s. thermophilus with peptidolytic lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus paracasei strains as adjuncts). the cheeses were ripened for 30d. the adjunct did not significantly affect acid production or growth of the primary starter; 2 of the species used in the adjunct (lb. paracasei and lb. helveticus) rapidly colonized the cheese and persisted until the end of ripening, whereas the counts of nonstarter lactic acid bacteria in the control cheese were  low until the end of ripening. the use of adjuncts affected ph, microbial composition (as assessed by both culture-dependent and culture-independent methods), total free amino acid content, and volatile profile (measured using an  electronic nose), whereas milk type had only a minor effect. although differences in primary proteolysis were found, they were probably indirect and related to the effects on ph and moisture. we conclude that, even with a short ripening time (30d), use of a peptidolytic adjunct may significantly affect important features  of scamorza and may be used to create a product that is measurably different from competing products.

TI  == the influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == the function of cell-free solutions (cfss) of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (fbps) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) using hplc. cell free solutions were prepared from four lab strains. two different concentrations  which were 50% (5 ml cfs+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml cfs+7.5 ml medium/1:3)  cfs and the control without cfs were prepared. both concentration of cfs of streptococcus thermophilus and 50% cfs of pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by salmonella paratyphi a. tyramine production by escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% cfs of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% cfs of leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. the inhibitor effect of 50% cfs of p. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by listeria monocytogenes, following lc. lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% cfs of leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). the stimulation effects of 50% cfs of s. thermophilus and lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. cfs of lab strains showed  statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased ph quickly and reduced the formation of amn and bas. consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use cfs for food and food products.

TI  == effect of adjuncts on sensory properties and consumer liking of scamorza cheese.
AB  == the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of a peptidolytic adjunct (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, and lactobacillus paracasei), as a tool to accelerate ripening, on sensory properties and acceptability of scamorza  cheese obtained using 2 types of milk (friesian and friesian+jersey) and streptococcus thermophilus as primary starter. a 10-member panel was trained using a specific frame of references and used a specific vocabulary to assess cheese sensory properties through quantitative descriptive analysis (qda), whereas 87 consumers were used to evaluate product acceptability. analysis of variance showed that milk type did not markedly alter cheese sensory properties.  conversely, panelists perceived higher intensities of butter, saltiness, and sweetness flavors in cheese without adjunct culture (st), whereas the addition of the adjunct culture (st+a) induced higher and sourness flavors, oiliness and grainy textures, and lower adhesiveness, moisture, springiness, and tenderness. principal component analysis showed positive relationships between ph and tenderness, sweetness and saltiness and a negative correlation between ph and grainy, oiliness, color and structure uniformity, sourness, and milk. most of the differences observed in qda and most of the relationships observed in the principal component analysis were linked to the higher microbial activity induced by the adjunct culture. independently of milk and starter types, consumers perceived scamorza cheese as characterized by a good eating quality (mean liking  scores were all above the neutral point of the hedonic scale). although st cheeses showed higher values for overall liking, 2 homogeneous groups of consumers were identified using partial least squares regression analysis. one group preferred st cheeses with higher levels of tenderness, adhesiveness, springiness, and moisture in terms of texture, butter in terms of flavor, and sweetness in terms of taste, whereas a second group preferred st+a products characterized by specific attributes of texture (cohesiveness and oiliness), flavor (milk), taste (sourness), and appearance (structure and color uniformity). we conclude that further studies for the development of short-ripened products based on the use of adjunct cultures should be conducted to promote product differentiation and meet the sensory requirements of particular segments of consumers.

TI  == control of tyramine and histamine accumulation by lactic acid bacteria using bacteriocin forming lactococci.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the competitive effects of three bacteriocin producing strains of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis against two aminobiogenic lactic acid bacteria, i.e. the tyramine producing strain enterococcus faecalis ef37 and the histamine producing strain streptococcus thermophilus pri60, inoculated at different initial concentrations (from 2 to 6 log cfu/ml). the results showed that the three l. lactis subsp. lactis strains were able to produce bacteriocins: in particular, l. lactis subsp. lactis vr84 and eg46 produced, respectively, nisin z and lacticin 481, while for the strains  cg27 the bacteriocin has not been yet identified, even if its peptidic nature has been demonstrated. the co-culture of e. faecalis ef37 in combination with lactococci significantly reduced the growth potential of this aminobiogenic strain, both in terms of growth rate and maximum cell concentration, depending on the initial inoculum level of e. faecalis. tyramine accumulation was strongly reduced when e. faecalis ef37 was inoculated at 2 log cfu/ml and, to a lesser extent, at 3 log cfu/ml, as a result of a lower cell load of the aminobiogenic strain. all the lactococci were more efficient in inhibiting streptococci in comparison with e. faecalis ef37; in particular, l. lactis subsp. lactis vr84 induced the death of s. thermophilus pri60 and allowed the detection of histamine traces only at higher streptococci inoculum levels (5-6 log cfu/ml). the other two lactococcal strains did not show a lethal action against s. thermophilus pri60, but were able to reduce its growth extent and histamine accumulation, even if l. lactis subsp. lactis eg46 was less effective when the initial streptococci  concentration was 5 and 6 log cfu/ml. this preliminary study has clarified some aspects regarding the ratio between bacteriocinogenic strains and aminobiogenic strains with respect to the possibility to accumulate ba and has also showed that different bacteriocins can have different effects on ba production on the same strain. this knowledge is essentially aimed to use bacteriocinogenic lactococci as a predictable strategy against aminobiogenic bacteria present in cheese or other fermented foods.

TI  == effects of ingesting milk fermented by lactococcus lactis h61 on skin health in young women: a randomized double-blind study.
AB  == we conducted a randomized double-blind trial to evaluate the effects of fermented milk produced using only lactococcus lactis strain h61 as a starter bacterium (h61-fermented milk) on the general health and various skin properties of young women. healthy female volunteers (n=23; age=19-21r) received h61-fermented milk (10(10) cfu of strain h61/d) or conventional yogurt (10(10) cfu of both lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus per day), as a reference food, daily for 4 wk. before and at the end of 4 wk, blood samples were taken, and skin hydration (inner forearms and cheek) and melanin content, elasticity, and sebum content (cheek only) were measured. skin hydration at the inner forearm was higher at wk 4 than at wk 0 in both groups. sebum content in cheek rose significantly after intervention in the h61-fermented milk  group, but not the conventional yogurt group. other skin parameters did not differ in either group. serum analysis showed that total protein concentration and platelet count were elevated and reactive oxygen species decreased in both groups after the intervention. although h61-fermented milk and conventional yogurt had similar effects on skin status and some blood characteristics of participants, an increase of sebum content in cheek is preferable to h61-fermented milk. as skin lipids contribute to maintaining the skin barrier, h61-fermented milk would provide beneficial effects on skin for young women.

TI  == comparative genomics of the dairy isolate streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 against related members of the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex.
AB  == background: within the genus streptococcus, only streptococcus thermophilus is used as a starter culture in food fermentations. streptococcus macedonicus though, which belongs to the streptococcus bovis/streptococcus equinus complex (sbsec), is also frequently isolated from fermented foods mainly of dairy origin. members of the sbsec have been implicated in human endocarditis and colon cancer. here we compare the genome sequence of the dairy isolate s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 to the other sbsec genomes in order to assess in silico its potential adaptation to milk and its pathogenicity status. results: despite the fact that the sbsec species were found tightly related based on whole genome phylogeny of streptococci, two distinct patterns of evolution were identified among them. streptococcus macedonicus, streptococcus infantarius cj18 and streptococcus pasteurianus atcc 43144 seem to have undergone reductive evolution resulting in significantly diminished genome sizes and increased percentages of potential pseudogenes when compared to streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. in addition, the three species seem to have lost genes for catabolizing complex plant carbohydrates and for detoxifying toxic substances previously linked to the ability of s. gallolyticus to survive in the rumen. analysis of the s. macedonicus genome revealed features that could support adaptation to milk, including an extra gene cluster for lactose and galactose metabolism, a proteolytic system for casein hydrolysis, auxotrophy for several vitamins, an increased ability to resist bacteriophages and horizontal gene transfer events with the dairy lactococcus lactis and s. thermophilus as potential donors. in addition, s. macedonicus lacks several pathogenicity-related genes found in s. gallolyticus. for example, s. macedonicus has retained only one (i.e. the pil3) of the three pilus gene clusters which may mediate the binding of s. gallolyticus to the extracellular matrix. unexpectedly, similar findings were obtained not only for the dairy s. infantarius cj18, but also for the blood isolate s. pasteurianus atcc 43144. conclusions: our whole genome analyses suggest traits of adaptation of s. macedonicus to the nutrient-rich dairy environment. during this  process the bacterium gained genes presumably important for this new ecological niche. finally, s. macedonicus carries a reduced number of putative sbsec virulence factors, which suggests a diminished pathogenic potential.

TI  == in vivo application and dynamics of lactic acid bacteria for the four-season production of vastedda-like cheese.
AB  == twelve lactic acid bacteria (lab), previously selected in vitro (gaglio et al., 2014), were evaluated in situ for their potential to act as starter cultures for  the continuous four-season production of vastedda-like cheese, made with raw ewes' milk. the strains belonged to lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and streptococcus thermophilus. lab were first inoculated in multiple-strain combinations on the basis of their optimal growth temperatures in three process conditions which differed for milk treatment and medium for strain development: process 1, growth  of strains in the optimal synthetic media and pasteurised milk; process 2, growth of strains in whey based medium (wbm) and pasteurised milk; and process 3, growth of strains in wbm and raw milk. the strains that acidified the curds in short time, as shown by a ph drop, were all mesophilic and were then tested in a single inoculum through process 3. randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis applied to the colonies isolated from the highest dilutions of samples confirmed the dominance of the added strains after curd acidification, stretching and storage. after 15days of refrigerated storage, the decrease in ph values showed an activity of the mesophilic strains at low temperatures, but only lc. lactis subsp. cremoris pon153, ln. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides pon259 and  pon559 increased their number during the 15days at 7 degrees c. a sensory evaluation indicated that the cheeses obtained by applying protocol 3 and by inoculation with lactococci are the most similar to the protected denomination of origin (pdo) cheese and received the best scores by the judges. thus, the experimental cheeses obtained with raw milk and inoculated with single and multiple combinations of lactococci were subjected to the analysis of the volatile organic compounds (vocs) carried out by a headspace solid phase microextraction (spme) technique coupled with gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (gc/ms). the dominance of lactococci over thermophilic lab of raw milk was verified during summer production and, based on the combination of voc profiles and sensory evaluation of the final cheeses, the multi-strain lactococcus culture resulted in the most suitable starter preparation for the full-year production of vastedda-like cheese.

TI  == current taxonomy of phages infecting lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == phages infecting lactic acid bacteria have been the focus of significant research attention over the past three decades. through the isolation and characterization of hundreds of phage isolates, it has been possible to classify phages of the dairy starter and adjunct bacteria lactococus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, leuconostoc spp., and lactobacillus spp. among these, phages of l. lactis have been most thoroughly scrutinized and serve as an excellent model system to address issues that arise when attempting taxonomic classification of phages infecting other lab species. here, we present an overview of the current taxonomy of phages infecting lab genera of industrial significance, the methods employed in these taxonomic efforts and how these may be employed for the taxonomy of phages of currently underrepresented and emerging phage species.

TI  == microbial biodiversity in cheese consortia and comparative listeria growth on surfaces of uncooked pressed cheeses.
AB  == the study set out to determine how changes in the microbial diversity of a complex antilisterial consortium from the surface of st-nectaire cheese modify its antilisterial activities. on the basis of the microbial composition of a natural complex consortium named tr15 (truefood consortium 15), three new consortia of different species and strain compositions were defined: tr15-sc (58  isolates from tr15 collection), tr15-m (pools of isolates from selective counting media) and tr15-bhi (pools of isolates from bhi medium). their antilisterial activities on the surfaces of uncooked pressed cheese made with pasteurised milk  were compared with the activity of complex consortium tr15 and a control cheese inoculated only with starter culture (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii). the natural consortium tr15 was the most inhibitory, followed by reconstituted consortium tr15-bhi. the dynamics of the cheese rind microbial flora were monitored by counting on media and by isolate identification using 16s rdna sequencing and direct 16s rdna single strand conformation polymorphism analysis. the combination of these methods showed that rind with natural consortium tr15 had greater microbial diversity and different microbial dynamics  than cheese rinds with reconstituted consortia. cheese rind with the natural consortium showed higher citrate consumption and the highest concentrations of lactic and acetic acids, connected with high levels of lactic acid bacteria such  as carnobacterium maltaromaticum, vagococcus fluvialis, enterococcus gilvus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, brochothrix thermosphacta and lactococcus lactis, ripening bacteria such as arthrobacter nicotianae/arilaitensis, and gram negative bacteria (pseudomonas psychrophila and enterobacter spp.). the highest l. monocytogenes count was on rind with tr15-m and was positively associated with the highest ph value, high succinic and citric acid contents, and the highest levels of marinilactibacillus psychrotolerans and gram positive catalase positive bacteria represented by staphylococcus vitulinus, brevibacterium linens, microbacterium gubbeenense and brachybacterium tyrofermentans. the results show that the species composition of consortium is more important than the number of species. it is likely that inhibition mechanisms differ from one consortium to another; investigating gene expression will be an effective way to elucidate microbial interactions in cheese.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == food environments select microorganisms based on selfish energetic behavior.
AB  == nutrient richness, and specifically the abundance of mono- and disaccharides that characterize several food matrixes, such as milk and grape juice, has allowed the speciation of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts with a high fermentation capacity instead of energetically favorable respiratory metabolism. in these environmental contexts, rapid sugar consumption and lactic acid or ethanol production, accumulation, and tolerance, together with the ability to propagate in the absence of oxygen, are several of the "winning" traits that have apparently evolved and become specialized to perfection in these fermenting microorganisms.  here, we summarize and discuss the evolutionary context that has driven energetic metabolism in food-associated microorganisms, using the dairy species lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus among prokaryotes and the bakers' yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae among eukaryotes as model organisms.

TI  == genetic engineering techniques for lactic acid bacteria: construction of a stable shuttle vector and expression vector for beta-glucuronidase.
AB  == the shuttle vector, pul6erm, was constructed by using a replicon from pl2, a multiple cloning site, cole1 ori, the ori of gram-negative bacteria from vector puc19, and the erythromycin resistance gene from pva838 as a selection marker. pul6erm could be transformed easily and maintained stably in lactococcus lactis,  streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus casei. transformation assays of pul6erm indicated that it had a narrow host range. beta-glucuronidase was induced in the presence of 0.3 m nacl and 50 mm glutamate  and expressed at 2.4 u mg(-1) with the expression vector (pul6erm-gadr-gus) constructed based on pul6erm carrying beta-glucuronidase gene wuth a chloride-inducible (gadr) expression cassette using pgad as promoter. therefore,  pul6erm and pul6erm-gadr-gus might be a safe and useful genetic tool for the improvement of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == characterization of carnobacterium maltaromaticum lma 28 for its positive technological role in soft cheese making.
AB  == carnobacterium maltaromaticum is a lactic acid bacterium isolated from soft cheese. the objective of this work was to study its potential positive impact when used in cheese technology. phenotypic and genotypic characterization of six  strains of c. maltaromaticum showed that they belong to different phylogenetic groups. although these strains lacked the ability to coagulate milk quickly, they were acidotolerant. they did not affect the coagulation capacity of starter lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, used in  dairy industry. the impact of c. maltaromaticum lma 28 on bacterial flora of cheese revealed a significant decrease of psychrobacter sp. concentration, which  might be responsible for cheese aging phenomena. an experimental plan was carried out to unravel the mechanism of inhibition of psychrobacter sp. and listeria monocytogenes and possible interaction between various factors (cell concentration, nacl, ph and incubation time). cellular concentration of c. maltaromaticum lma 28 was found to be the main factor involved in the inhibition  of psychrobacter sp. and l. monocytogenes.

TI  == diversity of thermophilic bacteria in raw, pasteurized and selectively-cultured milk, as assessed by culturing, pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing.
AB  == thermophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) species, such as streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus helveticus, enjoy worldwide economic importance as dairy starters. to assess the diversity of thermophilic bacteria in milk, milk samples were enriched in thermophilic organisms through a stepwise procedure which included pasteurization of milk at 63 degrees c for 30 min (pm samples) and pasteurization followed by incubation at 42 degrees c for 24 h (ipm samples). the microbial composition of these samples was analyzed by culture-dependent (at 42 degrees c) and culture-independent (pcr-dgge and pyrosequencing of 16s rrna gene amplicons) microbial techniques. the results were then compared to those obtained for their corresponding starting raw milk counterparts (rm samples). twenty different species were scored by culturing among 352 isolates purified from the counting plates and identified by  molecular methods. mesophilic lab species (lactococcus lactis, lactococcus garvieae) were dominant (87% of the isolates) among the rm samples. however, s. thermophilus and lb. delbrueckii were found to be the dominant recoverable organisms in both pm and ipm samples. the dgge profiles of rm and pm samples were found to be very similar; the most prominent bands belonging to lactococcus, leuconostoc and streptococcus species. in contrast, just three dgge bands were obtained for ipm samples, two of which were assigned to s. thermophilus. the pyrosequencing results scored 95 operational taxonomic units (otus) at 3% sequence divergence in an rm sample, while only 13 were encountered in two ipm samples. this technique identified leuconostoc citreum as the dominant microorganism in the rm sample, while s. thermophilus constituted more than 98% of the reads in the ipm samples. the procedure followed in this study allowed to  estimate the bacterial diversity in milk and afford a suitable strategy for the isolation of new thermophilic lab strains, among which adequate starters might be selected.

TI  == consumption of fermented milk product with probiotic modulates brain activity.
AB  == background & aims: changes in gut microbiota have been reported to alter signaling mechanisms, emotional behavior, and visceral nociceptive reflexes in rodents. however, alteration of the intestinal microbiota with antibiotics or probiotics has not been shown to produce these changes in humans. we investigated whether consumption of a fermented milk product with probiotic (fmpp) for 4 weeks by healthy women altered brain intrinsic connectivity or responses to emotional attention tasks. methods: healthy women with no gastrointestinal or psychiatric symptoms were randomly assigned to groups given fmpp (n = 12), a nonfermented milk product (n = 11, controls), or no intervention (n = 13) twice daily for 4 weeks. the fmpp contained bifidobacterium animalis subsp lactis, streptococcus thermophiles, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and lactococcus lactis subsp lactis. participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after the intervention to measure brain response to an emotional faces attention task and resting brain activity. multivariate and region of interest analyses were performed. results: fmpp intake was associated with reduced task-related response of a distributed functional network (49% cross-block covariance; p = .004) containing affective, viscerosensory, and somatosensory cortices. alterations in  intrinsic activity of resting brain indicated that ingestion of fmpp was associated with changes in midbrain connectivity, which could explain the observed differences in activity during the task. conclusions: four-week intake of an fmpp by healthy women affected activity of brain regions that control central processing of emotion and sensation.

TI  == changes in fatty acid profile of feta cheese including conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  == background: during the last two decades much attention has been given to conjugated linoleic acid (cla) because of its potentially beneficial biological effects. cheese is one of the major dietary sources of cla. however, the cla content of greek cheeses is variable and affected by many factors. fatty acid analysis of feta cheese, made of sheep's milk, was conducted at different stages  of the manufacturing process in order to monitor and explain fatty acid and especially cla changes. results: cla content in fresh milk and during the early stages of manufacture was 0.66 +/- 0.02 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids; it increased during the ripening process (0.75 +/- 0.06 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids) and decreased during storage (0.52 +/- 0.15 g 100 g(-)(1) fatty acids). saturated fatty acids (sfa), increased after 37 and 48 days of aging, while monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa), showed the opposite tendency. conclusion: cla content significantly increased during the ripening stages and decreased during aging (p </= 0.05). cla is not stable during manufacture and storage of feta cheese, a fact which should be resolved, since this biologically active substance can be obtained from the diet.

TI  == bacteriophages in food fermentations: new frontiers in a continuous arms race.
AB  == phage contamination represents an important risk to any process requiring bacterial growth, particularly in the biotechnology and food industries. the presence of unwanted phages may lead to manufacturing delays, lower quality product, or, in the worst cases, total production loss. thus, constant phage monitoring and stringent application of the appropriate control measures are indispensable. in fact, a systematic preventive approach to phage contamination [phage analysis and critical control points (paccp)] should be put in place. in this review, sources of phage contamination and novel phage detection methods are described, with an emphasis on bacterial viruses that infect lactic acid bacteria used in food fermentations. recent discoveries related to antiphage systems that  are changing our views on phage-host interactions are highlighted. finally, future directions are also discussed.

TI  == isolation and identification of the microbiota of danish farmhouse and industrially produced surface-ripened cheeses.
AB  == for studying the microbiota of four danish surface-ripened cheeses produced at three farmhouses and one industrial dairy, both a culture-dependent and culture-independent approach were used. after dereplication of the initial set of 433 isolates by (gtg)5-pcr fingerprinting, 217 bacterial and 25 yeast isolates were identified by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene or the d1/d2 domain of the 26s rrna gene, respectively. at the end of ripening, the cheese core microbiota of the farmhouse cheeses consisted of the mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab) starter cultures lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteorides as well as non-starter lab including different lactobacillus spp. the cheese from the industrial dairy was almost exclusively dominated by lb. paracasei. the surface bacterial microbiota of all four cheeses were dominated by corynebacterium spp. and/or brachybacterium spp. brevibacterium spp. was found to be subdominant compared to other bacteria on the farmhouse cheeses, and no brevibacterium spp. was found on the cheese from the industrial dairy, even though b. linens was used as surface-ripening culture. moreover, gram-negative bacteria identified as alcalignes faecalis and proteus vulgaris were found on one of the farmhouse cheeses. the surface yeast microbiota consisted primarily of one dominating species for each cheese. for the farmhouse cheeses, the dominant yeast species were yarrowia lipolytica, geotrichum spp. and debaryomyces hansenii, respectively, and for the cheese from the industrial dairy, d. hansenii was the dominant yeast species. additionally, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) analysis revealed that streptococcus thermophilus was present in the farmhouse raw milk cheese analysed in this study. furthermore, dgge bands corresponding to vagococcus carniphilus, psychrobacter spp. and lb. curvatus on the cheese surfaces indicated that these bacterial species may play a role in cheese ripening.

TI  == structural aspects of the interaction of dairy phages with their host bacteria.
AB  == knowledge of phage-host interactions at a fundamental level is central to the design of rational strategies for the development of phage-resistant strains that may be applied in industrial settings. phages infecting lactic acid bacteria, in  particular lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus, negatively impact on dairy fermentation processes with serious economic implications. in recent years a wealth of information on structural protein assembly and topology has become available relating to phages infecting escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis, which act as models for structural analyses of dairy phages. in this review, we explore the role of model tailed phages, such as t4 and spp1, in advancing our knowledge regarding interactions between dairy phages  and their hosts. furthermore, the potential of currently investigated dairy phages to in turn serve as model systems for this particular group of phages is discussed.

TI  == analysis of microbial diversity on deli slicers using polymerase chain reaction and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis technologies.
AB  == cross-contamination of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria from food-contact surfaces to food products is a serious public health issue. bacteria may survive  and attach to food-contact surfaces by residual food components and/or background bacteria which may subsequently transfer to other food products. deli slicers, generally used for slicing ready-to-eat products, can serve as potential sources  for considerable bacterial transfer. the objective of this study was to assess the extent and distribution of microbial diversity of deli slicers by identification of pathogenic and background bacteria. slicer-swab samples were collected from restaurants in arkansas and texas in the united states. ten surface areas for each slicer were swabbed using sterile sponges. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was applied to investigate the fingerprint of samples, and each band was further identified by sequence analysis. pseudomonads  were identified as the dominant bacteria followed by enterobacteriaceae family, and lactic acid bacteria such as lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus were also found. bacterial distribution was similar for all surface  areas, while the blade guard exhibited the greatest diversity. this study provides a profile of the microbial ecology of slicers using dgge to develop more specific sanitation practices and to reduce cross-contamination during slicing.

TI  == phages of lactic acid bacteria: the role of genetics in understanding phage-host  interactions and their co-evolutionary processes.
AB  == dairy fermentations are among the oldest food processing applications, aimed at preservation and shelf-life extension through the use of lactic acid bacteria (lab) starter cultures, in particular strains of lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus spp. and leuconostoc spp. traditionally this was performed by continuous passaging of undefined cultures from a finished  fermentation to initiate the next fermentation. more recently, consumer demands on consistent and desired flavours and textures of dairy products have led to a more defined approach to such processes. dairy (starter) companies have responded to the need to define the nature and complexity of the starter culture mixes, and dairy fermentations are now frequently based on defined starter cultures of low complexity, where each starter component imparts specific technological properties that are desirable to the product. both mixed and defined starter culture approaches create the perfect environment for the proliferation of (bacterio)phages capable of infecting these lab. the repeated use of the same starter cultures in a single plant, coupled to the drive towards higher and consistent production levels, increases the risk and negative impact of phage infection. in this review we will discuss recent advances in tracking the adaptation of phages to the dairy industry, the advances in understanding lab phage-host interactions, including evolutionary and genomic aspects.

TI  == exopolysaccharides modify functional properties of whey protein concentrate.
AB  == the objective of this research was to produce whey protein concentrate (wpc) with modified functionality using exopolysaccharide- (eps) producing cultures. two different eps-producing cultures, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris jfr and streptococcus thermophilus, producing eps1 and eps2 respectively, were used in this study. one eps-nonproducing commercial cheese culture (dvs 850; chr. hansen, milwaukee, wi) was used as the control. reconstituted sweet whey powder was used  in this study to eliminate variations from fresh whey. cultures grown overnight in reconstituted wpc (10% wt/vol) were added, directly or after overnight cooling (cooled eps), at 2% (wt/vol) to 6% (wt/wt) solution of reconstituted whey. whey was then high-temperature, short-time pasteurized at 75 degrees c for 35s and ultrafiltered to a volume reduction factor of 5. ultrafiltered whey (retentate) was spray dried at inlet and outlet air temperatures of 200 and 90 degrees c, respectively, to obtain wpc. in general, the solubility of wpc was higher at ph 7 than at ph 3. whey protein concentrate containing eps2 exhibited higher protein solubility than did wpc containing no eps. also, the presence of eps in wpc decreased protein denaturation. the emulsifying ability of wpc containing eps was higher than that in control. addition of eps to wpc significantly enhanced its gelling ability. foam overrun and hydrophobicity of wpc were not affected by addition of eps. in conclusion, data obtained from this study show that eps modify wpc functionality. the extent of modification depends on the type of eps.  cooling of culture containing eps before its addition to whey further reduced wpc protein denaturation and increased its solubility at ph 7 and gel hardness.

TI  == antioxidant properties of potentially probiotic bacteria: in vitro and in vivo activities.
AB  == thirty-four strains of lactic acid bacteria (seven bifidobacterium, 11 lactobacillus, six lactococcus, and 10 streptococcus thermophilus) were assayed in vitro for antioxidant activity against ascorbic and linolenic acid oxidation (taa(aa) and taa(la)), trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity (teac), intracellular glutathione (tgsh), and superoxide dismutase (sod). wide dispersion of each of taa(aa), taa(la), teac, tgsh, and sod occurred within bacterial groups, indicating that antioxidative properties are strain specific. the strains bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis dsmz 23032, lactobacillus acidophilus dsmz 23033, and lactobacillus brevis dsmz 23034 exhibited among the highest taa(aa), taa(la), teac, and tgsh values within the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. these  strains were used to prepare a potentially antioxidative probiotic formulation, which was administered to rats at the dose of 10(7), 10(8), and 10(9) cfu/day for 18 days. the probiotic strains colonized the colon of the rats during the trial and promoted intestinal saccharolytic metabolism. the analysis of plasma antioxidant activity, reactive oxygen molecules level, and glutathione concentration, revealed that, when administered at doses of at least 10(8) cfu/day, the antioxidant mixture effectively reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative stress. probiotic strains which are capable to limit excessive amounts  of reactive radicals in vivo may contribute to prevent and control several diseases associated with oxidative stress.

AB  == the effects of the expression of a small heat shock protein (shsp) gene from streptococcus thermophilus on stress resistance in lactococcus lactis under different environmental stresses were investigated in this study. pmg36e-shsp, an expression vector, was first constructed by inserting a shsp open reading frame (orf) cloned from s. thermophilus strain st-qc into pmg36e. then, a food-grade expression vector, pmg-shsp, was generated by deleting the erythromycin resistance gene from pmg36e-shsp. the transformation rate of pmg-shsp was comparable to that of pmg36e-shsp when each of these two vectors was introduced into l. lactis. these results demonstrated that the shsp orf could successfully used as a food-grade selection marker in both pmg-shsp and pmg36e-shsp. furthermore, the growth characteristics were almost the same between l. lactis ml23 transformants harboring pmg36e or pmg-shsp. the survival rate of l. lactis ml23 expressing the shsp orf were increased to 0.032%, 0.006%, 0.0027%, 0.03%, and 0.16% under the following environmental stresses: heat, acid, ethanol, bile salt and h2o2, respectively. these results indicated that the expression of the shsp gene in the food-grade vector pmg-shsp conferred resistance to environmental stresses without affecting the growth characteristics of l. lactis ml23.

TI  == a survey of the bacterial composition of kurut from tibet using a culture-independent approach.
AB  == kurut (fermented yak milk) made by natural fermentation is a very important dairy food for the local people in tibet (china). it is important to fully understand the bacterial composition of kurut for quality improvement and industrial production. because more than 99% of prokaryotes cannot be cultured and identified by methods currently used in taxonomy, we applied a culture-independent approach to explore the microbial biodiversity of this traditional food. in this study, a bacterial 16s rrna gene clone library, including 460 clones, was constructed using total dna extracted from 30 samples of kurut. after screening by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) analysis, 56 operational taxonomic units (otu) with unique rflp patterns were obtained. then, 1 representative sequence of every otu was sequenced and phylogenetically analyzed. the representative phylotypes were affiliated with 5 groups, including lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and acetobacter. in addition, nearly one-third of the representative clones (132 clones) had low similarity to species in genbank (<97%), and these phylotypes were regarded as unknown bacteria. the characteristics of kurut are determined not only by lactic acid bacteria well known by the culture-dependent approach but also by bacteria that have not yet been identified.

TI  == improved acid stress survival of lactococcus lactis expressing the histidine decarboxylation pathway of streptococcus thermophilus chcc1524.
AB  == degradative amino acid decarboxylation pathways in bacteria generate secondary metabolic energy and provide resistance against acid stress. the histidine decarboxylation pathway of streptococcus thermophilus chcc1524 was functionally expressed in the heterologous host lactococcus lactis nz9000, and the benefits of the newly acquired pathway for the host were analyzed. during growth in m17 medium in the ph range of 5-6.5, a small positive effect was observed on the biomass yield in batch culture, whereas no growth rate enhancement was evident. in contrast, a strong benefit for the engineered l. lactis strain was observed in acid stress survival. in the presence of histidine, the pathway enabled cells to  survive at ph values as low as 3 for at least 2 h, conditions under which the host cells were rapidly dying. the flux through the histidine decarboxylation pathway in cells grown at physiological ph was under strict control of the electrochemical proton gradient (pmf) across the membrane. ionophores that dissipated the membrane potential (deltapsi) and/or the ph gradient (deltaph) strongly increased the flux, whereas the presence of glucose almost completely inhibited the flux. control of the pmf over the flux was exerted by both deltapsi and deltaph and was distributed over the transporter hdcp and the decarboxylase hdca. the control allowed for a synergistic effect between the histidine decarboxylation and glycolytic pathways in acid stress survival. in a narrow ph range around 2.5 the synergism resulted in a 10-fold higher survival rate.

TI  == the fate of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures, escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in danish raw milk and cheeses determined by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to study the bacterial communities in raw milk and in danish raw milk cheeses using pyrosequencing of tagged amplicons of the v3 and v4 regions of the 16s rdna and cdna. furthermore, the effects of acidification and ripening starter cultures, cooking temperatures and rate of acidification on  survival of added escherichia coli, listeria innocua and staphylococcus aureus in cheeses at different stages of ripening were studied by pyrosequencing and quantitative real time (qrt)-pcr. a high diversity of bacterial species was detected in raw milk. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus rhamnosus were the main bacteria detected in raw milk and cheeses. bacteria belonging to the genera brevibacterium, staphylococcus, escherichia, weissella, leuconostoc, pediococcus were also detected in both 16s rdna and cdna obtained from raw milk and cheeses. e. coli, which was added to milk used for production of some cheeses, was detected in both dna and rna extracted from cheeses at different stages of ripening showing the highest percentage of the total sequence reads at 7 days of ripening and decreased again in the later ripening stages. growth of e. coli in cheeses appeared to be affected by the cooking temperature and the rate of acidification  but not by the ripening starter cultures applied or the indigenous microbiota of  raw milk. growth of l. innocua and s. aureus added to milks was inhibited in all  cheeses at different stages of ripening. the use of 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing  and qrt-pcr allows a deeper understanding of the behavior of indigenous microbiota, starter cultures and pathogenic bacteria in raw milk and cheeses.

TI  == construction of theta-type shuttle vector for leuconostoc and other lactic acid bacteria using pcb42 isolated from kimchi.
AB  == the pcb42 plasmid from leuconostoc citreum cb2567, a strain isolated from kimchi, was characterized, and a shuttle vector for escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (lab) was constructed. the pcb42 plasmid has a circular structure of 4312bp, a low g+c content, and no single-stranded dna intermediates during replication, which indicates that pcb42 replicates via the theta-type replication mechanism. in silico analysis of this plasmid revealed 6 open reading frames: 1 transposase gene, 1 dna-binding gene, 2 putative replication genes, and 2 unknown genes. the fragment encompassing orf5 contains a functional plasmid replicon. this plasmid was capable of replicating in various lab, including l. citreum, l.  mesenteroides, lactobacillus plantarum, lb. reuteri, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, weissella confusa, and oenococcus oeni. the lab-e. coli shuttle vector was constructed by ligating pcb42 and pek104, and the resulting shuttle vector, pleucm42, showed a high segregational stability in l. citreum cb2567 after 100 generations of cell division. by using this shuttle vector, the beta-gal gene from lb. plantarum was successfully expressed in the host strain, l. citreum cb2567. the pleucm42 shuttle vector can serve as a useful gene-delivery and expression tool for the genetic study or metabolic engineering  of various strains of lab.

TI  == intraspecific and interspecific interactions among proteins regulating exopolysaccharide synthesis in streptococcus thermophilus, streptococcus iniae, and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris and the assessment of potential lateral gene transfer.
AB  == using the yeast two-hybrid system, intraspecific protein interactions were detected in streptococcus iniae and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris between the transmembrane activation protein (cpsc and epsa, respectively) and the protein tyrosine kinase (cpsd and epsb, respectively), between two protein tyrosine kinases, and between the protein tyrosine kinase and the phosphotyrosine phosphatase (cpsb and epsc, respectively). for each of these intraspecific interactions, interspecific interactions were also detected when one protein was  from s. iniae and the other was from streptococcus thermophilus . interactions were also observed between two protein tyrosine kinases when one protein was from either of the streptococcus species and the other from l. lactis subsp. cremoris. the results and sequence comparisons performed in this study support the conclusion that interactions among the components of the tyrosine kinase - phosphatase regulatory system are conserved in the order lactobacillales and that interspecific genetic exchanges of the genes that encode these proteins have the  potential to form functional recombinants. a better understanding of intraspecific and interspecific protein interactions involved in regulating exopolysaccharide biosynthesis may facilitate construction of improved strains for industrial uses as well as identification of factors needed to form functional regulatory complexes in naturally occurring recombinants.

TI  == the impact of a consortium of fermented milk strains on the gut microbiome of gnotobiotic mice and monozygotic twins.
AB  == understanding how the human gut microbiota and host are affected by probiotic bacterial strains requires carefully controlled studies in humans and in mouse models of the gut ecosystem where potentially confounding variables that are difficult to control in humans can be constrained. therefore, we characterized the fecal microbiomes and metatranscriptomes of adult female monozygotic twin pairs through repeated sampling 4 weeks before, 7 weeks during, and 4 weeks after consumption of a commercially available fermented milk product (fmp) containing a consortium of bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis, two strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris,  and streptococcus thermophilus. in addition, gnotobiotic mice harboring a 15-species model human gut microbiota whose genomes contain 58,399 known or predicted protein-coding genes were studied before and after gavage with all five sequenced fmp strains. no significant changes in bacterial species composition or in the proportional representation of genes encoding known enzymes were observed  in the feces of humans consuming the fmp. only minimal changes in microbiota configuration were noted in mice after single or repeated gavage with the fmp consortium. however, rna-seq analysis of fecal samples and follow-up mass spectrometry of urinary metabolites disclosed that introducing the fmp strains into mice results in significant changes in expression of microbiome-encoded enzymes involved in numerous metabolic pathways, most prominently those related to carbohydrate metabolism. b. animalis subsp. lactis, the dominant persistent member of the fmp consortium in gnotobiotic mice, up-regulates a locus in vivo that is involved in the catabolism of xylooligosaccharides, a class of glycans widely distributed in fruits, vegetables, and other foods, underscoring the importance of these sugars to this bacterial species. the human fecal metatranscriptome exhibited significant changes, confined to the period of fmp consumption, that mirror changes in gnotobiotic mice, including those related to  plant polysaccharide metabolism. these experiments illustrate a translational research pipeline for characterizing the effects of fmps on the human gut microbiome.

TI  == utilization of uf-permeate for production of beta-galactosidase by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == four lactobacilli strains (lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacilus casei and lactobacillus reuteri) were grown in mrs broth and three lactococci strains (streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis  and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetilactis) were grown in m17 broth. l. reuteri and s. thermophilus were chosen on the basis of the best mean beta-galactosidase activity of 10.44 and 10.01 u/ml respectively, for further studies on permeate-based medium. the maximum production of beta-galactosidase by l. reuteri was achieved at lactose concentration of 6%, initial ph 5.0-7.5, ammonium phosphate as nitrogen source at a concentration of 0.66 g n/l and incubation temperature at 30 degrees c/24 hrs to give 6.31 u/ml. while in case of s. thermophilus, maximum beta-galactosidase production was achieved at 10% lactose concentration of permeate medium, supplemented with phosphate buffer ratio of 0.5:0.5 (kh2po4:k2hpo4, g/l), at initial ph 6.0-6.5, ammonium phosphate  (0.66g n/l) as nitrogen source and incubation temperature 35 degrees c for 24 hrs to give 7.85 u/ml.

TI  == culture-independent detection of microorganisms in traditional slovakian bryndza  cheese.
AB  == in order to investigate the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese (a cheese containing unpasteurized or pasteurized ewes' milk component) by a culture-independent method, dna was extracted directly from 7 bryndza samples and analysed by an innovative method. using the universal prokaryotic and fungal primers, ribosomal dna internal transcribed spacer (its) regions with variable length were amplified. the standard universal reverse primer l1 aligning to bacterial 23s rdna was found unsuitable for some lactic acid bacteria and other species based on in silico analysis. therefore, l1 primer was replaced by a combination of novel primers gplusr and gminusr aligning to the adjacent, more conserved dna region. the amplification profiles were visualised by both standard electrophoresis and by fluorescent capillary gel electrophoresis. from representative samples, major amplicons were excised from the gel, cloned and sequenced. sequencing revealed that the samples contained lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus brevis, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, streptococcus macedonicus, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, debaromyces hansenii, mucor fragilis, yarrowia lipolytica and galactomyces geotrichum. these results represent an extension of the knowledge on the microflora of slovakian bryndza cheese. the introduced automated ribosomal dna intergenic spacer analysis of the bacterial and fungal genomes proved to be very effective in the application of studying microflora of cheese.

TI  == short communication: characterization of microflora in mexican chihuahua cheese.
AB  == this work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in mexico using 16s rrna gene analysis. as expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including escherichia coli and  staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in  9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent  being lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. leuconostoc mesenteroides and streptococcus macedonicus were identified  in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional chihuahua  cheese attributes.

TI  == diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with traditional fermented dairy products in mongolia.
AB  == spontaneous milk fermentation has a long history in mongolia, and beneficial microorganisms have been handed down from one generation to the next for use in fermented dairy products. the objective of this study was to investigate the diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in fermented yak, mare, goat, and cow milk products by analyzing 189 samples collected from 13 different regions in mongolia. the lab counts in these samples varied from 3.41 to 9.03 log cfu/ml. fermented yak and mare milks had almost identical mean numbers of lab, which were significantly higher than those in fermented goat milk but slightly lower than those in fermented cow milk. in total, 668 isolates were obtained from these samples using de man, rogosa, and sharpe agar and m17 agar. each isolate was considered to be presumptive lab based on gram-positive and catalase-negative properties, and was identified at the species level by 16s rrna gene sequencing,  multiplex pcr assay, and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. all isolates from mongolian dairy products were accurately identified as enterococcus faecalis (1 strain), enterococcus durans (3 strains), lactobacillus brevis (3 strains), lactobacillus buchneri (2 strains), lactobacillus casei (16 strains), lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus (142 strains), lactobacillus diolivorans (17 strains), lactobacillus fermentum (42 strains), lactobacillus helveticus (183 strains), lactobacillus kefiri (6 strains), lactobacillus plantarum ssp. plantarum (7 strains), lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis (7 strains), leuconostoc lactis (22 strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides (21 strains), streptococcus thermophilus (195 strains), and weissella cibaria (1 strain). the predominant lab were strep. thermophilus and lb. helveticus, which were isolated  from all sampling sites. the results demonstrate that traditional fermented dairy products from different regions of mongolia have complex compositions of lab species. such diversity of lab provides useful information for further studies of probiotic strain selection and starter culture design, with regard to the industrial production of traditional fermented milk.

TI  == typing of bacteriophages by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr to assess genetic diversity.
AB  == the recent boom in phage therapy and phage biocontrol requires the design of suitable cocktails of genetically different bacteriophages. the current methods for typing phages need significant quantities of purified dna, may require a priori genetic information and are cost and time consuming. we have evaluated the randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr technique to produce unique and reproducible band patterns from 26 different bacteriophages infecting staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, streptococcus thermophilus, bacillus subtilis and lactobacillus casei bacterial strains. initially, purified dna and phage suspensions of seven selected phages were used as a template. the conditions that were found to be optimal 8 mum of 10-mer primers, 3 mum magnesium oxalacetate and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide. the rapd genomic fingerprints using a phage titer suspension higher than 10(9) pfu ml(-1) were highly reproducible. clustering by the pearson correlation coefficient and the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages clustering algorithm correlated largely with genetically different phages infecting the same bacterial species, although closely related phages with a similar dna restriction pattern were indistinguishable. the results support the use of rapd-pcr for quick typing of phage isolates and preliminary assessment of  their genetic diversity bypassing tedious dna purification protocols and previous knowledge of their sequence.

TI  == poly(dimethyl siloxane) surface modification with biosurfactants isolated from probiotic strains.
AB  == depending on the final application envisaged for a given biomaterial, many surfaces must be modified before use. the material performance in a biological environment is mainly mediated by its surface properties that can be improved using suitable modification methods. the aim of this work was to coat poly(dimethyl siloxane) (pdms) surfaces with biosurfactants (bss) and to evaluate how these compounds affect the pdms surface properties. bss isolated from four probiotic strains (lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus paracasei, streptococcus thermophilus a, and streptococcus thermophilus b) were used. bare pdms and pdms coated with bss were characterized by contact angle measurements, infrared spectroscopy (atr-ftir), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps), and atomic force microscopy (afm). the influence of the surface modifications on the materials blood compatibility was studied through thrombosis and hemolysis assays. the cytotoxicity of these materials was tested against rat peritoneal macrophages. afm results demonstrated the successful coating of the surfaces. also, by contact angle measurements, an increase of the coated surfaces hydrophilicity was seen. furthermore, xps analysis indicated a decrease of the silicon content at the surface, and atr-ftir results showed the presence of bs characteristic groups as  a consequence of the modification. all the studied materials revealed no toxicity and were found to be nonhemolytic. the proposed approach for the modification of  pdms surfaces was found to be effective and opens new possibilities for the application of these surfaces in the biomedical field.

AB  == a pentaplex pcr assay for the rapid, selective and simultaneous detection of lactobacillus helveticus, l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, and l. fermentum, was developed. the target sequences were a group of genes coding for beta-galactosidase production (s. thermophilus and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), for cell-enveloped associated proteinase synthesis (l. helveticus), for dipeptide transport system production (l. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and for arginine-ornithine antiporter protein production (l. fermentum). the analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated with 5 reference strains and 140 lactic acid bacterial strains derived  from raw milk cheeses and belonging to the lactobacillus, streptococcus, lactococcus and enterococcus genera. the identification limit for each target strain was 10(3)cfu/ml. this new molecular assay was used to investigate the lab  population by direct extraction of dna from the 12 whey cultures for grana padano. the pentaplex pcr assay revealed a good correspondence with microbiological analyses and allowed to identify even minor lab community members which, can be out-competed in vitro by numerically more abundant microbial species.

TI  == hdcb, a novel enzyme catalysing maturation of pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase.
AB  == pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylases are produced as proenzymes that mature by cleavage followed by formation of the pyruvoyl prosthetic group. the histidine decarboxylation pathway of streptococcus thermophilus chcc1524 that consists of the pyruvoyl-dependent histidine decarboxylase hdca and the histidine/histamine exchanger hdcp was functionally expressed in lactococcus lactis. the operon encoding the pathway contains in addition to the hdca and hdcp genes a third gene hdcb. expression of different combinations of the genes in l.  lactis and escherichia coli followed by analysis of the protein products demonstrated the involvement of hdcb in the cleavage of the hdca proenzyme. the hdca proenzyme and hdcb protein were purified to homogeneity and cleavage and activation of the histidine decarboxylase activity was demonstrated in vitro. substoichiometric amounts of hdcb were required to cleave hdca showing that hdcb  functions as an enzyme. in agreement, expression levels of hdcb in the cells were low relative to those of hdca. the turnover number of hdcb in vitro was extremely low (0.05 min(-)(1)) which was due to a very slow association/dissociation of the enzyme/substrate complex. in fact, hdcb was shown to co-purify both with the hdca s82a mutant that mimics the proenzyme and with the mature hdca complex.

TI  == ftir-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional greek graviera cheese.
AB  == this study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (fourier transformed infra-red [ftir] spectroscopy) and molecular (rflp and sscp analysis of 16s rrna  genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (lab) flora present in traditional greek graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. a total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of tsaye (incubated at 30 degrees c), m-17 (22 degrees c) and m-17 (42 degrees c) agar media were clustered by ftir and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by  all methods. based on their ftir spectra, 282 isolates were lab grouped in 28 clusters. the lab species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and lactococcus lactis (0.7%). also, staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from tsaye. comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the lab species identified. the present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid ftir screening of 10-fold more  isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant lab species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.

TI  == microbial diversity, dynamics and activity throughout manufacturing and ripening  of castelmagno pdo cheese.
AB  == the diversity, dynamics and activity of castelmagno pdo cheese microbiota were studied in three batches produced in a floor valley farm, in the grana valley (northwest italy), during the wintertime. samples of milk, curd and cheese (core  and subsurface) at different ripening time were submitted to both culture-dependent and -independent analysis. in particular, dna and rna directly  extracted from the matrices were studied by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and reverse transcription (rt)-pcr-dgge. culture-dependent methods highlighted the initial dominance of a thermophilic streptococcal population with the species streptococcus thermophilus and s. agalactiae. then, mesophilic lactococci occurred among isolates during manufacturing, with lactococcus lactis which was also well represented in the first month of castelmagno pdo ripening. at this point and throughout the ripening, lactobacilli prevailed in cheese samples, represented from lactobacillus plantarum and lb. casei. culture-independent analysis underlined the undoubted role of l. lactis, actively involved in both castelmagno pdo manufacturing and ripening. despite lb. helveticus was never isolated on selective media, a dgge band referred to this microorganism was detected, at rna level, in samples from ripened cheeses. on the other hand, lb. plantarum was widely isolated from the plates, among lactobacilli, but never detected by direct analysis. due to the importance of microbiota in the sensory richness and properties of traditional cheeses, new information have been added, in this work, on microbial diversity of castelmagno  pdo cheese.

TI  == microbial stability and safety of traditional greek graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  == the microflora of four batches of traditional greek graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. the cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known lab bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by pcr. all batches were safe according to the european union regulatory criteria for listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. the cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant lab from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. sixteen e. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. in accordance, enterocin b gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin p gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin a, b, p, 31, l50a, and l50b genes. plantaricin a gene  was also amplified from all cheeses. mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional graviera cheese products, with lab bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.

TI  == role of antioxidant enzymes in bacterial resistance to organic acids.
AB  == growth in aerobic environments has been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ros) and to cause oxidative stress in most organisms. antioxidant enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutases and hydroperoxidases) and dna repair mechanisms provide protection against ros. acid stress has been shown to be associated with the induction of mn superoxide dismutase (mnsod) in lactococcus lactis and staphylococcus aureus. however, the relationship between acid stress and oxidative stress is not well understood. in the present study, we showed that mutations in the gene coding for mnsod (soda) increased the toxicity of lactic acid at ph 3.5 in streptococcus thermophilus. the inclusion of the iron chelators 2,2'-dipyridyl (dip), diethienetriamine-pentaacetic acid (dtpa), and o-phenanthroline (o-phe) provided partial protection against 330 mm lactic acid at ph 3.5. the results suggested that acid stress triggers an iron-mediated oxidative stress that can be ameliorated by mnsod and iron chelators. these findings were further validated in escherichia coli strains lacking both mnsod and iron sod (fesod) but expressing a heterologous mnsod from s. thermophilus. we also found that, in e. coli, fesod did not provide the same protection afforded by mnsod and that hydroperoxidases are equally important in protecting the cells  against acid stress. these findings may explain the ability of some microorganisms to survive better in acidified environments, as in acid foods, during fermentation and accumulation of lactic acid or during passage through the low ph of the stomach.

AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the dominant bacterial population during the manufacture and the ripening of two artisanal pecorino crotonese cheeses, provided by different farms, were investigated by the combination of culture-dependent and -independent approaches. three hundred and thirty-three strains were isolated from selective culture media, clustered using restriction fragment length polymorphism and were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing. the results indicate a decrease in biodiversity during ripening, revealing the presence of lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus species in the curd and in aged cheese samples and the occurrence of several lactobacilli throughout  cheese ripening, with the dominance of lactobacillus rhamnosus species. bacterial dynamics determined by denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise description of the distribution of bacteria, highlighting differences in  the bacterial community among cheese samples, and allowed to detect lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus buchneri and leuconostoc mesenteroides species, which were not isolated. moreover, the concentration of flavour compounds produced throughout cheese ripening was investigated and related to lactic acid bacteria presence. fifty-seven compounds were identified in the volatile fraction of pecorino crotonese cheeses by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. esters, alcohols and free fatty acids were the most abundant compounds, while aldehydes and hydrocarbons were present at low levels.

TI  == characterization of a novel lysm domain from lactobacillus fermentum bacteriophage endolysin and its use as an anchor to display heterologous proteins on the surfaces of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the endolysin lyb5, from lactobacillus fermentum temperate bacteriophage phipyb5, showed a broad lytic spectrum against gram-positive as well as gram-negative bacteria. sequence analysis revealed that the c terminus of the endolysin lyb5 (ly5c) contained three putative lysin motif (lysm) repeat regions, implying that  ly5c was involved in bacterial cell wall binding. to investigate the potential of ly5c for surface display, green fluorescent protein (gfp) was fused to ly5c at its n or c terminus and the resulting fusion proteins were expressed in escherichia coli. after being mixed with various cells in vitro, gfp was successfully displayed on the surfaces of lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus casei, lb. brevis, lb. plantarum, lb. fermentum, lb. delbrueckii, lb. helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus cells. increases in the fluorescence intensities of chemically pretreated l. lactis and lb. casei cells compared to those of nonpretreated cells suggested that the peptidoglycan was the binding ligand for ly5c. moreover, the ph and concentration of sodium chloride were optimized to enhance the binding capacity of gfp-ly5c, and high-intensity fluorescence of cells was observed under optimal conditions. all results suggested that ly5c was  a novel anchor for constructing a surface display system for lactic acid bacteria (lab). to demonstrate the applicability of the ly5c-mediated surface display system, beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from paenibacillus sp. strain k1, replacing gfp, was functionally displayed on the surfaces of lab cells via ly5c. the success in surface display of gfp and beta-gal opened up the feasibility of employing the cell wall anchor of bacteriophage endolysin for surface display in  lab.

TI  == antibiotic resistance of probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from  marketed foods and drugs.
AB  == objective: to identify the antimicrobial resistance of commercial lactic acid bacteria present in microbial foods and drug additives by analyzing their isolated strains used for fermentation and probiotics. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility of 41 screened isolates was tested with disc diffusion and e-test  methods after species-level identification. resistant strains were selected and examined for the presence of resistance genes by pcr. results: distribution of resistance was found in different species. all isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and imipenem. in addition, isolates resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, bacitracin, and erythromycin were detected, although the incidence of resistance to these antibiotics was relatively low. in contrast, most strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. the genes msrc, vanx, and dfra were detected in strains of enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis. conclusion: antibiotic resistance is present in different species of probiotic strains, which poses a threat to food safety. evaluation of the safety of lactic acid bacteria for human consumption should be guided by established criteria, guidelines and regulations.

TI  == nisin-induced expression of pediocin in dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to test whether a single vector, nisin-controlled expression (nice) system  could be used to regulate expression of the pediocin operon in streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and lactobacillus casei. methods and results: the intact pediocin operon was cloned immediately into pmsp3535 downstream of the nisa promoter (pnisa). the resulting vector, prsnped, was electrotransformed into strep. thermophilus st128, l. lactis subsp. lactis ml3 and lact. casei c2. presence of the intact vector was confirmed by pcr, resulting in the amplification of a 0.8-kb dna fragment, and inhibition zones were observed for all lactic acid bacteria (lab) transformants following induction with 50 ng ml(-1) nisin, when listeria monocytogenes scott a was used as the target bacterium. using l. monocytogenes nr30 as target, the l. lactis transformants produced hazy zones of inhibition, while the lact. casei transformants produced clear zones of inhibition. zones of inhibition were not observed when the strep.  thermophilus transformants were tested against nr30. conclusions: the lab hosts were able to produce enough pediocin to inhibit the growth of l. monocytogenes scott a; the growth of l. monocytogenes nr30 was effectively inhibited only by the lact. casei transformants. significance and impact of the study: this is the  first time that the nice system has been used to express the intact pediocin operon in these lab hosts. this system could allow for the in situ production of  pediocin in fermented dairy foods supplemented with nisin to prevent listeria contamination.

TI  == diversity and evolution of the microbial populations during manufacture and ripening of casin, a traditional spanish, starter-free cheese made from cow's milk.
AB  == classical culturing and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) techniques have been used for studying the microbial diversity and dynamics of the traditional spanish casin cheese during manufacturing and ripening. as with other starter-free cheeses made from raw milk, the microbial diversity of casin was shown to be high by both culturing and dgge analyses. the culture technique showed that lactic acid bacteria (lab) species constituted the majority of the microbial populations. of the 14 bacterial species identified, lactococcus garvieae was predominant in the three-day-old cheese sample, although it was replaced by lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis at day 30. as expected, the dgge profiles obtained were complex, consisting, depending on the sample, in five to ten different amplification bands. among these, a band corresponding to streptococcus thermophilus was observed throughout the whole manufacturing process. this species had never been identified from traditional spanish cheeses  previously. culturing and molecular methods showed high populations of undesirable microorganisms, arguing for a required improvement in the hygiene of  casin manufacture. random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd) profiling suggested that the l. garvieae and l. lactis populations were composed of one and five strains, respectively. in addition, only a single l. lactis rapd pattern was stably maintained from day three to day 30, indicating high succession of strains along ripening. after a thoroughly characterisation, strains of the two lactococcus species could be used in designing specific starter cultures for casin. additional species (such as lactobacillus plantarum and corynebacterium variabile) might be included as adjunct cultures.

TI  == heterologous expression of the bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase in escherichia coli and lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the major objective of the present study is to change the alanine production of lactic acid bacteria by expression of bacillus subtilis (natto) alanine dehydrogenase (aladh), the gene that is not present in lactic acid. b. subtilis aladh gene (ald) was cloned into a pgex6p-1 and expressed in e. coli jm109. its enzyme activity was 48.3u/mg at 30 degrees c and 45.2u/mg at 42 degrees c. this ald gene was then cloned into a vector pnz8148 to generate a vector pnz8148/ald.  the same ald gene was placed downstream of the ldh promoter from streptococcus thermophilus to generate pnz273/ldhp/ald. the pnz8148/ald and pnz273/ldhp/ald were introduced separately in lactococcus lactis nz9000. as a result of over-expressed ald, the production of alanine detected by hplc in l. lactis nz9000 carrying pnz273/ldhp/ald reached 52mug/ml, an approximately 26-fold increase compared to the parent strain l. lactis nz9000, but not in l. lactis nz9000 carrying pnz8148/ald. this study would help strain improvement to be used  in dairy fermentation for developing healthy yogurts with sweet taste or other fermented dairy foods.

TI  == improvement of constipation and liver function by plant-derived lactic acid bacteria: a double-blind, randomized trial.
AB  == objective: lactic acid bacteria (lab) contribute to human health; however, the probiotic properties vary among strains classified into the same species. the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of yogurts made by different types of lab on the gastrointestinal system. the yogurts were also evaluated by measuring serum lipid contents and liver functional indicators as a  secondary objective. methods: healthy human adults (n = 68) with some complaints  with regard to intestinal health, including constipation and diarrhea, were randomly assigned to receive one of three types of yogurt in a double-blind manner: type a, a yogurt made by plant-derived lab (mainly lactobacillus [lb.] plantarum sn35n); type b, a yogurt made by plant-derived lab (mainly lb. plantarum sn13t); and type c, a yogurt made by animal-derived lab (mainly lactococcus lactis a6 and streptococcus thermophilus 510) as a control. the subjects consumed 100 g of yogurt daily for 6 wk. data were collected from clinical visits at 2-wk intervals and by diaries used to record defecation and health conditions. results: drastic and constant increments of defecation frequency in subjects with constipation were observed with type a and b yogurts but not with type c yogurt. type b and c yogurts resulted in decreases in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. the serum concentrations of liver functional parameters were improved by the type b yogurt (12-25% reduction). conclusion: the present study suggests that lb. plantarum sn13t exhibits a superior probiotic effect on constipation in addition to improving the serum lipid contents and liver function.

TI  == possible promoter regions within the proteolytic system in streptococcus thermophilus and their interaction with the cody homolog.
AB  == possible promoter regions preceding 14 genes belonging to the proteolytic system  of streptococcus thermophilus klds 3.0503 were predicted by a promoter analysis software nnpp. the 14 genes included an extracellular protease gene prts, an oligopeptide abc transport system gene amia1, and 12 genes, respectively, encoding peptidases pepa, peps, pepn, pepc, pepb, pepq, pepv, pept, pepm, pepxp,  pepp, and pepo. these predicted promoter sequences were cloned and inserted into  the upstream of a promoterless escherichia coli gusa (beta-glucuronidase) gene in a promoter probe vector pnz273. the resulting vectors were, respectively, introduced into s. thermophilus klds 3.0503 and all 14 predicted promoter sequences were able to drive gusa expression, which indicated that these sequences were functional promoters. these promoters were able to interact with the s. thermophilus cody homolog in an in vitro dna binding assay but they did not contain a conserved cody-box sequence identified in lactococcus lactis. these results were useful for further studies on the regulation of protein metabolism in s. thermophilus.

TI  == bacterial diversity of darfiyeh, a lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  == in order to contribute to the preservation of the lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety  made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. three independent batches of darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (lab) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. in order to explore the darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. the latter included polymerase chain reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge), classical pcr and quantitative pcr. these methods revealed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus malodoratus, group d streptococcus sp., lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and l. lactis subsp. cremoris, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus curvatus, staphylococcus haemolyticus, escherichia coli, clostridium sp./eubacterium tenue. real-time pcr  enabled quantification of e. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. the present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of lebanese artisanal dairy products.

TI  == characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and dna identification of atypical lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. by combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16s rrna gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west algeria. forty strains phenotypically related to cocci lab were identified as belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, and other enterococcus species. no streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. in particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% nacl, at ph 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.

TI  == a dna array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  == an oligonucleotide array based on pcr method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the  simultaneous identification of 14 lactic acid bacteria (lab) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. the hypervariable regions v3 and v6 of 16s, together with a variable region of 23s rrna genes and several genes specific for  virulence factors were selected. universal primers and multiplex pcr were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. the dominant species such as streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, andleuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dutps. the results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic dna from campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, salmonella thyphimurium, listeria monocytogenes and yersinia enterocolitica. a clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility testing of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria by broth microdilution method and etest.
AB  == we applied two methods of broth microdilution and etest for measuring minimal inhibition concentration (mic) of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria for 15  antimicrobial agents to compare the feasibility, reproducibility, and equivalence of the two methods. both methods were originally described by the european projects prosafe and ace-art. in 84% combinations of strains and antimicrobial agents mic differences between the two methods were within one log(2) dilution. in the case of rifampicin the difference between the two methods was more than ten-fold. we further determined mics of 70 strains (14 strains of lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, 16 strains of lactococcus lactis, 30 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and 10 strains of bifidobacterium longum) by the broth microdilution method. in most cases, mic distributions were uni-modal and within 5 log(2) dilutions except for the mic distribution of l. lactis to the aminoglycoside group which was broader. these data are a good basis for improving knowledge of antimicrobial susceptibility of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria, and can be used to revise tentative epidemiological cut-off values.

AB  == in this report, we describe the amino acid metabolism and amino acid dependency of the dairy bacterium streptococcus thermophilus lmg18311 and compare them with  those of two other characterized lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis and lactobacillus plantarum. through the construction of a genome-scale metabolic model of s. thermophilus, the metabolic differences between the three bacteria were visualized by direct projection on a metabolic map. the comparative analysis revealed the minimal amino acid auxotrophy (only histidine and methionine or cysteine) of s. thermophilus lmg18311 and the broad variety of volatiles produced from amino acids compared to the other two bacteria. it also revealed the limited number of pyruvate branches, forcing this strain to use the homofermentative metabolism for growth optimization. in addition, some industrially relevant features could be identified in s. thermophilus, such as the unique pathway for acetaldehyde (yogurt flavor) production and the absence of a complete pentose phosphate pathway.

TI  == study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  == the bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. total microbial dna was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template  in polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to study the hypervariable v3 region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). representative bands of dgge patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. the use of universal primer for pcr-dgge allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also  for other adventitious species. dgge profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. cluster analysis of dgge profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. some lactic acid bacteria (lab) recurred in many  samples (streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. the microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant lab but also adventitious bacteria (macrococcus caseolyticus, rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (chryseobacterium spp., pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees c of coagulated milk. pantoea spp. was primarily  found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of e. faecium, e. faecalis and s. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. these species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.

TI  == conjugative transfer of the integrative conjugative elements icest1 and icest3 from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == integrative and conjugative elements (ices), also called conjugative transposons, are genomic islands that excise, self-transfer by conjugation, and integrate in the genome of the recipient bacterium. the current investigation shows the intraspecies conjugative transfer of the first described ices in streptococcus thermophilus, icest1 and icest3. mitomycin c, a dna-damaging agent, derepresses icest3 conjugative transfer almost 25-fold. the icest3 host range was determined  using various members of the firmicutes as recipients. whereas numerous icest3 transconjugants of streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis were recovered, only one transconjugant of lactococcus lactis was obtained. the newly  incoming ices, except the one from l. lactis, are site-specifically integrated into the 3' end of the fda gene and are still able to excise in these transconjugants. furthermore, icest3 was retransferred from e. faecalis to s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmids carrying different parts of the icest1 recombination module were used to show that the integrase gene is required for the site-specific integration and excision of the ices, whereas the excisionase gene is required for the site-specific excision only.

TI  == maturing dynamics of surface microflora in fontina pdo cheese studied by culture-dependent and -independent methods.
AB  == aims: to study the evolution of rind microbial communities in fontina pdo cheese. methods and results: four batches were examined for their surface microflora during ripening, carried out in two different maturing caves, at ollomont and pre-saint-didier, aosta valley region, northwest of italy. culture-dependent methodologies were combined with culture-independent analysis (pcr-dgge). yeasts  were found to increase from 10(3) to 10(6) cfu cm(-2) in 28 days, with consequent rise of surface ph, which allowed the growth of salt-tolerant bacteria, in particular coryneforms which reached 10(9) cfu cm(-2) at the end of 3 months. coagulase-negative cocci and lactic acid bacteria reached 10(7) cfu cm(-2) in the same period. debaryomyces hansenii and candida sake were the species more constantly present throughout the whole maturing process. as early as after 1 day since manufacture, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and streptococcus thermophilus were detected on cheese rinds. arthrobacter nicotianae, brevibacterium casei and corynebacterium glutamicum were found after 7-28 days. conclusions: according to cluster analysis of dgge profiles, the maturing environment seemed to influence the dynamics of microbial groups on fontina surfaces. significance and impact of the study: these results represent a first picture of micro-organisms colonizing fontina pdo rinds. further studies are in progress to better understand the origin of this surface microflora and to formulate surface starters.

TI  == short communication: impact of ph and temperature on the acidifying activity of carnobacterium maltaromaticum.
AB  == the acidifying activity of carnobacterium maltaromaticum lma28, a strain isolated from french soft cheese, was studied in trypticase soy broth with yeast extract (tsb-ye) medium and in milk. in tsb-ye supplemented with lactose, glucose, or galactose, lactose and glucose were metabolized with a maximum growth rate of 0.32 h(-1) and galactose was not metabolized. during hydrolysis of lactose, the galactose moiety was not excreted. the major product was l(+) lactic acid, with no significant difference in the lactic acid yield. glucose was not completely metabolized because cell growth stopped when ph values reached an average of 5.0. in sterilized uht milk, the addition of 1 g/l of ye enhanced its coagulation. compared with commercial starter lactic acid bacteria such as lactococcus lactis  dsmz 20481 or streptococcus thermophilus inra 302, carnobacterium maltaromaticum  lma 28 was shown to be a slow acidifying strain. however, in spite of this weak acidifying ability, c. maltaromaticum lma 28 can sustain low ph values in coculture with lc. lactis dsmz 20481 or s. thermophilus inra 302. the individual  and interactive effects of initial ph values (5.2 to 8.0) and incubation temperatures (23 to 37 degrees c) on acidifying activity were studied by response surface methodology. the 3 strains displayed different behaviors depending on ph  and temperature. the psychrotrophic lactic acid strain c. maltaromaticum lma 28 was able to grow at alkaline ph values and during storage conditions. it could be used as a potential ripening flora in soft cheese.

TI  == potentially probiotic bacteria induce efficient maturation but differential cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells.
AB  == aim: to analyze the ability of nine different potentially probiotic bacteria to induce maturation and cytokine production in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (modcs). methods: cytokine production and maturation of modcs in response to bacterial stimulation was analyzed with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and flow cytometric analysis (facs), respectively. the kinetics of mrna expression of cytokine genes was determined by northern blotting. the involvement of different signaling pathways in cytokine gene expression was studied using specific pharmacological signaling inhibitors. results: all studied bacteria induced the maturation of modcs in a dose-dependent manner. more detailed analysis with s. thermophilus ths, b. breve bb99, and l. lactis subsp. cremoris arh74 indicated that these bacteria induced the expression of modc maturation markers hla class ii and cd86 as efficiently as pathogenic bacteria. however, these bacteria differed in their ability to induce modc cytokine gene expression. s. thermophilus induced the expression of pro-inflammatory (tnf-alpha, il-12, il-6, and ccl20) and th1 type (il-12 and ifn-gamma) cytokines, while b. breve and l. lactis were also potent inducers of anti-inflammatory il-10. mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) p38, phosphatidylinositol 3 (pi3) kinase, and nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) signaling pathways were shown to be involved in bacteria-induced cytokine production. conclusion: our results indicate that potentially probiotic bacteria are able to induce modc maturation, but their ability to induce cytokine gene expression varies significantly from one bacterial strain to another.

TI  == polyphasic approach to bacterial dynamics during the ripening of spanish farmhouse cheese, using culture-dependent and -independent methods.
AB  == we studied the dynamics of the microbial population during ripening of cueva de la magaha cheese using a combination of classical and molecular techniques. samples taken during ripening of this spanish goat's milk cheese in which lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus were used as starter cultures were analyzed. all bacterial isolates were clustered by using randomly amplified  polymorphic dna (rapd) and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing, species-specific pcr, and multiplex pcr. our results indicate that the majority of the 225 strains isolated and enumerated on solid media during the ripening period were nonstarter lactic acid bacteria, and lactobacillus paracasei was the  most abundant species. other lactobacillus species, such as lactobacillus plantarum and lactobacillus parabuchneri, were also detected at the beginning and end of ripening, respectively. non-lactic-acid bacteria, mainly kocuria and staphylococcus strains, were also detected at the end of the ripening period. microbial community dynamics determined by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis provided a more precise estimate of the distribution of bacteria  and enabled us to detect lactobacillus curvatus and the starter bacteria s. thermophilus and l. lactis, which were not isolated. surprisingly, the bacterium  most frequently found using culture-dependent analysis, l. paracasei, was scarcely detected by this molecular approach. finally, we studied the composition of the lactobacilli and their evolution by using length heterogeneity pcr.

AB  == the objective of this study was to determine i) if camembert cheese micro-organisms could be detected in fecal samples after regular consumption by human subjects and ii) the consequence of this consumption on global metabolic activities of the host colonic microbiota. an open human protocol was designed where 12 healthy volunteers were included: a 2-week period of fermented products  exclusion followed by a 4-weeks camembert ingestion period where 2x40 g/day of camembert cheese was consumed. stools were collected from the volunteers before consumption, twice during the ingestion period (2nd and 4th week) and once after  a wash out period of 2 weeks. during the consumption of camembert cheese, high levels of lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides were measured in fecal samples using real-time quantitative pcr, reaching median values of 8.2 and 7.5 log(10) genome equivalents/g of stool. for ln. mesenteroides, persistence was observed 15 days after the end of camembert consumption. the survival of geotrichum candidum was also assessed and the fecal concentration reached a median level of 7.1 log(10) cfu/g in stools. except a decreasing trend of the nitrate reductase activity, no significant modification was shown in the metabolic activities during this study.

TI  == microbial diversity in natural whey cultures used for the production of caciocavallo silano pdo cheese.
AB  == the microbial diversity of sixty-three natural whey cultures (nwcs) for the manufacture of caciocavallo silano cheese pdo was studied. the nwcs were collected from different dairies covering the whole territory of pdo production including five different regions of southern italy. the microbial species diversity was determined by direct dna extraction from nwcs and polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) amplification of variable regions of the 16s rrna gene followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dhplc). dgge and dhplc fingerprinting yielded the same results in terms of number of bands/peaks and specific migration/retention time of the amplicons. the dhplc technique was used in this study for the first time to assess a food-related mixed microbial community by a culture-independent approach and proved to be at least as effective as dgge in profiling species diversity in nwcs. cluster analysis of dgge and dhplc data revealed that the species-related groups of similarity were not dependent on the geographical origin of the nwcs. the presence of three groups of 10-14 nwcs at 100% of species similarity indicated that some species associations are very commonly occurring in the nwcs for caciocavallo silano cheese pdo. a rapd-pcr analysis of the nwcs was also performed for the members of the above groups and it showed that, though characterized by the same species diversity, most of the identical nwcs included  different biotypes. the sequences of dgge bands and dhplc peaks revealed the occurrence of mainly thermophilic lactic acid bacteria such as lactobacillus delbrueckii, l. helveticus and streptococcus thermophilus even though the mesophilic lactococcus lactis also occurred in some nwcs. in conclusion, the results of this study indicate that the microbial diversity of nwcs used for the  caciocavallo silano pdo cheese is not high, it is not dependent on the geographical origin and the same microbial species occur within the territory examined. the microbiota of fermented pdo products and its possible link with territory should be studied case by case in order to have useful evidences for the assessment of product quality and authenticity.

TI  == diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  == exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy streptococcus species s. thermophilus, s. macedonicus and s. salivarius, were exposed to acid,  osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. three strains of dairy related streptococci, lactococcus lactis atcc11454, enterococcus faecium dsm20477 and enterococcus faecalis dsm20478, were included for comparison purposes. acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrilamide gel electrophoresis, respectively. all  strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. with a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. for some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses.  matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect  of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (dnak, gpre, groel, and groes) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between  stress response and band intensity was evident.

AB  == the effect of six wild strains on the volatile profile of the ps cheese was investigated and compared to that generated from industrial starters generally used to produce ps cheese. all cheeses were subjected to microbiological, physicochemical, and volatile compounds analyses. the dgge of the 16s rdna analysis was also applied. the volatile compounds generated during ripening were  studied through the spme and the gc-ms methods. no difference was detected between the experimental and control cheeses throughout chemical and microbiological analyses, while the dgge results showed the presence of streptococcus thermophilus in all cheeses, and the dominance of enterococcus durans, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus casei in most of the experimental cheeses. moreover, the presence of lactococcus lactis species as in  the control and in the experimental p2 and p4 cheeses was also revealed. the spme results showed more pronounced volatile compounds in the experimental cheese samples than in the control ones.

TI  == [gene regulation to lactic acid bacteria for increasing production of flavor metabolite].
AB  == abstract: the major flavor substances lactic acid bacteria produced include the buttermilk aroma butanedione, the yoghurt flavor acetaldehyde and the amino acid. metabolic engineering in lab had focused primarily on rerouting of pyruvate metabolism towards butanedione or acetaldehyde to improve the flavor of fermented milk, which has considerable economic value. the typical yogurt flavor is caused  by acetaldehyde produced through many different pathways. the attention was focused on one specific reaction for acetaldehyde formation catalyzed by serine hydroxymethyltransferase, which encoded by the glya gene. in addition, the efficient conversion of glucose into acetaldehyde was achieved by over-expression of pyruvate decarboxylase and nadh oxidase in lab. the concentration of acetaldehyde derived from this regulation is higher than the other strategy. as for the regulation of butanedione, it was focused on combinating inactivation of  alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase with low lactate dehydrogenase activity, or with overproduction of nadh-oxidase, or with overproduction of alpha-acetolactate synthase. then the possibility of co-regulation with certain three kinds of enzyme above was recommended.

TI  == the inhibitory spectrum of thermophilin 9 from streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 depends on the production of multiple peptides and the activity of blpg(st), a thiol-disulfide oxidase.
AB  == the blp(st) cluster of streptococcus thermophilus lmd-9 was recently shown to contain all the genetic information required for the production of bacteriocins active against other s. thermophilus strains. in this study, we further investigated the antimicrobial activity of s. thermophilus lmd-9 by testing the susceptibility of 31 bacterial species (87 strains). we showed that lmd-9 displays an inhibitory spectrum targeted toward related gram-positive bacteria, including pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes. using deletion mutants, we investigated the contribution of the three putative bacteriocin-encoding operons  blpd(st)-orf2, blpu(st)-orf3, and blpe(st)-blpf(st) (bac(st) operons) and of the  blpg(st) gene, which encodes a putative modification protein, to the inhibitory spectrum and immunity of strain lmd-9. our results present evidence that the blp(st) locus encodes a multipeptide bacteriocin system called thermophilin 9. among the four class ii bacteriocin-like peptides encoded within the bac(st) operons, blpd(st) alone was sufficient to inhibit the growth of most thermophilin 9-sensitive species. the blpd(st) gene forms an operon with its associated immunity gene(s), and this functional bacteriocin/immunity module could easily be transferred to lactococcus lactis. the remaining three bac(st) peptides, blpu(st), blpe(st), and blpf(st), confer poor antimicrobial activity but act as enhancers of the antagonistic activity of thermophilin 9 by an unknown mechanism. the blpg(st) gene was also shown to be specifically required for the antilisteria activity of thermophilin 9, since its deletion abolished the sensitivities of most listeria species. by complementation of the motility deficiency of escherichia coli dsba, we showed that blpg(st) encodes a functional thiol-disulfide oxidase, suggesting an important role for disulfide bridges within thermophilin 9.

TI  == bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk.
AB  == the aim of this work was to identify the bacterial biodiversity of traditional zabady fermented milk using pcr-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (pcr-ttge) and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). most of the identified bacterial species in zabady samples belonged to lactic acid bacteria (lab), e.g., streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus garvieae, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc citreum, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and lactobacillus johnsonii. using the culture-dependent and independent methods, the streptococcal and lactococcal groups appeared to be the major bacterial species in zabady fermented milk, whereas the lactobacilli were the minor ones. the main dominant species was st. thermophilus followed by lc. garvieae. other molecular tools, e.g., species-specific pcr assay and cloning and sequencing strategy were used to confirm the ttge and dgge results. lc. garvieae, lc. raffinolactis, ln. citreum,  and lb. johnsonii were identified for the first time in this type of egyptian fermented milk.

AB  == the effect of a mixed probiotic culture on instrumental texture, and on sensorial and related properties of minas fresh cheese during refrigerated storage was investigated. three cheese-making trials were prepared: t1, with the traditional  type o starter culture (lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis + l. lactis subsp. cremoris), t2 with only lactic acid and t3, with lactic acid and the probiotic abt culture (lactobacillus acidophilus la-5 + bifidobacterium animalis bb-12 + streptococcus thermophilus). instrumental texture profile analysis and related properties were monitored during storage for up to 21 days. lb. acidophilus and b. animalis were present in high levels throughout storage of cheeses t3, above 6 log cfu.g(-1), threshold required for probiotic activity, and stimulation of the  la-5 growth was observed. cheeses with added probiotic abt culture, as well as those made adding lactic acid only, showed to be less brittle and with more favorable sensorial features, due to higher ph values. results indicated that the use of probiotic abt culture complementary to lactic acid for the purpose of substituting the type o (lc. lactis subsp. lactis + lc. lactis subsp. cremoris) culture, traditionally employed for minas cheese production, is advantageous.

TI  == redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: to verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. methods and results: eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from traditional italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis,  lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus helveticus and pediococcus pentosaceus. it was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential  before the lactobacilli. the reduction rate of enterococcus spp. and l. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and lactobacillus spp. all the p. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. conclusions: the evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. significance and impact of the study: the reduction aptitude of strains might be  used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.

TI  == the extent of co-metabolism of glucose and galactose by lactococcus lactis changes with the expression of the lacsz operon from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the lactose transporter and beta-galactosidase from streptococcus thermophilus, encoded by the lacsz operon, were introduced into the lactose-negative strain lactococcus lactis mg1363 and the expression of the lacsz operon was modulated by substitution of the native promoter with randomized synthetic promoters. a series of strains with various expression levels of lacsz were examined for their fermentation of lactose. strains with a high expression level were found to metabolize lactose in a similar manner to s. thermophilus, i.e. the galactose moiety of lactose was excreted to the growth medium and only glucose was metabolized in glycolysis. interestingly, strains with low expression of the operon showed a mixed acid metabolism and co-metabolism of galactose and glucose. the lactose flux increased gradually with increasing expression of the lacsz operon until an optimum was observed at intermediate beta-galactosidase activities of 2000-3000 miller units. at higher expression levels, the flux decreased. these strains had a glycolytic flux comparable with those of reference strains with the standard lactococcal pts(lac) (lactose phosphotransferase transport system) lactose transporter, which indicates that lactose transport is  not rate-limiting for glycolysis in lactococcus. finally, an additional atp drain was introduced into the fastest growing strain, cs2004, to test whether the atp demand controlled glycolysis under these conditions, but in fact no increase in glycolytic flux was observed.

TI  == optimization of conditions for profiling bacterial populations in food by culture-independent methods.
AB  == in this study we used culture-independent methods to profile bacterial populations in food products. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and  fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) were employed in order to identify bacterial species without the need of isolation and biochemical identification. the protocols used to extract the dna, subsequently subjected to pcr amplification for dgge, as well as the hybridization procedure for fish, were optimised. moreover, an extensive study on the primers and probes to be used for  the direct detection and identification of microorganisms commonly found in food, was carried out. meat and cheese samples, fresh or processed, were subjected to dgge and fish analysis and the results obtained highlighted how the processing in food industry is decreasing the bacterial biodiversity. not only processed cheese or meat but also fermented products were dominated by only one or few species. lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus and brochothrix thermosphacta were the main species found in meat products, while in cheese(s) lactococcus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and leuconostoc spp. were repeatedly detected. the results obtained by the two culture-independent methods used always correlated well.

TI  == comparative sequence analysis of plasmids from lactobacillus delbrueckii and construction of a shuttle cloning vector.
AB  == while plasmids are very commonly associated with the majority of the lactic acid  bacteria, they are only very rarely associated with lactobacillus delbrueckii, with only four characterized to date. in this study, the complete sequence of a native plasmid, pdoj1, from a strain of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was determined. it consisted of a circular dna molecule of 6,220 bp with a g+c content of 44.6% and a characteristic ori and encoded six open reading frames (orfs), of which functions could be predicted for three-a mobilization (mob) protein, a transposase, and a fused primase-helicase replication protein. comparative analysis of pdoj1 and the other available l. delbrueckii plasmids (plbb1, pjbl2, pn42, and pll1212) revealed a very similar organization and amino  acid identities between 85 and 98% for the putative proteins of all six predicted orfs from pdoj1, reflecting a common origin for l. delbrueckii plasmids. analysis of the fused primase-helicase replication gene found a similar fused organization only in the theta replicating group b plasmids from streptococcus thermophilus. this observation and the ability of the replicon to function in s. thermophilus support the idea that the origin of plasmids in l. delbrueckii was likely from s. thermophilus. this may reflect the close association of these two species in dairy fermentations, particularly yogurt production. as no vector based on plasmid replicons from l. delbrueckii has previously been constructed, an escherichia coli-l. delbrueckii shuttle cloning vector, pdoj4, was constructed from pdoj1, the p15a ori, the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pci372, and the  lacz polylinker from puc18. this cloning vector was successfully introduced into  e. coli, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, s. thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis. this shuttle cloning vector provides a new tool for molecular analysis of lactobacillus delbrueckii and other lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == selection and properties of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient spontaneous mutants of streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == many lactic acid bacteria produce diacetyl, which is a desirable aroma compound in some fermented dairy products. strains or mutants of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar. diacetylactis that are deficient in alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase are used in some food processes for their ability to produce large  amounts of diacetyl. however, up until now, the use of alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants of streptococcus thermophilus for increased diacetyl production has not been evaluated. the objective of the present study was to devise a procedure for selecting spontaneous alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants of s. thermophilus. we observed that in a chemically defined medium (cdm) containing alpha-ketobutyrate plus leucine, or alpha-ketobutyrate plus leucine plus isoleucine, the alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutant til865, obtained by directed mutagenesis, grew faster than its parent strain. this property was used for selecting spontaneous alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase-deficient mutants on agar plates. the resulting  mutants were able to grow in milk, and their acidifying activity was slightly lower than that of the parent strain. under partial anaerobic or aerobic conditions, they produced approximately three times more diacetyl than the parent strain. such spontaneous mutants may be useful for increasing the diacetyl content of fermented milks whose production involves s. thermophilus strains.

TI  == influence of the dairy environment on gene expression and substrate utilization in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are widely used for the industrial production of fermented dairy products and form a group of related low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. the major species used in dairy manufacturing are lactobacillus, lactococcus, streptococcus, and leuconostoc. traditionally most are applied as starter cultures for dairy fermentations or used as probiotic cultures, delivered in dairy vehicles. the appearance of the genomes of lactococcus lactis, bidifobacterium longum, lactobacillus plantarum, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, 2  strains of streptococcus thermophilus, and pending completion of many draft genomic sequences, is now promoting in-depth investigation into the comparative genetic content of lab. moreover, whole-genome transcriptional arrays are quickly revealing critical genes/operons that are coordinately expressed and the impact of environmental factors on expression of multiple gene sets. comparative genomics between multiple genomes is providing insights into genes that are important in metabolic, physiological, and functional roles for different lab in  the environments they inhabit, ranging from the gastrointestinal tract to milk and acidified dairy products.

TI  == complete genome sequence of the prototype lactic acid bacterium lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363.
AB  == lactococcus lactis is of great importance for the nutrition of hundreds of millions of people worldwide. this paper describes the genome sequence of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363, the lactococcal strain most intensively studied throughout the world. the 2,529,478-bp genome contains 81 pseudogenes and encodes 2,436 proteins. of the 530 unique proteins, 47 belong to  the cog (clusters of orthologous groups) functional category "carbohydrate metabolism and transport," by far the largest category of novel proteins in comparison with l. lactis subsp. lactis il1403. nearly one-fifth of the 71 insertion elements are concentrated in a specific 56-kb region. this integration  hot-spot region carries genes that are typically associated with lactococcal plasmids and a repeat sequence specifically found on plasmids and in the "lateral gene transfer hot spot" in the genome of streptococcus thermophilus. although the parent of l. lactis mg1363 was used to demonstrate lysogeny in lactococcus, l. lactis mg1363 carries four remnant/satellite phages and two apparently complete prophages. the availability of the l. lactis mg1363 genome sequence will reinforce its status as the prototype among lactic acid bacteria through facilitation of further applied and fundamental research.

AB  == a novel streptococcus pneumoniae plasmid (pspnp1; 5413bp) has been isolated from  the multidrug-resistant clone poland(23f)-16, and its complete nucleotide sequence has been determined. sequence analysis predicted seven co-directional open reading frames and comparative analyses revealed that plasmid pspnp1 is different to pdp1, the only previously described pneumococcal plasmid, whereas it is highly similar to pst08, a plasmid from streptococcus thermophilus. a double-stranded origin for replication similar to the replication origin of the pc194/pub110 family was located upstream of the putative rep gene (orf2). it also contained a 144-bp region with over 60% identity to the single-stranded origin type a of the streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pmv158/pls1. detection of single-stranded dna by southern blot analysis indicated that pspnp1 replicates via a rolling circle mechanism. interestingly, the product of orf1 has a putative zonular occludens toxin conserved domain present in toxigenic strains of vibrio cholerae. real-time pcr assays revealed that this orf was expressed. hybridization experiments showed that the pspnp1 replicon was unusual among other examined antibiotic-resistant pneumococcal clones, although the recombinant plasmids based on pspnp1 were able to replicate in bacillus subtilis and lactococcus lactis.

TI  == multiplex pcr for the detection and identification of dairy bacteriophages in milk.
AB  == bacteriophage infections of starter lactic acid bacteria are a serious risk in the dairy industry. phage infection can lead to slow lactic acid production or even the total failure of fermentation. the associated economic losses can be substantial. rapid and sensitive methods are therefore required to detect and identify phages at all stages of the manufacture of fermented dairy products. this study describes a simple and rapid multiplex pcr method that, in a single reaction, detects the presence of bacteriophages infecting streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii, plus three genetically distinct 'species' of lactococcus lactis phages commonly found in dairy plants (p335, 936  and c2). available bacteriophage genome sequences were examined and the conserved regions used to design five pairs of primers, one for each of the above bacteriophage species. these primers were designed to generate specific fragments of different size depending on the species. since this method can detect the above phages in untreated milk and can be easily incorporated into dairy industry routines, it might be readily used to earmark contaminated milk for use in processes that do not involve susceptible starter organisms or for use in those that involve phage-deactivating conditions.

TI  == accuracy of species identity of commercial bacterial cultures intended for probiotic or nutritional use.
AB  == independent studies have indicated that the microbiological composition of several commercial probiotic products does not correspond to the product label information. the present study set out to investigate to what extent these problems may be due to the use of misidentified cultures at the onset of production. for this purpose, 213 cultures of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and propionibacteria intended for probiotic or nutritional use were collected from 26 manufacturers of probiotic products, three international culture collections and  one research institute. the accuracy of the taxonomic identity provided by the strain depositor was assessed through a polyphasic approach based on validated and standardized identification methods including fluorescent amplified fragment  length polymorphism (faflp) and repetitive dna element (rep)-pcr fingerprinting,  protein profiling and partial 16s rdna sequencing. the majority of the cultures were received as members of the genera lactobacillus (57%) and bifidobacterium (22%); however, propionibacteria, enterococci, lactococcus lactis (subsp. lactis), streptococcus thermophilus and pediococci were also obtained. upon reidentification, 46 cases of misidentification at the genus level (n=19) or species level (n=27) were recorded, including 34 commercial probiotic cultures deposited by 10 different companies. the finding that more than 28% of the commercial cultures intended for human and/or animal probiotic use were misidentified at the genus or species level suggests that many cases of probiotic product mislabeling originate from the incorporation of incorrectly identified strains. a large number of these discrepancies could be related to the use of methods with limited taxonomic resolution (e.g., api strips) or that are unsuitable for reliable identification up to species level (e.g., pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and randomly amplified polymorphic dna analysis). the current study has again highlighted that reliable identification of lab and propionibacteria requires molecular methods with a high taxonomic resolution that are linked to up-to-date identification libraries.

AB  == the ltp gene, located within the lysogeny module of temperate streptococcus thermophilus phage tp-j34, has been shown to be expressed in lysogenic strain s.  thermophilus j34. it codes for a lipoprotein, as demonstrated by inhibition of cleavage of the signal sequence by globomycin. exposure of ltp on the surface of  lactococcus lactis protoplasts bearing a plasmid-encoded copy of ltp has been demonstrated by immunogold labeling and electron microscopy. expression of ltp in prophage- and plasmid-cured s. thermophilus j34-6f interfered with tp-j34 infection. while plating efficiency was reduced by a factor of about 40 and lysis of strain j34-6f in liquid medium was delayed considerably, phage adsorption was  not affected at all. intracellular accumulation of phage dna was shown to be inhibited by ltp. this indicates interference of ltp with infection at the stage  of triggering dna release and injection into the cell, indicating a role of ltp in superinfection exclusion. expression of ltp in l. lactis bu2-60 showed that the same superinfection exclusion mechanism was strongly effective against phage  p008, a member of the lactococcal 936 phage species: no plaque-formation was detectable with even 10(9) phage per ml applied, and lysis in liquid medium did not occur. in lactococcus also, ltp apparently inhibited phage dna release and/or injection. ltp appears to be a member of a family of small, secreted proteins with a 42 amino acids repeat structure encoded by genes of gram-positive bacteria. some of these homologous genes are part of the genomes of prophages.

AB  == the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant (art) pathogens is a major threat to  public health. while the surfacing of art food-borne pathogens is alarming, the magnitude of the antibiotic resistance (ar) gene pool in food-borne commensal microbes is yet to be revealed. incidence of art commensals in selected retail food products was examined in this study. the presence of 10(2)-10(7) cfu of art  bacteria per gram of foods in many samples, particularly in ready-to-eat, 'healthy' food items, indicates that the art bacteria are abundant in the food chain. ar-encoding genes were detected in art isolates, and streptococcus thermophilus was found to be a major host for ar genes in cheese microbiota. lactococcus lactis and leuconostoc sp. isolates were also found carrying ar genes. the data indicate that food could be an important avenue for art bacterial evolution and dissemination. ar-encoding plasmids from several food-borne commensals were transmitted to streptococcus mutans via natural gene transformation under laboratory conditions, suggesting the possible transfer of ar genes from food commensals to human residential bacteria via horizontal gene transfer.

AB  == the characteristics of cell growth, lactic acid production, amino acid release and consumption by single-strain cultures of lactic acid bacteria (isolated from  kefir grains), and by a multiple-strain kefir starter prepared from them, were studied. the change in the levels of free amino acids was followed throughout the kefir process: single-strain kefir bacteria and the kefir starter (lactococcus lactis c15-1%+lactobacillus helveticus mp12-3%+(streptococcus thermophilus t15+lactobacillus bulgaricus hp1 = 1:1)-3%) were cultivated in pasteurized (92 degrees c for 20 min) cow's milk (3% fat content) at 28 degrees c for 5 h (the kefir starter reached ph 4.7) and subsequently grown at 20 degrees c for 16 h; storage was at 4 degrees c for 168 h. the strain l. helveticus mp12 was unrivaled with respect to free amino acid production (53.38 mg (100 g)(-1)) and cell growth (17.8 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1)); however, it manifested the lowest acidification activity. l. bulgaricus hp1 released approximately 3.7 times less amino acids, nearly 5 times lower cell growth, and produced about 1.2 times more lactic acid.  s. thermophilus t15 demonstrated dramatically complex amino acid necessities for  growth and metabolism. with l. lactis c15, the highest levels of growth and lactic acid synthesis were recorded (18.3 x 10(8) cfu ml(-1) and 7.8 g l(-1) lactic acid at the 21st hour), and as for free amino acid production, it approximated l. bulgaricus hp1 (17.03 mg (100 g)(-1) maximum concentration). in the l. lactis c15 culture, the amino acids were used more actively throughout the first exponential growth phase (by the 10th hour) than during the second growth phase. the unique properties of the l. helveticus mp12 strain to produce amino acids were employed to create a symbiotic bioconsortium kefir culture, which, under conditions of kefir formation, enhanced lactic acid production and shortened the time required to reach ph 4.7; intensified cell growth activity, resulting in a respective 90- and 60-fold increase in the concentration of lactobacilli and cocci in the mixed culture compared to individual cultures; and  accumulated free amino acids in the final kefir with higher total concentrations  (56.88 mg (100 g)(-1)) and an individual concentration of essential amino acids (1.5 times) greater than that of yogurt.

TI  == effects of exopolysaccharide-producing cultures on the viscoelastic properties of reduced-fat cheddar cheese.
AB  == the objective was to study the influence of different exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing and nonproducing lactic cultures on the viscoelastic properties of reduced-fat cheddar cheese. changes in the viscoelastic properties were followed over a ripening period of 6 mo. results showed that the elastic, viscous, and complex moduli were higher in reduced-fat cheeses made with eps-nonproducing cultures than in full-fat cheese. no differences in the viscoelastic properties were found between young reduced-fat cheese made with a ropy strain of lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (jfr1) and its full-fat counterpart. interestingly, the changes in viscoelastic moduli in both full-fat cheese and reduced-fat cheese made with jfr1 during ripening followed the same pattern. whereas the moduli increased during the first month of ripening in those 2 cheeses, a dramatic decrease was observed in all other cheeses. slopes of the viscoelastic moduli as a function of frequency were lower in the full-fat than in reduced-fat cheeses. the creep test showed that fresh reduced-fat cheese made with jfr1 was less rigid and more deformable than that made with eps-nonproducing cultures. the creep and recovery properties of young reduced-fat cheese made with jfr1 and the full-fat type were similar. no differences were found in the viscoelastic properties between reduced-fat cheese made with no eps and those made with eps-producing adjunct cultures of streptococcus thermophilus. after 6 mo of ripening, cheeses made with eps-producing cultures maintained lower elastic and viscous moduli than did those made with no eps.

TI  == application of exopolysaccharide-producing cultures in reduced-fat cheddar cheese: composition and proteolysis.
AB  == proteolysis during ripening of reduced fat cheddar cheeses made with different exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing and nonproducing cultures was studied. a ropy strain of lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris (jfr1) and capsule-forming nonropy and moderately ropy strains of streptococcus thermophilus were used in making reduced-fat cheddar cheese. commercial cheddar starter was used in making full-fat cheese. results showed that the actual yield of cheese made with jfr1 was higher than that of all other reduced-fat cheeses. cheese made with jfr1 contained higher moisture, moisture in the nonfat substance, and residual coagulant activity than all other reduced-fat cheeses. proteolysis, as determined by page and the level of water-soluble nitrogen, was also higher in cheese made with jfr1 than in all other cheeses. the hplc analysis showed a significant increase in hydrophobic peptides (causing bitterness) during storage of cheese made with jfr1. cheese made with the capsule-forming nonropy adjunct of s. thermophilus, which contained lower moisture and moisture in the nonfat substance levels and lower chymosin activity than did cheese made with jfr1, accumulated less hydrophobic peptides. in conclusion, some eps-producing cultures produced reduced-fat cheddar cheese with moisture in the nonfat substance similar to that  in its full-fat counterpart without the need for modifying the standard cheese-making protocol. such cultures might accumulate hydrophobic (bitter) peptides if they do not contain the system able to hydrolyze them. for making high quality reduced-fat cheddar cheese, eps-producing cultures should be used in conjunction with debittering strains.

TI  == use of an alpha-galactosidase gene as a food-grade selection marker for streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the alpha-galactosidase gene (aga) of lactococcus raffinolactis atcc 43920 was previously shown to be an efficient food-grade selection marker in lactococcus lactis and pediococcus acidilactici but not in streptococcus thermophilus. in this study, we demonstrated that the alpha-galactosidase of l. raffinolactis is thermolabile and inoperative at 42 degrees c, the optimal growth temperature of s. thermophilus. an in vitro assay indicated that the activity of this alpha-galactosidase at 42 degrees c was only 3% of that at 30 degrees c, whereas  the enzyme retained 23% of its activity at 37 degrees c. transformation of strep. thermophilus rd733 with the shuttle-vector pnz123 bearing the aga gene of l. raffinolactis (praf301) generated transformants that were stable and able to grow on melibiose and raffinose at 37 degrees c or below. the transformed cells possessed 6-fold more alpha-galactosidase activity after growth on melibiose than cells grown on lactose. slot-blot analyses of aga mrna indicated that repression  by lactose occurred at the transcriptional level. the presence of praf301 did not interfere with the lactic acid production when the transformed cells of strep. thermophilus were grown at the optimal temperature in milk. using the recombinant plasmid praf301, which carries a chloramphenicol resistance gene in addition to aga, we showed that both markers were equally efficient at differentiating transformed from nontransformed cells. the aga gene of l. raffinolactis can be used as a highly efficient selection marker in strep. thermophilus.

TI  == the specificity of oligopeptide transport by streptococcus thermophilus resembles that of lactococcus lactis and not that of pathogenic streptococci.
AB  == peptide transport is a crucial step in the growth of streptococcus thermophilus in protein- or peptide-containing media. the objective of the present work was to determine the specificity of peptide utilization by this widely used lactic acid  bacterium. to reach that goal, complementary approaches were employed. the capability of a proteinase-negative s. thermophilus strain to grow in a chemically defined medium containing a mixture of peptides isolated from milk as  the source of amino acids was analysed. peptides were separated into three size classes by ultrafiltration. the strain was able to use peptides up to 3.5 kda during growth, as revealed by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analyses. the same strain was grown in chemically defined medium containing a tryptic digest of casein, and the respective time-course consumption of the peptides during growth was estimated. the ability to consume large peptides (up to 23 residues) was confirmed, as long as they are cationic and hydrophobic. these results were confirmed by peptide transport studies. extension of the study to 11 other strains revealed that they all shared these preferences.

TI  == rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by m13-generated, rapd-pcr fingerprint databases.
AB  == about a thousand lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific pcr and rapd-pcr, respectively. rapd-pcr profiles, which were obtained by using the m13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by bionumerics software. cluster analysis of the combined rapd-pcr fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library,  which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. a library unit, in this case, can be considered  to be a definable taxon. the strains belonged to 11 main rapd-pcr fingerprinting  library units identified as lactobacillus casei/paracasei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus brevis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. the proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful lab strain collection. the same approach could also be applied to identify lab strains isolated from other food ecosystems.

TI  == characterization of the cro-ori region of the streptococcus thermophilus virulent bacteriophage dt1.
AB  == the virulent cos-type streptococcus thermophilus phage dt1 was previously isolated from a mozzarella whey sample, and its complete genomic sequence is available. the putative ori of phage dt1 is characterized by three inverted and two direct repeats located in a noncoding region between orf36 and orf37. as the  replication ability of the putative ori and flanking genes could not be established, its ability to confer phage resistance was tested. when ori is cloned on a high-copy-number plasmid, it provides protection to s. thermophilus strains against phage infection during milk fermentation. this protection is phage specific and strain dependent. then, a detailed transcriptional map was established for the region located between the cro-like gene (orf29) and the ori. the results of the northern blots indicated that the transcription of this region started 5 min after the onset of phage infection. comparative analysis of the expression of the cro-ori region in the three s. thermophilus cos-type phages dt1, sfi19 (virulent), and sfi21 (temperate) reveals significant differences in the number and size of transcripts. the promoter upstream of orf29 was further investigated by primer extension analysis, and its activity was confirmed by a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay, which showed that the phage promoter is  more efficient than the constitutive bacterial promoter of the s. thermophilus operon encoding the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system. however, the phage promoter is less efficient than the pts promoter in lactococcus lactis and in escherichia coli.

AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  == nostrano di primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the paneveggio-pale di san martino natural park area in the italian dolomites. in summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, passo rolle and vanoi, in the paneveggio natural park. during the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. the microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by rapd analysis and identified by 16s rrna sequence. the milk of the passo rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly lactococcus  lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei.  the plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. the dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. the vanoi cheese was dominated by enterococcus faecium and streptococcus macedonicus  in the first two days and mesophilic 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. in the first few days, the rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic s. macedonicus and s. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. during ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. the taxonomical identification by 16s rrna sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of s. macedonicus, lactobacillus plantarum, 21 lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, lactobacillus fermentum and e. faecium were detected in both cheeses.

TI  == changes in galactose and lactic acid content of sweet whey during storage.
AB  == whey is often stored or transported for a period of time prior to processing. during this time period, galactose and lactic acid concentrations may accumulate, reducing the quality of spray-dried whey powders in regard to stickiness and agglomeration. this study surveyed industry samples of cheddar and mozzarella cheese whey streams to determine how galactose and lactic acid concentrations changed with storage at appropriate (4 degrees c) and abuse (37.8 degrees c) temperatures. samples stored at 4 degrees c did not exhibit significant increases in levels of lactic acid or galactose. mozzarella whey accumulated the greatest amount of galactose and lactic acid with storage at 37.8 degrees c. whey samples  derived from cheese made from single strains of starter culture were also evaluated to determine each culture's contribution to galactose and lactic acid production. starter cultures evaluated included streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris, and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. whey derived from l. helveticus accumulated a significantly greater amount of lactic acid upon storage at 37.8 degrees c as compared with the other cultures. galactose accumulation was significantly decreased in whey from l. lactis ssp. lactis stored at 37.8 degrees c in comparison with the other cultures. results from this study indicate that proper storage conditions (4 degrees c) for whey prevent accumulation of galactose and lactic acid while the extent of accumulation during storage at 37.8 degrees c varies depending on the culture(s)  used in cheese production.

TI  == a potential food-grade cloning vector for streptococcus thermophilus that uses cadmium resistance as the selectable marker.
AB  == a potential food-grade cloning vector, pnd919, was constructed and transformed into s. thermophilus st3-1, a plasmid-free strain. the vector contains dnas from  two different food-approved organisms, streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis. the 5.0-kb pnd919 is a derivative of the cloning vector pnd918 (9.3 kb) and was constructed by deletion of the 4.3-kb region of pnd918 which contained dna from non-food-approved organisms. pnd919 carries a heterologous native cadmium resistance selectable marker from l. lactis m71 and expresses the cd(r) phenotype in s. thermophilus transformants. with the s. thermophilus replicon derived from the shuttle vector pnd913, pnd919 is able to replicate in the two s. thermophilus industrial strains tested, st3-1 and st4-1. its relatively high retention rate in s. thermophilus further indicates its usefulness as a potential food-grade cloning vector. to our knowledge, this is the first report of a replicative potential food-grade vector for the industrially important organism s. thermophilus.

TI  == ph-sensing 96-well microtitre plates for the characterization of acid production  by dairy starter cultures.
AB  == a new method for characterization of acid production by dairy starter cultures is presented. microplates with integrated optical ph sensors are developed. two fluorophores, a ph-sensitive and a ph-insensitive one are immobilised at the bottom of a polystyrene 96-well microtitre plate. the ph-insensitive fluorophore  serves as an internal reference and makes calibration unnecessary. the sensor measures ph accurately in optically well-defined media. particles and fluorophores contained in the bulk medium disturbed the measurements. despite these disturbances it was possible to clearly sense differences in inoculum type  and in inoculum sizes of cultures of lactococcus lactis and of streptococcus thermophilus at 30 and 37 degrees c. besides a ph-related signal there is information about other changes during milk fermentation. the cultivation results were compared with those from the established cinac-method. from this comparison  it can be concluded that the new method can be used reliably to characterize particularly a large number of strains for screening purposes but also for quality control.

TI  == effects of cultivation conditions on folate production by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == a variety of lactic acid bacteria were screened for their ability to produce folate intracellularly and/or extracellularly. lactococcus lactis, streptococcus  thermophilus, and leuconostoc spp. all produced folate, while most lactobacillus  spp., with the exception of lactobacillus plantarum, were not able to produce folate. folate production was further investigated in l. lactis as a model organism for metabolic engineering and in s. thermophilus for direct translation  to (dairy) applications. for both these two lactic acid bacteria, an inverse relationship was observed between growth rate and folate production. when cultures were grown at inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics or salt or when the bacteria were subjected to low growth rates in chemostat cultures, folate levels in the cultures were increased relative to cell mass and (lactic) acid production. s. thermophilus excreted more folate than l. lactis, presumably as a  result of differences in the number of glutamyl residues of the folate produced.  in s. thermophilus 5,10-methenyl and 5-formyl tetrahydrofolate were detected as the major folate derivatives, both containing three glutamyl residues, while in l. lactis 5,10-methenyl and 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate were found, both with either four, five, or six glutamyl residues. excretion of folate was stimulated at lower ph in s. thermophilus, but ph had no effect on folate excretion by l. lactis. finally, several environmental parameters that influence folate production in these lactic acid bacteria were observed; high external ph increased folate production and the addition of p-aminobenzoic acid stimulated folate production, while high tyrosine concentrations led to decreased folate biosynthesis.

TI  == application of the shsp gene, encoding a small heat shock protein, as a food-grade selection marker for lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == sequence analysis and characterization of plasmids from streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == the nucleotide sequences of eight plasmids isolated from seven streptococcus thermophilus strains have been determined. plasmids pst04, per1-1, and pj34 are related and replicate via a rolling circle mechanism. plasmid pj34 encodes for a  replication initiation protein (repa) and a small polypeptide with unknown function. plasmids pst04 and per1-1 carry in addition to repa genes coding for small heat shock proteins (shsp). expression of these proteins is induced at elevated temperatures or low ph and increases the thermo- and acid resistance. plasmids per1-2 and pst22-2 show identical sequences with five putative open reading frames (orfs). the gene products of orf1 and orf4 reveal some similarities to transposon encoded proteins of bacillus subtilis and tn916. orf1  of plasmid pst106 encodes a protein similar to resolvases of different gram-positive bacteria. integrity of orf2 and 3, encoding a putative dna primase  and a replication protein, is essential for replication. orf1 to 3 of plasmid pst08, which are organized in a tricistronic operon, encode a repa protein, an adenosine-specific methyltransferase, and a type ii restriction endonuclease. another type ii restriction-modification (r/m) system is encoded on plasmid pst0  which is highly similar to those encoded on lactococcal plasmid phw393 and b. subtilis plasmid pxh13. plasmid-free derivatives of strains st0 and st08 show increased phage sensitivity, indicating that in the wild-type strains the r/m systems are functionally expressed. recombinant plasmids based on the replicons of plasmids pst04, pj34, pst106, pst08, and pst0, are able to replicate in lactococcus lactis and b. subtilis, respectively, whereas constructs carrying per1-2 only replicate in s. thermophilus.

AB  == the growth of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus paracasei was studied in a ph-auxostat. the computer-controlled smooth change of ph or temperature was used to study the effect of ph and temperature on the culture characteristics (specific growth rate mu growth yield y(atp) and specific lactate production rate q(atp)). the behaviour of mu and q(atp) with an increase of temperature suggested that atp production capacity was an important factor in determining the maximum growth rate of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the decrease of y(atp) with increase of temperature resulted in the decrease of specific growth rate while q(atp) remained constant or even increased. with the decrease of ph, decrease of both y(atp) and q(atp) was observed. s. thermophilus st20 having the highest maximum specific growth rate of 2.2 h(-1) at 44 degrees c was the most acid sensitive strain. the l. paracasei e1h3 having the lowest mu(max) was the most tolerant strain to ph change. the behaviour of mixed culture of l. bulgaricus and s. thermophilus in milk in a ph-auxostat with ph-decrease was in agreement with the  pure culture experiments of the same species. the study showed that ph-auxostat with smooth controlled change of ph and temperature is an effective method for determination of technological characteristics and comparative physiological study of lab.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

AB  == intestinal, respiratory and genitourinary mucosal surfaces are the most important routes of entry for microbial pathogens. the stimulus of the mucosal immunity is  not easy because the trigger keys for the activation do not follow the ones of the systemic immune response. in previous works we have demonstrated that some lactic acid bacteria (lab), when orally administered, can induce an enhance of the gut immune response. taking into account the concept of a common mucosal response, we studied the effect of orally administered mice with lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis on the iga secreting cells associated to bronchus. as shown before, oral immunostimulation with lab induced an increase of the iga* cells at intestinal level by a dose depending effect. in this study it is also showed that the lab assayed, with exception of l. acidophilus, were able to enhance iga+ cells at bronchial level,  being also this effect dose dependent. the increment induced by some lab in the number of iga+ cells on the mucosa surface of the lower respiratory tract may be  very important to prevent bronchus diseases.

TI  == cell wall attachment of a widely distributed peptidoglycan binding domain is hindered by cell wall constituents.
AB  == the c-terminal region (ca) of the major autolysin acma of lactococcus lactis contains three highly similar repeated regions of 45 amino acid residues (lysm domains), which are separated by nonhomologous sequences. the ca domain could be  deleted without destroying the cell wall-hydrolyzing activity of the enzyme in vitro. this acma derivative was capable neither of binding to lactococcal cells nor of lysing these cells while separation of the producer cells was incomplete.  the ca domain and a chimeric protein consisting of ca fused to the c terminus of  msa2, a malaria parasite surface antigen, bound to lactococcal cells specifically via ca. the fusion protein also bound to many other gram-positive bacteria. by chemical treatment of purified cell walls of l. lactis and bacillus subtilis, peptidoglycan was identified as the cell wall component interacting with ca. immunofluorescence studies showed that binding is on specific locations on the surface of l. lactis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus, b. subtilis, lactobacillus sake, and lactobacillus casei cells. based on these studies, we propose that lysm-type repeats bind to peptidoglycan and that binding is hindered by other cell wall constituents, resulting in localized binding of acma. lipoteichoic acid is a candidate hindering component. for l. lactis sk110,  it is shown that lipoteichoic acids are not uniformly distributed over the cell surface and are mainly present at sites where no msa2ca binding is observed.

TI  == feasibility studies to control acute diarrhoea in children by feeding fermented milk preparations actimel and indian dahi.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study feasibility of diarrhoea control in children (6 months to 5 y of age) by feeding fermented milk preparations. the design used was a randomized controlled clinical trial and the study was carried out at the delhi university college hospital providing tertiary care, and a nearby community centre nand nagri, a resettlement colony in east delhi. children suffering from acute diarrhoea (75 patients from the hospital and 75 from the community) were allocated to three groups by double-blind technique. group 1 was given a fermented milk, actimel, containing 10(8) of each lactobacillus casei dn-114001,  lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus per gram. group 2 was given indian dahi (lf 40) containing 10(8) of each lactococcus lactis, lactococcus lactis cremoris and leuconostac mesenteroides cremoris per gram. group 3 was given ultra-heat-treated yoghurt preparation (no live bacteria). actimel was also used as a starter to prepare the curd in order to study the preventive effect of diarrhoea in children in a community. in the hospital study  indian dahi and actimel administration reduced mean duration of diarrhoea by 0.3  and 0.6 day (p<0.001), respectively. the corresponding figures in the community study were 0.2 and 0.5 day (p<0.05), respectively. the families using actimel as  a starter showed a reduction in diarrhoeal morbidity episodes by 40% of the children tested in a 3 month follow-up. in conclusion, actimel, fermented milk containing lactobacillus casei dn-114001, and indian dahi can significantly reduce the duration of diarrhoea in children; the former preparation being superior.

TI  == isolation, characterisation and identification of lactic acid bacteria from bushera: a ugandan traditional fermented beverage.
AB  == one hundred and thirteen strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were selected from 351 isolates from 15 samples of traditionally fermented household bushera from uganda and also from laboratory-prepared bushera. isolates were phenotypically characterised by their ability to ferment 49 carbohydrates using api 50 chl kits  and additional biochemical tests. coliforms, yeasts and lab were enumerated in bushera. the ph, volatile organic compounds and organic acids were also determined. the lab counts in household bushera varied between 7.1 and 9.4 log cfu ml(-1). the coliform counts varied between < 1 and 5.2 log cfu ml(-1). the ph of bushera ranged from 3.7 to 4.5. ethanol (max, 0.27%) was the major volatile organic compound while lactic acid (max, 0.52%) was identified as the dominant organic acid in household bushera. the initial numbers of lab and coliforms in laboratory-fermented bushera were similar; however, the lab numbers increased faster during the first 24 h. lab counts increased from 5.5 to 9.0 log cfu ml(-1) during the laboratory fermentation. coliform counts increased from 5.9 to 7.8 log cfu ml(-1) at 24 h, but after 48 h, counts were less 4 log cfu ml(-1). yeasts increased from 4.3 to 7.7 log cfu ml(-1) at 48 h, but thereafter decreased slightly. the ph declined from 7.0 to around 4.0. lactic acid and ethanol increased from zero to 0.75% and 0.20%, respectively. lactic acid bacteria isolated from household bushera belonged to lactobacillus, streptococcus and enterococcus genera. tentatively, lactobacillus isolates were identified as lactobacillus plantarum, l. paracasei subsp. paracasei, l. fermentum, l. brevis and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii. streptococcus thermophilus strains were also identified in household bushera. lab isolated from bushera produced in the laboratory belonged to five genera (lactococcus, leuconostoc, lactobacillus, weissella and enterococcus. eight isolates were able to produce acid from starch  and were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (four strains), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (one strain), leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum (one strain), weissella confusa (one strain) and l. plantarum (one strain).

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by lactic acid bacteria of kefir grains.
AB  == a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus hp1 strain with high exopolysaccharide activity was selected from among 40 strains of lactic acid bacteria, isolated from kefir grains. by associating the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus hp1 strain with streptococcus thermophilus t15, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis c15, lactobacillus helveticus mp12, and sacharomyces cerevisiae a13, a kefir starter was formed. the associated cultivation of the lactobacteria and yeast had a positive effect on the exopolysaccharide activity of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus hp1. the maximum exopolysaccharide concentration of the starter culture exceeded the one by the lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus hp1 monoculture by approximately 1.7 times, and the time needed to reach the maximum concentration (824.3 mg exopolysacharides/l) was shortened by 6 h. the monomer composition of the exopolysaccharides from the kefir starter culture was represented by glucose  and galactose in a 1.0:0.94 ratio, which proves that the polymer synthesized is kefiran.

TI  == cell-wall proteinases prts and prtb have a different role in streptococcus thermophilus/lactobacillus bulgaricus mixed cultures in milk.
AB  == the manufacture of yoghurt relies on the simultaneous utilization of two starters: streptococcus thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (lb. bulgaricus). a protocooperation usually takes place between the two species, which often results in enhanced milk acidification and aroma formation compared to pure cultures. cell-wall proteinases of lactococcus lactis  and lactobacilli have been shown to be essential to growth in milk in pure cultures. in this study, the role of proteinases prts from s. thermophilus and prtb from lb. bulgaricus in bacterial growth in milk was evaluated; a negative mutant for the prts gene of s. thermophilus cnrz 385 was constructed for this purpose. pure cultures of s. thermophilus cnrz 385 and its prts-negative mutant were made in milk as well as mixed cultures of s. thermophilus and lb. bulgaricus: s. thermophilus cnrz 385 or its prts-negative mutant was associated with several strains of lb. bulgaricus, including a prtb-negative strain. the ph  and growth of bacterial populations of the resulting mixed cultures were followed, and the lactobacillus strain was found to influence both the extent of  the benefit of lb. bulgaricus/s. thermophilus association on milk acidification and the magnitude of s. thermophilus population dominance at the end of fermentation. in all mixed cultures, the sequential growth of s. thermophilus then of lb. bulgarius and finally of both bacteria was observed. although proteinase prts was essential to s. thermophilus growth in milk in pure culture,  it had no effect on bacterial growth and thus on the final ph of mixed cultures in the presence of prtb. in contrast, proteinase prtb was necessary for the growth of s. thermophilus, and its absence resulted in a higher final ph. from these results, a model of growth of both bacteria in mixed cultures in milk is proposed.

TI  == cloning vectors for streptococcus thermophilus derived from a native plasmid.
AB  == a 3.5-kb native plasmid (pnd103) was identified in streptococcus thermophilus st2-1. preliminary sequence analysis indicated that pnd103 belongs to group i s.  thermophilus plasmids. a region of approximately 2 kb appears to contain three components: a plus origin of replication (ori) typical of plasmids that replicate via rolling circle replication; a gene encoding a replication protein (rep); and  a gene encoding a small heat shock protein (hsp). pnd103 was then used to construct s. thermophilus/escherichia coli hybrid cloning vectors by ligating different portions of pnd103 to an origin-probe vector (pnd330) composed of puc19 and a gram-positive erythromycin resistance gene. the shuttle vectors (pnd913, pnd914 and pnd915) were successfully introduced back into plasmid-free s. thermophilus st3-1 as well as to lactococcus lactis lm0230 and e. coli jm109. segregational and structural stability study indicated that these vectors can be  maintained in these hosts. the results indicated that pnd913, pnd914 and pnd915 are potential shuttle cloning vectors for s. thermophilus.

TI  == molecular characterization of cadmium resistance in streptococcus thermophilus strain 4134: an example of lateral gene transfer.
AB  == two genes (cadc(st) and cada(st) [subscript st represents streptococcus thermophilus]), located on the chromosome of s. thermophilus 4134, were shown to  constitute a cadmium/zinc resistance cassette. the genes seem to be organized in  an operon, and their transcription is cadmium dependent in vivo. the proposed product of the cada open reading frame (cada(st)) is highly similar to p-type cadmium efflux atpases, whereas the predicted protein encoded by cadc(st) (cadc(st)) shows high similarity to arsr-type regulatory proteins. the observed homologies and g+c content of this cassette and surrounding regions suggest that  this dna was derived from lactococcus lactis and may have been introduced relatively recently into the s. thermophilus 4134 genome by a lateral gene transfer event. the complete cassette confers cadmium and zinc resistance to both s. thermophilus and l. lactis, but expression of cada(st) alone is sufficient to  give resistance. by using electrophoretic mobility shift assays it was shown that the cadc(st) protein is a dna binding protein that binds specifically to its own  promoter region, possibly to two copies of an inverted repeat, and that this cadc(st)-dna interaction is lost in the presence of cadmium. using lacz fusion constructs it was shown that the cadmium-dependent expression of cada(st) is mediated by the negative regulator cadc(st). a model for the regulation of the expression of cadmium resistance in s. thermophilus is discussed.

TI  == the dilemma of phage taxonomy illustrated by comparative genomics of sfi21-like siphoviridae in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the complete genome sequences of two dairy phages, streptococcus thermophilus phage 7201 and lactobacillus casei phage a2, are reported. comparative genomics reveals that both phages are members of the recently proposed sfi21-like genus of siphoviridae, a widely distributed phage type in low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. graded relatedness, the hallmark of evolving biological systems, was observed when different sfi21-like phages were compared. across the structural module, the graded relatedness was represented by a high level of dna sequence similarity or protein sequence similarity, or a shared gene map in the absence of sequence relatedness. this varying range of relatedness was found within sfi21-like phages from a single species as demonstrated by the different prophages harbored by lactococcus lactis strain il1403. a systematic dot plot analysis with 11 complete l. lactis phage genome sequences revealed a clear separation of all temperate phages from two classes of virulent phages. the temperate lactococcal phages share dna sequence homology in a patchwise fashion over the nonstructural gene cluster. with respect to structural genes, four dna homology groups could be defined within temperate l. lactis phages. closely related structural modules for all four dna homology groups were detected in phages from streptococcus or listeria, suggesting that they represent distinct evolutionary lineages that have not uniquely evolved in l. lactis. it seems reasonable to base phage taxonomy on data from comparative genomics. however, the peculiar modular nature of phage evolution creates ambiguities in the definition  of phage taxa by comparative genomics. for example, depending on the module on which the classification is based, temperate lactococcal phages can be classified as a single phage species, as four distinct phage species, or as two if not three different phage genera. we propose to base phage taxonomy on comparative genomics of a single structural gene module (head or tail genes). this partially phylogeny-based taxonomical system still mirrors some aspects of the current international committee on taxonomy in virology classification system. in this system the currently sequenced lactococcal phages would be grouped into five genera: c2-, sk1, sfi11-, r1t-, and sfi21-like phages.

TI  == the evaluation of mixtures of yeast and potato extracts in growth media for biomass production of lactic cultures.
AB  == the effectiveness of yeast extracts (ye) and potato extracts (pe) to promote growth of seven lactic cultures was evaluated by automated spectrophotometry (as). two aspects of the growth curve were analysed: (1) maximum biomass obtained (using odmax) and (2) highest specific growth rate mu(max)) eleven lots from the  same pe-manufacturing process were examined for lot-to-lot variability. the odmax values of three of the seven strains were significantly affected by lot source, but mu(max) was not significantly affected. the growth of bacteria was systematically lower in base medium containing 100% pe than in base medium containing 100% ye for both odmax or mu(max) data, which could be related to the  lower content in nitrogen-based compounds in pe. in as assays, highest od values  for lactobacillus casei eq28, lactobacillus rhamnosus r-011, lactobacillus plantarum eq12, and streptococcus thermophilus r-083 were obtained with a mixture of pe and ye. fermentations (2 l) were also carried out to determine the accuracy of as to predict biomass levels obtained under fermentation trials. in these fermentations, replacement of 50% ye with pe was shown to enable good growth of s. thermophilus. with l. rhamnosus r-011, a high correlation (r2 = 0.95) was found between odmax data obtained in the as assays and that of the 2-l bioreactor when the same growth medium was used for both series of fermentations. however, as was not as efficient when industrial media were used for the bioreactor assays. the relationship was still good for odmax between as data and that of the bioreactor data with l. rhamnosus r-011 in industrial lbs medium (r2 = 0.87), but was very poor with the s. thermophilus r-083 on rosell #43 industrial medium (r2  = 0.33). since pe cost 40% less than ye, there are strong economic advantages in  considering such a partial replacement of ye by pe.

AB  == interactions among lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria were investigated to establish adequate combinations of strains to manufacture probiotic dairy products. for this aim, a total of 48 strains of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and bifidobacterium spp. (eight of each) were used. the detection of bacterial interactions was carried out using the well-diffusion agar assay, and the interactions found were further characterized  by growth kinetics. a variety of interactions was demonstrated. lb. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus was found to be able to inhibit s. thermophilus strains. among  probiotic cultures, lb. acidophilus was the sole species that was inhibited by the others (lb. casei and bifidobacterium). in general, probiotic bacteria proved to be more inhibitory towards lactic acid bacteria than vice versa since the latter did not exert any effect on the growth of the former, with some exceptions. the study of interactions by growth kinetics allowed the setting of four different kinds of behaviors between species of lactic acid starter and probiotic bacteria (stimulation, delay, complete inhibition of growth, and no effects among them). the possible interactions among the strains selected to manufacture a probiotic fermented dairy product should be taken into account when choosing the best combination/s to optimize their performance in the process and  their survival in the products during cold storage.

AB  == the diversity and dynamics of the microbial communities during the manufacturing  of ragusano cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in sicily (italy), were investigated by a combination of classical and culture-independent approaches. the latter included pcr, reverse transcriptase-pcr (rt-pcr), and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) of 16s rrna genes (rdna). bacterial and lactobacillus group-specific primers were used to amplify the v6 to v8 and v1 to  v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene, respectively. dgge profiles from samples taken during cheese production indicated dramatic shifts in the microbial community structure. cloning and sequencing of rdna amplicons revealed that mesophilic lactic acid bacteria (lab), including species of leuconostoc, lactococcus lactis, and macrococcus caseolyticus were dominant in the raw milk, while streptococcus thermophilus prevailed during lactic fermentation. other thermophilic lab, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus fermentum, also flourished during ripening. comparison of the rrna-derived patterns obtained by rt-pcr to the rdna dgge patterns indicated a substantially different degree of metabolic activity for the microbial groups detected. identification of cultivated lab isolates by phenotypic characterization and 16s rdna analysis indicated a variety of species, reflecting to a large extent the results obtained from the 16s rdna clone libraries, with the significant exception of the lactobacillus delbrueckii  species, which dominated in the ripening cheese but was not detected by cultivation. the present molecular approaches combined with culture can effectively describe the complex ecosystem of natural fermented dairy products, giving useful information for starter culture design and preservation of artisanal fermented food technology.

AB  == a polyphasic pcr-dgge approach was used to describe the microbial population occurring in natural whey cultures (nwcs) for water-buffalo mozzarella cheese production. total microbial community was assessed without cultivation by analyzing dna directly extracted from the original samples of nwc. in addition, dna extracted from bulks of cells formed by harvesting colonies from the serial dilution agar plates of a variety of culture media was used to profile the "cultivable" community. the 16s rdna v3 region was amplified using dna from nwc as well as dna from bulks as templates and the amplicons were separated by dgge.  the microbial entities occurring in nwcs were identified by partial 16s rdna sequencing of dgge bands: four lactic acid bacteria (lab) closest relative of streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii and lactobacillus crispatus were revealed by the analysis of dna directly extracted from nwc while two other lab, lactobacillus fermentum and enterococcus faecalis,  were identified by analyzing dna from the cultivable community. the developed pcr-dgge analysis of the "cultivable" community showed good potential in evaluating microbial diversity of a dairy environment: it usefully highlighted the bias introduced by selective amplification when compared to the analysis of the total community from nwc and allowed suitability of media and growth conditions to be evaluated. moreover, it could be used to complete the culture independent study of microbial diversity to give information on concentration ratios among species occurring in a particular environment and can be proposed for rapid identification of dominant microorganisms in alternative to traditional tools.

TI  == comparative genomics reveals close genetic relationships between phages from dairy bacteria and pathogenic streptococci: evolutionary implications for prophage-host interactions.
AB  == the genome of the highly pathogenic m1 serotype streptococcus pyogenes isolate sf370 contains eight prophage elements. only prophage sf370.1 could be induced by mitomycin c treatment. prophage sf370.3 showed a 33.5-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of the cos-site temperate siphovirus r1t infecting the dairy bacterium lactococcus lactis. the two-phage genomes shared between 60 and 70% nucleotide sequence identity over the dna packaging, head and  tail genes. analysis of the sf370.3 genome revealed mutations in the replisome organizer gene that may prevent the induction of the prophage. the mutated phage  replication gene was closely related to a virulence marker identified in recently emerged m3 serotype s. pyogenes strains in japan. this observation suggests that  prophage genes confer selective advantage to the lysogenic host. sf370.3 encodes  a hyaluronidase and a dnase that may facilitate the spreading of s. pyogenes through tissue planes of its human host. prophage sf370.2 showed a 43-kb-long genome that closely resembled the genome organization of pac-site temperate siphoviridae infecting the dairy bacteria s. thermophilus and l. lactis. over part of the structural genes, the similarity between sf370.2 and s. thermophilus  phage o1205 extended to the nucleotide sequence level. sf370.2 showed two probable inactivating mutations: one in the replisome organizer gene and another  in the gene encoding the portal protein. prophage sf370.2 also encodes a hyaluronidase and in addition two very likely virulence factors: prophage-encoded toxins acting as superantigens that may contribute to the immune deregulation observed during invasive streptococcal infections. the superantigens are encoded  between the phage lysin and the right attachment site of the prophage genome. the genes were nearly sequence identical with a dna segment in s. equi, suggesting horizontal gene transfer. the trend for prophage genome inactivation was even more evident for the remaining five prophage sequences that showed massive losses of prophage dna. in these prophage remnants only 13-0.3 kb of putative prophage dna was detected. we discuss the genomics data from s. pyogenes strain sf370 within the framework of darwinian coevolution of prophages and lysogenic bacteria and suggest elements of genetic cooperation and elements of an arms race in this  host-parasite relationship.

AB  == the genes responsible for exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis in streptococcus thermophilus sfi39 were identified on a 20-kb genomic fragment. the two genes, epse and epsg, were shown to be involved in eps synthesis as their disruption lead to the loss of the ropy phenotype. several naturally selected nonropy mutants were isolated, one acquired an insertion sequence (is)-element (is905) in the middle of the eps gene cluster. the eps gene cluster was cloned and transferred into a noneps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363. the eps produced was shown by chemical analysis and nmr spectroscopy to be identical to the eps produced by s. thermophilus sfi39. this demonstrated first that all genes needed for eps production and export were present in the s. thermophilus sfi39 eps gene cluster, and second that the heterologous production  of an eps was possible by transfer of the complete eps gene cluster alone, provided that the heterologous host possessed all necessary genetic information for precursor synthesis.

TI  == [viability and activity of the lactic bacteria (streptococcus salivarius ssp thermophilus y lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp bulgaricus) del yogurt en venezuela].
AB  == national and international legislations have agreed that the population of lactic bacteria in yogurt must be viable and not less than 10(6) ufc/g. in venezuela, during last years, observations indicate that the number of viable cells in some  commercial samples show high variations, as low levels. this research attempted to find the origin of this problem in the local industry. for this purpose 105 commercial samples were analyzed during their shelf life and 32 samples of yogurt prepared in the laboratory following the flow diagram of the local industry. the  different conditions of freeze dried lactic culture, were also analyzed. these samples were evaluated for viable cell count of lactic bacteria and possible variations of ph and acidity. the absence or low number of lactic bacteria detected in some commercial samples is due to the use of inadequate working cultures that show imbalanced proportions of the two microorganisms, besides a low count below 106 ufc/g. the succesive propagation and storage time of mother culture, and the overacidification of the product, produce subletal injury to the microbial cells of the yogurt starter culture. the data indicate that manufacturing practices significantly affect the survival of the lactic flora.

TI  == streptococcus thermophilus in cheddar cheese--production and fate of galactose.
AB  == the behaviour of streptococcus thermophilus in combination with lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris or subsp. lactis mesophilic starters in experimental cheddar cheese is reported. in a standard manufacturing procedure employing a 38  degrees c cook temperature, even very low levels (0.007%) of str. thermophilus combined with normal levels of the mesophilic starter (1.7%) resulted in increased rates of acid production, the formation of significant amounts of galactose (approximately 13 mmol/kg cheese), and populations nearly equivalent to those of the mesophilic lactic starter in the curd before salting. at a 41 degrees c cook temperature, the str. thermophilus attained a higher maximum population (approximately log 8.2 colony forming units (cfu)/g) than the lc. lactis subsp. cremoris (approximately log 6.8 cfu/g) and formed more galactose (approximately 28 mmol/kg). lactobacillus rhamnosus, deliberately added to a cheese made using str. thermophilus starter and which contained 24 mmol galactose/kg at day one, utilized all the galactose during the first 3 months of  cheese ripening. adventitious non-starter lactic acid bacteria had the potential  to utilize this substrate too, and a close relationship was demonstrated between  the increase in this flora and the disapearance of the galactose. some possible consequences for cheese quality of using str. thermophilus as a starter component are discussed.

TI  == isolation and characterization of a streptococcus thermophilus plasmid closely related to the pmv158 family.
AB  == twenty-two streptococcus thermophilus strains used for milk fermentations were analyzed for their plasmid content and 13 of them (59%) were found to contain one or two plasmids. fifteen s. thermophilus plasmids were divided into four groups using dna homology. ten plasmids were classified within group a and they shared homologies with all the previously sequenced s. thermophilus plasmids. three plasmids (group b) hybridized with each other and two plasmids only hybridized with themselves (groups c and d). single-stranded dna was detected within strains containing plasmids of groups a, c, and d, indicating that they replicate via a rolling-circle mode. the only plasmid of group c, named psmq172, was further characterized. this 4230-bp plasmid replicates in escherichia coli, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus salivarius and does not confer phage resistance. comparisons with databases showed that psmq172 was related to pmv158 of streptococcus agalactiae and to pssu1 of streptococcus suis. these results suggest that genetic exchanges may have occurred between pathogenic and nonpathogenic streptococci.

TI  == comparative genomics of lactococcal phages: insight from the complete genome sequence of lactococcus lactis phage bk5-t.
AB  == lactococcus lactis phage bk5-t and streptococcus thermophilus phage sfi21, two cos-site temperate siphoviridae with 40-kb genomes, share an identical genome organization, sequence similarity at the amino acid level over about half of their genomes, and nucleotide sequence identity of 60% over the dna packaging and head morphogenesis modules. siphoviridae with similarly organized genomes and substantial protein sequence similarity were identified in several genera of low-gc-content gram-positive bacteria. these phages demonstrated a gradient of relatedness ranging from nucleotide sequence similarity to protein sequence similarity to gene map similarity over the dna packaging and head morphogenesis modules. interestingly, the degree of relatedness was correlated with the evolutionary distance separating their bacterial hosts. these observations suggest elements of vertical evolution in phages. the structural genes from bk5-t shared no sequence relationships with corresponding genes/proteins from lactococcal phages belonging to distinct lactococcal phage species, including phage sk1 (phage species 936) that showed a closely related gene map. despite a clearly distinct genome organization, lactococcal phages sk1 and c2 showed nine sequence-related proteins. over the early gene cluster phage bk5-t shared nine regions of high nucleotide sequence similarity, covering at most two adjacent genes, with lactococcal phage r1t (phage species p335). over the structural genes, the closest relatives of phage r1t were not lactococcal phages belonging to other phage species, but siphoviridae from mycobacteria (high-gc-content gram-positive bacteria). evidence for recent horizontal gene transfer between distinct phage species was obtained for dairy phages, but these transfers were limited to phages infecting the same bacterial host species.

TI  == analysis of the genetic switch and replication region of a p335-type bacteriophage with an obligate lytic lifestyle on lactococcus lactis.
AB  == the dna sequence of the replication module, part of the lysis module, and remnants of a lysogenic module from the lytic p335 species lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was determined, and its regulatory elements were investigated. the identification of a characteristic genetic switch including two divergent promoters and two cognate repressor genes strongly indicates that phi31 was derived from a temperate bacteriophage. regulation of the two early promoters was analyzed by primer extension and transcriptional promoter fusions to a laclm  reporter. the regulatory behavior of the promoter region differed significantly from the genetic responses of temperate lactococcus lactis phages. the cro gene homologue regulates its own production and is an efficient repressor of ci gene expression. no detectable ci gene expression could be measured in the presence of cro. ci gene expression in the absence of cro exerted minor influences on the regulation of the two promoters within the genetic switch. homology comparisons revealed a replication module which is most likely expressed from the promoter located upstream of the cro gene homologue. the replication module encoded genes  with strong homology to helicases and primases found in several streptococcus thermophilus phages. downstream of the primase homologue, an at-rich noncoding origin region was identified. the characteristics and location of this region and its ability to reduce the efficiency of plaquing of phi31 10(6)-fold when present at high copy number in trans provide evidence for identification of the phage origin of replication. phage phi31 is an obligately lytic phage that was isolated from commercial dairy fermentation environments. neither a phage attachment site  nor an integrase gene, required to establish lysogeny, was identified, explaining its lytic lifestyle and suggesting its origin from a temperate phage ancestor. several regions showing extensive dna and protein homologies to different temperate phages of lactococcus, lactobacillus, and streptococcus were also discovered, indicating the likely exchange of dna cassettes through horizontal gene transfer in the dynamic ecological environment of dairy fermentations.

TI  == gut mucosal immunostimulation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the beneficial properties of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on human health have been frequently demonstrated. the interaction of lab with the lymphoid cells associated to the gut to activate the mucosal immune system and the mechanisms by which they can exert an adjuvant effect is still unclear, as well as if this property is common for all the lab. we studied the influence of the oral administration of different geneous of lab such as lactobacillus casei, l. acidophilus, l. rhamnosus, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. plantarum, lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus. we determined if the lab assayed were able to stimulate the specific, the non-specific immune response (inflammatory response), or both. we demonstrated that all the bacteria assayed were able to increase the number of iga producing cells associated to the lamina  propria of small intestine. this effect was dose dependent. the increase in iga+  producing cells was not always correlated with an increase in the cd4+ t cell number, indicating that some lab assayed only induced clonal expansion of b cells triggered to produce iga. most of them, induced an increase in the number of cells involved in the inflammatory immune response. cd8+ t cell were diminished or not affected, with exception of l. plantarum that induced an increase at low dose. this fact would mean that lab are unable to induce cytotoxicity mechanisms. we demonstrated the importance in the selection of lab to be used as gut mucosal  adjuvant. the different behaviours observed among them on the gut mucosal immune  response, specially those that induce inflammatory immune response, show that not all the lab can be used as oral adjuvant and that the beneficial effect of them can not generalized to genous or specie. the immunoadjuvant capacity would be a property of the strain assayed.

TI  == genetic loci of streptococcus mitis that mediate binding to human platelets.
AB  == the direct binding of bacteria to platelets is a postulated major interaction in  the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis. to identify bacterial components that mediate platelet binding by streptococcus mitis, we screened a tn916deltae-derived mutant library of s. mitis strain sf100 for reduced binding to human platelets in vitro. two distinct loci were found to affect platelet binding. the first contains a gene (pblt) encoding a highly hydrophobic, 43-kda protein with 12 potential membrane-spanning segments. this protein resembles members of the major facilitator superfamily of small-molecule transporters. the  second platelet binding locus consists of an apparent polycistronic operon. this  region includes genes that are highly similar to those of lactococcus lactis phage r1t and streptococcus thermophilus phage 01205. two genes (pbla and pblb) encoding large surface proteins are also present. the former encodes a 107-kda protein containing tryptophan-rich repeats, which may serve to anchor the protein within the cell wall. the latter encodes a 121-kda protein most similar to a tail fiber protein from phage 01205. functional mapping by insertion-duplication mutagenesis and gene complementation indicates that pblb may be a platelet adhesin and that expression of pblb may be linked to that of pbla. the combined data indicate that at least two genomic regions contribute to platelet binding by s. mitis. one encodes a probable transmembrane transporter, while the second encodes two large surface proteins resembling structural components of lysogenic  phages.

TI  == analysis of six prophages in lactococcus lactis il1403: different genetic structure of temperate and virulent phage populations.
AB  == we report the genetic organisation of six prophages present in the genome of lactococcus lactis il1403. the three larger prophages (36-42 kb), belong to the already described p335 group of temperate phages, whereas the three smaller ones  (13-15 kb) are most probably satellites relying on helper phage(s) for multiplication. these data give a new insight into the genetic structure of lactococcal phage populations. p335 temperate phages have variable genomes, sharing homology over only 10-33% of their length. in contrast, virulent phages have highly similar genomes sharing homology over >90% of their length. further analysis of genetic structure in all known groups of phages active on other bacterial hosts such as escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, mycobacterium: and streptococcus thermophilus confirmed the existence of two types of genetic structure related to the phage way of life. this might reflect different intensities of horizontal dna exchange: low among purely virulent phages and high among temperate phages and their lytic homologues. we suggest that the constraints on genetic exchange among purely virulent phages reflect their optimal genetic organisation, adapted to a more specialised and extreme form of parasitism than temperate/lytic phages.

AB  == a cryptic plasmid designated psbo2 (3582 bp) was isolated from streptococcus bovis jb1. the psbo2 contained putative sites for a double-strand origin (dso), a small transcriptional repressor protein (cop), countertranscribed rnas (ctrnas),  and a replication protein (rep), which were similar to those from pmv158 and pls1, which were isolated from s. agalactiae, and pwvo1, isolated from lactococcus lactis. the putative single-strand origin (sso) of psbo2 was similar  to per341 and pst1, which were isolated from s. thermophilus. recombinant plasmid designated psbe2 was constructed to bind pecm184 vector and the dna fragment containing sso, dso, cop, ctrnas, and rep of psbo2. when psbe2 was introduced into s. bovis 12-u-1 and no8, the plasmids in the transformants had deleted the 160-bp fragment between sso and dso. this plasmid, designated psbe2a, was capable of transforming escherichia coli and s. bovis strains 12-u-1 and no8 on high frequency; therefore, psbe2a is an effective shuttle vector.

TI  == molecular properties of streptococcus thermophilus plasmid per35 encoding a restriction modification system.
AB  == bacteriophage attack on lactic fermentation bacteria (lfb) is costly to the dairy industry because it results in product loss. one mechanism used by lfb to protect themselves from bacteriophage attack is restriction of foreign dna. three plasmids, per16, per35, and per36, from three different strains of the thermotolerant dairy fermentation bacterium streptococcus thermophilus were sequenced. one of these plasmids, per35, isolated from s. thermophilus st135, encoded a type ic restriction-modification (r-m) system very similar to those encoded on plasmids pil2614 in lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and pnd861 in lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis. the high degree of identity between the  r-m systems encoded on per35, pil2614, and pnd861 indicated the potential for horizontal transfer of these genes between different species of lactic fermentation bacteria. similar to the functional r-m system encoded on pil2614 that protects the mesophilic l. lactis subsp. lactis against phage attack, the r-m system on per35 most likely functions in the same role in s. thermophilus st135. the plasmid per16 was found to encode the specificity subunit of the r-m system, but not the r or m subunits. in addition, all three plasmids encoded proteins that are present on other s. thermophilus plasmids, including a protein  for rolling-circle replication (repa) and a low-molecular-weight stress protein (hsp). the presence of a complete r-m system encoded on a plasmid in s. thermophilus, a species that often lacks plasmids, is novel and may be beneficial for protecting s. thermophilus from bacteriophage attack under dairy fermentation conditions.

TI  == efficient insertional mutagenesis in streptococcus thermophilus.
AB  == bacteria have always been considered ideal organisms for genetic analysis. while  this is true for some model organisms, like escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and, more recently, lactococcus lactis, genetic analysis of other organisms is often prevented by lack of valuable tools, like vectors, transposons and methods  for transformation, gene inactivation and random insertional mutagenesis. this is the case of the moderately thermophilic bacterium streptococcus thermophilus, an  organism that, in spite of its widespread use for food fermentations, is only poorly characterized. we report here an insertional mutagenesis system that allows efficient random mutagenesis, easy characterization of the interrupted genes and construction of stable null mutations. this may become a powerful s. thermophilus tool for both genetic analysis and construction of 'food-grade' mutants of this biotechnologically relevant microorganism.

TI  == branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis is essential for optimal growth of streptococcus thermophilus in milk.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria are nutritionally demanding bacteria which need, among other things, amino acids for optimal growth. we identified the branched-chain amino acid (bcaa) biosynthesis pathway as an essential pathway for optimal growth of streptococcus thermophilus in milk. through random insertional mutagenesis, we isolated and characterized two mutants for which growth in milk is affected as a  consequence of ilvb and ilvc gene interruptions. this situation demonstrates that the bcaa biosynthesis pathway is active in s. thermophilus. bcaa biosynthesis is  necessary but not sufficient for optimal growth of s. thermophilus and is subject to retro-inhibition processes. the specificity of the bcaa biosynthesis pathway in s. thermophilus lies in the independent transcription of the ilvc gene encoding a keto acid reductoisomerase acting on acetolactate at the junction of the bcaa and acetoin biosynthesis pathways. the possible advantages for s. thermophilus of keeping this biosynthesis pathway active could be linked either to adaptation of the organism to milk, which is different than that of other dairy bacteria, or to the role of the pathway in maintaining the internal ph.

(one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms,  yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had  a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.

AB  == in bacterial communities one bacterium can influence the growth of other members  of the population. these interactions may be based on nutritional factors or may  occur via bacterial signaling molecules that are released in the medium. we present an example, showing that in addition to the above means of interactions,  muramidases, enzymes that specifically cleave peptidoglycan chains, can also mediate interactions between bacteria. using fluorescent in situ hybridization we demonstrate that lactococcus lactis muramidase acma can hydrolyze the cell wall of streptococcus thermophilus, without affecting viability. this intercellular activity of the lactococcal muramidase results in chain disruption of streptococci in vivo. our data lead us to propose that chains can give growth advantages to streptococci in aerobic conditions.

TI  == screening of lactic acid bacteria for bile salt hydrolase activity.
AB  == bile salt hydrolysis is an important metabolic reaction in the bile salt metabolism of mammals. this reaction has a facilitating effect for bile salt excretion but can also be involved in various illnesses. in recent years interest has increased to use bile salt hydrolysis to influence the cholesterol metabolism of humans and farm animals. to understand the distribution and range of bile salt hydrolase activity in lactic acid bacteria, we screened more than 300 strains of  the genera bifidobacterium and lactobacillus and the species lactococcus lactis,  leuconostoc mesenteroides, and streptococcus thermophilus. results obtained for 273 strains showed that bile salt hydrolase activity is common in bifidobacterium and lactobacillus but absent in l. lactis, leu. mesenteroides, and s. thermophilus. nearly all bifidobacteria species and strains have bile salt hydrolase activity, whereas this activity can only be found in selected species of lactobacilli. a strong correlation can be observed between the habitat of a genus or species and the presence of bile salt hydrolase activity. most often bile salt hydrolase activity is found in strains that have been isolated from the intestines or from feces from mammals--an environment rich in conjugated and unconjugated bile acids. strains and species from other habitats like milk or vegetables--environments from which bile salts are absent--do normally not have bile salt hydrolase activity. in two independent assays, we established that bile salt hydrolase activity in bifidobacteria is, in general, much higher than in lactobacilli.

AB  == the temperate phage tpw22, induced from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris w22, and the evolutionarily interesting integrase of this phage were characterized. phage tpw22 was propagated lytically on l. lactis subsp. cremoris 3107, which could also be lysogenized by site-specific integration. the attachment site (attp), 5'-taaggcgacggtcg-3', of phage tpw22 was present on a 7.5-kb ecori fragment, a 3.4-kb ecori-hindiii fragment of which was sequenced. sequence information revealed the presence of an integrase gene (int). the deduced amino acid sequence showed 42 and 28% identity with integrases of streptococcal and lactococcal phages, respectively. the identities with these integrase-encoding genes were 52 and 45%, respectively, at the nucleotide level. this could indicate horizontal gene transfer. a stable integration vector containing attp and int was constructed, and integration in l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 was obtained. the existence of an exchangeable lactococcal phage integration module was suggested. the proposed module covers the phage attachment site, the integrase gene, and surrounding factor-independent terminator structures. the phages philc3, tp901-1, and tpw22 all have different versions of this module. phylogenetically, the tpw22 int links the philc3 lactococcal integrase with known streptococcus thermophilus integrases.

TI  == characterization in vitro and in vivo of a new hu family protein from streptococcus thermophilus st11.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is a thermophilic gram-positive bacterium belonging to the lactic acid group. we report the isolation and characterization of a new 9.6-kda dna-binding protein, hsth, belonging to the hu family of nucleoid-associated proteins. the hsth gene was isolated in a 2.5-kb genomic region, upstream of a gene with strong homology to lactococcus lactis pyrd. it is transcribed from a single e. coli sigma(70)-like promoter. based on its high level of sequence similarity to b. subtilis and e. coli hu, hsth appears to be an hu homologue. the hsth protein shows biochemical and functional properties typical of hu proteins from gram-positive bacteria, being heat-stable, acid-soluble, and homodimeric. when expressed in hu-deficient e. coli cells, hsth supported the growth of bacteriophage mu as efficiently as e. coli hu homo- and heterodimeric proteins. it did not, however, display any ihf-specific functions.  finally, we show that hsth binds to linear dna with no apparent specificity, forming protein-dna complexes similar but not identical to those observed with e. coli hu proteins.

TI  == functional analysis of glycosyltransferase genes from lactococcus lactis and other gram-positive cocci: complementation, expression, and diversity.
AB  == sixteen exopolysaccharide (eps)-producing lactococcus lactis strains were analyzed for the chemical compositions of their epss and the locations, sequences, and organization of the eps genes involved in eps biosynthesis. this allowed the grouping of these strains into three major groups, representatives of which were studied in detail. previously, we have characterized the eps gene cluster of strain nizo b40 (group i) and determined the function of three of its  glycosyltransferase (gtf) genes. fragments of the eps gene clusters of strains nizo b35 (group ii) and nizo b891 (group iii) were cloned, and these encoded the  nizo b35 priming galactosyltransferase, the nizo b891 priming glucosyltransferase, and the nizo b891 galactosyltransferase involved in the second step of repeating-unit synthesis. the nizo b40 priming glucosyltransferase gene epsd was replaced with an erythromycin resistance gene, and this resulted in loss of eps production. this epsd deletion was complemented with priming gtf genes from gram-positive organisms with known function and substrate specificity. although no eps production was found with priming galactosyltransferase genes from l. lactis or streptococcus thermophilus, complementation with priming glucosyltransferase genes involved in l. lactis eps and streptococcus pneumoniae  capsule biosynthesis could completely restore or even increase eps production in  l. lactis.

TI  == cold shock proteins and low-temperature response of streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302.
AB  == low-temperature adaptation and cryoprotection were studied in the thermophilic lactic acid bacterium streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302. s. thermophilus actively adapts to freezing during a pretreatment at 20 degrees c, resulting in an approximately 1, 000-fold increased survival after four freeze-thaw cycles compared to mid-exponential-phase cells grown at an optimal temperature of 42 degrees c. no adaptation is observed when cells are exposed to a temperature (10  degrees c) below the minimal growth temperature of the strain (just below 15 degrees c). by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis several 7-kda cold-induced proteins were identified, which are the major induced proteins after a shift to 20 degrees c. these cold shock proteins were maximally expressed at 20 degrees c, while the induction level was low after cold shock to 10 degrees c. to confirm the presence of csp genes in s. thermophilus, a pcr strategy was used which yielded products of different sizes. sequence analysis revealed csp-like sequences that were up to 95% identical to those of csp genes of s. thermophilus  st1-1, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and lactococcus lactis. northern blot analysis revealed a seven- to ninefold induction of csp mrna after a temperature shift to 20 degrees c, showing that this thermophilic bacterium indeed contains at least one cold-inducible csp gene and that its regulation takes place at the transcriptional level.

AB  == production of pediocin in pediococcus acidilactici is associated with pmbr1.0, which encodes prepediocin, a pediocin immunity protein, and two proteins involved in secretion and precursor processing. these four genes are organized as an operon under control of a single promoter. we have constructed shuttle vectors that contain all four structural genes, the chromosomal promoter st(p2201) from streptococcus thermophilus, and repa from the 2-kbp s. thermophilus plasmid per8. the recombinant plasmid, ppc318, expressed and secreted active pediocin in escherichia coli. streptococcus thermophilus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, and enterococcus faecalis were electrotransformed with ppc418, a modified vector  fitted with an erythromycin resistance tracking gene. pediocin was produced and secreted in each of the lactic acid bacteria, and production was stable for up to ten passages. the expression of pediocin in dairy fermentation microbes has important implications for bacteriocins as food preservatives in dairy products.

TI  == peps from streptococcus thermophilus. a new member of the aminopeptidase t family of thermophilic bacteria.
AB  == the proteolytic system of lactic acid bacteria is essential for bacterial growth  in milk but also for the development of the organoleptic properties of dairy products. streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry. in comparison with the model lactic acid bacteria lactococcus lactis, s. thermophilus possesses two additional peptidases (an oligopeptidase and the aminopeptidase peps). to understand how s. thermophilus grows in milk, we purified and characterized this aminopeptidase. peps is a monomeric metallopeptidase of approximately 45 kda with optimal activity in the range ph 7.5-8.5 and at 55 degrees c on arg-paranitroanilide as substrate. peps exhibits a high specificity towards peptides possessing arginine or aromatic amino acids at  the n-terminus. from the n-terminal protein sequence of peps, we deduced degenerate oligonucleotides and amplified the corresponding gene by successive pcr reactions. the deduced amino-acid sequence of the peps gene has high identity (40-50%) with the aminopeptidase t family from thermophilic and extremophilic bacteria; we thus propose the classification of peps from s. thermophilus as a new member of this family. in view of its substrate specificity, peps could be involved both in bacterial growth by supplying amino acids, and in the development of dairy products' flavour, by hydrolysing bitter peptides and liberating aromatic amino acids which are important precursors of aroma compounds.

TI  == study of the possible mechanisms involved in the mucosal immune system activation by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the induction of a mucosal immune response is not easy due to the development of  oral tolerance, but under some conditions, bacteria can activate this immune system. antigens administered orally can interact with m cells of peyer's patches or bind to the epithelial cells. we have demonstrated that certain lactic acid bacteria are able to induce specific secretory immunity, and others will enhance  the gut inflammatory immune response. the aim of this work was to establish the reason for these different behaviors and to define possible mechanisms involved in the interaction of lactic acid bacteria at the intestinal level. we studied iga+ and igm+ b cells comparatively in bronchus and intestine and cd4+ t cells and iga anti-lactic acid bacteria antibodies in the intestinal fluid, induced by  oral administration of lactobacillus casei, lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, lb.  acidophilus, lb. plantarum, lb. rhamnosus, lactococcus lactis, and streptococcus  salivarius ssp. thermophilus. the increase in the iga+ b cells in the bronchus means that these lactic acid bacteria were able to induce the iga cycle by interaction with m cells from peyer's patches or intestinal epithelial cells. the igm+ cells increased when the stimulus did not induce the switch from igm+ to iga+. the increase in the cd4+ cells suggests interaction of peyer's patches and  enhancement of the b- and t-cell migration. the anti-lactic acid bacteria antibody is related to the processing and presentation of the microorganisms to the immune cells. we demonstrated that lb. casei and lb. plantarum were able to interact with peyer's patch cells and showed an increase in iga-, cd4+ cells, and antibodies specific for the stimulating strain. lactobacillus acidophilus induced gut mucosal activation by interaction with the epithelial cells without increase  in the immune cells associated with the bronchus. although lb. rhamnosus and strep. salivarius ssp. thermophilus interact with epithelial cells, they also induced an immune response against their epitopes. lactococcus lactis and lb. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus induced an increase of iga+ cells entering the iga cycle but not cd4+ cells; thus, these bacteria would have been bound to epithelial cells that activated b lymphocytes without processing and presenting of their epitopes. we did not determine specific antibodies against lc. lactis or lb. bulgaricus.

TI  == introduction of the exopolysaccharide gene cluster from streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 into lactococcus lactis mg1363: production and characterization of an altered polysaccharide.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 produces an exopolysaccharide (eps) composed of glucose, galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine in the molar ratio of 1:2:1. the genes responsible for the eps biosynthesis have been isolated previously and found to be clustered in a 14.5 kb region encoding 13 genes. transfer of this gene cluster into a non-eps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363, yielded an eps with a similar high molecular weight, but a different structure from the eps from the native host. the structure of the recombinant eps was determined by means of 1h homonuclear and 1h-13c heteronuclear two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectra and was found to be -->  3)-beta-d-glcp-(1 --> 3)-alpha-d-galp-(1 --> 3)-beta-d-galp-(1 --> as opposed to  --> 3)[alpha-d-galp-(1 --> 6)]-beta-d-glcp-(1 --> 3)-alpha-d-galpnac-(1 --> 3)-beta-d-galp-(1 --> for the wild-type s. thermophilus sfi6. furthermore, l. lactis mg1363 (pfs101) was also lacking a udp-n-acetylglucosamine c4-epimerase activity, which would provide udp-galnac for a galnac incorporation into the eps  and probably caused the substitution of galnac by gal in the recombinant eps. this modification implies that (i) bacterial glycosyltransferases could potentially have multiple specificities for the donor and the acceptor sugar molecule; and (ii) the repeating unit polymerase can recognize and polymerize a repeating unit that differs in the backbone as well as in the side-chain from its native substrate.

TI  == are horizontal transfers involved in the evolution of the streptococcus thermophilus exopolysaccharide synthesis loci?
AB  == a 32.5kb variable locus of the streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 chromosome, the eps locus, contains 25 orf and seven insertion sequences (is). the putative products of 17 orf are related to proteins involved in the synthesis of polysaccharides in various bacteria. the two distal regions and a small central region of the eps locus are constant and present in all or almost all of the s. thermophilus strains tested. the other regions are variable and present in only some s. thermophilus strains tested, particularly in the closely related strains  cnrz368 and a054. a 13.6kb variable region of the eps locus of s. thermophilus cnrz368 contains two orf that are almost identical to epsl and orfy of the eps locus of lactococcus lactis nizob40 and seven is belonging to four different families, iss1, is981, is1193 and is1194. five of these sequences were probably acquired by horizontal transfer from l. lactis (bourgoin, f., et al., 1996. gene  178, 15-23). three probes of this 13.6kb region hybridized with the dna of several l. lactis strains tested. a specific probe for another sequence within the s. thermophilus eps locus, epsf, hybridized with the dna of one of the l. lactis strains tested. sequence comparisons also suggest that five orf of the eps locus have a mosaic structure and probably result from recombinations between sequences that are 10 to 50% divergent. the chimeric structure of the eps locus suggests a very complex evolution. this evolution probably involves both the acquisition of the 13.6kb region from l. lactis by horizontal transfer and exchanges within the s. thermophilus species.

TI  == ctsr, a novel regulator of stress and heat shock response, controls clp and molecular chaperone gene expression in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == clpp and clpc of bacillus subtillis encode subunits of the clp atp-dependent protease and are required for stress survival, including growth at high temperature. they play essential roles in stationary phase adaptive responses such as the competence and sporulation developmental pathways, and belong to the  so-called class iii group of heat shock genes, whose mode of regulation is unknown and whose expression is induced by heat shock or general stress conditions. the product of ctsr, the first gene of the clpc operon, has now been  shown to act as a repressor of both clpp and clpc, as well as clpe, which encodes a novel member of the hsp100 clp atpase family. the ctsr protein was purified and shown to bind specifically to the promoter regions of all three clp genes. random mutagenesis, dnasel footprinting and dna sequence deletions and comparisons were  used to define a consensus ctsr recognition sequence as a directly repeated heptad upstream from the three clp genes. this target sequence was also found upstream from clp and other heat shock genes of several gram-positive bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus salivarius, s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, leuconostoc oenos, lactobacillus sake, lactococcus lactis and clostridium acetobutylicum. ctsr homologues were also identified in several of these bacteria, indicating that heat shock regulation by ctsr is highly conserved in gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == molecular ecology and evolution of streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages--a review.
AB  == bacteriophages attacking streptococcus thermophilus, a lactic acid bacterium used in milk fermentation, are a threat to the dairy industry. these small isometric-headed phages possess double-stranded dna genomes of 31 to 45 kb. yoghurt-derived phages exhibit a limited degree of variability, as defined by restriction pattern and host range, while a large diversity of phage types have been isolated from cheese factories. despite this diversity all s. thermophilus phages, virulent and temperate, belong to a single dna homology group. several mechanisms appear to create genetic variability in this phage group. site-specific deletions, one type possibly mediated by a viral recombinase/integrase, which transformed a temperate into a virulent phage, were  observed. recombination as a result of superinfection of a lysogenic host has been reported. comparative dna sequencing identified up to 10% sequence diversity due to point mutations. genome sequencing of the prototype temperate phage phi sfi21 revealed many predicted proteins which showed homology with phages from lactococcus lactis suggesting horizontal gene transfer. homology with phages from evolutionary unrelated bacteria like e. coli (e.g. lambdoid phage 434 and p1) and mycobacterium phi l5 was also found. due to their industrial importance, the existence of large phage collections, and the whole phage genome sequencing projects which are currently underway, the s. thermophilus phages may present an  interesting experimental system to study bacteriophage evolution.

AB  == comparative sequence analysis of 40% of the genomes from two prototype streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages (lytic group i phage phi sfi19 and the  cos site containing temperate phage phi sfi21) suggested two processes in the evolution of their genomes. in a first evolutionarily distant phase the basic genome structure was apparently constituted by modular exchanges. over the 17-kb-long dna segment analyzed in the present report, we observed clusters of genes with similarity to genes from leuconostoc oenos phage l10, lactococcus lactis phage bk5-t, and streptococcus pneumoniae phage dp-1. a chimeric protein was predicted for orf 1291 which showed similarity to both phage bk5-t and phage  dp-1 proteins. the very large orf 1626 gene product showed similarity to two adjacent genes from the lactobacillus delbrueckii phage ll-h and further phage proteins (lactococcus lactis, bacillus subtills). the similarities were localized to distinct parts of this apparently multifunctional protein. the putative phi sfi19 lysin showed similarity to both lysins of phages and cellular enzymes. in a second, evolutionarily more recent, phase the s, thermophilus phage genomes apparently diversified by point mutations and small deletions/insertions. over the investigated 17-kb dna region phi sfi19 differed from phi sfi21 by 10% base pair changes, the majority of which were point mutations (mainly at the third codon position), while a third of the base pair differences were contributed by small deletions/insertions. the base pair changes were unevenly distributed. over the leuconostoc phage-related dna the change rate was high, while over the lactococcus and s. pneumoniae phage-related dna the change rate was low. we speculate that the degree of base pair change could provide relative time scales  for the modular exchange reactions observed in s. thermophilus phages.

TI  == molecular characterization of a phage-inducible middle promoter and its transcriptional activator from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31.
AB  == an inducible middle promoter from the lactococcal bacteriophage phi31 was isolated previously by shotgun cloning an 888-bp fragment (p15a10) upstream of the beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) gene (lacz.st) from streptococcus thermophilus  (d. j. o'sullivan, s. a. walker, s. g. west, and t. r. klaenhammer, bio/technology 14:82-87, 1996). the promoter showed low levels of constitutive beta-gal activity which could be induced two- to threefold over baseline levels after phage infection. during this study, the fragment was subcloned and characterized to identify a smaller, tightly regulated promoter fragment which allowed no beta-gal activity until after phage infection. this fragment, defined  within nucleotides 566 to 888 (p(566-888); also called fragment 566-888), contained tandem, phage-inducible transcription start sites at nucleotides 703 and 744 (703/744 start sites). consensus -10 regions were present upstream of both start sites, but no consensus -35 regions were identified for either start site. a transcriptional activator, encoded by an open reading frame (orf2) upstream of the 703/744 start sites, was identified for p(566-888). orf2 activated p(566-888) when provided in trans in escherichia coli. in addition, when combined with ptrk391 (p15a10::lacz.st) in lactococcus lactis nck203, an antisense orf2 construct was able to retard induction of the phage-inducible promoter as measured by beta-gal activity levels. finally, gel shift assays showed that orf2 was able to bind to promoter fragment 566-888. deletion analysis of the region upstream from the tandem promoters identified a possible binding site for transcriptional activation of the phage promoters. the dna-binding ability of orf2 was eliminated upon deletion of part of this region, which lies centered approximately 35 bp upstream of start site 703. deletion analysis and mutagenesis studies also elucidated a critical region downstream of the 703/744 start sites, where mutagenesis resulted in a two- to threefold increase in beta-gal activity. with these improvements, the level of expression achieved by an explosive-expression strategy was elevated from 3,000 to 11,000 beta-gal units within 120 min after induction.

AB  == a highly conserved dna region extending over 5 kb was observed in streptococcus thermophilus bacteriophages. comparative sequencing of one temperate and 26 virulent phages demonstrated in the most extreme case an 18% aa difference for a  predicted protein, while the majority of the phages showed fewer, if any aa changes. the relative degree of aa conservation was not homogeneous over the dna  segment investigated. sequence analysis of the conserved segment revealed genes possibly involved in dna transactions. three predicted proteins (orf 233, 443, and 382 gene product (gp)) showed nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. orf 443 gp showed in addition a deah box motif, characteristically found in a subgroup of helicases, and a variant zinc finger motif known from a phage t7 helicase/primase. tree analysis classified orf 443 gp as a distant member of the  helicase superfamily. orf 382 gp showed similarity to putative plasmid dna primases. downstream of orf 382 a noncoding repeat region was identified that showed similarity to a putative minus origin from a cryptic s. thermophilus plasmid. four predicted proteins showed not only high degrees of aa identity (34  to 63%) with proteins from lactococcus lactis phages, but their genes showed a similar topological organization. we interpret this as evidence for a horizontal  gene transfer event between phages of the two bacterial genera in the distant past.

TI  == identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  == when lactic acid bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees c for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees c for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and pediococcus pentosaceus po2 (18%), but not for the lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of lactobacillus helveticus lb1 and streptococcus thermophilus ts2. when the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even  further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. use of degenerate pcr primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis resulted in pcr products from all strains  tested. the pcr product from lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis m474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. use of pcr primers based on the m474 sequence resulted in pcr products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not  from the lactobacillus helveticus, streptococcus thermophilus, or pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.

TI  == presence of additional peptidases in streptococcus thermophilus cnrz 302 compared to lactococcus lactis.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus is widely used in the dairy industry but little is known about its peptidase system. the aim of this study was to determine the biochemical and genetic characteristics of this system, and to compare it to the  well known system of lactococcus lactis. we separated the intracellular proteins  of strep. thermophilus cnrz 302 and l. lactis ncdo 763 by ion-exchange chromatography and we detected the activity of the different types of peptidases. in both l. lactis and strep. thermophilus strains, we showed 13 different peptidase activities with biochemical homologies between both species. streptococcus thermophilus also possessed two peptidases which we did not find in l. lactis: an aminopeptidase and an oligopeptidase. we performed southern blot experiments and among the eight peptidase genes tested, only the genes encoding the general aminopeptidases, pepc and pepn, were homologous between the l. lactis and strep. thermophilus strains. besides biochemical and genetic similarities, the peptidase systems of strep. thermophilus and l. lactis thus differed by the presence of additional peptidases in strep. thermophilus.

TI  == cell wall anchoring of the streptococcus pyogenes m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the m6 protein from streptococcus pyogenes is the best-characterized member of a  family of cell envelope-associated proteins. based on the observation that the c-terminal sorting signals of these proteins can drive cell wall anchoring of heterologous unanchored proteins, we have cloned and expressed the emm6 structural gene for the m6 protein in various lactic acid bacteria (lab). the emm6 gene was successfully expressed from lactococcal promoters in several lactococcus lactis strains, an animal-colonizing lactobacillus fermentum strain,  lactobacillus sake, and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. the m6 protein was efficiently anchored to the cell wall in all strains tested. in lactobacilli, essentially all detectable m6 protein was cell wall associated. these results suggest the feasibility of using the c-terminal anchor moiety of m6 for protein surface display in lab.

TI  == characterization of a thiol-dependent endopeptidase from lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32.
AB  == an endopeptidase gene (pepe) was isolated from a previously constructed genomic library of lactobacillus helveticus cnrz32. the pepe gene consisted of a 1,314-bp open reading frame encoding a putative peptide of 52.1 kda. significant identity  was found between the deduced amino acid sequence of pepe and the sequences for aminopeptidase c from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis dsm7290, l. helveticus cnrz32, streptococcus thermophilus cnrz302, and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris am2. a recombinant pepe fusion protein containing an n-terminal six-histidine tag was constructed and purified to electrophoretic homogeneity. characterization of pepe revealed that it was a thiol-dependent protease having a monomeric mass of 50 kda, with optimum temperature, nacl concentration, and ph for activity at 32 to 37 degrees c, 0.5%, and 4.5, respectively. pepe had significant activity under conditions which simulate those of ripening cheese (10 degrees c, 4% nacl, ph 5.1). pepe hydrolyzed internal peptide bonds in met-enkephalin and bradykinin; however, hydrolysis of alpha-, beta-, and kappa-caseins was not detected.

TI  == characterization of a mosaic iss1 element and evidence for the recent horizontal  transfer of two different types of iss1 between streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis.
AB  == a 12-kb region of the streptococcus thermophilus cnrz368 chromosome was found to  contain two copies of is981 (one complete and one truncated) and three copies of  iss1 (two complete, iss1sa and iss1sc, and one truncated, delta iss1sb). comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these iss1 elements with those of previously identified iso-iss1 elements from lactococcus lactis and the enterococcus genus indicated that the iss1 group is divided into three distinct subgroups which we have named alpha, beta and gamma. nucleotide sequences of elements belonging to the same subgroup share more than 97% identity whereas sequences of elements from different groups share only 75-85% identity. sequence  analysis of iss1sa and delta iss1sb showed that they are members of the alpha group. we found that iss1sc from s. themophilus cnrz368, an iss1 from l. lactis il964 and is946 from l. lactis tek1 resulted from recombinations between alpha and beta elements. in addition, iss1w from l. lactis wg2 resulted from a recombination event between a gamma element and an iss1 belonging to an unidentified subgroup. iss1 sequences belonging to the alpha and beta subgroups were found in both s. thermophilus and l. lactis and gamma sequences were found in both the enterococcus genus and l. lactis. the quasi-identity of some iss1 elements in s. thermophilus and l. lactis and the distribution of alpha and beta  elements suggest that horizontal transfer of iss1 elements recently took place from l. lactis to s. thermophilus, two lactic acid bacteria used in the manufacture of cheeses. since the presence of is981 in s. thermophilus cnrz368 also probably resulted from a horizontal transfer from l. lactis [guedon et al. (1995) mol. microbiol. 16, 69-78], the 12-kb region bearing is981 and iss1 elements could be due to the integration of a lactococcal dna fragment into the chromosome.

TI  == genomic organization of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == current knowledge of the genomes of the lactic acid bacteria, lactococcus lactis  and streptococcus thermophilus, and members of the genera lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus and carnobacterium, is reviewed. the genomes contain a chromosome within the size range of 1.8 to 3.4 mbp. plasmids are common in lactococcus lactis (most strains carry 4-7 different plasmids), some of the lactobacilli and pediococci, but they are not frequently present in s. thermophilus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus or the intestinal lactobacilli. five is elements have been found in l. lactis and most strains carry multiple copies of at least two of them; some strains also carry a 68-kbp conjugative transposon. is elements have been found in the genera lactobacillus and leuconostoc, but not in s. thermophilus. prophages are also a normal component of the l. lactis genome and lysogeny is common in the lactobacilli, however it appears to be rare in s. thermophilus. physical and genetic maps for two l. lactis subsp. lactis strains, two l. lactis subsp. cremoris strains and s. thermophilus a054 have been constructed and each reveals the presence of six rrn  operons clustered in less than 40% of the chromosome. the l. lactis subsp. cremoris mg1363 map contains 115 genetic loci and the s. thermophilus map has 35. the maps indicate significant plasticity in the l. lactis subsp. cremoris chromosome in the form of a number of inversions and translocations. the cause(s) of these rearrangements is (are) not known. a number of potentially powerful genetic tools designed to analyse the l. lactis genome have been constructed in recent years. these tools enable gene inactivation, gene replacement and gene recovery experiments to be readily carried out with this organism, and potentially with other lactic acid bacteria and gram-positive bacteria. integration vectors based on temperate phage attb sites and the random insertion  of is elements have also been developed for l. lactis and the intestinal lactobacilli. in addition, a l. lactis sex factor that mobilizes the chromosome in a manner reminiscent to that seen with escherichia coli hfr strains has been discovered and characterized. with the availability of this new technology, research into the genome of the lactic acid bacteria is poised to undertake a period of extremely rapid information accrual.

TI  == the effect of cations on the hydrolysis of lactose and the transferase reactions  catalysed by beta-galactosidase from six strains of lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == development and characterization of lactose-positive pediococcus species for milk fermentation.
AB  == bacteriophages against streptococcus thermophilus are a growing problem in the italian cheese industry. one possible control method involves replacing s. thermophilus in mozzarella starter blends with lactic acid bacteria from a different genus or species. in this study, we evaluated lactose-positive pediococci for this application. because we could not identify any commercially available pediococci with fast acid-producing ability in milk, we transformed pediococcus pentosaceus atcc 25744, p. pentosaceus atcc 25745, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 12697 by electroporation with ppn-1, a 35-kb lactococcus lactis lactose plasmid. transformants of p. pentosaceus atcc 25745 and p. acidilactici atcc 12697 were then used to examine lactose-positive pediococci for properties related to milk fermentation. both transformants rapidly produced acid and efficiently retained ppn-1 in lactose broth, and neither bacterium was attacked by bacteriophages in whey collected from commercial cheese facilities. paired starter combinations of pediococcus spp. and lactobacillus helveticus lh100 exhibited synergistic ph reduction in milk, and small-scale cheese trials showed  that these cultures could be used to manufacture part-skim mozzarella cheese. results demonstrate that lactose-positive pediococci have potential as replacement cocci for s. thermophilus in italian cheese starter blends and may facilitate development of new strain rotation schemes to combat s. thermophilus bacteriophage problems in mozzarella cheese plants.

AB  == a 2.8-kb cryptic plasmid showing no homology to either pfx3 (rolling circle, pe194-type) or pci305 (theta-type) lactococcal replicons was identified in lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. the plasmid, pwc1, was compatible with both pci3340 (a pci305 derivative) and pfx3 in l. lactis subsp. cremoris 2204. sequence analysis of pwc1 showed one major orf encoding a protein with a deduced  size of 316 amino acids (aa). database comparisons showed that the protein was distinct from the pfx- and pci-type replication proteins (less than 21% aa identity), but shared significant homology (up to 57% aa identity) with the replication proteins from a different group of rolling circle plasmids (pc194-type) commonly found in gram-positive bacteria. a pc194-type rolling circle plasmid has not been previously described in l. lactis. further sequence analysis showed a conserved double-stranded origin of replication in pwc1 preceded by a large (118-bp) direct repeat. the chloramphenicol-resistance gene from pc194 was inserted into a nonessential region of pwc1 to give pcp12. the host range of pcp12 included streptococcus thermophilus, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus aureus, but not escherichia coli. both pcp12 and to a lesser extent pwc1 generated single-stranded dna (ssdna) in l. lactis. a possible single-stranded origin of replication was identified by sequence analysis of pwc1 and by comparing levels of ssdna produced by pcp12 deletion derivatives. the pwc1 replicon may be a useful addition to other replicons currently available for vector construction.

AB  == we report the identification and characterization of the eps gene cluster of streptococcus thermophilus sfi6 required for exopolysaccharide (eps) synthesis. this report is the first genetic work concerning eps production in a food microorganism. the eps secreted by this strain consists of the following tetrasaccharide repeating unit:-->3)-beta-d-galp-(1-->3)-[alpha-d-galp-(1-->6)]-beta-d- d-galp-(1-->3)-alpha-d-galp-d-galpnac-(1-->. the genetic locus the genetic locus  was identified by tn916 mutagenesis in combination with a plate assay to identify eps mutants. sequence analysis of the gene region, which was obtained from subclones of a genomic library of sfi6, revealed a 15.25-kb region encoding 15 open reading frames. eps expression in the non-eps-producing heterologous host, lactococcus lactis mg1363, showed that within the 15.25-kb region, a region with  a size of 14.52 kb encoding the 13 genes epsa to epsm was capable of directing eps synthesis and secretion in this host. homology searches of the predicted proteins in the swiss-prot database revealed high homology (40 to 68% identity) for epsa, b, c, d, and e and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus agalactiae. moderate to low homology (37 to 18% identity) was detected for epsb, d, f, and h and the genes involved in capsule synthesis in staphylococcus aureus for epsc, d, and e and the genes involved in exopolysaccharide i (epsi) synthesis in rhizobium meliloti for epsc to epsj and the genes involved in lipopolysaccharide synthesis in members of the  enterobacteriaceae, and finally for eps k and lipb of neisseria meningitidis. genes (epsj, epsl, and epsm) for which the predicted proteins showed little or no homology with proteins in the swiss-prot database were shown to be involved in eps synthesis by single-crossover gene disruption experiments.

TI  == efficient insertional mutagenesis in lactococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == in lactococci, the study of chromosomal genes and their regulation is limited by  the lack of an efficient transposon mutagenesis system. we associated the insertion sequence iss1 with the thermosensitive replicon pg+ host to generate a  mutagenic tool that can be used even in poorly transformable strains. iss1 transposition is random in different lactococcal strains as well as in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus thermophilus. high-frequency random insertion (of about 1%) obtained with this system in lactococcus lactis allows efficient mutagenesis, with typically one insertion per cell. after iss1 replicative transposition, the chromosome contains duplicated iss1 sequences flanking pg+ host. this structure allows cloning of the interrupted gene. in addition, efficient excision of the plasmid leaves a single iss1 copy at the mutated site, thus generating a stable mutant strain with no foreign markers. mutants obtained by this transposition system are food grade and can thus be used in fermentation processes.

TI  == development of an expression strategy using a lytic phage to trigger explosive plasmid amplification and gene expression.
AB  == a novel plasmid-based expression strategy, exploiting two features of lytic bacteriophages, was developed in lactococcus lactis. components of this system include a phage origin of replication and phage expression signals, which were induced to high efficiency upon phage infection of the host. phage-specific expression signals were cloned from phi 31 in a promoter-screening strategy using the lacz gene from streptococcus thermophilus. one clone exhibited a significant  induction in beta-galactosidase production and concomitant increase in lacz mrna  during the phi 31 infection cycle of the host. molecular characterization of the  cloned insert revealed 888 bp positioned near the phi 31 cos site. primer extension analysis showed that transcription was induced approximately 20 min following phi 31 infection at four points, apparently organized in two sets of tandem promoters on the cloned phage insert. one of these middle phage promoters  also showed a basal level of activity prior to phage infection. the phi 31 promoter lacz cassette was cloned into a low-copy-number vector plasmid containing the phi 31 origin of replication (ori31) and the resulting low-copy-number plasmid exhibited negligible beta-galactosidase production in l.  lactis. however, > 2,000 units were detected following a deliberate infection with phi 31. a control expression plasmid without ori31 could only be induced to  85 units. the combination of these phage-inducible expression signals together with ori31 functioned synergistically to drive rapid and high efficiency expression of a heterologous gene in l. lactis.

TI  == highly bioluminescent streptococcus thermophilus strain for the detection of diary-relevant antibiotics in milk.
AB  == inefficient translational initiation is often the cause of poor foreign gene expression in gram-positive organisms. the expression of bacterial luciferase (lux) genes in streptococcus thermophilus (bioluminescence) was improved by addressing this problem in two ways; by ribosome-binding site (rbs) replacement,  and by enhancing lux rbs access by polymerase chain reaction modification either  alone or combined with translational coupling to a truncated upstream open- reading frame (orf') having its own rbs. lactococcal expression signals were employed for plasmid-based lux expression. the same constructs were used to monitor bioluminescence in lactococcus lactis, as well as two non-lactic bacterial strains, for comparison. high lux expression was achieved in all four organisms with a heterodimeric thermostable enzyme. surprisingly, where ready access to the lux rbs was predicted, translational coupling to the lactococcal orf remained a prerequisite for detectable lux expression in l. lactis. in contrast, high bioluminescence in s. thermophilus was independent of coupling. consistent with these observations, inspection of published gene sequences suggests that rbs "strength" may be a more important factor in translation in s.  thermophilus than in l. lactis. using reduced light production in highly bioluminescent s. thermophilus as an indicator of biocide presence in milk, test  times could be significantly shortened compared with a commercial test utilizing  the related non-bioluminescent strain. lux genes appear to be sensitive, exponential-phase reporters of gene activity in s. thermophilus, an organism with molecular biology and genetics that remain largely unstudied.

AB  == a 96 kda aminopeptidase was purified from streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus ncdo 573. the enzyme had similar properties to aminopeptidases isolated from lactococci and lactobacilli and showed a high degree of n-terminal  amino acid sequence homology to aminopeptidase n from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. it catalysed the hydrolysis of a range of aminoacyl 4-nitroanilides and 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and oligopeptides.  in common with aminopeptidases from other lactic acid bacteria, the enzyme from strep. salivarius subsp. thermophilus showed highest activity with lysyl derivatives but was also very active with arginyl and leucyl derivatives. relative activity with alanyl, phenylalanyl, tyrosyl, seryl and valyl derivatives was considerably lower and with glycyl, glutamyl and prolyl derivatives almost negligible. the aminopeptidase also catalysed the hydrolysis of dipeptides and tripeptides but mostly at rates much less than that with l-lysyl-4-nitroanilide and oligopeptides. the enzyme catalysed the successive hydrolysis of various amino acid residues from the n-terminus of several oligopeptides but it was unable to cleave peptide bonds on the n-terminal side of a proline residue.

TI  == gene cloning and characterization of pepc, a cysteine aminopeptidase from streptococcus thermophilus, with sequence similarity to the eucaryotic bleomycin  hydrolase.
AB  == streptococcus thermophilus cnrz 302 contains at least three general aminopeptidases able to hydrolyze phe-beta-naphthylamide substrate. the gene encoding one of these aminopeptidases was cloned from a total dna library of s. thermophilus cnrz 302 constructed in escherichia coli tg1 using pbluescript plasmid. the wild-type tg1 strain, although not deficient in aminopeptidase activity, is unable to hydrolyze the substrate phe-beta-naphthylamide, and thus the library could be screened with an enzymic plate assay using this substrate. one clone was selected which was shown to express an aminopeptidase, identified as a pepc-like enzyme on the basis of cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibodies directed against the lactococcal pepc cysteine aminopeptidase. the gene was further subcloned and sequenced. a complete open reading frame coding for a 445-residue (50414 da) polypeptide was identified. 70% identity was found between the deduced amino acid sequence and the sequence of pepc from lactococcus lactis  subspecies cremoris, confirming the identity of the cloned gene. high sequence similarity (38% identity) was also found with an eucaryotic enzyme, bleomycin hydrolase. in addition, the predicted amino acid sequence of the streptococcal pepc showed a region of strong similarity to the active site of cysteine proteinases with conservation of the residues involved in the catalytic site. the product of the cloned pepc gene was overproduced in e. coli and was purified from a cellular extract. purification to homogeneity was achieved by two-step ion-exchange chromatography. biochemical characterization of the pure recombinant enzyme confirms that the cloned peptidase is a thiol aminopeptidase possessing a  broad specificity. the enzyme has a molecular mass of 300 kda suggesting an hexameric structure. on the basis of sequence similarities as well as common biochemical and enzymic properties, the bacterial pepc-type enzymes and the eucaryotic bleomycin hydrolase constitute a new family of thiol aminopeptidases among the cysteine peptidases.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide sequencing of l-lactate dehydrogenase gene from streptococcus thermophilus m-192.
AB  == the gene encoding l-lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) was cloned from an industrial dairy strain of streptococcus thermophilus m-192 using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe based on the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, and its nucleotide sequence was determined. the enzyme was deduced to have 328 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 35,428 and found to have  high sequence similarity to ldhs from other lactic acid bacteria (89.0% to streptococcus mutans, 76.3% to lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, 67% to lactobacillus casei, and 60% to lactobacillus plantarum). the gene contained a promoter-like sequence similar to the escherichia coli promoter consensus, and expression of the s. thermophilus ldh gene was observed in e. coli cells.

TI  == direct screening of recombinants in gram-positive bacteria using the secreted staphylococcal nuclease as a reporter.
AB  == a system for direct screening of recombinant clones in lactococcus lactis, based  on secretion of the staphylococcal nuclease (snase) in the organism, was developed. the nuc gene (encoding snase) was cloned on both rolling-circle and theta-replicating plasmids. l. lactis strains containing these nuc+ plasmids secrete snase and are readily detectable by a simple plate test. a multicloning site (mcs) was introduced just after the cleavage site between leader peptide and the mature snase, without affecting nuclease activity. cloning foreign dna fragments into any site of the mcs interrupts nuc and thus results in nuc mutant  clones which are easily distinguished fron nuc+ clones on plates. the utility of  this system for l. lactis was demonstrated by cloning an antibiotic resistance marker and escherichia coli chromosomal dna fragments into the mcs of the nucmcs  cassette. both cloning vectors containing the nucmcs cassette were also introduced into streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, in which direct screening of nuc mutant recombinant clones was also achieved. the potential uses  of nuc as a secretion reporter system are discussed.

TI  == partial characterization of an rpod-like gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 with a polymerase chain reaction-based approach.
AB  == with degenerated oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of bacterial sigma factor proteins, a 117-bp internal dna fragment of an rpod-like gene of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis ml3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the dna sequence of this pcr product was determined by cycle sequencing, and the deduced amino acid sequence of this internal fragment showed  an extensive homology with the known sigma factor sequences from six other microorganisms and present a 13-amino acid region corresponding to the typical "rpod box" of primary sigma factors. this pcr product was used as a probe to specifically detect sigma homologs in pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc lactis, lactobacillus helveticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus thermophilus, and lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris. these data are consistent with the existence of a high similarity between the primary sigma factors from diverse gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in  fermented dairy products.
AB  == lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar has been developed for the enumeration of bifidobacteria in fermented dairy products. the medium contains lithium chloride  and sodium propionate to inhibit the growth of other lactic acid bacteria. pure cultures of bifidobacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci were tested for growth in this medium. with one exception, all bifidobacteria were able to grow in this  medium and in a nonselective agar with a difference not exceeding .4 log units. however, none of the lactobacilli tested and only one strain each of streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris grew in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar. in those cases, the numbers of colonies were lower in lithium chloride-sodium propionate agar by 1.26 and 2.51 log units, respectively, compared with a nonselective agar. bifidobacteria were also selectively isolated from all fermented milks and cheeses analyzed.

TI  == purification and characterization of an endopeptidase from lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris wg2.
AB  == an endopeptidase has been purified to homogeneity from a crude cell extract of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris wg2 by a procedure that includes diethyl-aminoethane-sephacel chromatography, phenyl-sepharose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, and fast protein liquid chromatography over an anion-exchange column and a hydrophobic-interaction column. gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated a molecular mass of the purified enzyme of 70,000 da. the endopeptidase can degrade several oligopeptides into various tetra-, tri-, and dipeptides. the endopeptidase has no aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase, dipeptidase, or tripeptidase activity. it is optimally active at ph 6.0 to 6.5 and in the temperature range of 30 to 38 degrees c. the enzyme is inactivated by the chemical agents 1,10-phenanthroline,  ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate, beta-mercaptoethanol, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and is inhibited by cu2+ and zn2+. the ethylenedinitrilotetraacetate- or 1,10-phenanthroline-treated enzyme can be reactivated by co2+. immunoblotting with specific antibodies raised against the purified endopeptidase indicated that the enzyme is also present in other lactococcus spp., as well as in lactobacillus spp. and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.

TI  == ultrasound treatment for harvesting an aminopeptidase from lactic acid bacteria and quantitation of the enzyme by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
AB  == ultrasound treatment of lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris am2 was optimized to release a maximum amount of intracellular aminopeptidase without modifying the antigenicity of the enzyme. the cells were sonicated three times for 30 s at 23 w. antibodies produced against the aminopeptidase purified from l. lactis subsp.  cremoris am2 enabled us to use immunoblotting to detect the enzyme in the lysates of all of the lactococci tested but not in the lysates of leuconostoc strains, lactobacilli, and streptococcus salivarus subsp. thermophilus. a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) was developed to quantify the purified  aminopeptidase; the detection limit was 4 ng/ml. the aminopeptidase in the supernatant obtained after the ultrasound treatment of strain am2 cells was detected with the elisa starting with a total protein concentration of 200 ng/ml. the proportion of equivalent purified aminopeptidase in the supernatant of l. lactis subsp. cremoris am2 was about 2% of the total protein. similarly, the aminopeptidase was quantified in different lactococci; the percentages varied between 0.16 and 2%, depending on the strain. the aminopeptidase content in a mixture of several lactic bacteria was also determined with the sandwich elisa.

TI  == distribution and purification of aspartate racemase in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the distribution of aspartate racemase (ec 5.1.1.13) in various kinds of bacteria demonstrated that the enzyme occurs in lactic acid bacteria, such as streptococcus species and lactobacillus species. the enzyme from streptococcus thermophilus iam10064 was more thermostable than that from streptococcus lactis iam1198 which contained the enzyme most abundantly among the lactic acid bacteria we examined here. we purified the enzyme about 3400-fold to homogeneity from cell-free extract of s. thermophilus, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of 28,000 as a homodimer. the enzyme utilizes specifically aspartate as a substrate, but not alanine and glutamate. maximal reaction velocity was observed at 37 degrees c and around ph 8.0. the sequence of the nh2-terminal amino acids of the enzyme was determined to be met-glu-asn-phe-phe-ser-ile-leu-gly-xxx-met-gly-thr-met-ala-thr-glu-ser- phe-.

TI  == isolation and characterization of chromosomal promoters of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  == a promoter probe vector, ptg244, was constructed with the aim of isolating transcription initiation signals from streptococcus thermophilus (streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus). ptg244 is based on the escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle vector ptg222, into which the promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of bacillus pumilus (cat-86) was cloned. random sau3a fragments from the s. thermophilus a054 chromosomal dna were cloned  upstream of the cat-86 gene by using e. coli as the host. the pool of recombinant plasmids were introduced into s. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis in order to search for promoter activity in these hosts. for s. thermophilus, it was necessary to first select erythromycin-resistant transformants and then to screen for chloramphenicol resistance among these. direct selection of chloramphenicol-resistant clones was, however, possible in l. lactis subsp. lactis. six fragments exhibiting promoter activity were characterized in s. thermophilus by measuring the levels of cat-86 transcription  and/or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase specific activity. three of the promoter-carrying fragments were sequenced. the 5' ends of their corresponding mrnas were determined by s1 mapping and shown to correspond to a purine residue in all cases. upstream from these potential transcription start points, sequences homologous to the e. coli sigma 70 and the bacillus subtilis vegetative sigma 43  (or sigma a) consensus promoters were identified.

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.

TI  == [cloning the gene of beta-galactosidase from the industrial strain of streptococcus lactis 111 in e. coli cells and conjugated transfer of this gene to streptococcus thermophilus cells].
AB  == the ability of the industrial strains of streptococcus lactis to synthesize the enzyme beta-galactosidase was studied. five strains among sixteen were found to produce high levels of the enzyme. the beta-galactosidase gene in the most active strain streptococcus lactis 111 was shown to be located on the 50 kb conjugative  plasmid. the plasmid was transferred by conjugation into streptococcus thermophilus cells and subsequently the gene for beta-galactosidase was studied in transconjugants. the beta-galactosidase gene from streptococcus lactis 111 was subcloned in escherichia coli cells on the plasmid pbr322. the gene was localized on the 4.8 kb bgiii fragment of dna. following the restriction of dna by the sau3a the gene was subcloned on the birepliconed plasmid vector pcb20 capable of  replication in the gram-negative as well as gram-positive microorganisms. the recombinant derivatives of pcb20 were isolated that carry the beta-galactosidase  gene on the dna fragments of different size.

AB  == cells of streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis entrapped in k-carrageenan-locust bean gum gel performed similarly  to free cells in the conversion of lactose to lactic acid. bead diameter influenced the fermentation rate. cells entrapped in smaller beads (0.5 to 1.0 mm) showed higher release rates, higher lactose, glucose, and formic acid utilization, higher galactose accumulation, and higher lactic acid production than did cells entrapped in larger beads (1.0 to 2.0 mm). values for smaller beads were comparable with those for free cells. immobilization affected the fermentation rate of lactic acid bacteria, especially lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. entrapped cells of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus demonstrated a lower lactic acid production than did free cells in batch fermentation. the kinetics of the production of formic and pyruvic acids by l. lactis subsp. lactis and s. salivarius subsp. thermophilus are presented.

AB  == due to the current variability in applying polyethylene glycol-mediated protoplast transformation to lactic streptococci, a study was undertaken to assess the feasibility of conjugative mobilization as an alternative method for vector delivery. by using the broad-host-range conjugative plasmid pva797, the partially homologous cloning vector pva838 was successfully introduced into various strains of streptococcus lactis, streptococcus cremoris, streptococcus lactis subsp. diacetylactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and streptococcus faecalis. frequencies ranged from 10(-2) to 10(-6) transconjugants per recipient. both pva797 and pva838 were acquired intact, without alteration in functionality. also, the shuttle vector psa3, which shares partial homology with pva797, was mobilized via conjugation. the use of s. lactis lm2301 as the intermediate donor  allowed the use of physiologic and metabolic characteristics for recipient differentiation. the construction of a vector containing a "dna cassette" conferring mobilization and the resolution, segregation, and stability of the cointegrates, pva797, pva838, and psa3, are also reported.
