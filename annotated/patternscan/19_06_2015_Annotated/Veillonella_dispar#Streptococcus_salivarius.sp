TI  == the influence of oral veillonella species on biofilms formed by streptococcus species.
AB  == oral veillonella, veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, veillonella rogosae, and veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. to investigate the role  of oral veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or streptococcus sanguinis, with  oral veillonella were examined at the species level. the amount of biofilm formed by s. mutans, s. gordonii, and s. salivarius in the presence of the six veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of s. mutans with v. dispar. in contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by s. sanguinis, the presence of veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of v. parvula and v. dispar. the time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. only that of s. gordonii with v. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. these results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. it is possible that there may be  several factors involved in the interaction between streptococcus and veillonella species.

TI  == diversity of human small intestinal streptococcus and veillonella populations.
AB  == molecular and cultivation approaches were employed to study the phylogenetic richness and temporal dynamics of streptococcus and veillonella populations in the small intestine. microbial profiling of human small intestinal samples collected from four ileostomy subjects at four time points displayed abundant populations of streptococcus spp. most affiliated with s. salivarius, s. thermophilus, and s. parasanguinis, as well as veillonella spp. affiliated with v. atypica, v. parvula, v. dispar, and v. rogosae. relative abundances varied per subject and time of sampling. streptococcus and veillonella isolates were cultured using selective media from ileostoma effluent samples collected at two time points from a single subject. the richness of the streptococcus and veillonella isolates was assessed at species and strain level by 16s rrna gene sequencing and genetic fingerprinting, respectively. a total of 160 streptococcus and 37 veillonella isolates were obtained. genetic fingerprinting differentiated  seven streptococcus lineages from ileostoma effluent, illustrating the strain richness within this ecosystem. the veillonella isolates were represented by a single phylotype. our study demonstrated that the small intestinal streptococcus  populations displayed considerable changes over time at the genetic lineage level because only representative strains of a single streptococcus lineage could be cultivated from ileostoma effluent at both time points.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == coaggregation properties of human oral veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  == the primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. all 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were veillonella atypica or veillonella dispar. all but one of them coaggregated with strains of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. these tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the  subgingival flora such as actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus sanguis. in contrast, 24 of 29 veillonella isolates, of which 20 were veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of actinomyces, s. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with s. salivarius. the majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. these results indicate that the three human oral veillonella species  are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.
