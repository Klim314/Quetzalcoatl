TI  == the oral mucosal and salivary microbial community of behcet's syndrome and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == background: behcet's syndrome (bs) is a multisystem immune-related disease of unknown etiology. recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) is characterized by the presence of idiopathic oral ulceration without extraoral manifestation. the interplay between the oral microbial communities and the immune response could play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of both bs and ras. objective: to investigate the salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities in  bs and ras. methods: purified microbial dna isolated from saliva samples (54 bs,  25 healthy controls [hc], and 8 ras) were examined by the human oral microbe identification microarray. cultivable salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities from ulcer and non-ulcer sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis. mycobacterium spp. were detected in saliva and in ulcer and non-ulcer oral mucosal brush biopsies following culture on lowenstein-jensen slopes and mycobacterial growth indicator  tubes. results: there was increased colonization with rothia denticariosa of the  non-ulcer sites of bs and ras patients (p<0.05). ulcer sites in bs were highly colonized with streptococcus salivarius compared to those of ras (p<0.05), and with streptococcus sanguinis compared to hc (p<0.0001). oral mucosa of hc were more highly colonized with neisseria and veillonella compared to all studied groups (p<0.0001). conclusions: despite the uncertainty whether the reported differences in the oral mucosal microbial community of bs and ras are of causative or reactive nature, it is envisaged that restoring the balance of the oral microbial community of the ulcer sites may be used in the future as a new treatment modality for oral ulceration.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == acetaldehyde production by major oral microbes.
AB  == objectives: to assess acetaldehyde (ach) production by bacteria constituting the  oral microbiota and the inhibitory effects of sugar alcohols on ach production. materials and methods: the predominant bacterial components of the salivary microbiota of 166 orally healthy subjects were determined by barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. bacterial ach production from ethanol or glucose was measured using gas chromatography. in addition, inhibition by four sugars and five sugar alcohols of ach production was assayed. results: forty-one species from 16 genera were selected as predominant and prevalent bacteria based on the following criteria: identification in >/=95% of the subjects, >/=1% of mean relative abundance or >/=5% of maximum relative abundance. all neisseria species tested produced conspicuous amounts of ach from  ethanol, as did rothia mucilaginosa, streptococcus mitis and prevotella histicola exhibited the ability to produce ach. in addition, xylitol and sorbitol inhibited ach production by neisseria mucosa by more than 90%. conclusions: the oral microbiota of orally healthy subjects comprises considerable amounts of bacteria  possessing the ability to produce ach, an oral carcinogen. consumption of sugar alcohols may regulate ach production by oral microbes.

TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == meningococcal septic shock after iud insertion, a case presentation.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a normal commensal of human mucous membranes that is no longer considered to be restricted to the nasopharynx. due to the practice of oral sex, the mucous membranes of the cervix, urethra or anus have become a potential infection site for this bacterium. inserting an intrauterine device (iud), can alter the protective barrier of the endocervical mucosa, allowing for  bacterial infection and systemic spread. we present a case report of a 40-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, spotting and fever after inserting an iud and developed a fulminant septic shock. blood cultures and cultures from ascites showed the presence of neisseria meningitidis group y. from our knowledge, there are a few cases presented in the literature of toxic shock syndrome after iud insertion, caused by staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus group a, but this is the first case of meningococcal sepsis after iud insertion described. so, even though iuds rarely cause significant infection, physicians should consider this device as a possible source in reproductive-age women with the clinical features of sepsis.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == the composition of microbiome in larynx and the throat biodiversity between laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients and control population.
AB  == the throat is an ecological assemblage involved human cells and microbiota, and the colonizing bacteria are important factors in balancing this environment. however, this bacterial community profile has thus been poorly investigated. the  purpose of this study was to investigate the microbial biology of the larynx and  to analyze the throat biodiversity in laryngeal carcinoma patients compared to a  control population in a case-control study. barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene was used. we collected tissue samples from 29 patients with laryngeal carcinoma and 31 control patients with vocal cord polyps. the findings  of high-quality sequence datasets revealed 218 genera from 13 phyla in the laryngeal mucosa. the predominant communities of phyla in the larynx were firmicutes (54%), fusobacteria (17%), bacteroidetes (15%), proteobacteria (11%),  and actinobacteria (3%). the leading genera were streptococcus (36%), fusobacterium (15%), prevotella (12%), neisseria (6%), and gemella (4%). the throat bacterial compositions were highly different between laryngeal carcinoma subjects and control population (p = 0.006). the abundance of the 26 genera was significantly different between the laryngeal cancer and control groups by metastats analysis (p<0.05). fifteen genera may be associated with laryngeal carcinoma by partial least squares discriminant analysis (p<0.001). in summary, this study revealed the microbiota profiles in laryngeal mucosa from tissue specimens. the compositions of bacteria community in throat were different between laryngeal cancer patients and controls, and probably were related with this carcinoma. the disruption of this bio-ecological niche might be a risk factor for laryngeal carcinoma.

TI  == the cultivable human oral gluten-degrading microbiome and its potential implications in coeliac disease and gluten sensitivity.
AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  == objective: microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. the material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. the aim of this in  vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (mpt) or cast titanium (cpt) and zirconia abutments (zc). methods: six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. the study was  conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. results: pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria mucosa, porphyromonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobios, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus parasanguinis, and tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (p > 0.05). all the other target species presented significant differences sought by friedman test (p < 0.0001). conclusions: there was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. cpt presented the higher mean counts, followed by mpt and zc. cpt group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than mpt and zc. the anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.

TI  == bacteria and candida yeasts in inflammations of the oral mucosa in children with  secondary immunodeficiency.
AB  == background: oral microbial flora and a damaged oral mucosa may increase the risk  of bacteriemia, fungemia and complications in immunocompromised patients. aim of  the study: assessment of presence: bacteria and candida spp. in different oral lesions, and the incidence of bacteremia in the case of a damaged mucosa in transplant recipients and patients receiving anti-tumour chemotherapy. material and method: forty-five patients - 18 months to 18 years of life, were included (20 - organ recipients, 14- anti-tumour chemotherapy, 11 - control group). clinical, oral mucosa examination focused on the type, severity and site of lesions, and microbiology assessed the presence of bacteria and fungi in the material from lesions. blood cultures were performed in ten immunocompromised patients with manifestations of systemic infection. the control material consisted of blood cultures made prior to the onset of oral lesions and after 4-6 weeks following their remission in a diagnosed bacteremia. the statistical analysis was performed. results: in the subjects with secondary immunodeficiency, among other coagulase-negative staphylococcus (cons), candidia spp. were more frequent. in cancer patients, mucositis was associated with candida spp., streptococcus spp. organ recipients with stomatitis exhibited the presence of cons, streptococcus viridians and other. oral lesions in the control group contained haemophilus parainfluenzae, neisseria spp. and staphylococcus aureus. in 30% of immunocompromised patients, oral lesions were accompanied by bacteremia. conclusions: a correlation has been found between oral lesions and the presence of s. aureus in patients without secondary immunodeficiency, and of  cons, enterococcus spp., candida spp. in immunocompromised patients.

TI  == microbiome diversity in the bronchial tracts of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == culture of bacteria from bronchial secretions in respiratory patients has low sensitivity and does not allow for complete assessment of microbial diversity across different bronchial compartments. in addition, a significant number of clinical studies are based on sputum samples, and it is not known to what extent  they describe the real diversity of the mucosa. in order to identify previously unrecognized lower airway bacteria and to investigate the complexity and distribution of microbiota in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), we performed pcr amplification and pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene in patients not showing signs or symptoms of infection. four types of respiratory samples (sputum, bronchial aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, and bronchial mucosa) were taken from each individual, obtaining on average >1,000 16s rrna sequences per sample. the total number of genera per patient was >100, showing a  high diversity, with streptococcus, prevotella, moraxella, haemophilus, acinetobacter, fusobacterium, and neisseria being the most commonly identified. sputum samples showed significantly lower diversity than the other three sample types. lower-bronchial-tree samples, i.e., bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial mucosa, showed a very similar bacterial compositions in contrast to sputum and bronchial aspirate samples. thus, sputum and bronchial aspirate samples are upper bronchial tree samples that are not representative of the lower bronchial mucosa  flora, and bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed the results closest to those for the bronchial mucosa. our data confirm that the bronchial tree is not sterile in  copd patients and support the existence a different microbiota in the upper and lower compartments.

TI  == possible variation of the human oral bacterial community after wearing removable  partial dentures by dgge.
AB  == although it is well-known that variations of the microbial community in a specific location of human body may be associated with some diseases, the developing change of the oral microbiota related to oral diseases before and after wearing the removable partial dentures (rpd) is not completely understood.  in this study, three kinds of samples (saliva, supra- and subgingival plaque, and oral mucosal surfaces) were collected from the 10-patients group at three different times: before, 1-month and 6-months after the treatment. ten healthy adults were also selected as the control group. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was applied to identify the bacterial profiles and to analyze the dynamics of the oral microbial population in the pre- and post-therapy. the anova of repeated measurement data indicated that, in the saliva and mucosal surfaces,  wearing rpds caused significant change of numbers of amplicons. as many as 607 amplicons were chosen to cut out and re-amplify by pcr. after cloning and sequencing, a total of 16 bacterial genera were identified. the health-associated genera such as streptococcus, neisseria, rothia, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, gemella, veillonella, selenomona and actinomyces tended to decrease, whereas the  disease-associated species including streptococcus mutans tended to increase. in  general, wearing rpds influenced the diversity of the bacterial species in the oral microbial ecosystem. it is noteworthy that the oral environment will be changed from the healthy status towards the disease status after the treatment.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == early microbial succession in redeveloping dental biofilms in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

TI  == evaluation of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota of alcoholic and non-alcoholic individuals. methods: the study was conducted with 49 alcoholic and 49 non-alcoholic males of the philippe  pinel institute, rio de janeiro, brazil. the subjects were selected by convenience and two criteria were used to diagnose alcohol dependence: the cage (cut-down, annoyed, guilt, eyes-opener) questionnaire and the international statistical classification of diseases, 10th edition (who). subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 4 sites, 2 with probing depth (pd) >/= 4 mm and 2 sites with pd < 4 mm. the presence and levels of 45 bacterial taxa were analysed  using the checkerboard technique. results: the prevalence of bacterial species was not significantly different between groups. however, alcoholics showed significantly higher mean counts of aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis (adjusted p < 0.001). moreover, alcoholics harboured significantly higher mean levels of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, f. nuc. nucleatum, gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, p. gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii, and tannerella forsythia at sites with pd < 4 mm or >/= 4 mm compared to non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). of interest, shallow sites of alcoholics presented  significantly higher mean levels of f. nuc. vincentii, f. nuc nucleatum, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythia than sites with pd >/= 4 mm of non-alcoholics (p </= 0.001). conclusions: alcoholics and non-alcoholics present a diverse and complex  microbiota; however, alcoholics harbour significantly higher levels of periodontopathic species in the subgingival microbiota than non-alcoholics.

TI  == detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a taqman-based real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using taqman pcr and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. material and methods: fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by taqman pcr. results: the quantity of the cariogenic bacteria actinomyces spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacilllus spp., rothia dentocariosa, parvimonas micra, propionibacterium acnes and neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. no significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria  except p. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. conclusion: all the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.

TI  == amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial dna for real-time quantitative  pcr analysis.
AB  == background: high-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including pcr, dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial dna. in clinical settings, the amount of sampled dna is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular dna sequence types. methods: a linear amplification  protocol using dna polymerase i was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial dna. the protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate pcr of 16s rdna sequences. real-time quantitative pcr of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified dna against unamplified dna. results: the amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug dna from as little as 12.5 ng of template dna. correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative pcr results from amplified and unamplified dna were between 0.78 and 0.98. conclusion: the optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial dna from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.

TI  == the bacterial microbiota in the oral mucosa of rural amerindians.
AB  == the oral microbiota plays an important role in buccal health and in diseases such as periodontitis and meningitis. the study of the human oral bacteria has so far  focused on subjects from western societies, while little is known about subjects  from isolated communities. this work determined the composition of the oral mucosa microbiota from six amazon amerindians, and tested a sample preservation alternative to freezing. paired oral swabs were taken from six adults of guahibo  ethnicity living in the community of platanillal, amazonas state, venezuela. replicate swabs were preserved in liquid nitrogen and in aware messenger fluid (calypte). buccal dna was extracted, and the v2 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified and pyrosequenced. a total of 17 214 oral bacterial sequences were obtained from the six subjects; these were binned into 1034 otus from 10 phyla, 30 families and 51 genera. the oral mucosa was highly dominated by four phyla: firmicutes (mostly the genera streptococcus and veillonella), proteobacteria (mostly neisseria), bacterioidetes (prevotella) and actinobacteria (micrococcineae). although the microbiota were similar at the phylum level, the amerindians shared only 62 % of the families and 23 % of the genera with non-amerindians from previous studies, and had a lower richness of genera (51 vs  177 reported in non-amerindians). the amerindians carried unidentified members of the phyla bacteroidetes, firmicutes and proteobacteria and their microbiota included soil bacteria gp1 (acidobacteriaceae) and xylanibacter (prevotellaceae), and the rare genus phocoenobacter (pasteurellaceae). preserving buccal swabs in the aware messenger oral fluid collection device substantially altered the bacterial composition in comparison to freezing, and therefore this method cannot be used to preserve samples for the study of microbial communities.

AB  == this clinical study evaluated the effect of different oral hygiene protocols on the bacterial composition of dental plaque. after a 2-week period of using fluoride-free toothpaste, 30 participants followed three 1-week experimental protocols, each followed by 2-week fluoride-free washout periods in a randomized  crossover examiner-blind controlled trial. the 1-week experimental protocols comprised the use of amf/snf(2) toothpaste twice daily, after which participants  either (1) rinsed with tap water, (2) did not rinse but only spat out the toothpaste, or (3) rinsed with an amf/snf(2) mouthwash. in the fluoride-free washout periods, the participants brushed their teeth with fluoride-free toothpaste without further instructions. six hours after the last brushing (+/- rinsing) of each period, buccal plaque samples in the upper molar region were taken. the microbiota composition of the plaque samples was analyzed by checkerboard dna:dna hybridization. a statistically significant reduction was found in the total amount of dna of the 39 major plaque species measured, and in  the proportions of some acid-producing bacterial strains after the period having  used the amf/snf(2) toothpaste + amf/snf(2) mouthrinsing. the results indicate that using the amf/snf(2) toothpaste and rinse combination could result in plaque of lower cariogenicity.

TI  == defining the healthy "core microbiome" of oral microbial communities.
AB  == background: most studies examining the commensal human oral microbiome are focused on disease or are limited in methodology. in order to diagnose and treat  diseases at an early and reversible stage an in-depth definition of health is indispensible. the aim of this study therefore was to define the healthy oral microbiome using recent advances in sequencing technology (454 pyrosequencing). results: we sampled and sequenced microbiomes from several intraoral niches (dental surfaces, cheek, hard palate, tongue and saliva) in three healthy individuals. within an individual oral cavity, we found over 3600 unique sequences, over 500 different otus or "species-level" phylotypes (sequences that  clustered at 3% genetic difference) and 88 - 104 higher taxa (genus or more inclusive taxon). the predominant taxa belonged to firmicutes (genus streptococcus, family veillonellaceae, genus granulicatella), proteobacteria (genus neisseria, haemophilus), actinobacteria (genus corynebacterium, rothia, actinomyces), bacteroidetes (genus prevotella, capnocytophaga, porphyromonas) and fusobacteria (genus fusobacterium).each individual sample harboured on average 266 "species-level" phylotypes (sd 67; range 123 - 326) with cheek samples being  the least diverse and the dental samples from approximal surfaces showing the highest diversity. principal component analysis discriminated the profiles of the samples originating from shedding surfaces (mucosa of tongue, cheek and palate) from the samples that were obtained from solid surfaces (teeth).there was a large overlap in the higher taxa, "species-level" phylotypes and unique sequences among the three microbiomes: 84% of the higher taxa, 75% of the otus and 65% of the unique sequences were present in at least two of the three microbiomes. the three individuals shared 1660 of 6315 unique sequences. these 1660 sequences (the "core microbiome") contributed 66% of the reads. the overlapping otus contributed to 94% of the reads, while nearly all reads (99.8%) belonged to the shared higher taxa. conclusions: we obtained the first insight into the diversity and uniqueness of individual oral microbiomes at a resolution of next-generation sequencing. we showed that a major proportion of bacterial sequences of unrelated healthy individuals is identical, supporting the concept of a core microbiome at  health.

TI  == booster vaccinations: can immunologic memory outpace disease pathogenesis?
AB  == almost all current vaccines work by the induction of antibodies in serum or on the mucosa to block adherence of pathogens to epithelial cells or interfere with  microbial invasion of the bloodstream. however, antibody levels usually decline after vaccination to undetectable amounts if further vaccination does not occur.  persistence of vaccine-induced antibodies usually goes well beyond the time when  they should have decayed to undetectable levels because of ongoing "natural" boosting or other immunologic mechanisms. the production of memory b and t cells  is of clear importance, but the likelihood that a memory response will be fast enough in the absence of a protective circulating antibody level likely depends on the pace of pathogenesis of a specific organism. this concept is discussed with regard to haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis; hepatitis a and b; diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella; rotavirus; and human papilloma virus. with infectious diseases for which the pace of pathogenesis is less rapid, some individuals will contract infection before the memory response is fully activated and implemented. with infectious diseases for which the pace of pathogenesis is slow, immune memory should be sufficient to prevent disease.

TI  == proximal small intestinal microbiota and identification of rod-shaped bacteria associated with childhood celiac disease.
AB  == objectives: alterations in the composition of the microbiota in the intestine may promote development of celiac disease (cd). using scanning electron microscopy (sem) we previously demonstrated that rod-shaped bacteria were present on the epithelium of proximal small intestine in children with cd but not in controls. in this study we characterize the microbiota of proximal small intestine in children with cd and controls and identify cd-associated rod-shaped bacteria. methods: proximal small intestine biopsies from 45 children with cd and 18 clinical controls were studied. bacteria were identified by 16s rdna sequencing in dna extracted from biopsies washed with buffer containing dithiothreitol to enrich bacteria adhering to the epithelial lining, by culture-based methods and by sem and transmission electron microscopy. results: the normal, mucosa-associated microbiota of proximal small intestine was limited. it was dominated by the genera streptococcus and neisseria, and also contained veillonella, gemella, actinomyces, rothia, and haemophilus. the proximal small intestine microbiota in biopsies from cd patients collected during 2004-2007 differed only marginally from that of controls, and only one biopsy (4%) had rod-shaped bacteria by sem (sem+). in nine frozen sem+ cd biopsies from the previous study, microbiotas were significantly enriched in clostridium, prevotella, and actinomyces compared with sem- biopsies. bacteria of all three genera were isolated from children born during the swedish cd epidemic. new clostridium and prevotella species and actinomyces graevenitzii were tentatively  identified. conclusions: rod-shaped bacteria, probably of the indicated species,  constituted a significant fraction of the proximal small intestine microbiota in  children born during the swedish cd epidemic and may have been an important risk  factor for cd contributing to the fourfold increase in disease incidence in children below 2 years of age during that time.

TI  == distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in five different intra-oral habitats in young children.
AB  == background: knowledge of the colonization patterns and composition of the oral microbiota can lead to a better understanding of disease initiation. aim: the aim of this study was to examine the distribution of selected cariogenic bacteria in  samples from five different oral habitats in young greek children. design: ninety-three children 3-12 years old (mean + sd 7.9 +/- 2.5) (60.2% male, 39.8% female) participated and split into three different age groups: primary (3-6 years), early mixed (6-9 years), and mixed dentition (9-12 years). samples for bacterial enumeration were taken from saliva, supragingival and subgingival plaque, tongue dorsum, and soft tissues from each child, and were further analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: mean counts and proportions of all the test bacteria differed significantly among sample locations. cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all healthy children. mean  proportions of streptococcus mutans isolated from soft tissue and streptococcus sanguinis from soft tissue, subgingival and saliva samples increased significantly with age, whereas the opposite was seen for lactobacillus acidophilus. conclusions: cariogenic bacteria were present in almost all young children. soft tissues, saliva, and tongue were more often colonized by cariogenic streptococcal species than teeth. these surfaces may serve as reservoirs for oral pathogens, requiring attention during preventive interventions.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == a pneumococcal merr-like regulator and s-nitrosoglutathione reductase are required for systemic virulence.
AB  == a transcriptional regulator, nmlr(sp), has been identified in streptococcus pneumoniae that is required for defense against nitric oxide (no) stress. the nmlr(sp) gene is cotranscribed with adhc, which encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase  that is able to reduce s-nitrosoglutathione (gsno) with nadh as reductant. nmlr(sp) and adhc mutants exhibited a reduced level of nadh-gsno oxidoreductase activity and were more susceptible to killing by no than were wild-type cells. comparison of the virulence of wild-type and mutant strains by use of a mouse model system showed that nmlr(sp) and adhc do not play a key role in the adherence of pneumococci to the nasopharynx in vivo. an intraperitoneal challenge experiment revealed that both nmlr(sp) and adhc were required for survival in blood. these data identify novel components of a no defense system in pneumococci that are required for systemic infection.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

TI  == nasopharyngeal aerobic bacterial flora and staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in deaf children.
AB  == objective: to determine the nasopharyngeal aerobic bacterial flora and staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in deaf children and the role of flora in deafness. study design: a prospective, controlled study. methods: nasopharyngeal  and nasal swabs were collected from 87 deaf children with acquired etiology at zonguldak primary school for the deaf and 56 healthy children. the children with  genetic base (syndromic or nonsyndromic, familial or sporadic, ad, ar or x-linked recessive), and also with the history of drug exposure, head trauma, birth trauma, prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia and the viral diseases with high fever (like mumps and measles) were excluded from the study. swabs were inoculated on to a variety of bacteriological culture media, which were then incubated in an appropriate atmosphere. colonisation of group a beta hemolytic streptococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria menengitidis, moraxella catarrhalis and s. aureus in upper respiratory tract were investigated. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates were determined according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) guidelines. results: although, the rates of colonization of the nasopharyngeal aerobic bacteria and nasal s. aureus did not differ significantly between deaf children and normal healthy subjects, less colonization rates were found in deaf children than normal healthy subjects. s. aureus was isolated from 18 (20.7%) deaf children. all s. aureus isolates from deaf children were susceptible to oxacillin. penicillin susceptibility rate was 22.2%. conclusion: it is considered that nasopharyngeal and nasal colonizations of deaf children with potentially pathogenic aerobic bacterial flora is not a significant risk factor for acquired infections when compared with healthy children.

TI  == high correlation between the bacterial species in denture plaque and pharyngeal microflora.
AB  == objectives: the morbidity and mortality of the dependent elderly that result from aspiration pneumonia are recognized as a major geriatric health problem. most cases of bacterial pneumonia are initiated following colonization or superinfection of the pharynx by pathogenic bacteria, followed by aspiration of pharyngeal contents. a recent study revealed that bacteria, that commonly cause respiratory infection, colonized the dentures of dependent elderly. this suggests that denture plaque may function as a reservoir of potential respiratory pathogens to facilitate colonization on the pharynx. the purpose of this study was to determine the possible correlation between denture and pharyngeal microflora. study design: the denture and pharyngeal bacterial flora of 50 dependent elderly were examined, and the microorganisms identified by culturing.  the agreement between the bacterial species in denture plaque and pharyngeal microflora was investigated using the kappa method. results: the microorganism species on the dentures and pharyngeal mucosa of the subjects had an agreement rate of 68.5%. the agreement rate for each of the bacterial species of the dentures and pharynx was also demonstrated to be high. conclusions: dentures should be considered an important reservoir of organisations which could colonise the pharynx, and the importance of controlling denture plaque for the prevention  of aspiration pneumonia cannot be overemphasized.

TI  == distribution of selected bacterial species on intraoral surfaces.
AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == [the microflora of ulzerous zone mucosa in patients with duodenal ulcer].
AB  == bacteriological study of the biopsies taken from gastric and duodenal mucosa of 10 healthy volunteers and 74 patients with duodenal ulcer, was carried out. in the gastroduodenal zone of healthy subjects microorganisms of 6 genera (streptococcus, candida, staphylococcus, bacillus, helicobacter and lactobacillus) were detected. h. pylori was isolated in 20% of cases only in biopsy specimens taken from the antral section of the stomach of healthy as monoculture or in combination with c. albicans. in patients with duodenal ulcer activation of opportunistic microflora was observed in the periulcerous zone. more often h. pylori occurred in associations with fungi of the genus candida, streptococci, staphylococci, enterobacteria, pseudomonas and other microorganisms (of more than 30 genera). quantitatively the dominating microorganisms (3.8-5.7 lg cfu/g) were h. pylori, fungi of the genus candida, bacteria of the genera streptococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, gemella, prevotella, veillonella, peptococcus, bacillus, different species of opportunistic enterobacteria, as well as bacteria of the genera staphylococcus, micrococcus, corynebacterium, neisseria, pseudomonas, etc. opportunistic bacteria detected in the ulcerous zone, as a rule, expressed hemolytic, lecithinase, rnaase, caseinolytic, catalase and urease activity. sonicated filtrates of such cultures produced a cytotoxic effect on cells hep-2. ulcer is an infected wound that needs sanitation.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == identification of the conjugative mef gene in clinical acinetobacter junii and neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates.
AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.

TI  == phosphorylcholine decoration of lipopolysaccharide differentiates commensal neisseriae from pathogenic strains: identification of lica-type genes in commensal neisseriae.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (chop) is a potential candidate for a plurispecific vaccine, because it is present on surface components of many mucosal organisms, including  haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, chop has been detected on pili of neisseria meningitidis and neisseria  gonorrhoeae. in this study, we demonstrate the presence of the phosphorylcholine  epitope on the lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of several species of commensal neisseriae (cn), a property that differentiates commensal from the pathogenic strains of neisseriae. in an extended survey of 78 strains, we confirmed the exclusive expression of the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. despite the presence of pili on cn, which are homologous to class ii pili of n. meningitidis, they did not react with anti-chop antibody. this observation was further supported by the fact that 14c-labelled choline was incorporated only in  the lpss of cn. analysis of the lps of n. lactamica strain nl4 revealed two distinct and interconvertible molecular species of lps with high and low levels of reactivity with anti-chop antibody. in addition, on/off phase variation gave rise to frequent modulation in the levels of antibody reactivity. a concurrent modulation was also observed in the binding of c-reactive protein, crp, a chop-binding reactant that is implicated in bacterial clearance. genetic analysis showed the presence of a gene in several cn spp. with significant sequence identity to h. influenzae lica. this gene encodes choline kinase and is also involved in phase variation of the lps-associated chop in h. influenzae. in contrast, lica-like genes were not identified in the pathogenic neisseria strains tested. they are absent from n. meningitidis strain z2491 genome database. these  data suggest that the genetic basis for chop incorporation in cn lps resembles that in h. influenzae spp. and may be distinct from that generating the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. further, the modulation of chop expression on cn lps, and corresponding modulation of crp binding, has the potential to confer the property of immune avoidance and thus of persistence on mucosa.

TI  == the effect of cigarette smoke on adherence of respiratory pathogens to buccal epithelial cells.
AB  == smoking is associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in adults. in children, exposure to cigarette smoke is a risk factor for respiratory tract infection and bacterial meningitis: active smoking and passive exposure to  cigarette smoke is also associated with carriage of some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria in both adults and children. the aims of the study were to determine the effect of active smoking on: (1) bacterial binding to epithelial cells; (2) expression of host cell antigens that act as receptors for some species; and (3) the effects of passive exposure to water-soluble components of cigarette smoke on bacterial binding. flow cytometry was used to assess binding to buccal epithelial cells of the following species labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate: neisseria meningitidis, neisseria lactamica, streptococcus pneumoniae, bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis,  staphylococcus aureus. flow cytometry was also used to assess expression of host  cell antigens which have been identified as bacterial receptors. for each species, binding to cells of smokers was significantly higher than to cells of non-smokers; however, expression of host cell antigens was similar on epithelial  cells of both groups. non-dilute cigarette smoke extract reduced binding of bacteria to epithelial cells, but dilutions between 1 in 10 and 1 in 320 enhanced binding. we conclude that smokers might be more densely colonised by a variety of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the enhanced bacterial binding to epithelial cells of smokers is not related to enhanced expression of host cell antigens that can act as receptors for some species, but possibly to components in the smoke that alter charge or other properties of the epithelial cell surface. passive coating of mucosal surfaces with components of cigarette smoke might enhance binding of potentially pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == the role of humoral mucosal immunity in the induction and maintenance of chronic  airway infections.
AB  == the respiratory mucosa is protected primarily by a secretory immune system that is under complex and only partly understood immunoregulatory control. secretory immunoglobulins (siga and sigm) protect the mucosal surface by immune exclusion of antigens. however, the fact that most iga produced in the respiratory tract belongs to the iga1 subclass renders siga in this region susceptible to iga-specific proteases produced by haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumonia, and neisseria meningitidis. immunoglobulin g can also perform immune exclusion at respiratory surfaces but, like ige, it reaches the secretions merely by passive diffusion. the phlogistic properties of antibodies belonging to these  classes explain their potential involvement in maintaining mucosal inflammation.  in patients with selective iga deficiency, siga is lacking and is not regularly compensated for satisfactorily by sigm. in such patients unexplained immunoregulatory mechanisms, perhaps involving the local microbiota, give rise to a large number of igd-producing cells in the upper respiratory tract. immunoglobulin d cannot act as a secretory antibody and might block the protective properties of igg; this could explain why these patients are particularly prone to recurrent infections. our observations show that there are  large individual variations in the mucosal immune system with regard to humoral immunity in the upper respiratory tract.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.

AB  == background: serious complications, such as emboli and mycotic aneurysms, are still frequent in documented cases of infective endocarditis. infecting organisms other than streptococcus viridans and staphylococcus are becoming more common. case report: a 8 year-old girl was admitted because of a sudden pain in the right calf followed by complete disability. she had low-grade fever and presented with  a moderate heart murmur with no sign of congestive heart failure, a severe pain at palpation of her calf with no homans sign; she had many dental caries. laboratory data indicated leukocytosis with increased percentage of polymorphonuclear cells and increased sedimentation rate. ultrasonography of the  calf showed laceration of the muscle with blood suffusion. echocardiography showed vegetations involving the mitral valve. intravenous antibiotic therapy with penicillin g and netilmicin was instituted, but mitral insufficiency appeared 7 days later while the fever persisted. at that time, the brain ct scan  showed ischemic lesions, while angiography showed several mycotic aneurysms. neisseria mucosa was recovered from the 5 initial blood cultures 16 days after the onset, and penicillin g was replaced by ampicillin. a second vegetation involving the aortic valve was seen a few days later, and a recent arterial embolism to the right leg was suspected because fever and pain reappeared. the brain ischemic lesions gradually disappeared and a second angiography performed 3 months after the first showed that all but one large mycotic aneurysm had disappeared; this last aneurysm was excised. four years later, the child is in good health without any neurological sequelae but having mitral insufficiency. conclusion: this girl presented with classical complication of infective endocarditis due to neisseria mucosa, a saprophytic organism of the oral cavity.  this is the second report of such an infection in children.

TI  == humoral immune response patterns of human mucosae: induction and relation to bacterial respiratory tract infections.
AB  == immunoglobulin-producing cells in mucosal tissues, quantitatively the body's most important humoral immune system, synthesize mainly dimers and larger polymers of  iga (poly-iga) with incorporated j (joining) chain. poly-iga is actively transported to exocrine secretions by a transmembrane epithelial glycoprotein called secretory component. enhancing secretory immunity by oral vaccination is an interesting possibility, but mucosal antigen uptake and local immune regulation are complex and only partly understood. immunoglobulin isotype response patterns in the upper respiratory mucosa and distal gut are strikingly different. the preferential production of iga1 in nasal and bronchial mucosae is  intriguing in view of the frequent synthesis of iga1-specific proteases by haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis. a relationship of proneness to produce invasive disease and enzymatically induced deterioration of secretory immunity has been proposed. differences in mucosal immune response patterns among patients with selective iga deficiency or igg subclass deficiencies also suggest that local humoral immunity is an important variable in resistance to infections.

AB  == aerobic microflora of the throat mucosa was studied in 518 healthy persons aged 1 to 50 years. on the basis of the study results, criteria for estimating microbiocenoses of the upper respiratory tracts were defined. it was shown that the throat symbiotic flora included three groups of microorganisms playing different roles in the development of microbiocenosis. the indigenous group consisted of representatives of streptococcus and neisseria and was characterized by permanent (90-100 per cent) and intensive (3-8 lg cfu/ml) colonization, broad  species spectrum, associations of 2-3 and more species and no significant influence of sociological, age and season factors. the representatives of the facultative group i.e. bacteria belonging to staphylococcus, corynebacterium and  haemophilus were less frequent (25-50 per cent). the intensity of their isolation was lower (1-4 lg cfu/ml) and their species spectrum was narrow. the microorganisms of the transitory group were characterized by low frequency (5-20  per cent) and insignificant contamination of the throat mucosa (1-2 lg cfu/ml). the nature of the colonization was monospecific. the group was more numerous by generic composition (candida, escherichia, klebsiella, citrobacter, enterobacter, pseudomonas, branhamella, moraxella and micrococcus). however, it was generally limited by one colonization type. the facultative and transitory groups were subject to age and season variation. they were also different in urban and rural  populations.

TI  == the growth of bacteria and the production of exoglycosidic enzymes in the dental  plaque of macaque monkeys.
AB  == the rate of growth of the predominant bacterial strains of plaque from the developmental grooves of first deciduous molar teeth was determined. median doubling times were 3.32, 3.45, 2.88 and 4.54 h for streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and neisseria mucosa respectively. withdrawal of dietary food did not greatly influence the number of bacteria found in the grooves 18 h after they had been cleaned when compared to the number in fed monkeys; exceptions were significant increases in streptococcus mitior and n. mucosa. addition of 0.5 per  cent (w/v) glucose to the drinking water of fasted monkeys also did not influence the size of this bacterial population 18 h after cleaning, so bacteria growing in cleaned grooves must gain a major part of their nutritional needs from their immediate environment, most likely salivary constituents. the ability of oral bacteria to use the oligosaccharide side-chains of salivary glycoproteins was then explored. exoglycosidases for the preferred anomeric linkages of the principal monosaccharide units of salivary glycoproteins were produced both by oral bacteria in vitro and by dental plaque in vivo. thus plaque flora has the potential to degrade glycoproteins and this may explain how bacteria in the grooves grow in the absence of dietary food.

TI  == [allergization of the body by neisseria meningitidis. i. the problem of the occurrence of n. meningitidis in cases of bronchial asthma of bacterial etiology  (author's transl)].
AB  == the object of the authors work was the examination of nasopharyngeal swabs on the prevalence of neisseria meningitidis. a group of 222 patients suffering from asthma bronchiale of bacteriological etiology was under observation in order to be able to prepare an autovaccine. nasopharyngeal swabs were inoculated on special nutrient media. neisseria meningitidis was found in 22%, mainly from nasopharyngeal swabs, together with haemophilus sp. and streptococcus pneumoniae. in 59% of examined cases the positive findings lasted longer than 1 year. 46% of  isolated strains belonged to group b, about 30% of strains were untypable. the problem of allergisation of people suffering from asthma bronchiale with these strains and the question of preparing an autovaccine from neisseria meningitidis  is discussed.

TI  == microscopic and baceriologic analysis of expectorated sputum.
AB  == samples of expectorated sputum were examined grossly and microscopically to determine their suitability for bacterial cultures. microscopically, specimens were categorized according to the number of leukocytes and squamous epithelial cells (sec) observed under low-power (times 100) in a gram-stained smear. the mean number of species isolated was greater than 4 from specimens with more than  10 sec per field, 2.7 from specimens with fewer than 10 sec per field, and 2.4 from transtracheal aspirates. oropharyngeal flora was isolated from nearly all of the specimens with more than 10 sec per field, and potential pathogens were found in less than 15% of such specimens. the bacterial flora of specimens with fewer than 10 sec per field closely resembled that of transtracheal aspirates.

TI  == nasal bacterial flora of calves in healthy and in pneumonia-prone herds.
AB  == an enclosed swab assembly was employed in a survey of 790 samples of nasal mucus  collected from calves in 12 herds. it was possible to classify the nasal bacterial flora of calves in three components, basal, supplementary and transient. the potential pathogens, p. multocia, and p.hemolytica, together with  micrococci, saprophytic neisseria and a streptococcus composed the basal flora and were judged to be widely distributed in the cattle population.a special bacteriological-statistical formula was employed to quantitatively classify the populations of several bacterial species. enzootic pneumonia of calves was not found to be associated with a characteristic nasal bacterial flora; in contrast,  cases of bacterial pneumonia in a well-managed "pool" herd of young bulls were regularly associated with the isolation of p. hemolytica from the nasal secretion. pasteurella species were capable of dominating the flora for periods of several days at a time in what was judged to be a state of active colonization of the nasal muscosa with shedding of the organisms in large numbers. this state  of active colonization did not fore-tell the likelihood of the development of pneumonia in affected calves; periodic suppression of p. hemolytica was observed  in closely studied calves.
