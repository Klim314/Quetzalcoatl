TI  == infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking: a systematic review of reported cases: management, visual outcome, and treatment proposed.
AB  == abstract aim: to describe the infectious complications and the group of pathogens involved in the infection following corneal crosslinking, the visual outcome, and the treatment proposed. methods: a medline (national library of medicine, bethesda, md, usa) search from october 2000 to october 2013 was performed to identify all articles describing infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking treatment. nineteen articles were selected. ten articles reported infectious complications of corneal crosslinking treatment were included. nine articles were excluded, because seven described sterile keratitis, one article was in german, and one reported general complication without describing the infection complication. results: a total number of infections reported included 10 eyes. the infectious keratitis was associated with bacteria in five eyes (50%): gram-positive bacteria in three eyes (30%) (staphylococcus epidermidis, s. aureus and streptococcus salivarius plus s. oralis, respectively) and gram-negative bacteria in two eyes (20%) (e. coli; p. aeruginosa); there was herpes virus in two eyes, fungus in two eyes (fusarium and microsporidia) (20%),  and acanthamoeba in one eye (10%). conclusions: only 10 cases of infectious keratitis following corneal crosslinking are published. the most virulent pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa and acanthamoeba. less virulent organisms were escherichia coli and s. epidermidis. two cases of herpes keratitis were described, suggesting the possibility of systemic antiviral prophylaxis before corneal crosslinking treatment. the most common risk factor of infections identified was postoperative incorrect patient behavior.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic (allium sativum) extract on dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: allium sativum, commonly known as garlic, exhibits antibacterial effects against a wide range of bacteria. aim: the objective of this in vitro study was to assess the antibacterial effect of different concentrations of garlic extract against human dental plaque microbiota. materials and methods: antibacterial activities of four different concentrations of garlic extract (5%,  10%, 20%, and 100%) were evaluated against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and lactobacillus spp. using the disk diffusion method. papers soaked in 0.2% concentration chlorhexidine gluconate and saline were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. the data were subjected to one-way anova and the tukey multiple comparisons test at a 5% significance level. results: all bacterial strains were  inhibited by all test materials. the inhibition zones of the different concentrations of garlic extract were not significantly different for s. mutans,  s. sanguis, and s. salivarius. for p. aeruginosa and lactobacillus spp. the inhibition zones of 5%, 10% and 20% concentrations were not significantly different from one another, but they were significantly more than that of the 100% extract. conclusion: the 5%, 10%, 20%, and 100% concentrations of garlic extract had similar effects, so further studies seem to be indicated on the usefulness of the 5% extract.

TI  == prevalence of streptococci and increased polymicrobial diversity associated with  cystic fibrosis patient stability.
AB  == diverse microbial communities chronically colonize the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. pyrosequencing of amplicons for hypervariable regions in the 16s rrna gene generated taxonomic profiles of bacterial communities for sputum genomic dna samples from 22 patients during a state of clinical stability (outpatients) and 13 patients during acute exacerbation (inpatients). we employed quantitative pcr  (qpcr) to confirm the detection of pseudomonas aeruginosa and streptococcus by the pyrosequencing data and human oral microbe identification microarray (homim)  analysis to determine the species of the streptococci identified by pyrosequencing. we show that outpatient sputum samples have significantly higher  bacterial diversity than inpatients, but maintenance treatment with tobramycin did not impact overall diversity. contrary to the current dogma in the field that pseudomonas aeruginosa is the dominant organism in the majority of cystic fibrosis patients, pseudomonas constituted the predominant genera in only half the patient samples analyzed and reported here. the increased fractional representation of streptococcus in the outpatient cohort relative to the inpatient cohort was the strongest predictor of clinically stable lung disease. the most prevalent streptococci included species typically associated with the oral cavity (streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus parasanguis) and the streptococcus milleri group species. these species of streptococcus may play an important role in increasing the diversity of the cystic fibrosis lung environment and promoting patient stability.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == the commensal streptococcus salivarius k12 downregulates the innate immune responses of human epithelial cells and promotes host-microbe homeostasis.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is an early colonizer of human oral and nasopharyngeal epithelia, and strain k12 has reported probiotic effects. an emerging paradigm indicates that commensal bacteria downregulate immune responses through the action on nf-kappab signaling pathways, but additional mechanisms underlying probiotic actions are not well understood. our objective here was to identify host genes specifically targeted by k12 by comparing their responses with responses elicited by pathogens and to determine if s. salivarius modulates epithelial cell immune responses. rna was extracted from human bronchial epithelial cells (16hbe14o- cells) cocultured with k12 or bacterial pathogens. cdna was hybridized to a human 21k oligonucleotide-based array. data were analyzed using arraypipe, innatedb, panther, and opossum. interleukin 8 (il-8) and growth-regulated oncogene alpha (groalpha) secretion were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. it was demonstrated that s. salivarius k12 specifically altered the expression of 565 host genes, particularly those involved in multiple innate defense pathways, general epithelial cell function and homeostasis, cytoskeletal remodeling, cell development and migration, and signaling pathways. it inhibited baseline il-8 secretion and il-8 responses to ll-37, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and flagellin in epithelial cells and attenuated groalpha secretion in response to flagellin. immunosuppression was coincident with the inhibition of activation of the nf-kappab pathway. thus, the commensal and probiotic behaviors of s. salivarius k12 are proposed to be due to the organism (i) eliciting no proinflammatory response, (ii) stimulating an anti-inflammatory response, and (iii) modulating genes associated with adhesion to the epithelial layer and homeostasis. s. salivarius k12 might thereby ensure that it is tolerated by the host and maintained on the epithelial surface while actively protecting the host from inflammation and apoptosis induced by pathogens.

TI  == interference in adhesion of bacteria and yeasts isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber by rhamnolipid biosurfactants.
AB  == aims: the effects and extent of adhesion of four different bacterial and two yeast strains isolated from explanted voice prostheses to silicone rubber with and without an adsorbed rhamnolipid biosurfactant layer obtained from pseudomonasaeruginosa ds10-129 was studied. methods and results: the ability of rhamnolipid biosurfactant to inhibit adhesion of micro-organisms to silicone rubber was investigated in a parallel-plate flow chamber. the anti-adhesive activity of the biosurfactant at different concentrations was significant against all the strains and depended on the micro-organism tested. the results showed an  effective reduction in the initial deposition rates, and the number of bacterial  cells adhering after 4 h, for all micro-organisms tested at the 4 g l(-1) undiluted rhamnolipid solution. maximum initial reduction of adhesion rate (an average of 66%) occurred for streptococcus salivarius gb 24/9 and candida tropicalis gb 9/9. the number of cells adhering after 4 h on silicone rubber conditioned with biosurfactant was reduced to 48% for staphylococcus epidermidis  gb 9/6, strep. salivarius gb 24/9, staphylococcus aureus gb 2/1 and c. tropicalis gb 9/9 in comparison to controls. perfusing the flow chamber with biosurfactant containing solution followed by the passage of a liquid-air interface, to investigate detachment of micro-organisms adhering to silicone rubber, produced high detachment (96%) of adhered cells for all micro-organisms studied, except for staph. aureus gb 2/1 (67%). significance and impact of the study: it is concluded that biosurfactant represent suitable compounds that should be considered in developing future strategies to prevent the microbial colonization  of silicone rubber voice prostheses.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == inhibition of adhesion of yeasts and bacteria by poly(ethylene oxide)-brushes on  glass in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  == poly(ethylene oxide) (peo)-brushes are generally recognized as protein-repellent  surfaces, and although a role in discouraging microbial adhesion has been established for some strains and species, no study exists on the effects of peo-brushes on a large variety of bacterial and yeast strains. in this paper, a peo-brush has been covalently attached to glass and silica by reaction in a polymer melt. subsequently, the presence of a peo-brush was demonstrated using contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ellipsometry. for five bacterial (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two yeast strains (candida albicans and candida tropicalis), adhesion to peo-brushes  was compared with adhesion to bare glass in a parallel plate flow chamber. the initial deposition rates of sta. epidermidis, sta. aureus and str. salivarius to  glass were relatively high, between 2400 and 2600 cm(-2) s(-1), while e. coli and p. aeruginosa deposited much more slowly. the initial deposition rates of the yeasts to glass were 144 and 444 cm(-2) s(-1) for c. albicans gb 1/2 and c. tropicalis gb 9/9, respectively. coating of the glass surface with a peo-brush yielded more than 98 % reduction in bacterial adhesion, although for the more hydrophobic p. aeruginosa a smaller reduction was observed. for both yeast species adhesion suppression was less effective than for the bacteria and here too the more hydrophobic c. tropicalis showed less reduction than the more hydrophilic c. albicans. the peo-brush had a thickness of 22 nm in water, as inferred from ellipsometry. assuming that on bare glass the adhered micro-organisms are positioned only a few nanometers away from the surface and that the brush keeps them at a distance of 22 nm, it is calculated that the brush yields a sevenfold attenuation of the lifshitz-van der waals attraction to the surface between the micro-organisms and the surface. decreased lifshitz-van der waals attraction may be responsible for the suppression of the microbial adhesion observed.

TI  == palmitoleic acid isomer (c16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

TI  == [effect of bioceramics on biological activity of microorganisms].
AB  == background and objective: biomaterials that come into contact with microorganisms in the middle ear or paranasal sinuses should be tested before clinical application. thus, it is necessary to test the influence exerted on bacterial growth by biomaterials used as bone substitutes in head and neck surgery before implantation. patients and methods: in this study, bioverit, al2o3 ceramic, and glass carbon were subjected to contamination with typical microorganisms in the middle ear and paranasal sinuses such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and salivarius, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis and candida albicans. results: in the suspension test, all gram-negative species were inhibited, but gram-positive microorganisms and candida albicans were not affected. the al2o3 ceramic showed the largest inhibition effect while growth inhibition of glass carbon was low. streptococcus  pneumoniae and salivarius can use glass carbon as a nutrient. in contrast, bioverit and al2o3 ceramic could not improve the growth of all tested microorganisms. conclusions: in conclusion, we think that bioverit is suitable for implantation in bacterially contaminated regions of the head and neck, whereas glass carbon is unsuitable for this application in reconstructive surgery.

TI  == ib-367, a protegrin peptide with in vitro and in vivo activities against the microflora associated with oral mucositis.
AB  == although the microflora associated with oral mucositis initiated by cytotoxic therapy is not well characterized, several studies suggest that reduction of the  microbial load in the oral cavity has some clinical benefit. the mics of ib-367,  a synthetic protegrin analog, ranged from 0.13 to 64 microgram/ml for gram-positive bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and staphylococcus aureus) and from 0.06 to 8 microgram/ml for gram-negative species (klebsiella, escherichia, and pseudomonas). ib-367 exhibited rapid, microbicidal activity against both log- and stationary-phase cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and pseudomonas aeruginosa. at concentrations near the mics for these two organisms (4 and 2 microgram/ml, respectively), ib-367 reduced viability by more than 3 logs in less than 16 min. similarly, ib-367 effected a 4-log reduction of the endogenous microflora in pooled human saliva within 2 min at 250 microgram/ml, a concentration readily attained by local delivery. after nine serial transfers at  0.5x the mic, the mic of ib-367 for mrsa and p. aeruginosa increased only two to  four times. in a phase i clinical study with healthy volunteers, ib-367 was well  tolerated, with no detectable systemic absorption. one hour after treatment with  9 mg of ib-367, the prevalence of gram-negative bacteria and yeast was reduced, and the density of the predominant gram-positive oral flora was decreased 1,000 times. ib-367's properties (speed of killing, breadth of spectrum, and lack of resistance) make the compound a strong candidate for the prophylaxis of oral mucositis. phase ii clinical trials with ib-367 are under way for this indication in immunocompromised subjects.

TI  == [the effect of biomaterials and other industrial materials on the growth of several aerobic bacterial species in vitro].
AB  == the article deals with interactions between bio-vitro-materials and bacteria species in vitro. the growth of s. aureus, sc. salivarius, e. coli and ps. aeruginosa in a salt solution with and without addition of biomaterials was examined until the day 60 in a static culture. by counting the cfu/ml and determination the relative change of germ capacity the results were compared. the data of such series obtained with working materials of similar chemical composition were collected and evaluated. we found, that ps. aeruginosa was promoted in growth by all materials, especially those, which contained carbon. the same can be said about the last materials and e. coli. in contrast as well ca- and p-containing as--free biomaterials reduced the numbers of germs. changes  of multiplying of s. aureus and sc. salivarius seldom were observed. it ist apparent, that the biomaterials tested are not indifferent against a few germs, which may cause infections, but they promote the growth of a few species in vitro. this may favour an infection, if such materials should be implanted. it is proposed to test biomaterials microbiologically before clinical application. materials with indifferent behavior or low anti-microbiological effect have to be favoured.

AB  == as the results of the quantitative study of streptococcus salivarius adhering to  buccal epithelial cells, three levels of their natural colonization were established: low (less than 20 bacteria per epithelial cell), medium (20-50 bacteria), and high (more than 50 bacteria). the characteristics of natural colonization by s. salivarius inversely correlated with the resistance of epithelial cells to the adhesion of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in the process of interaction with p. aeruginosa highly adhesive strain, s. salivarius, naturally colonizing the cells of the buccal epithelium, decreased in number 2-10 times up  to complete desorption. these results may be regarded as the manifestation of one of the mechanisms regulating the microecological balance in the system of mucous  membranes.

AB  == the aerobic bacteria colonizing breast milk of the low-income group in nigeria were quantified to assess its suitability for use in milk banks. in parallel, the nutritional and health status of donating mothers and their infants were assessed by physicians. the aerobic bacteria contained in the specimens included streptococcus salivarius, bacillus cereus, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermides. in general, the microbial load found in these milk samples is lower than levels considered dangerous. an analysis of the results showed that 50% of the mother's milk is contaminated, 17% of which was infected with primary pathogens. there was no correlation between demographic data, nutritional or health status of either mother or infant and microbial load  in mother's milk. milk obtained from this socio-economic group, is therefore, considered safe for use in milk banks.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == fine structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  == the structure and distribution of extracellular polymer surrounding bacillus circulans, diplococcus (streptococcus) pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, herella vaginacola (acinetobacter calcoaceticus), and agrobacterium tumefaciens were studied by electron microscopy. a modified ruthenium red staining procedure was used to examine the fine structure of capsule and slime. freeze-etching and critical-point drying were used to examine the quantity of unaltered exocellular  material. comparative data demonstrate that fibrillar extracellular polymer surrounding b. circulans, d. pneumoniae, and k. pneumoniae is capsule (cell wall  attached) which is characteristic of the producing organism. capsular polymer generally appeared fibrillar, although globular polymer consisted of capsular subunits bound to s. salivarius and h. vaginacola. exocellular slime was present  about s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and a. tumefaciens.

TI  == factors influencing the occurrence of high numbers of iodine-resistant bacteria in iodinated swimming pools.
AB  == it has been shown that, although iodinated swimming-pool waters are usually free  from coliform bacteria and enterococci, the total counts frequently become relatively high. pseudomonas alcaligenes and alcaligenes faecalis have been shown to account for most of these high counts. it was of interest, therefore, to compare the microbial flora of four alternately chlorinated and iodinated swimming pools. by means of the membrane filter method and suitable selective media, examinations were made for total viable counts, coliform bacteria, enterococci, staphylococci, streptococcus salivarius, and p. aeruginosa. colonies also were picked from membrane filters incubated on standard plate count agar and identified. the results showed that, although viable counts were significantly higher during the iodinated periods, the specific types of bacteria determined were either fewer than or the same as in chlorinated periods. during chlorination, the predominant microbial flora consisted of staphylococci and members of the genus bacillus. during iodination, however, the p. alcaligenes-a.  faecalis group accounted for 92 to 99% of the microbial flora. the accumulation of high numbers of these bacteria was shown to be due to their iodine resistance  and their ability to grow rapidly in pool water in the absence of free iodine.
