TI  == [usefulness and limit of gram staining smear examination].
AB  == gram staining is one of the most simple and inexpensive methods for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infections. it yields results much faster than  culture, and provides important data for the patient's treatment and prognosis. however, a difference exists in the quality and quantity of information yielded by gram staining smears based on the experience and knowledge of those conducting the tests. therefore, a risk of misdiagnosis based on the information obtained from gram staining smears is also present. the gram staining conditions and morphology of bacteria sometimes change due to antimicrobial therapy. species of  gram-negative rods sometimes become filamentous and pleomorphic. gram-positive bacteria may become gram variable (change in staining condition) after antimicrobial therapy. even bacteria that are easy to mis-identify exist, because the morphology of bacteria may be similar. enterococcus faecalis is a gram-positive diplococcus, forming gram-positive clustered cocci in specimens from blood culture bottles, resembling streptococcus pneumoniae. acinetobacter baumannii is a gram-negative diplococcus in sputum, resembling moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis. pasteurella multocida is a small-sized, gram-negative  short rod in the sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. prevotella intermedia is a small-sized, gram-negative short rod in sputum, resembling haemophilus influenzae. capnocytophaga sp. is a gram-negative fusiform (thin needle shape) rod present in clinical specimens, resembling fusobacterium nucleatum.

TI  == comparative analysis of endodontic pathogens using checkerboard hybridization in  relation to culture.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of this study was to detect bacterial species and to  quantify the total number of bacteria from samples of infected root canals before (s1) and after chemo-mechanical preparation using 2% chlorhexidine (chx) gel as auxiliary chemical substance (s2) and after 7 days of intracanal dressing (s3) to compare microbial changes. method: twenty-four teeth were selected for this study. chemo-mechanical preparation was performed using 2% chx gel, then three different intracanal medicaments [m1: ca(oh)(2) paste; m2: 2% chx gel; and m3: ca(oh)(2) paste plus 2% chx gel] were used for 7 days. checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was performed to detect 40 bacterial species. aerobic and anaerobic culture techniques were used to determine the bacterial community by counting the colony-forming units (cfu). results: the species most frequently identified by checkerboard in s1 were: fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, treponema socranskii ssp. socranskii, parvimonas micra and enterococcus faecalis. in s2 and s3 a total of eight different species were identified; and only one of them was gram-positive (e. faecalis). microorganisms were not identified after use of m2 for 7 days. the quantification obtained on agar plates ranged from 4 x 10(5) to 2.6 x 10(6) cfu/ml in s1, mean cfu was reduced by 99.96% in s2, and there was no  statistical difference between the cfu in s2 and s3. conclusion: the antibacterial effect of the mechanical preparation supplemented by the use of an  antibacterial auxiliary substance greatly reduced the microorganisms in the main  root canal.

TI  == microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  == aim: to examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. methodology: samples were collected by means of a size 15 h-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. results: the species found at the highest levels and prevalence were fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, porphyromonas gingivalis,  veillonella parvula, enterococcus faecalis, campylobacter gracilis and neisseria  mucosa. total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: p > 0.05). e. faecalis, streptococcus anginosus, capnocytophaga sputigena and capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (mann-whitney test, p < 0.05). higher levels of p. gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. leptotrichia buccalis (or = 1.83; ci 95%) and porphyromonas endodontalis (or = 2.15; ci 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. conclusions: primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species.  specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
