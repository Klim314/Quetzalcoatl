TI  == inhibition of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase resistance enzymes by metal salts.
AB  == aminoglycosides (ags) are clinically relevant antibiotics used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as mycobacteria. as with all current antibacterial agents, resistance to ags is an increasing problem. the most common mechanism of resistance to ags is the presence of ag-modifying enzymes (ames) in bacterial cells, with ag acetyltransferases (aacs) being the most prevalent. recently, it was discovered that zn(2+) metal ions displayed an inhibitory effect on the resistance enzyme aac(6')-ib in acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli. in this study, we explore a wide array of metal salts (mg(2+), cr(3+), cr(6+), mn(2+), co(2+), ni(2+), cu(2+), zn(2+), cd(2+), and au(3+) with different counter ions) and their inhibitory effect on a large repertoire of aacs [aac(2')-ic, aac(3)-ia, aac(3)-ib, aac(3)-iv, aac(6')-ib', aac(6')-ie, aac(6')-iid, and eis]. in addition, we determine the mic values for amikacin and tobramycin in combination  with a zinc pyrithione complex in clinical isolates of various bacterial strains  (two strains of a. baumannii, three of enterobacter cloacae, and four of klebsiella pneumoniae) and one representative of each species purchased from the  american type culture collection.

TI  == antimicrobial consumption and resistance in five gram-negative bacterial species  in a hospital from 2003 to 2011.
AB  == background: the misuse of antimicrobial agents increases drug resistance in bacteria. methods: the correlation between antimicrobial agent consumption and related resistance in the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis was analyzed during the period 2003-2011. results: among these five bacteria, overall e. coli and k. pneumoniae were more commonly isolated from bloodstream than the other species. regarding enterobacteriaceae, e. coli and k.  pneumoniae showed annual increases of resistance to the tested antimicrobial agents; conversely, p. mirabilis exhibited reduced resistance to cefuroxime, ceftriaxone and cefepime. in contrast to the relatively low antimicrobial resistance in p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii revealed high resistance, which was over 85% resistant rate to the tested antimicrobial agents and over 80% carbapenem resistance in 2011. e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis differed  in development of antimicrobial resistance after consumption of the antimicrobial agents. k. pneumoniae developed resistance to all antimicrobial groups, whereas resistance in p. mirabilis was not related to any antimicrobial consumption. p. aeruginosa developed resistance to beta-lactam antimicrobials and aminoglycosides, whereas a. baumanii developed resistance to carbapenems after their use. conclusion: the development of antimicrobial resistance was related to antimicrobial agents and bacterial species.

TI  == in vitro activity of the siderophore monosulfactam bal30072 against contemporary  gram-negative pathogens from new york city, including multidrug-resistant isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of bal30072 was assessed against clinical isolates from nyc hospitals, including isolates from a citywide surveillance study and a collection of isolates with well-characterised resistance mechanisms. bal30072 was the most  active beta-lactam against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic50/90, 0.25/1 mug/ml), acinetobacter baumannii (mic50/90, 4/>64 mug/ml) and kpc-possessing klebsiella pneumoniae (mic50/90, 4/>64 mug/ml). combining bal30072 with meropenem resulted in a >/= 4-fold decrease in the bal30072 mic90 both for a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae. for isolates with a bal30072 mic>4 mug/ml, addition of a sub-mic concentration of colistin resulted in a four-fold decrease in the bal30072 mic in 44% of p. aeruginosa, 82% of a. baumannii and 23% of k. pneumoniae. using sub-mic concentrations, bal30072 plus colistin was bactericidal against 4 of 11 isolates  in time-kill studies. bal30072 mics were frequently lower for p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae when tested using mueller-hinton agar versus iso-sensitest agar or  mueller-hinton broth. against the well-characterised isolates, reduced susceptibility to bal30072 correlated with mexa and mexx expression (p. aeruginosa), adeb expression (a. baumannii) and presence of shv-type esbls (a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae). bal30072 shows promising activity against contemporary gram-negatives, including mdr p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae. enhanced activity was often present when bal30072 was combined with meropenem or colistin. bal30072 mics were influenced by the testing method, particularly for p. aeruginosa and k. pneumoniae. further in vivo studies are warranted to determine the potential clinical utility of bal30072 alone and combined with other agents.

TI  == colistin susceptibility testing by etest and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == the accuracy of disk susceptibility methods for colistin against 778 bacterial pathogens was evaluated in comparison with etest using interpretive criteria available from the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). colistin exhibited excellent activity against acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.5 mg/l), whilst it was less active both against enterobacter spp. and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic for 50% of the organisms (mic(50))=0.5 mg/l, mic(90)=16 mg/l). colistin also showed good activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(90)=2 mg/l, mic(50)=1 mg/l) but poor activity against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic(50)=8 mg/l, mic(90)=128 mg/l). only 0.8% of minor errors were observed between the studied methods for p. aeruginosa isolates when the clsi criteria were applied. all a. baumannii isolates with a zone diameter < or =12 mm were resistant and those with a zone diameter > or =14 mm were susceptible according to mic breakpoints established by the clsi. among nine isolates exhibiting a zone diameter of 13 mm, one was resistant to colistin (mic=8 mg/l) and eight isolates  were susceptible (mic=0.5 mg/l). applying a mic breakpoint of < or =2 mg/l for susceptibility in enterobacteriaceae, all isolates with a zone diameter > or =14  mm were susceptible, whilst all isolates with a zone diameter < or =11 mm were resistant. among isolates with zone diameters of 12-13 mm, 59% were characterised as susceptible. major errors were observed only in k. pneumoniae isolates at a rate of 0.8%. the poor agar diffusion characteristics of colistin limit the predictive accuracy of the disk diffusion test and consequently values of 12-13 mm should be confirmed with mic determination by etest or broth dilution method.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of multidrug-resistant gram negative bacteria to fosfomycin.
AB  == we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against a randomly selected sample of 30 klebsiella pneumoniae, 30 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 30 acinetobacter baumannii multidrug-resistant, clinical isolates from patients in a general tertiary care hospital in athens, greece. standard laboratory methods were used for susceptibility testing to commonly used antibiotics and the detection of extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) and metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) production. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of fosfomycin for each isolate was determined by the agar dilution method. all k. pneumoniae isolates were both esbl and mbl producers; all p. aeruginosa isolates were esbl producers. the k. pneumoniae strains had fosfomycin mics distributed across a range of 8-64 microg/ml; mic(50) was 16 microg/ml and mic(90) 32 microg/ml. the fosfomycin mics of the p. aeruginosa strains had a distribution across a range of 4 to over 512 microg/ml; mic(50) was 32 microg/ml and mic(90) 128 microg/ml. the  fosfomycin mics of the a. baumannii strains had a distribution across a range of  64 to over 512 microg/ml; mic(50) was 256 microg/ml and mic(90) more than 512 microg/ml. although standardized fosfomycin mic interpretative breakpoints for the species studied are lacking, the findings of our study support the idea that  fosfomycin may be further investigated as one among a decreasing list of therapeutic options for the treatment of infections due to multidrug-resistant strains of, primarily, k. pneumoniae and, secondly, p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  == background: blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. methods: the species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the severance hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. results: of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by staphylococcus  aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, enterococcus spp., and klebsiella pneumoniae. the proportion of patients with enterococcus faecium and k. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. enterococcus, s. aureus and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. e. coli, enterococcus spp., k. pneumoniae and s. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. oxacillin-resistant s. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant e. faecium and imipenemresistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and  acinetobacter baumannii increased. conclusions: e. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and s. aureus, alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and k. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. the bacteremia due to enterococcus, k. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant e. faecium, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii gradually increased during this period.

TI  == [selective action of broad-spectrum antibiotics on intestinal flora in sepsis in  rats].
AB  == objective: to investigate the selective effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics on the intestinal flora in sepsis in rats. methods: fifty-six sd rats were randomly  divided into normal control group, scald group [before ceftriaxone sodium (rocephin) treatment group], scald group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, scald group with 9 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group (before rocephin treatment group), sepsis group with 3 days of rocephin treatment, and sepsis group with 9 days of rocephin treatment. all the animals were incurred with 30% iii degree burns on their back followed by endotoxin challenge with a dose of 20  mg/kg 24 hours after the burn injury. the animals were treated with intraperitoneal injection of ceftriaxone 24 hours (60 mg/kg, quaque 12 hours) after the second hit with endotoxin. at the end of the treatment, the bacteria in stomach, intestine and colon were cultured. the number and kind of the bacteria were also determined. results: antibiotics significantly increased the number of  cocci (p<0.05 or p<0.01). the ratio between cocci and bacilli was markedly inverted. in selective culture of gut bacilli, e.coli was almost the only bacteria in the contents of stomach, intestine and colon in normal control group, but after burns and endotoxin challenge, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis appeared. after the rats received antibiotics treatment, e. coli decreased in number or disappeared, and was replaced mainly by pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus  and other bacilli. conclusion: broad-spectrum antibiotics can induce imbalance of bacteria flora in the gut, resulting in a reversion of the ratio between cocci and bacilli, and also reduction in intestinal colonization resistance. then, opportunistic pathogens become dominant flora in gut, which may cause antibiotic-related gut-origin diseases.

TI  == impact of ceftazidime restriction on gram-negative bacterial resistance in an intensive care unit.
AB  == the present study included three periods: (1) a 12-month pre-restriction and control period in 2001; (2) a 12-month restriction period with reduced ceftazidime prescribing in favor of piperacillin-tazobactam (2002); (3) and a 24  month post-restriction period (2003-2004). note that, for results, p represents the difference between 2002 and 2001; p', the difference between 2003 and 2001; and p'', the difference between 2004 and 2001. no changes in hygiene practices were observed during these three periods. the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of reducing ceftazidime use in an intensive care unit (icu) upon gram-negative bacterial resistance, particularly as regards pseudomonas aeruginosa. during the three periods of the study, patients were similar concerning age, simplified acute physiology score (sapsii), the site of nosocomial infection, and the requirements for mechanical ventilation (75% in 2001, 76% in 2002, 74% in 2003, and 85% in 2004). the most commonly isolated pathogens were p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacteriaceae. the use of ceftazidime decreased significantly from 12.6% in 2001 to 9% in 2002,  to 3% in 2003 (p' = 0.0009), and 2.6% in 2004 (p'' = 0.0001) in favor of piperacillin-tazobactam (0% 2001 to 3.7% in 2003; p' = 0.002; and 5% in 2004; p'' = 0.0001). simultaneously, we observed a significant decrease in isolates of p. aeruginosa resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam (p = 0.03; p' = 0.004; p'' = 0.009), and those resistant to imipenem in 2003 (p' = 0.008). we also noted a significant decrease in a. baumannii isolates resistant to ceftazidime (p' = 0.01; p'' = 0.0004) and those resistant to imipenem in both 2002 and 2004 (p = 0.03; p'' = 0.04), and a considerable decrease in isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae producing expanded spectrum betalactamase (esbl) in 2003 and 2004 (p'  = 0.04; p'' = 6.10(-5)). in contrast, we noted an increase in penicillinase-producing isolates of k. pneumoniae, from 6% in 2001 to 16% in 2002 (p = 0.01), 20% in 2003 (p' = 0.001), and 32% in 2004 (p'' = 10(-6)). we concluded that restriction of ceftazidime use was demonstrated to be efficient in reducing antimicrobial resistance, especially to k. pneumoniae esbl.
