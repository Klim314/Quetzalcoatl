TI  == application of bacteriophages in post-harvest control of human pathogenic and food spoiling bacteria.
AB  == bacteriophages have attracted great attention for application in food biopreservation. lytic bacteriophages specific for human pathogenic bacteria can  be isolated from natural sources such as animal feces or industrial wastes where  the target bacteria inhabit. lytic bacteriophages have been tested in different food systems for inactivation of main food-borne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica, shigella spp., campylobacter jejuni and cronobacter sakazkii, and also  for control of spoilage bacteria. application of lytic bacteriophages could selectively control host populations of concern without interfering with the remaining food microbiota. bacteriophages could also be applied for inactivation  of bacteria attached to food contact surfaces or grown as biofilms. bacteriophages may receive a generally recognized as safe status based on their lack of toxicity and other detrimental effects to human health. phage preparations specific for l. monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7 and s. enterica serotypes have been commercialized and approved for application in foods or as part of surface decontamination protocols. phage endolysins have a broader host specificity compared to lytic bacteriophages. cloned endolysins could be used as  natural preservatives, singly or in combination with other antimicrobials such as bacteriocins.

TI  == photodynamic inactivation mediated by erythrosine and its derivatives on foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of photodynamic inactivation (pdi) mediated by erythrosine (ery) and its ester derivatives erythrosine methyl ester (erymet) and erythrosine butyl ester (erybut) on foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria. we evaluated staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, aeromonas hydrophila atcc 7966, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium atcc 14028, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853. the toxicity of all of the compounds was assessed in vero cells. pdi  mediated by ery and its derivatives combined with a light-emitting diode was performed at different concentrations and exposure times. s. aureus was more photosensitive than gram-negative bacteria to ery, erymet, and erybut. the ery-mediated pdi of s. aureus induced a significant reduction of 4.0 log cfu/ml at a light dose of 40 j/cm2. erymet and erybut at lower light doses than ery completely eradicated s. aureus. when photoirradiated with ery at light doses of  156 and 234 j/cm2, a. hydrophila was completely eradicated. erybut was more efficient in the pdi of a. hydrophila than erymet, even at 1 x 10-5 m and lower light doses. salmonella typhimurium, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa required higher concentrations of photosensitizers to reduce cell survival. erybut and ery may be promising photosensitizing agents against a. hydrophila and s. aureus. they were  effective at reducing bacterial counts at nontoxic concentrations. the photoinactivation rate of the evaluated bacteria decreased in the following order: s. aureus > a. hydrophila > e. coli > s. typhimurium > p. aeruginosa.

TI  == conjunctival flora of clinically normal and diseased turtles and tortoises.
AB  == background: in captive breed turtles and tortoises conjunctival disease is common. our aim was to investigate the bacterial and fungal flora present in the  eyes of healthy and pathological chelonians and to compare findings in turtles with those in tortoises. results: samples were taken from the conjunctival sacs of 34, diseased and healthy, chelonians (18 tortoises and 16 turtles) and submitted to bacterial and fungal investigation. all samples showed bacterial growth. thirteen animals (38%), harboured a single bacterial species as sole isolate and twenty-one animals (62%) harboured more than one species. detection of multiple bacterial infection was clearly greater in tortoises compared to turtles. most frequently isolated bacterial species were bacillus spp. (13 isolates), staphylococcus xylosus (10 isolates), sphingomonas paucimobilis (6 isolates), staphylococcus sciuri and aeromonas hydrophila/caviae (each 5 isolates), ochrobactrum anthropi (3 isolates), citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas luteola (each 2 isolates). only one isolate of kocuria varians/rosea, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus auricularis, staphylococcus  haemolyticus, staphylococcus lentus, morganella morganii, pasteurella multocida,  pasteurella pneumotropica/haemolytica, proteus spp., pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and vibrio parahaemolyticus was evidenced. the presence in 8 animals of mycoplasma spp. and  in 1 animal with severe conjunctivitis of chlamydia spp. was detected by pcr. candida spp. was also isolated from two healthy animals. conclusions: a clear predominance of gram positive isolates in tortoises and gram negative isolates in turtles was found. however, we cannot ascribe the observed difference to the diversity of animal species, as other factors, including especially different characteristics of the living environments, may play a role. almost all bacterial species isolated may have clinical significance, mostly as opportunistic pathogens, both for humans and animals. that chelonians are often carrier of bacteria with zoonotic potential is a well-known fact, in particular with regard  to salmonella spp. therefore, it is not surprising the detection of a strain of salmonella enterica ssp. arizonae in the eye of one of the animals tested. worthy of note is the finding of chlamydia spp. in a severe case of conjunctivitis, though we cannot epidemiologically assess a cause-effect relationship between presence of chlamydia and disease.

TI  == removal of pathogenic bacterial biofilms by combinations of oxidizing compounds.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are commonly formed on medical devices and food processing surfaces. the antimicrobials used have limited efficacy against the biofilms; therefore, new strategies to prevent and remove these structures are needed. here, the effectiveness of brief oxidative treatments, based on the combination of sodium hypochlorite (naclo) and hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the presence of copper sulfate (cuso4), were evaluated against bacterial laboratory strains and clinical isolates, both in planktonic and biofilm states. simultaneous application of oxidants synergistically inactivated planktonic cells and prevented biofilm formation of laboratory escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus strains, as well as clinical isolates of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, klebsiella oxytoca, and uropathogenic e. coli. in addition, preformed biofilms of e. coli c, salmonella typhimurium, k. pneumoniae, and salmonella enterica exposed to treatments were removed by applying 12 mg/l naclo, 0.1 mmol/l cuso4, and 350 mmol/l h2o2 for 5 min. klebsiella oxytoca and staphylococcus aureus required a 5-fold increase in naclo concentration, and the e. coli clinical isolate remained unremovable unless treatments were applied on biofilms formed within 24 h instead of 48 h. the application of treatments that last a few minutes using oxidizing compounds at low concentrations represents an interesting disinfection strategy against pathogens associated with medical and industrial settings.

TI  == rapid detection of listeria monocytogenes in milk using confocal micro-raman spectroscopy and chemometric analysis.
AB  == listeria monocytogenes is a facultatively anaerobic, gram-positive, rod-shape foodborne bacterium causing invasive infection, listeriosis, in susceptible populations. rapid and high-throughput detection of this pathogen in dairy products is critical as milk and other dairy products have been implicated as food vehicles in several outbreaks. here we evaluated confocal micro-raman spectroscopy (785 nm laser) coupled with chemometric analysis to distinguish six  closely related listeria species, including l. monocytogenes, in both liquid media and milk. raman spectra of different listeria species and other bacteria (i.e., staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and escherichia coli) were collected to create two independent databases for detection in media and milk, respectively. unsupervised chemometric models including principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were applied to differentiate l. monocytogenes from listeria and other bacteria. to further evaluate the performance and reliability of unsupervised chemometric analyses, supervised chemometrics were performed, including two discriminant analyses (da) and soft independent modeling of class analogies (simca). by analyzing raman spectra via two da-based chemometric models, average identification accuracies of 97.78% and  98.33% for l. monocytogenes in media, and 95.28% and 96.11% in milk were obtained, respectively. simca analysis also resulted in satisfied average classification accuracies (over 93% in both media and milk). this raman spectroscopic-based detection of l. monocytogenes in media and milk can be finished within a few hours and requires no extensive sample preparation.

TI  == purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, kl-1y, from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1.
AB  == three bacteriocins from lactobacillus plantarum kl-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase hplc. the bacteriocin peptides kl-1x, -1y and -1z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 da, respectively. all three peptides were  stable at ph 2-12 and 25 degrees c and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees c for 30 min and 121 degrees c for 15 min. however, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. kl-1y showed  broad inhibitory activities against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis dmst 17368, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 15442, p. aeruginosa atcc 9027, escherichia coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739. kl-1x and -1z inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. kl-1x, kl-1y and kl-1z exhibited synergistic activity. the successful amino acid sequencing of kl-1y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin kl-1y". plantaricin kl-1y exhibited bactericidal activity against bacillus cereus jcm 2152(t). compared to nisin, kl-1y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 au/ml against the growth of bacillus coagulans jcm 2257(t), b. cereus jcm 2152(t), listeria innocua atcc 33090(t), staphylococcus aureus tistr 118, e. coli o157:h7 and e. coli atcc 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only b. coagulans jcm 2257(t) and b. cereus jcm 2152(t). therefore, the novel plantaricin kl-1y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  == foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni,  bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica,  staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely  affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. to help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by  different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and  physicochemical methods (heat, uv light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. possible areas for future research are suggested. plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the  potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. the collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == increased efficiency of campylobacter jejuni n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb by  structure-guided engineering.
AB  == conjugate vaccines belong to the most efficient preventive measures against life-threatening bacterial infections. functional expression of n-oligosaccharyltransferase (n-ost) pglb of campylobacter jejuni in escherichia coli enables a simplified production of glycoconjugate vaccines in prokaryotic cells. polysaccharide antigens of pathogenic bacteria can be covalently coupled to immunogenic acceptor proteins bearing engineered glycosylation sites. transfer efficiency of pglbcj is low for certain heterologous polysaccharide substrates. in this study, we increased glycosylation rates for salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium lt2 o antigen (which lacks n-acetyl sugars) and staphylococcus aureus cp5 polysaccharides by structure-guided engineering of pglb. a three-dimensional  homology model of membrane-associated pglbcj, docked to the natural c. jejuni n-glycan attached to the acceptor peptide, was used to identify potential sugar-interacting residues as targets for mutagenesis. saturation mutagenesis of  an active site residue yielded the enhancing mutation n311v, which facilitated fivefold to 11-fold increased in vivo glycosylation rates as determined by glycoprotein-specific elisa. further rounds of in vitro evolution led to a triple mutant s80r-q287p-n311v enabling a yield improvement of s. enterica lt2 glycoconjugates by a factor of 16. our results demonstrate that bacterial n-ost can be tailored to specific polysaccharide substrates by structure-guided protein engineering.

TI  == molecular detection of fastidious and common bacteria as well as plasmodium spp.  in febrile and afebrile children in franceville, gabon.
AB  == malaria was considered as the main cause of fever in africa. however, with the roll back malaria initiative, the causes of fever in africa may change. this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of bacteria and plasmodium spp. in febrile and afebrile (controls) children from franceville, gabon. about 793 blood samples from febrile children and 100 from controls were analyzed using polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) coupled with sequencing. plasmodium spp. was the microorganism most detected in febrile (74.5%, 591/793) and controls (13%, 13/100), p < 0.0001. its coinfection with bacteria was found only in febrile children (p = 0.0001). staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent bacterium in febrile children (2.8%, 22/793) and controls (3%, 3/100). eight cases of salmonella spp. (including two salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi) and two of streptococcus pneumoniae were found only among febrile children. borrelia spp. was found in 2 controls while rickettsia felis was detected in 10 children (in 8 febriles and 2 afebriles). no  dna of other targeted microorganisms was detected. plasmodium spp. remains prevalent while salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were common bacteria in gabon. two fastidious bacteria, rickettsia felis and borrelia spp., were found. inclusion of controls should improve the understanding of the causes of fever in sub-saharan africa.

TI  == [the metabolism of the innate immunity cells in bacterial infections].
AB  == metabolic activity of innate immunity cells infected by various doses of gram-negative (yersinia pseudotuberculosis, salmonella enteritidis) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes) bacteria has been investigated. using various animal models we found that during the initial period (up to 2 days) changes of infection in cellular responses depend on the type of the pathogen. in response to infection caused by gram-negative bacteria predominant neutrophil accumulation in the foci of inflammation was observed, while gram-positive bacteria induced preferential accumulation of macrophages. the study of metabolism of these cells showed that the response of terminally differentiated primed phagocytes to pathogen appearance was higher than in cells  circulating in blood. in addition to the priming state the phagocyte reactivity is influenced by the bacterial load. at a low phagocyte/microbe ratio the cells reaction is almost undetectable, while an excess of microorganisms causes (despite of the increase of the phagocytic parameters) the hyperactivation of cell metabolism and production of maximal amounts of bactericide agents, which exhibit a damaging effect on the cell itself.

TI  == potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB  == a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli o8, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus suis, listeria monocytogenes and pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. in adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of b. subtilis jt143 and l. acidophilus ly24 respectively isolated from bioplus((r))2b and florafit((r)) probiotics (p < 0.05). the adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2,  48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. the survival rate of b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. the strain was fully resistant to ph 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. the safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. these results implied that that the new strain of b. coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.

TI  == extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
AB  == sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (gtsp) and smooth hound (shsp) skins. their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopic analysis. the antibacterial activities of gtsp and shsp against listeria monocytogenes (atcc 43251), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enterica (atcc 43972) and enterobacter  sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values and by essays in liquid media. gtsp and shsp were fractionated by a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. fraction fgii, from gtsp, and fraction fsii, from shsp, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. the sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.

TI  == multidrug efflux pumps from enterobacteriaceae, vibrio cholerae and staphylococcus aureus bacterial food pathogens.
AB  == foodborne illnesses caused by bacterial microorganisms are common worldwide and constitute a serious public health concern. in particular, microorganisms belonging to the enterobacteriaceae and vibrionaceae families of gram-negative bacteria, and to the staphylococcus genus of gram-positive bacteria are important causative agents of food poisoning and infection in the gastrointestinal tract of humans. recently, variants of these bacteria have developed resistance to medically important chemotherapeutic agents. multidrug resistant escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, enterobacter spp., and staphylococcus aureus are becoming increasingly recalcitrant to clinical treatment in human patients. of the various bacterial resistance mechanisms against antimicrobial agents, multidrug efflux pumps comprise a major cause of multiple drug resistance. these multidrug efflux pump systems reside in the biological membrane of the bacteria and actively extrude antimicrobial agents from bacterial cells. this review article summarizes the evolution of these bacterial drug efflux pump  systems from a molecular biological standpoint and provides a framework for future work aimed at reducing the conditions that foster dissemination of these multidrug resistant causative agents through human populations.

TI  == chicken mannose-binding lectin function in relation to antibacterial activity towards salmonella enterica.
AB  == mannose-binding lectin (mbl) is a c-type serum lectin of importance in innate immunity. low serum concentrations of mbl have been associated with greater susceptibility to infections. in this study, binding of purified chicken mbl (cmbl) to salmonella enterica subsp. enterica (s. enterica) serotypes b, c1 and d was investigated by flow cytometry, and staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) was used for comparison. for s. enterica the c1 serotypes were the only group to exhibit binding to cmbl. furthermore, functional studies of the role of cmbl in phagocytosis and complement activation were performed. spiking with cmbl had a dose-dependent effect on the hd11 phagocytic activity of s. enterica subsp. enterica serovar montevideo, and a more pronounced effect in a carbohydrate competitive assay. this cmbl dose dependency of opsonophagocytic activity by hd11 cells was not observed for s. aureus. no difference in complement-dependent bactericidal activity in serum with high or low cmbl concentrations was found for s. montevideo. on the other hand, serum with high concentrations of cmbl exhibited a greater bactericidal activity to s. aureus than serum with low concentrations of cmbl. the results presented here emphasise that chicken cmbl exhibits functional similarities with its mammalian counterparts, i.e. playing a  role in opsonophagocytosis and complement activation.

TI  == expression, purification, and in vitro comparative characterization of avian beta-defensin-2, -6, and -12.
AB  == the mature peptides of avian beta-defensin-2 (avbd-2), avbd-6, and avbd-12 were expressed as 6xhis-tagged recombinant proteins using the escherichia coli bl21(de3)plyss system. the yields of ravbd-2, ravbd-6, and ravbd-12 were approximately 0.92 mg/l, 1.24 mg/l, and 1.52 mg/l, respectively, of bacterial culture. the antimicrobial activities of ravbds were characterized under different salt, nutrient, and ph conditions. at concentrations of 8 mug/ml, 16 mug/ml, and 32 mug/ml, ravbds inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, e. coli, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. while no synergistic inhibitory activity was found, a significant antagonistic effect was detected between ravbd-2 and ravbd-12. treatment of e. coli and salmonella typhimurium with ravbds diminished their natural resistance to bile salts. under the nonreplicating low-nutrient condition, ravbds at a concentration of 16 mug/ml were able to kill e. coli and s. aureus within 30 min of contact. the antimicrobial activities of ravbds were enhanced by lowering salt concentration and ph from 7 to 6. the antimicrobial potency against s. aureus and e. coli could be characterized as ravbd-6 > ravbd-2 > ravbd-12, which coincided with the net positive charges of these peptides. in conclusion, data from the current study warrant the investigation of the potential use of ravbd-2, -6, and -12 as therapeutic and prophylactic antimicrobial agents against common bacterial pathogens.

TI  == survival and growth of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus in eggplant dip during storage.
AB  == eggplant dip is an internationally popular appetizer, prepared in some instances  under uncertain hygienic conditions with inconsistent refrigeration. this study examined the effects of citric acid on the survival of pathogenic microorganisms  (salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus) and  naturally present organisms (lactic acid bacteria, lab, aerobic bacteria, apc and yeast and mold, ym) in eggplant dip during storage. eggplant dip with 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 or 0.8% citric acid was inoculated with s. typhimurium, e. coli o157:h7  or s. aureus and stored at 4, 10 and 21 degrees c for </=15 d. throughout the study, the survival of the inoculated microorganisms was monitored, and lab, apc, ym numbers and ph were determined. there was no significant (p>0.05) effect of citric acid on inoculated s. typhimurium and e. coli o157:h7. salmonella and e. coli o157:h7 survived >7d with little reduction in viability. reduction of s. aureus viability increased with citric acid concentration and reached>3.0 log10 cfu/g by 15 d at 4 degrees c. citric acid had no effect (p>0.05) on the background ym during storage at 4, 10 and 21 degrees c or lab stored at 4 and 10  degrees c, while at 21 degrees c, 0.6 and 0.8% citric acid significantly reduced  lab. citric acid had no effect (p>0.05) on the apc in samples stored at 4 degrees c but it had significant effects on samples stored at 10 and 21 degrees c. work reported showed that the use of citric acid at 0.4-0.8% can inhibit the growth of s. aureus in eggplant dip, but adequate refrigeration is essential to minimize risk from this and other pathogens in this product.

TI  == propidium monoazide combined with real-time pcr for selective detection of viable staphylococcus aureus in milk powder and meat products.
AB  == staphylococcus aureus is a spherical, gram-positive, pathogenic bacterium commonly associated with bovine mastitis and clinical infections. it is also recognized as a pathogen that causes outbreaks of food poisoning. the objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a rapid and reliable technique that combines propidium monoazide (pma) staining with real-time quantitative (q)pcr to detect and quantify viable cells of staph. aureus in milk powder and meat products. the inclusivity and exclusivity of the assay were evaluated using 58 strains belonging to 14 species. serial dilutions of staph. aureus cells were used to establish a standard curve and to confirm the effect of pma treatment. milk powder and meat products were used as the spiked foods, and the ability of pma-qpcr to eliminate nonviable cells was determined in milk powder. furthermore, meat products were inoculated with different concentrations of staph. aureus and  10(5) cfu/g of bacillus cereus and salmonella enterica to test the interference by nontarget microorganisms. when pma treatment was applied before dna extraction, we were able to eliminate false-positive results with little effect on viable cells. the pma-qpcr assay was specific and more sensitive than conventional pcr, and the level of detection was 3.0x10(2) cfu/g in spiked milk powder. additionally, we observed no significant interference for the detection of viable staph. aureus from other nontarget bacteria. the pma-qpcr protocol is an effective and rapid method to quantify viable cells of staph. aureus in food samples. the pma-qpcr assay is specific and reliable, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for routine analysis in food and clinical diagnostic research at  a reasonable cost.

TI  == storage stability and antibacterial activity of eugenol nanoliposomes prepared by an ethanol injection-dynamic high-pressure microfluidization method.
AB  == eugenol is a major phenolic component with diverse biological activities. however, it is difficult to formulate into an aqueous solution due to poor water  solubility, and this limits its application. in the present study, eugenol nanoliposomes (en) were prepared by combining the ethanol injection method with the dynamic high-pressure microfluidization method. good physicochemical characterizations of en were obtained. the successful encapsulation of eugenol in nanoliposomes was confirmed by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. a good storage stability of en was confirmed by its low variation of average particle diameter and encapsulation efficiency after 8 weeks of storage. no oil drops were found in en after 8 weeks of storage at 4 degrees c and at room temperature, which suggested that the poor water solubility of eugenol was overcome by nanoliposome encapsulation. compared with that of eugenol solution, a relatively  good sustained release property was observed in en. the antibacterial activity of en against four common foodborne pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes) was evaluated in both luria broth and milk medium.

TI  == management of severe non-tb bacterial infection in hiv-infected adults.
AB  == despite widespread antiretroviral therapy use, severe bacterial infections (sbi)  in hiv-infected adults continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. four main pathogens account for the majority of documented sbi: streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typhoidal strains of salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. the epidemiology of sbi is dynamic, both in developing countries where, despite dramatic successes in antiretroviral  therapy, coverage is far from complete, and in settings in both resource-poor and resource-rich countries where antiretroviral therapy failure is becoming increasingly common. throughout the world, this complexity is further compounded  by rapidly emerging antimicrobial resistance, making management of sbi very challenging in these vulnerable patients. we review the causes and treatment of sbi in hiv-infected people and discuss future developments in this field.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of hop extracts against foodborne pathogens for meat applications.
AB  == aims: the objective of this study was the fundamental investigation of the antimicrobial efficiency of various hop extracts against selected foodborne pathogens in vitro, as well as their activity against listeria monocytogenes in a model meat marinade and on marinated pork tenderloins. methods and results: in a  first step, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of three hop extracts containing either alpha- or beta-acids or xanthohumol were determined against test bacteria including l. monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and escherichia coli by a colorimetric method based on the measurement of bacterial metabolic activity. moreover, the influence of either lactic or citric acid on the antimicrobial activity of the hop extracts was evaluated. the  efficiency of hop extracts as a natural food preservative was then tested in a model meat marinade at 2 and 8 degrees c, respectively, and finally on marinated  pork. the experiments showed that gram-positive bacteria were strongly inhibited  by hop extracts containing beta-acids and xanthohumol (mic values of 6.3 and 12.5 ppm, respectively), whereas the antimicrobial activity of the investigated alpha-acid extract was significantly lower (mic values of 200 ppm). gram-negative bacteria were highly resistant against all tested hop extracts. acidification of  the test media led to a decrease of the mic values. the inhibitory activity of the hop extracts against l. monocytogenes was strongly reduced in a fat-containing model meat marinade, but the efficiency of beta-acids in this matrix could be increased by lowering ph and storage temperatures. by applying 0.5 % beta-acids at ph = 5 in a model marinade, the total aerobic count of pork tenderloins was reduced up to 0.9 log10 compared with marinated pork without hop  extract after 2 weeks of storage at 5 degrees c. conclusions: beta-acid containing hop extracts have proven to possess a high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria in vitro and in a practice-related application for food preservation. significance and impact of the study: antimicrobial hop extracts could be used as natural preservatives in food applications to extend the shelf life and to increase the safety of fresh products.

TI  == the cyclic antibacterial peptide enterocin as-48: isolation, mode of action, and  possible food applications.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by enterococcus. it contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. the conformation of enterocin as-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. enterocin as-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on gram-positive bacteria. sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. this cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. enterocin as-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. the potential applications of enterocin as-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, bacillus spp., paenibacillus spp., geobacillus stearothermophilus, brochothrix thermosphacta, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). the efficacy of enterocin as-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high  hydrostatic pressure.

TI  == effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  == antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. white mustard essential oil (wmeo) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. the objective of  this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of wmeo against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. the bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, enterobacter  aerogenes, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. all microorganisms were inhibited by wmeo at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). in general, wmeo was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. salmonella enteritidis and s. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. the effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both  bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of wmeo against l. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against salmonella enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h.  sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of wmeo against salmonella enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against l. monocytogenes.  the presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of wmeo against l. monocytogenes and salmonella enteritidis. thus, wmeo is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.

TI  == the question of pathogen quantification in disinfected graywater.
AB  == graywater (gw) reuse for irrigation is recognized as a sustainable solution for water conservation. one of the major impediments to gw reuse is the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. this study monitored three similar on-site gw treatment systems bi-monthly over the course of a year to compare the presence of pathogens and indicators in raw, biologically treated, and biologically treated and disinfected [by chlorine and ultraviolet light (uv)] gw. the systems were designed to allow the testing of the same batch (collection) of water as it passed through the treatment chain. the samples were analyzed using standard culture-dependent methods and the data were compared to culture-independent dna-based methods. results suggested that the presence and abundance of fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa differ among the various gw streams (e.g. raw, biologically treated, and disinfected). the culture-dependent  analyses suggested that both chlorine and uv inactivate most of the bacteria tested in the biologically treated gw, albeit at different efficiencies. conversely, the dna-based analyses indicated no significant differences in pathogenic bacterial abundance between the biologically treated gw with or without disinfection. to better understand the discrepancies between the results, we repeated the analysis in the laboratory under controlled conditions using enterococcus faecalis as a model bacterium and obtained similar results. we suggest that disinfection of biologically treated gw with chlorine or uv is effective for treating pathogens, but that the inactivation efficiency cannot be  estimated by dna-based qpcr.

TI  == in-vitro screening of malaysian honey from different floral sources for antibacterial activity on human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: different researches on therapeutic effects of honey have been conducted in different regions; however the study on the potential antibacterial  activity of malaysian honey is still limited. in this study, antibacterial activities of different monofloral honey samples were tested against several common human pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the well-diffusion method, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) techniques were employed to investigate the putative antibacterial activity of malaysian monofloral honey from koompassia excelsa (becc.) taub (tualang), melaleuca cajuputi powell (gelam) and durio zibethinus murr. (durian). honey samples were tested against staphylococcus aureus atcc6518  and atcc25923, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc12228, enterococcus faecium lmg16192, enterococcus faecalis lmg16216 and atcc29212, escherichia coli atcc25922, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc14028 and klebsiella pneumoniae atcc13883. results: marked variations were observed in the antibacterial activity of these honey samples. durian honey failed to produce substantial antibacterial activity, whereas tualang and gelam honey showed a spectrum of antibacterial activity with their growth inhibitory effects against all of the tested bacterial species including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre). conclusion: present findings suggested gelam honey possesses highest antibacterial effect among the tested malaysian honey samples.

TI  == bacterial virulence analysis using brine shrimp as an infection model in relation to the importance of quorum sensing and proteases.
AB  == brine shrimp are aquatic crustaceans belonging to a genus of artemia. this organism is widely used for testing the toxicity of chemicals. in this study, brine shrimp were evaluated as an infection model organism to study bacterial virulence. artemia nauplii were infected with various pathogenic bacteria, such as vibrio vulnificus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia vietnamiensis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli, and the susceptibility to these bacteria was investigated by counting the survival of the infected nauplii. while all of the tested bacteria have significant virulence to brine shrimp, killing the nauplii in a few days, v. vulnificus showed the strongest virulence. p. aeruginosa also showed a dose-dependent virulence to brine shrimp, but the virulence was weaker than that of v. vulnificus. the virulence tests using the virulence-attenuated mutants of v. vulnificus and p. aeruginosa, such as quorum sensing (qs) mutants or protease-deficient mutants showed a significant attenuation of virulence, demonstrating that the qs mechanism is important in the virulence of these bacteria to brine shrimp. b. vietnamiensis, s. aureus, and e.  coli were also virulent to brine shrimp and the virulence was correlated with dosage within 24 h under our conditions. salmonella enterica typhimurium and bacillus subtilis were also virulent to brine shrimp, but the virulence was weak  and slowly exerted compared with that of other bacteria. taken together, we suggest that brine shrimp are a good infection model to assay bacterial virulence, especially for v. vulnificus and p. aeruginosa, and qs is important in the bacterial virulence to brine shrimp.

TI  == transcriptional specialization of human dendritic cell subsets in response to microbial vaccines.
AB  == the mechanisms by which microbial vaccines interact with human apcs remain elusive. herein, we describe the transcriptional programs induced in human dcs by pathogens, innate receptor ligands and vaccines. exposure of dcs to influenza, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus allows us to build a modular framework containing 204 transcript clusters. we use this framework to characterize the responses of human monocytes, monocyte-derived dcs and blood dc  subsets to 13 vaccines. different vaccines induce distinct transcriptional programs based on pathogen type, adjuvant formulation and apc targeted. fluzone,  pneumovax and gardasil, respectively, activate monocyte-derived dcs, monocytes and cd1c+ blood dcs, highlighting apc specialization in response to vaccines. finally, the blood signatures from individuals vaccinated with fluzone or infected with influenza reveal a signature of adaptive immunity activation following vaccination and symptomatic infections, but not asymptomatic infections. these data, offered with a web interface, may guide the development of improved vaccines.

TI  == urinary antibiotic activity in paediatric patients attending an outpatient department in north-western cambodia.
AB  == objective: antibiotic resistance is a prominent public and global health concern. we investigated antibiotic use in children by determining the proportion of unselected children with antibacterial activity in their urine attending a paediatric outpatient department in siem reap, cambodia. methods: caregiver reports of medication history and presence of possible infection symptoms were collected in addition to urine samples. urine antibiotic activity was estimated by exposing bacteria to urine specimens, including assessment against multiresistant bacteria previously isolated from patients in the hospital (a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), a multiresistant salmonella typhi and an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli isolate). results: medication information and urine were collected from 775 children. caregivers reported medication use in 69.0% of children in the preceding 48 h. 31.7% samples showed antibacterial activity; 16.3% showed activity against a local multiresistant organism. no specimens demonstrated activity against an esbl-producing e. coli. conclusions: antibiotics are widely used in the community setting in cambodia. parents are often ill-informed about drugs given to treat their children. increasing the regulation and training of private pharmacies in cambodia may be necessary. regional surveillance of antibiotic use and resistance is also essential in devising preventive strategies against further development of antibiotic resistance, which would have both local and global consequences.

TI  == co-occurrence of free-living protozoa and foodborne pathogens on dishcloths: implications for food safety.
AB  == in the present study, the occurrence of free-living protozoa (flp) and foodborne  bacterial pathogens on dishcloths was investigated. dishcloths form a potentially important source of cross-contamination with flp and foodborne pathogens in food-related environments. first various protocols for recovering and quantifying flp from dishcloths were assessed. the stomacher technique is recommended to recover flagellates and amoebae from dishcloths. ciliates, however, were more efficiently recovered using centrifugation. for enumeration of free-living protozoa on dishcloths, the most probable number method is a convenient method. enrichment was used to assess flp diversity on dishcloths (n=38). flp were found  on 89% of the examined dishcloths; 100% of these tested positive for amoebae, 71% for flagellates and 47% for ciliates. diversity was dominated by amoebae: vahlkampfiids, vannellids, acanthamoeba spp., hyperamoeba sp. and vermamoeba vermiformis were most common. the ciliate genus colpoda was especially abundant on dishcloths while heterotrophic nanoflagellates mainly belonged to the genus bodo, the glissomonads and cercomonads. the total number of flp in used dishcloths ranged from 10 to 10(4) mpn/cm(2). flagellates were the most abundant  group, and ciliates the least abundant. detergent use was identified as a prime determinant of flp concentrations on used dishcloths. bacterial load on dishcloths was high, with a mean total of aerobic bacteria of 7.47 log 10 cfu/cm(2). escherichia coli was detected in 68% (26/38) of the used dishcloths, with concentrations up to 4 log 10 cfu/cm(2). foodborne pathogens including staphylococcus aureus (19/38), arcobacter butzleri (5/38) and salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. halle (1/38) were also present. this study showed for the first time that flp, including some opportunistic pathogens, are a common and diverse group on dishcloths. moreover, important foodborne pathogens are also regularly recovered. this simultaneous occurrence makes dishcloths a potential risk factor for cross-contamination and a microbial niche for bacteria-flp interactions.

TI  == multiplex isothermal solid-phase recombinase polymerase amplification for the specific and fast dna-based detection of three bacterial pathogens.
AB  == we report on the development of an on-chip rpa (recombinase polymerase amplification) with simultaneous multiplex isothermal amplification and detection on a solid surface. the isothermal rpa was applied to amplify specific target sequences from the pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae, salmonella enterica and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) using genomic dna. additionally, a positive plasmid control was established as an internal control.  the four targets were amplified simultaneously in a quadruplex reaction. the amplicon is labeled during on-chip rpa by reverse oligonucleotide primers coupled to a fluorophore. both amplification and spatially resolved signal generation take place on immobilized forward primers bount to expoxy-silanized glass surfaces in a pump-driven hybridization chamber. the combination of microarray technology and sensitive isothermal nucleic acid amplification at 38 degrees c allows for a multiparameter analysis on a rather small area. the on-chip rpa was  characterized in terms of reaction time, sensitivity and inhibitory conditions. a successful enzymatic reaction is completed in <20 min and results in detection limits of 10 colony-forming units for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica and 100 colony-forming units for neisseria gonorrhoeae. the results show this method to be useful with respect to point-of-care testing and to enable simplified and miniaturized nucleic acid-based diagnostics. figurethe combination of multiplex isothermal nucleic acid amplification with rpa and spatially-resolved signal generation on specific immobilized oligonucleotides.

TI  == monotreme lactation protein is highly expressed in monotreme milk and provides antimicrobial protection.
AB  == monotremes (platypus and echidna) are the descendants of the oldest ancestor of all extant mammals distinguished from other mammals by mode of reproduction. monotremes lay eggs following a short gestation period and after an even briefer  incubation period, altricial hatchlings are nourished over a long lactation period with milk secreted by nipple-less mammary patches located on the female's  abdomen. milk is the sole source of nutrition and immune protection for the developing young until weaning. using transcriptome and mass spectrometry analysis of milk cells and milk proteins, respectively, a novel monotreme lactation protein (mlp) was identified as a major secreted protein in milk. we show that platypus and short-beaked echidna mlp genes show significant homology and are unique to monotremes. the mlp transcript was shown to be expressed in a variety of tissues; however, highest expression was observed in milk cells and was expressed constitutively from early to late lactation. analysis of recombinant mlp showed that it is an n-linked glycosylated protein and biophysical studies predicted that mlp is an amphipathic, alpha-helical protein,  a typical feature of antimicrobial proteins. functional analysis revealed mlp antibacterial activity against both opportunistic pathogenic staphylococcus aureus and commensal enterococcus faecalis bacteria but showed no effect on escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, and salmonella enterica. our data suggest that mlp is an evolutionarily ancient component of milk-mediated innate immunity absent in other mammals. we propose that mlp evolved specifically in the monotreme lineage supporting the evolution of lactation in these species to provide bacterial protection, at a time when mammals lacked nipples.

TI  == evaluation of nacl, ph, and lactic acid on the growth of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli in a liquid cheddar cheese extract.
AB  == a cheddar cheese model system, cheddar cheese extract, was used to examine how different levels of known microbial hurdles (nacl, ph, and lactic acid) in cheddar cheese contribute to inhibition of bacterial pathogens. this knowledge is critical to evaluate the safety of cheddar varieties with altered compositions. the range of levels used covered the lowest and highest level of these factors present in low-sodium, low-fat, and traditional cheddar cheeses. four pathogens were examined in this model system at 11 degrees c for 6 wk, with the lowest levels of these inhibitory factors that would be encountered in these products. the 4 pathogens examined were salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec). none of these organisms were capable of growth under these conditions. the stec exhibited the highest survival and hence was used to examine which of these inhibitory factors (nacl, ph, and lactic acid) was primarily responsible for the  observed inhibition. the stec survival was examined in cheddar cheese extract varying in nacl (1.2 vs. 4.8%), lactic acid (2.7 vs. 4.3%), and ph (4.8 vs. 5.3)  at 11 degrees c for 6 wk. the microbial hurdle found to have the greatest effect  on stec survival was ph. the interactions between ph and levels of protonated lactic acid and anionic lactic acid with stec survival was also evaluated; only the concentration of protonated lactic acid was determined to have a significant  effect on stec survival. these results indicate that, of the pathogens examined,  stec is of the greatest concern in cheddar varieties with altered compositions and that ph is the microbial hurdle primarily responsible for controlling stec in these products.

AB  == we successfully produced two human beta-defensins (hbd-1 and hbd-2) in bacteria as functional peptides and tested their antibacterial activities against salmonella enterica serovar typhi, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus employing both spectroscopic and viable cfu count methods. purified peptides showed approximately 50% inhibition of the bacterial population when used individually and up to 90% when used in combination. the 50% lethal doses (ld50)  of hbd-1 against s. typhi, e. coli, and s. aureus were 0.36, 0.40, and 0.69 mug/mul, respectively, while those for hbd-2 against the same bacteria were 0.38, 0.36, and 0.66 mug/mul, respectively. moreover, we observed that bacterium-derived antimicrobial peptides were also effective in increasing survival time and decreasing bacterial loads in the peritoneal fluid, liver, and  spleen of a mouse intraperitoneally infected with s. typhi. the 1:1 hbd-1/hbd-2 combination showed maximum effectiveness in challenging the salmonella infection  in vitro and in vivo. we also observed less tissue damage and sepsis formation in the livers of infected mice after treatment with hbd-1 and hbd-2 peptides individually or in combination. based on these findings, we conclude that bacterium-derived recombinant beta-defensins (hbd-1 and hbd-2) are promising antimicrobial peptide (amp)-based substances for the development of new therapeutics against typhoid fever.

TI  == assessment of oligogalacturonide from citrus pectin as a potential antibacterial  agent against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == foodborne diseases are an important public health problem in the world. the bacterial resistance against presently used antibiotics is becoming a public health issue; hence, the discovery of new antimicrobial agents from natural sources attracts a lot of attention. antibacterial activities of oligogalacturonide from commercial microbial pectic enzyme (cpe) treated citrus pectin, which exhibits antioxidant and antitumor activities, against 4 foodborne  pathogens including salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed. pectin hydrolysates from  cpe hydrolysis exhibited antibacterial activities. however, no antibacterial activity of pectin was observed. citrus oligogalacturonide from 24-h hydrolysis exhibited bactericidal effect against all selected foodborne pathogens and displayed minimal inhibitory concentration at 37.5 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa, l. monocytogenes, and s. typhimurium, and at 150.0 mug/ml for s. aureus.

TI  == unsaturated fatty acid, cis-2-decenoic acid, in combination with disinfectants or antibiotics removes pre-established biofilms formed by food-related bacteria.
AB  == biofilm formation by food-related bacteria and food-related pathogenesis are significant problems in the food industry. even though much disinfection and mechanical procedure exist for removal of biofilms, they may fail to eliminate pre-established biofilms. cis-2 decenoic acid (cda), an unsaturated fatty acid messenger produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa, is reportedly capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms by multiple types of microorganisms. however, whether cda has potential to boost the actions of certain antimicrobials is unknown. here, the activity of cda as an inducer of pre-established biofilms dispersal, formed by four main food pathogens; staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, salmonella enterica and e. coli, was measured using both semi-batch and continuous cultures bioassays. to assess the ability of cda combined biocides treatments to remove pre-established biofilms formed on stainless steel discs, cfu counts were performed for both treated and untreated cultures. eradication of the biofilms by cda combined antibiotics was evaluated using crystal violet staining. the effect of cda combined treatments (antibiotics and disinfectants) on biofilm surface area and bacteria viability was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, digital image analysis and live/dead staining. mics were also determined to assess the probable inhibitory effects of cda combined treatments on the growth of tested microorganisms' planktonic cells. treatment of pre-established biofilms with only 310 nm cda resulted in at least two-fold increase in the number of planktonic cells in all cultures. while antibiotics or  disinfectants alone exerted a trivial effect on cfu counts and percentage of surface area covered by the biofilms, combinational treatments with both 310 nm cda and antibiotics or disinfectants led to approximate 80% reduction in biofilm  biomass. these data suggests that combined treatments with cda would pave the way toward developing new strategies to control biofilms with widespread applications in industry as well as medicine.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

AB  == aims: factors affecting the antibacterial action of acidified sodium chlorite (asc), a widely used disinfectant, have not been determined. this study investigated the significant factors suggesting efficient production method to maximize bactericidal action of asc. methods and results: the effects of (i) preparation procedures (total three methods); (ii) initial concentrations of reactants: sodium chlorite (sc) and citric acid (cta) (up to maximum solubility of each reactant) and (iii) final ph values (3.0 and 2.5) to the bactericidal action of asc were investigated with a fixed final concentration of sc (10 ppm) using various foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus). the antimicrobial compounds produced and the bactericidal effects depended on the preparation procedure and the initial concentrations of the reactants. the asc prepared by premixing highly concentrated reactants (in particular > 40%) followed by dilution (dilution after reaction, dar) was more effective in inactivating foodborne pathogens, and it produced higher antimicrobial compound (cl(2) and clo(2)) yields than the other procedures. a 5-min treatment with asc,  produced using the other procedures, resulted in a reduction of < 3.5 log cfu ml(-1) (gram positive = 0.18-0.78; gram negative = 0.03-3.49 log cfu ml(-1)), whereas asc produced with the dar procedure using the saturated reactants completely inactivated all of the test pathogens within 5 min without recovery (initial concentration = 6.94-7.08 log cfu ml(-1)). conclusion: the asc production with the dar procedure using the saturated reactants maximizes both the antimicrobial compound yields and bactericidal effects of the asc solutions.  significance and impact of the study: this study will contribute to increase the  efficiency of asc treatments for disinfections reducing the effective sc concentrations for industrial use.

TI  == innate host defense requires tfeb-mediated transcription of cytoprotective and antimicrobial genes.
AB  == animal host defense against infection requires the expression of defense genes at the right place and the right time. understanding such tight control of host defense requires the elucidation of the transcription factors involved. by using  an unbiased approach in the model caenorhabditis elegans, we discovered that hlh-30 (known as tfeb in mammals) is a key transcription factor for host defense. hlh-30 was activated shortly after staphylococcus aureus infection, and drove the expression of close to 80% of the host response, including antimicrobial and autophagy genes that were essential for host tolerance of infection. tfeb was also rapidly activated in murine macrophages upon s. aureus infection and was required for proper transcriptional induction of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. thus, our data suggest that tfeb is a previously unappreciated, evolutionarily ancient transcription factor in the host response to infection.

TI  == cold-active antibacterial and antifungal activities and antibiotic resistance of  bacteria isolated from an alpine hydrocarbon-contaminated industrial site.
AB  == selection pressure in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils may lead not only to increased microbial resistance to antibiotics, but also to increased capacity of  the soil indigenous population to produce antimicrobial compounds. therefore, we  studied the antibiotic resistance pattern and antibacterial and/or antifungal activities of 47 bacterial strains isolated from an industrial alpine site heavily polluted with petroleum hydrocarbons. resistance to penicillin was more widespread (49%) than resistance to chloramphenicol or rifampicin (28%) or streptomycin (26%). only 9% of the strains were resistant to tetracycline. the ability to produce cold-active (10 degrees c) antimicrobial compounds was tested  by using human pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus) and yeasts (candida albicans, cryptococcus neoformans) as indicator microorganisms. about two-thirds of the 47 tested strains produced compounds that inhibited growth of at least one indicator microorganism. six strains inhibited growth of both bacteria and yeast indicators; 12 and 16 strains showed either antibacterial or antifungal activity, respectively. the most versatile bacteria with regard to multiple antibiotic resistance and antimicrobial activity belonged to actinobacteria or gammaproteobacteria. the antimicrobial compounds produced by three pseudomonas spp. and two serratia spp. strains were characterized in more detail by tlc and hplc. depending on the sensitivity of growth inhibition to enzymes, the compounds produced by the three pseudomonads contained a proteinaceous component.

TI  == effect of methylglyoxal on multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == honey has a complex chemistry, and its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity varies with floral source, climate, and harvesting conditions. methylglyoxal was  identified as the dominant antibacterial component of manuka honey. although it has been known that methylglyoxal has antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, there is not much information describing its activity against gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we report the effect of methylglyoxal against multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa (mdrp) using 53  clinically isolated strains. we also assessed the effect of deleting the five multidrug efflux systems in p. aeruginosa, as well as the efflux systems in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, on mics of methylglyoxal. our results indicate that methylglyoxal inhibits the growth of mdrp at concentrations of 128-512 mug/ml (1.7-7.1 mm) and is not recognized by drug efflux systems.

TI  == inhibitory effects of citral, cinnamaldehyde, and tea polyphenols on mixed biofilm formation by foodborne staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis.
AB  == biofilms are significant hazards in the food industry. in this study, we investigated the effects of food additive such as citral, cinnamaldehyde, and tea polyphenols on mixed biofilm formation by foodborne staphylococcus aureus and salmonella serotype enteritidis. the adhesion rates of mixed strains in sub-mic of additives were determined by a microtiter plate assay and bacterial communication signal autoinducer 2 (ai-2) production via a bioluminescence reporter vibrio harveyi bb170. the structure of mixed biofilm was analyzed using  scanning electron microscopy. the effect of the disinfectants hydrogen peroxide,  sodium hypochlorite, and peracetic acid was tested on the mixed biofilm. our results demonstrated that citral, cinnamaldehyde, and tea polyphenols were able to significantly inhibit mixed biofilm formation, while citral could reduce the synthesis of ai-2. conversely, we observed a significant increase in ai-2 mediated by cinnamaldehyde. tea polyphenols at lower concentrations induced ai-2  synthesis; however, ai-2 synthesis was significantly inhibited at higher concentrations (300 m g/ml). food additives inhibited the adhesion of mixed bacteria on stainless steel chips and increased the sensitivity of the mixed biofilm to disinfectants. in conclusion, citral, cinnamaldehyde, and tea polyphenols had strong inhibitory effects on mixed biofilm formation and also enhanced the effect of disinfectant on mixed biofilm formation. this study provides a scientific basis for the application of natural food additives to control biofilm formation of foodborne bacteria.

TI  == green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
AB  == this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated  by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == broad-spectrum anti-biofilm peptide that targets a cellular stress response.
AB  == bacteria form multicellular communities known as biofilms that cause two thirds of all infections and demonstrate a 10 to 1000 fold increase in adaptive resistance to conventional antibiotics. currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target bacterial biofilms. here we identified a potent anti-biofilm peptide 1018 that worked by blocking (p)ppgpp, an important signal in biofilm development. at concentrations that did not affect planktonic growth,  peptide treatment completely prevented biofilm formation and led to the eradication of mature biofilms in representative strains of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium and burkholderia cenocepacia. low levels of the peptide led to biofilm dispersal, while higher doses triggered biofilm cell death. we hypothesized that the peptide acted to inhibit a common stress response in target species, and that the stringent response, mediating (p)ppgpp synthesis through the enzymes rela and spot, was targeted. consistent with this, increasing (p)ppgpp synthesis by addition of serine hydroxamate or over-expression of rela led to reduced susceptibility to the peptide. furthermore, rela and spot mutations blocking production of (p)ppgpp replicated the effects of the peptide, leading to a reduction of biofilm formation in the four tested target species. also, eliminating (p)ppgpp expression after two days of biofilm growth by removal of arabinose from a strain expressing rela behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, reciprocated the effect of peptide added at the same time, leading to loss of biofilm. nmr and chromatography studies showed that the peptide acted on cells to cause degradation of (p)ppgpp within 30 minutes, and in vitro directly interacted with  ppgpp. we thus propose that 1018 targets (p)ppgpp and marks it for degradation in cells. targeting (p)ppgpp represents a new approach against biofilm-related drug  resistance.

TI  == t cells kill bacteria captured by transinfection from dendritic cells and confer  protection in mice.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) phagocytose, process, and present bacterial antigens to t lymphocytes to trigger adaptive immunity. in vivo, bacteria can also be found inside t lymphocytes. however, t cells are refractory to direct bacterial infection, leaving the mechanisms by which bacteria invade t cells unclear. we show that t cells take up bacteria from infected dcs by the process of transinfection, which requires direct contact between the two cells and is enhanced by antigen recognition. prior to transfer, bacteria localize to the immunological synapse, an intimate dc/t cell contact structure that activates t cells. strikingly, t cells efficiently eliminate the transinfecting bacteria within the first hours after infection. transinfected t cells produced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines and were able to protect mice from bacterial  challenge following adoptive transfer. thus, t lymphocytes can capture and kill bacteria in a manner reminiscent of innate immunity.

TI  == segmented continuous-flow multiplex polymerase chain reaction microfluidics for high-throughput and rapid foodborne pathogen detection.
AB  == high-throughput and rapid identification of multiple foodborne bacterial pathogens is vital in global public health and food industry. to fulfill this need, we propose a segmented continuous-flow multiplex polymerase chain reaction  (scf-mpcr) on a spiral-channel microfluidic device. the device consists of a disposable polytetrafluoroethylene (ptfe) capillary microchannel coiled on three  isothermal blocks. within the channel, n segmented flow regimes are sequentially  generated, and m-plex pcr is individually performed in each regime when each mixture is driven to pass three temperature zones, thus providing a rapid analysis throughput of mxn. to characterize the performance of the microfluidic device, continuous-flow multiplex pcr in a single segmented flow has been evaluated by investigating the effect of key reaction parameters, including annealing temperatures, flow rates, polymerase concentration and amount of input  dna. with the optimized parameters, the genomic dnas from salmonella enterica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus could  be amplified simultaneously in 19min, and the limit of detection was low, down to 10(2) copiesmul(-1). as proof of principle, the spiral-channel scf-mpcr was applied to sequentially amplify four different bacterial pathogens from banana, milk, and sausage, displaying a throughput of 4x3 with no detectable cross-contamination.

TI  == the focal complex of epithelial cells provides a signalling platform for interleukin-8 induction in response to bacterial pathogens.
AB  == bacterial pathogens can induce an inflammatory response from epithelial tissues due to secretion of the pro-inflammatory chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8). many bacterial pathogens manipulate components of the focal complex (fc) to induce signalling events in host cells. we examined the interaction of several bacterial pathogens with host cells, including campylobacter jejuni, to determine if the fc is required for induction of chemokine signalling in response to bacterial pathogens. our data indicate that secretion of il-8 is triggered by c. jejuni, helicobacter pylori and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in response to engagement of beta1 integrins. additionally, we found that the secretion of il-8  from c. jejuni infected epithelial cells requires fak, src and paxillin, which in turn are necessary for erk 1/2 recruitment and activation. targeting the fc component paxillin with sirna prevented il-8 secretion from cells infected with several bacterial pathogens, including c. jejuni, helicobacter pylori, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and  vibrio parahaemolyticus. our findings indicate that maximal il-8 secretion from epithelial cells in response to bacterial infection is dependent on the fc. based on the commonality of the host response to bacterial pathogens, we propose that the fc is a signalling platform for an epithelial cell response to pathogenic organisms.

AB  == bioconversion of biomass, particularly crop wastes, into biofuels is being developed as an alternative approach in meeting the high energy demand. in this study, a thermophilic bacterial strain by-3 that exhibits cellulolytic potential  was isolated from faecal samples of tibetan pigs; this strain was identified as bacillus subtilis. the strain can produce cellulase when grown on various substrates, including carboxymethyl cellulose, rice straw, corn stover, soluble starch and wheat bran. the maximum cellulase activity of the strain was up to 4.323 +/- 0.065 u ml(-1) when cultivated in the medium containing corn stover (30 g l(-1) ) for 24 h. the results demonstrated that corn stover is the most suitable substrate for cellulase production by the strain by-3. the crude cellulase of strain by-3 was most active at ph 5.5 and 60 degrees c, and the enzyme in acetate buffer (50 mmol l(-1) ) demonstrated a good stability at 60 degrees c for at least 1 h. the crude cellulase exhibited a strong antibacterial  activity against staphylococcus aureus. the strain can be used in cost-efficient  cellulase production for bioconversion of agricultural residual biomass into biofuels. significance and impact of the study: the increased consumption of fossil fuels has caused serious energy crisis and environmental problem. thus, an alternative energy source is necessary. bioconversion of biomass, particularly agricultural residuals, into value-added bioproducts, such as biofuels and chemical solvents, has received considerable attention. in this study, the newly  isolated thermophilic bacillus subtilis strain by-3 produces cellulase efficiently with the use of untreated corn stover as a sole carbon source. this strain possesses the thermostable cellulase that is active with diverse crop wastes with a broad ph range and is a highly promising candidate for agricultural waste management.

AB  == water-based chitosans in the forms of oligochitosan (oligocs) and nanowhisker chitosan (cswk) are proposed as a novel food preservative based on a minced pork  model study. the high surface area with a positive charge over the neutral ph range (ph 5-8) of oligocs and cswk lead to an inhibition against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and bacillus cereus) and gram-negative microbes (salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7). in  the minced pork model, oligocs effectively performs a food preservative for shelf-life extension as clarified from the retardation of microbial growth, biogenic amine formation and lipid oxidation during the storage. oligocs maintains almost all myosin heavy chain protein degradation as observed in the electrophoresis. the present work points out that water-based chitosan with its unique morphology not only significantly inhibits antimicrobial activity but also maintains the meat quality with an extension of shelf-life, and thus has the potential to be used as a food preservative.

TI  == the natural antimicrobial carvacrol inhibits quorum sensing in chromobacterium violaceum and reduces bacterial biofilm formation at sub-lethal concentrations.
AB  == the formation of biofilm by bacteria confers resistance to biocides and presents  problems in medical and veterinary clinical settings. here we report the effect of carvacrol, one of the major antimicrobial components of oregano oil, on the formation of biofilms and its activity on existing biofilms. assays were carried  out in polystyrene microplates to observe (a) the effect of 0-0.8 mm carvacrol on the formation of biofilms by selected bacterial pathogens over 24 h and (b) the effect of 0-8 mm carvacrol on the stability of pre-formed biofilms. carvacrol was able to inhibit the formation of biofilms of chromobacterium violaceum atcc 12472, salmonella enterica subsp. typhimurium dt104, and staphylococcus aureus 0074, while it showed no effect on formation of pseudomonas aeruginosa (field isolate) biofilms. this inhibitory effect of carvacrol was observed at sub-lethal concentrations (<0.5 mm) where no effect was seen on total bacterial numbers, indicating that carvacrol's bactericidal effect was not causing the observed inhibition of biofilm formation. in contrast, carvacrol had (up to 8 mm) very little or no activity against existing biofilms of the bacteria described, showing that formation of the biofilm also confers protection against this compound. since quorum sensing is an essential part of biofilm formation, the effect of carvacrol on quorum sensing of c. violaceum was also studied. sub-mic concentrations of carvacrol reduced expression of cvii (a gene coding for the n-acyl-l-homoserine lactone synthase), production of violacein (pigmentation) and chitinase activity (both regulated by quorum sensing) at concentrations coinciding with carvacrol's inhibiting effect on biofilm formation. these results indicate that carvacrol's activity in inhibition of biofilm formation may be related to the disruption of quorum sensing.

AB  == only limited information is available on the microbiological safety of fermented  alcoholic beverages because it is still a common belief that such beverages do not provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth and survival. thus, in this study, we examined the survival of major foodborne pathogens and spores in fermented alcoholic beverages. foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia  coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) and b. cereus spores (initial population, 3 to 4 log cfu/ml) were inoculated separately into three types of beer and refined rice wine, which were then stored at 5 and 22 degrees c. bacterial counts were assayed periodically for up to 28 days. vegetative b. cereus counts decreased rapidly, whereas b. cereus spore counts remained constant (p > 0.05) for a long period of  time in all beverages. vegetative b. cereus cells formed spores in beer at 5 and  22 degrees c, and the spores survived for long periods. among vegetative cells, e. coli o157:h7 had the highest survival (only 1.49 to 1.56 log reduction during  28 days in beer at 5 degrees c). beer and refined rice wine supported microbial survival from several days to several weeks. our results appear to contradict the common belief that pathogens cannot survive in alcoholic beverages. long-term survival of pathogens (especially b. cereus and e. coli o157:h7) in beer and refined rice wine should be taken into consideration by the manufacturers of these beverages. this study provides basic information that should help further research into microbial survival in alcoholic beverages and increase the microbiological safety regulation of fermented alcoholic beverages.

AB  == the incorporation of essential oils and nanotechnology into edible films has the  potential to improve the microbiological safety of foods. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pullulan films containing essential oils and nanoparticles against 4 foodborne pathogens. initial experiments using plate overlay assays demonstrated that 2% oregano essential oil was active against staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhimurium, whereas listeria monocytogenes  and escherichia coli o157:h7 were not inhibited. two percent rosemary essential oil was active against s. aureus, l. monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7, and s. typhimurium, when compared with 1%. zinc oxide nanoparticles at 110 nm were active against s. aureus, l. monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7, and s. typhimurium,  when compared with 100 or 130 nm. conversely, 100 nm silver (ag) nanoparticles were more active against s. aureus than l. monocytogenes. using the results from  these experiments, the compounds exhibiting the greatest activity were incorporated into pullulan films and found to inhibit all or some of the 4 pathogens in plate overlay assays. in challenge studies, pullulan films containing the compounds effectively inhibited the pathogens associated with vacuum packaged meat and poultry products stored at 4 degrees c for up to 3 wk, as compared to control films. additionally, the structure and cross-section of the films were evaluated using electron microscopy. the results from this study demonstrate that edible films made from pullulan and incorporated with essential  oils or nanoparticles may improve the safety of refrigerated, fresh or further processed meat and poultry products.

TI  == establishment of a bacterial infection model using the european honeybee, apis mellifera l.
AB  == injection of human pathogenic bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes) into the hemocoel of honeybee (apis mellifera l.) workers kills the infected bees. the bee-killing effects of the pathogens were affected by temperature, and the ld(5)(0) values at 37 degrees c were more than 100-fold lower than those at 15 degrees c. gene-disrupted s. aureus mutants of virulence genes such as agra, saes, arlr, srta, hla, and hlb had attenuated bee-killing ability. nurse bees were less susceptible than foragers and drones to s. aureus infection. injection of antibiotics clinically used for humans had therapeutic effects against s. aureus infections of bees, and the ed(5)(0) values of these antibiotics were comparable with those determined in mammalian models. moreover,  the effectiveness of orally administered antibiotics was consistent between honeybees and mammals. these findings suggest that the honeybee could be a useful model for assessing the pathogenesis of human-infecting bacteria and the effectiveness of antibiotics.

TI  == a new ultrasonic high-throughput instrument for rapid dna release from microorganisms.
AB  == rapid detection methods for microbiological contamination are requested by many industries that respond to public health concerns. the control laboratories are replacing traditional culturing methods with faster assays based on nucleic acid  amplification technologies, such as real-time pcr. however, an optimal nucleic acid sample preparation method is critical for the sensitivity and specificity of such tools. a high-throughput automated external ultrasonic device was developed  for rapid lysing of microorganisms. based on ct values obtained from real-time pcr, there was efficient dna release from the 16 microorganisms tested, including gram positive and negative bacteria, bacterial spores, yeasts and spores of molds. linearity of the lysis method was also demonstrated for staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, candida albicans and the spores of aspergillus brasiliensis, with correlation coefficients (r(2)) between  0.90 and 0.98. after sonication, pcr analysis of the lysates revealed earlier ct  values (0.83 to 7.49) for s. aureus, p. aeruginosa and s. enterica compared to the bead-beating method of lysis. these results demonstrated more efficient dna release from bacteria with the ultrasonication system. nevertheless, for fungi, the ct values were 0.94 to 1.61 later for sonication than for bead beating. this  study demonstrates that 4min of sonication with this new automated high-throughput instrument allows for the efficient lysis of a large range of microorganisms.

TI  == jcti-i: a novel trypsin inhibitor from jatropha curcas seed cake with potential for bacterial infection treatment.
AB  == jatropha curcas seed cake is a low-value by-product resulting from biodiesel production. the seed cake is highly toxic, but it has great potential for biotechnology applications as it is a repository of biomolecules that could be important in agriculture, medicine, and industry. to explore this potential, a novel trypsin inhibitor called jcti-i was purified by fractionation of the crude  extract with trichloroacetic acid (2.5%, v/v) followed by affinity chromatography (trypsin-sepharose 4b) and molecular exclusion (sephacryl s-200). non-reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration showed that jcti-i has approximately 20.0~kda. mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the intact molecular mass of jcti-i is 10.252~kda. moreover, jcti-i is a glycoprotein with 6.4% (m/m) carbohydrates, pi of 6.6, n-terminal sequence similarity around 60% to plant albumins and high stability to heat, ph, and salinity. jcti-i presented antibacterial activity against the human pathogenic bacteria salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar choleraesuis and staphylococcus aureus, with minimum inhibitory concentration less than 5~mug/ml.  furthermore, jcti-i did have inhibitory activity against the serine proteases from the tested bacteria. otherwise, no hemolytic activity of human erythrocytes  and signs of acute toxicity to mice were observed for jcti-i. the results demonstrate the benefits of j. curcas seed cake as a source of trypsin inhibitor  with potential for biotechnological application as a new antimicrobial agent against human pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == novel kojic acid-polymer-based magnetic nanocomposites for medical applications.
AB  == iron oxide magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) were synthesized by the coprecipitation  of iron salts in sodium hydroxide followed by coating separately with chitosan (cs) and polyethylene glycol (peg) to form cs-mnps and peg-mnps nanoparticles, respectively. they were then loaded with kojic acid (ka), a pharmacologically bioactive natural compound, to form ka-cs-mnps and ka-peg-mnps nanocomposites, respectively. the mnps and their nanocomposites were characterized using powder x-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, vibrating sample magnetometry, and scanning electron microscopy. the powder x-ray diffraction data suggest that all formulations consisted of highly crystalline, pure magnetite fe3o4. the fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis confirmed the presence of both polymers and ka in  the nanocomposites. magnetization curves showed that both nanocomposites (ka-cs-mnps and ka-peg-mnps) were superparamagnetic with saturation magnetizations of 8.1 emu/g and 26.4 emu/g, respectively. the ka drug loading was estimated using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, which gave a loading of 12.2% and 8.3% for the ka-cs-mnps and ka-peg-mnps nanocomposites, respectively. the release profile of the ka from the nanocomposites followed a pseudo second-order  kinetic model. the agar diffusion test was performed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity for both ka-cs-mnps and ka-peg-mnps nanocomposites against a number of microorganisms using two gram-positive (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis) and one gram-negative (salmonella enterica) species, and showed some antibacterial activity, which could be enhanced in future studies by optimizing drug loading. this study provided evidence for the promise for the further investigation of the possible beneficial biological activities of ka and both ka-cs-mnps and ka-peg-mnps nanocomposites in nanopharmaceutical applications.

TI  == use of porcine vaginal tissue ex-vivo to model environmental effects on vaginal mucosa to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1.
AB  == menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mtss) is a rare, recognizable, and treatable disease that has been associated with tampon use epidemiologically. it involves a confluence of microbial risk factors (staphylococcus aureus strains that produce  the superantigen-tsst-1), as well as environmental characteristics of the vaginal ecosystem during menstruation and host susceptibility factors. this paper describes a series of experiments using the well-characterized model of porcine vaginal mucosa ex-vivo to assess the effect of these factors associated with tampon use on the permeability of the mucosa. the flux of radiolabeled tsst-1 and tritiated water ((3)h2o) through porcine vaginal mucosa was determined at various temperatures, after mechanical disruption of the epithelial surface by tape stripping, after treatment with surfactants or other compounds, and in the presence of microbial virulence factors. elevated temperatures (42, 47 and 52 degrees c) did not significantly increase flux of (3)h2o. stripping of the epithelial layers significantly increased the flux of labeled toxin in a dose-dependent manner. addition of benzalkonium chloride (0.1 and 0.5%) and glycerol (4%) significantly increased the flux of (3)h2o but sodium lauryl sulfate at any concentration tested did not. the flux of the labeled toxin was significantly increased in the presence of benzalkonium chloride but not pluronic(r) l92 and tween 20 and significantly increased with addition of alpha-hemolysin but not endotoxin. these results show that the permeability of porcine vagina ex-vivo to labeled toxin or water can be used to evaluate changes  to the vaginal environment and modifications in tampon materials, and thus aid in risk assessment.

AB  == based on current u.s. food and drug administration acidified foods guidelines, regulatory approval of commercial pickled egg production without a final heat treatment requires challenge studies. we conducted challenge studies to verify common pickled egg processing parameters. hard-boiled eggs were acidified in ambient temperature brine at a 60:40 egg/brine ratio. four acidification treatments were studied in triplicate: 5% acetic acid (aa) or 2.5% aa brine with  and without 0.05% sodium benzoate. these treatments resulted in 2% or 1% aa with  or without 0.02% sodium benzoate, respectively, in the total system. samples were stored at 7 degrees c until ph at the yolk center was </= 4.6; subsequently, samples were held at ambient temperature. egg ph was measured at 24- to 48-h intervals until equilibrium ph was reached (4.0 and 4.4). eggs and jar lids were  challenged with separate pathogen cocktails (six strains and/or serovars) of salmonella enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. after 5 and 9 days, the ph fell below 4.6 in 2% aa and 1%  aa eggs, respectively. sodium benzoate did not affect acidification rate for these brine treatments (p >/= 0.05), nor did sodium benzoate affect pathogen die-off. e. coli o157:h7, salmonella, and l. monocytogenes were undetectable (<1  cfu/g) in pickled eggs in 2% aa at 72 h; s. aureus was undetectable after 7 days. in 1% aa eggs, salmonella was undetectable after 10 days. no pathogens were detectable after 14 days. no pathogens were detectable on lids within 72 h for the 2% aa treatment. only s. aureus was detectable on lids after 72 h in the 1% aa treatment and died off rapidly at ambient temperature. although pathogens began die-off under refrigeration, heat treatment (ambient temperature storage) was required to reach undetectable levels. minimal inversion was adequate treatment for lids. pickled eggs should be held under refrigeration for the length of time needed to acidify them to </= 4.6 and then held at ambient temperatures to ensure pathogen inactivation.

AB  == the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-iia primarily inactivates kanamycin and neomycin, whilst aph(3')-iiia also inactivates amikacin. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of both resistance genes in major human pathogens to obtain their baseline prevalence in the gene pool of these bacterial populations in austria. in total, 10 541 escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica and staphylococcus aureus isolates were collected representatively without selection bias between 2008 and 2011. isolates were analysed by aph(3')-iiia/nptiii- and aph(3')-iia/nptii-specific taqman real-time pcr. for positive strains, mics using etests were performed and resistance gene sequences  were determined. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iiia/nptiii was 1.62 % (95 % confidence interval: 1.38-1.88 %). in escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, p. aeruginosa and salmonella spp., the aph(3')-iiia/nptiii prevalence was 0.47 % (0-1.47 %), 37.53 % (32.84-42.40 %), 2.90 % (1.51-5.02 %),  0 % (0-0.32 %) and 0 % (0-0.037 %), respectively. eleven of a total of 169 carriers showed single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the resistance allele. the overall prevalence of aph(3')-iia/nptii was 0.0096 % (0-0.046 %). escherichia coli (0-0.70 %), enterococci (0-0.75 %), staphylococcus aureus (0-0.73 %) and p.  aeruginosa (0-0.32 %) did not carry aph(3')-iia. a single salmonella isolate was  positive, resulting in an aph(3')-iia prevalence of 0.013 % (0-0.058 %). aph(3')-iiia/nptiii carriers were moderately prevalent in the strains tested except for in enterococci, which appeared to be an important reservoir for aph(3')-iiia. aph(3')-iia/nptii genes were detected at clinically irrelevant frequencies and played no significant role in the aminoglycoside resistance gene  pool during the observation period.

TI  == inhibition of multidrug efflux as a strategy to prevent biofilm formation.
AB  == objectives: we have recently shown that inactivation of any of the multidrug efflux systems of salmonella results in loss of the ability to form a competent biofilm. the aim of this study was to determine the mechanism linking multidrug efflux and biofilm formation, and to determine whether inhibition of efflux is a  viable antibiofilm strategy. methods: mutants lacking components of the acrab-tolc system in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were investigated for their ability to aggregate, produce biofilm matrix components and form a biofilm. the potential for export of a biofilm-relevant substrate via efflux pumps was investigated and expression of genes that regulate multidrug efflux and production of biofilm matrix components was measured. the ability of efflux inhibitors carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, chlorpromazine and phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide to prevent biofilm formation by escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus under static and flow conditions was assessed. results: mutants of salmonella typhimurium that lack tolc or acrb, but surprisingly not acra, were compromised in their ability to form biofilms. this defect was not related to changes in cellular hydrophobicity, aggregative ability or export of any biofilm-specific factor. the biofilm defect  resulted from transcriptional repression of curli biosynthesis genes and consequent inhibition of production of curli. all three efflux inhibitors significantly reduced biofilm production in both static and flow biofilm assays,  although different concentrations of each inhibitor were most active against each species. conclusions: this work shows that both genetic inactivation and chemical inhibition of efflux pumps results in transcriptional repression of biofilm matrix components and a lack of biofilm formation. therefore, inhibition of efflux is a promising antibiofilm strategy.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of metabolites extracted from bacterial symbionts associated with marine sponges in coastal area of gulf of mannar biosphere, india.
AB  == marine coastal areas of india have vast diversity of sponges which harbours many  endosymbiotic bacteria which are the source of many potential antimicrobial metabolites. this study focuses the screening and characterization of drug-producing bacteria symbiotically which are associated with marine sponges collected from gulf of mannar, south coast india. six different sponges were collected and they were identified on the basis of their morphology. the drug-producing isolates were screened by agar overlay method towards various clinical strains. the secondary metabolites were characterized and were found to  be quinones, alkaloids, flavanoids and flavonyl glycosides. the metabolites showed significant inhibitory properties against clinical strains that were further identified as chromophoric and fluorophoric in nature. ethyl acetate extracts of chromophore and floureophore substances showed significant inhibitory properties against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and salmonella typhi respectively. 16s rrna gene sequencing of theses isolates revealed that chomophore-producing strain were closely related to pseudomonas spp. rhlb12, isolated from callyspongia spp. and floureophore-producing bacteria  was related to bacillus licheniformis t6-1 which was isolated from haliclona spp. hence, our study demonstrated that antimicrobial metabolites extracted from symbiotic bacteria associated with marine sponges have high therapeutic potential against many bacterial pathogens including multidrug-resistant strains. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study demonstrating antimicrobial potential of flurophoric and chromophoric metabolites extracted from bacterial biosymbionts associated with marine sponges. our study has significant scope as indian coastal area especially harbours vast varieties of sponges with novel secondary metabolites-producing organisms. the natural metabolites extracted from sponge-derived bacteria pave novel therapeutic remedy  against various pathogens when most of them are emerged as extreme drug resistant superbugs.

TI  == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60  mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure  ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin  in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI  == synthesis and evaluation of (z)-2,3-diphenylacrylonitrile analogs as anti-cancer  and anti-microbial agents.
AB  == in the present study, a series of (z)-2,3-diphenylacrylonitrile analogs were synthesized and then evaluated in terms of their cytotoxic activities against four human cancer cell lines, e.g. lung cancer (a549), ovarian cancer (sk-ov-3),  skin cancer (sk-mel-2), and colon cancer (hct15), as well as anti-microbial activities against three microbes, e.g. staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi,  and aspergillus niger. the title compounds were synthesized by knoevenagel condensation reaction of benzyl cyanide or p-nitrobenzyl cyanide with substituted benzaldehydes in good yields. most of the compounds exhibited significant suppressive activities against the growth of all cancer cell lines. compound 3c was most active in inhibiting the growth of a549, sk-ov-3, sk-mel-2, and hct15 cells lines with ic50 values of 0.57, 0.14, 0.65, and 0.34 mg/ml, respectively, followed by compounds 3f, 3i, and 3h. compound 3c exhibited 2.4 times greater cytotoxic activity against hct15 cells, whereas it showed similar potency against sk-ov-3 cells to that of the standard anti-cancer agent doxorubicin. structure-activity relationship study revealed that electron-donating groups at the para-position of phenyl ring b were more favorable for improved cytotoxic activity, whereas the presence of electron-withdrawing groups was unfavorable compare to unsubstituted acrylonitrile. an optimal electron density on phenyl ring a of (z)-2,3-diphenylacrylonitrile analogs was crucial for their cytotoxic activities against human cancer cell lines used in the present study. qualitative structure-cytotoxic activity relationships were studied using physicochemical parameters; a good correlation between calculated polar surface area (psa), a lipophobic parameter, and cytotoxic activity was found. moreover, all compounds showed significant anti-bacterial activities against s. typhi, whereas compound 3k showed potent inhibition against both s. aureus and s. typhi bacterial strains.

TI  == growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == background: the growth-inhibiting and morphostructural effects of seven constituents identified in asarum heterotropoides root on 14 intestinal bacteria  were compared with those of the fluoroquinolone antibiotic ciprofloxacin. method: a microtiter plate-based bioassay in sterile 96-well plates was used to evaluate  the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the test materials against the organisms. results: delta-3-carene (5) exhibited the most potent growth inhibition of gram-positive bacteria (clostridium difficile atcc 9689, clostridium paraputrificum atcc 25780, clostridium perfringens atcc 13124, and staphylococcus aureus atcc 12600) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli atcc 11775 and bacteroides fragilis atcc 25285) (minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic), 0.18-0.70 mg/ml) except for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 13311 (mic, 2.94 mg/ml). the mic of methyleugenol (2), 1,8-cineole (3), alpha-asarone (4), (-)-asarinin (6), and pellitorine (7) was between 1.47 and 2.94 mg/ml against all test bacteria (except for compound 2 against c. difficile (0.70 mg/ml); compounds 1 (23.50 mg/ml) and 4 (5.80 mg/ml) against c. paraputricum; compounds 2 (5.80 mg/ml), 4 (12.0 mg/ml), and 7 (0.70 mg/ml) against c. perfringens); compound 1 against e. coli (7.20 mg/ml) and s. enterica serovar typhimurium (12.0 mg/ml). overall, all of the constituents were  less potent at inhibiting microbial growth than ciprofloxacin (mic, 0.063-0.25 mg/ ml). the lactic acid-producing bacteria (four bifidobacteria and two lactobacilli) and one acidulating bacterium clostridium butyricum atcc 25779 were less sensitive and more susceptible than the five harmful bacteria and two nonpathogenic bacteria (b. fragilis and e. coli) to the constituents and to ciprofloxacin, respectively. beneficial gram-positive bacteria and harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria were observed to have different degrees of antimicrobial susceptibility to the constituents, although the antimicrobial susceptibility of the harmful gram-positive bacteria and the harmful and nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria was not observed. scanning electron microscopy observations showed different degrees of physical damage and morphological alteration to both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria treated with alpha-asarone, delta-3-carene, pellitorine, or ciprofloxacin, indicating that they do not share a common mode of action. conclusion: a. heterotropoides root-derived materials described merit further study as potential antibacterial products or lead molecules for the prevention or eradication from humans from diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.

TI  == antibacterial effect of light emitting diodes of visible wavelengths on selected  foodborne pathogens at different illumination temperatures.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of light emitting diodes (leds) in the visible region (461, 521 and 642 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum was investigated on escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus. the irradiances of the 461, 521 and 642 nm leds were 22.1, 16 and 25.4 mw/cm(2), respectively. bacterial cultures suspended in tryptic soy broth were illuminated by 10-watt leds at a distance of 4.5 cm for 7.5h at 20, 15 and 10 degrees c. regardless of the bacterial strains, bacterial inactivation was observed with the range of 4.6-5.2 logcfu/ml at 10 and 15 degrees c after illumination with the 461 nm led, while illumination with the 521 nm led resulted in only 1.0-2.0 log reductions after 7.5h. on the other hand, no antibacterial effect was observed using the 642 nm led treatment. the photodynamic inactivation by 461 and 521 nm leds was found to be greater at the set temperatures of 10 and  15 degrees c than at 20 degrees c. the d-values for the four bacterial strains at 10 and 15 degrees c after the illumination of 461 nm led ranged from 1.29 to 1.74 h, indicating that there was no significant difference in the susceptibility of the bacterial strains to the led illumination between 10 and 15 degrees c, except for l. monocytogenes. regardless of the illumination temperature, sublethal injury was observed in all bacterial strains during illumination with the 461 and the 521 nm led and the percentage of injured cells increased as the treatment time increased. thus, the results show that the antibacterial effect of the leds  was highly dependent on the wavelength and the illumination temperature. this study suggests the potential of 461 and 521 nm leds in combination with chilling  to be used as a novel food preservation technology.

TI  == poly(ethyleneimines) in dermal applications: biocompatibility and antimicrobial effects.
AB  == cationic polyamines, such as poly(ethyleneimines) (peis), may recommend themselves for antimicrobial applications as they can interact with microbial membranes resulting in their disruption. the purpose of the study was the assessment of biocompatibility and antibacterial activity of peis with different  architectures (branched (b) and linear (l)) and molar masses (0.8-750 kda). lpei  and bpei exhibited a strong antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus  and escherichia coli with a more pronounced effect on the gram-positive bacteria. lpeis further demonstrated a higher antibacterial efficacy compared to bpeis but  no significant differences between 5 and 25 kda were observed. in accordance, antibacterial activity of bpei did not specifically depend on molar mass. only slightly lower minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) were observed at 5 kda (s. aureus) and 25 kda (e. coli) in the tests. as peis are compelling candidates for  use in antimicrobial treatment, two basic aspects have to be investigated: treatment effectiveness and safety. peis clearly induced molecular weight dependent cytotoxic effects in vitro. peis with low molecular weight (0.8 and 5 kda) exhibited higher biocompatibility. nonetheless, the results confirmed a low  genotoxic potential of lpei and bpeis. in conclusion, 2.5 kda-lpei and 0.8 kda-bpei can be recommended for use as antimicrobial polymers in dermal applications due to their high biocompatibility with concomitant antibacterial efficacy.

AB  == here, we report the characterization of three avian beta-defensins (avbds) from the goose, named anser_avbd1, avbd3, and avbd6, respectively. all of anser_avbds  exhibited broad antibacterial activity. in addition, the antibacterial activity of all of the avbds against staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis decreased significantly in the presence of 100mm nacl (p<0.01). none of the avbds showed hemolytic activity. in order to assess the significance of these anser_avbds in the infection of salmonella enteritidis, mrna expression of toll-like receptor (tlr) 4 and anser_avbds in tissues of both control and infected geese was evaluated. we observed a significant up-regulation of tlr4, anser_avbd1, 3, and 6 in some immune tissues evaluated, in response to s. enteritidis infection. these  data demonstrated that tlr4 may serve a possible role in eliciting host immune responses to pathogens, and beta-defensins may play a pivotal role in the host defense mechanisms of the goose.

TI  == exploring insights for virulent gene inhibition of multidrug resistant salmonella typhi, vibrio cholerae, and staphylococcus areus by potential phytoligands via in silico screening.
AB  == in our recent studies on prevalence of multidrug resistant pathogens in byramangala reservoir, karnataka, india, we identified salmonella typhi, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio cholerae which had acquired multiple drug resistance (mdr) and emerged as superbugs. hence, there is a pressing demand to identify alternative therapeutic remedies. our study focused on the screening of  herbal leads by structure-based virtual screening. the virulent gene products of  these pathogens towards kanamycin(aph), trimethoprim(dfra1), methicillin (meci),  and vancomycin (vanh) were identified as the probable drug targets and their 3d structures were predicted by homology modeling. the predicted models showed good  stereochemical validity. by extensive literature survey, we selected 58 phytoligands and their drug likeliness and pharmacokinetic properties were computationally predicted. the inhibitory properties of these ligands against drug targets were studied by molecular docking. our studies revealed that baicalein from s. baicalensis (baikal skullcap) and luteolin from taraxacum officinale (dandelion) were identified as potential inhibitors against aph of s.  typhi. resveratrol from vitis vinifera (grape vine) and wogonin from s. baicalensis were identified as potential inhibitors against dfra1 of s. typhi. herniarin from herniaria glabra (rupture worts) and pyrocide from daucus carota (carrot) were identified as the best leads against dfra1 of v. cholerae. taraxacin of t. officinale (weber) and luteolin were identified as potential inhibitors against mec1. apigenin from coffee arabica (coffee) and luteolin were  identified as the best leads against vanh of s. aureus. our findings pave crucial insights for exploring alternative therapeutics against mdr pathogens.

TI  == pharmacological and toxicological evaluation of sulcona((r)), a traditional siddha medicine used in the treatment of burns.
AB  == sulcona, a siddha proprietary medicine used for the treatment of burns, has been  in practice for more than 50 years. this medicine has been successfully used on several burned patients with an excellent recovery and safety record. in this manuscript, we investigate some of its pharmacological and safety profiles. treatment of cells with sulcona induced a statistically significant increase in population doubling compared to concurrent controls in proliferating human lymphocytes as well as in balb/c 3t3 cells, suggesting that it stimulates cell proliferation. sulcona exhibited some antibacterial activity against pseudomonas  aeruginosa, salmonella typhi and staphylococcus aureus. carrageenan-induced rat paw edema testing suggested that sulcona has some anti-inflammatory properties. patch testing showed that sulcona has mild anesthetic effects. the above properties suggest sulcona's pharmacological properties aidin treatment of burns. sulcona did not show any skin irritation or sensitization or mutagenic potential  suggesting that it is safe for use. further work is necessary to elucidate its exact mechanisms of action.

TI  == dnase i and proteinase k eliminate dna from injured or dead bacteria but not from living bacteria in microbial reference systems and natural drinking water biofilms for subsequent molecular biology analyses.
AB  == molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and quantitative pcr (qpcr), are very sensitive, but may detect total dna present in a sample, including extracellular dna (edna) and dna coming from live and dead cells. dnase i is an endonuclease that non-specifically cleaves single- and double-stranded dna. this enzyme was tested in this study to analyze its capacity of digesting dna coming from dead cells with damaged cell membranes, leaving dna from living cells with intact cell membranes available for dna-based methods. for this purpose, an optimized dnase i/proteinase k (dnase/pk) protocol was developed. intact staphylococcus aureus cells, heat-killed pseudomonas aeruginosa cells, free genomic dna of salmonella enterica, and a mixture of these targets were treated according to the developed dnase/pk protocol. in parallel, these samples  were treated with propidium monoazide (pma) as an already described assay for live-dead discrimination. quantitative pcr and pcr-dgge of the eubacterial 16s rdna fragment were used to test the ability of the dnase/pk and pma treatments to distinguish dna coming from cells with intact cell membranes in the presence of dna from dead cells and free genomic dna. the methods were applied to three months old autochthonous drinking water biofilms from a pilot facility built at a german waterworks. shifts in the dna patterns observed after dgge analysis demonstrated the applicability of dnase/pk as well as of the pma treatment for natural biofilm investigation. however, the dnase/pk treatment demonstrated some  practical advantages in comparison with the pma treatment for live/dead discrimination of bacterial targets in drinking water systems.

TI  == cgmolluscidin, a novel dibasic residue repeat rich antimicrobial peptide, purified from the gill of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas.
AB  == a 5.5 kda antimicrobial peptide consisting of 55 amino acids, cgmolluscidin, was  purified from the acidified gill extract of the pacific oyster, crassostrea gigas, by ion-exchange and c18 reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. by comparing the n-terminal amino acid sequences and the molecular weight of this peptide with those of other known antimicrobial peptides, it has been revealed that this peptide had no homology with any known peptides. cgmolluscidin showed potent antimicrobial activity against both gram-positive bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus (minimal effective concentrations [mecs]; 1.3-31.3 mug/ml), and gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, and  vibrio parahaemolyticus ([mecs]; 0.4-2.3 mug/ml), without hemolytic activity. however, cgmolluscidin did not show any significant activity against candida albicans. the deduced amino acid sequence of the cgmolluscidin showed no hit in public protein databases, while the nucleotide sequence had a 99% homology (e value = 0) with only the unknown ests sequenced by c. gigas est project. tissue distribution of the cgmolluscidin mrna suggests that it is constitutively expressed as a mature form in a non-tissue-specific manner. the cgmolluscidin mrna expression level was significantly up-regulated at 12 h (2.8-fold) post injection with vibrio sp. this peptide is highly basic and contains several dibasic residue repeats including lysine-lysine or lysine-arginine in the sequence, but may not form an ordered structure. these results suggest that cgmolluscidin might be an oyster-specific novel antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == fine mechanisms of the interaction of silver nanoparticles with the cells of salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == silver nanoparticles possess antibacterial effect for various bacteria; however mechanisms of the interaction between ag-nps and bacterial cells remain unclear.  the aim of our study was to obtain direct evidence of ag-nps penetration into cells of gram-negative bacterium s. typhimurium and gram-positive bacterium s. aureus, and to study cell responses to ag-nps. the ag-nps (most 8-10 nm) were obtained by gas-jet method. s. typhimurium (7.81 x 10(7) cfu), or s. aureus (8.96 x 10(7) cfu) were treated by ag-nps (0.05 mg/l of silver) in orbital shaker at 190 rpm, 37 degrees c. bacteria were sampled at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 5 and 23 h of the incubation for transmission electron microscopy of ultrathin sections. the ag-nps adsorbed on outer membrane of s. typhimurium and cell wall of s. auereus; penetrated and accumulated in cells without aggregation and damaging of neighboring cytoplasm. in cells of s. aureus ag-nps bound with dna fibers. cell responses to ag-nps differed morphologically in s. typhimurium and s. aureus, and mainly were presented by damage of cell structures. the cytoplasm of s. aureus became amorphous, while s. typhimurium showed lumping and lysis of cytoplasm which led to formation of "empty" cells. other difference was fast change of cell shape in s. typhimurium, and late deformation of s. aureus cells. the obtained results showed how different could be responses induced by the same nps in relatively simple prokaryotic cells. evidently, ag-nps directly interact with macromolecular structures of living cells and are exert an active influence on their metabolism.

TI  == in vitro selection of rna aptamer specific to salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == salmonella is a major foodborne pathogen that causes a variety of human diseases. development of ligands directly and specifically binding to the salmonella will be crucial for the rapid detection of, and thus for efficient protection from, the virulent bacteria. in this study, we identified a rna aptamer-based ligand that can specifically recognize salmonella typhimurium through selex technology.  to this end, we isolated and characterized an rnase-resistant rna aptamer that bound to the ompc protein of salmonella typhimurium with high specificity and affinity (kd ~ 20 nm). of note, the selected aptamer was found to specifically bind to salmonella typhimurium, but neither to gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) nor to other gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7). this was evinced by aptamer-immobilized elisa and aptamer-linked precipitation experiments. this salmonella species-specific aptamer could be useful as a diagnostic ligand against pathogen-caused foodborne sickness.

TI  == screening for polyphenols, antioxidant and antimicrobial activitiesof extracts from eleven helianthemum taxa (cistaceae) used in folk medicine in south-eastern  spain.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: the helianthemum genus contains approximately one hundred taxa. some of them are important medicinal plants used in several countries for many different purposes. however, studies addressing the phytochemistry of many of these species or their biological activities are currently nonexistent. aim of the study: to perform a comparative analysis of the qualitative composition of secondary metabolites and biological activities of the leaves of the most commonly distributed and used spanish helianthemum taxa in order to find a relationship between chemotype, biological activity and uses. materials and methods: water and 80% methanolic extracts derived from 11 different helianthemum taxa were analyzed for their phytochemical composition using standard methods. furthermore, hplc analysis was performed for the estimation of gallic acid, ellagic acid, tannins and flavonols as marker compounds. the antioxidant activity was measured by employing the scavenging activity on dpph (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and abts (2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate) radicals. the 80% methanolic extracts were evaluated for antibacterial (gram-positive staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and listeria monocytogenes and gram-negative escherichia coli and salmonella enterica) activity using the micro dilution technique. results: the total polyphenolic content and antioxidant capabilities differed significantly among the helianthemum leaf extracts. a strong correlation between  total phenolic content, antioxidant properties and antimicrobial activity was found. the polyphenolic profile was specific for each taxon. whereas helianthemum alypoides, helianthemum cinereum subsp. rotundifolium, helianthemum hirtum, helianthemum asperum, and helianthemum marifolium subsp. marifolium were characterized by the presence of gallic acid, egallic derivatives and ellagitannins; the polyphenolic profile of helianthemum apenninum subsp. cavanillesianum, helianthemum syriacum and helianthemum polygonoides was mostly based on flavonoids. helianthemum cinereum, helianthemum alypoides and helianthemum marifolium consistently presented the strongest radical scavenging activity (in water extracts ec50 ranges from 29.88 to 38.1 against dpph and from  8.11 to 20.8 against abts, and in 80% meoh extracts from 25.3 to 31.8 against dpph and from 6.15 to 8.6 against abts), total phenol content (>117mg gae/l) and  antimicrobial activities. conclusion: the helianthemum taxa used in folk medicine did not cluster in a unique section, being equally distributed in two out of the  four sections analysed. there was not a clear relationship between the chemotype, based on the polyphenolic composition of the taxa, and their taxonomical classification. however, the composition of the methanolic and water extracts from the leaves of plants belonging to the helianthemum genus was strongly related to their medicinal uses.

TI  == formation of biofilms under phage predation: considerations concerning a biofilm  increase.
AB  == bacteriophages are emerging as strong candidates for combating bacterial biofilms. however, reports indicating that host populations can, in some cases, respond to phage predation by an increase in biofilm formation are of concern. this study investigates whether phage predation can enhance the formation of biofilm and if so, if this phenomenon is governed by the emergence of phage-resistance or by non-evolutionary mechanisms (eg spatial refuge). single-species biofilms of three bacterial pathogens (pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) were pretreated and post-treated with species-specific phages. some of the phage treatments resulted in an increase in the levels of biofilm of their host. it is  proposed that the phenotypic change brought about by acquiring phage resistance is the main reason for the increase in the level of biofilm of p. aeruginosa. for biofilms of s. aureus and s. enterica typhimurium, although resistance was detected, increased formation of biofilm appeared to be a result of non-evolutionary mechanisms.

TI  == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB  == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks.  the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single  tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

AB  == severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.

TI  == detection of escherichia coli via voc profiling using secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (sesi-ms).
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 (ec o157:h7), as well as its recently emerging non-o157  relatives, are a notorious group of pathogenic bacteria associated with foodborne outbreaks. in this study, we demonstrated that secondary electrospray ionization  mass spectrometry (sesi-ms) could be a rapid and accurate detection technology for foodborne pathogens. with sesi-ms volatile organic compound (voc) profiling,  we were able to detect and separate a group of eleven e. coli strains from two major foodborne bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhimurium in three food modeling media. in addition, heatmap analysis of relative peak intensity show that there are six core peaks (m/z of 65, 91, 92, 117, 118 and 119) present and at a similar intensity in all eleven e. coli strains at the experimental conditions we tested. these peaks can be considered conserved voc biomarkers for e. coli species (robustly produced after just 4 h of growth). bacterial strain-level differentiation was also attempted via voc profiling, and  we found that ec o157:h7 and ec o145 were differentiable from all other ec strains under the conditions investigated.

TI  == in vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of chinese crested and yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. thirty seven isolates were identified as lactobacillus or enterococcus. out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (lab) and belonged to the species lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other lab isolates were enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%).  strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (ph 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. all isolates produced low rates of  hydrogen peroxide. based on these results, two lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.

TI  == outbreaks associated to large open air festivals, including music festivals, 1980 to 2012.
AB  == in the minds of many, large scale open air festivals have become associated with  spring and summer, attracting many people, and in the case of music festivals, thousands of music fans. these festivals share the usual health risks associated  with large mass gatherings, including transmission of communicable diseases and risk of outbreaks. large scale open air festivals have however specific characteristics, including outdoor settings, on-site housing and food supply and  the generally young age of the participants. outbreaks at large scale open air festivals have been caused by cryptosporium parvum, campylobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, hepatitis a virus, influenza virus, measles virus, mumps virus and norovirus. faecal-oral and respiratory transmissions of pathogens result from non-compliance with hygiene rules, inadequate sanitation and insufficient vaccination coverage.  sexual transmission of infectious diseases may also occur and is likely to be underestimated and underreported. enhanced surveillance during and after festivals is essential. preventive measures such as immunisations of participants and advice on-site and via social networks should be considered to reduce outbreaks at these large scale open air festivals.

TI  == development of a novel rapid immunodiagnostic kit based on flagellar 40 kda antigen epitope for the detection of typhoid fever in indian patients.
AB  == to aid the clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever in india, where most hospitals and primary health centres have no facilities for culture, we report on the development of a novel and rapid immunodiagnostic kit for the direct detection of salmonella typhi--specific igg antibodies against s. typhi flagellar h antigen. the disease often does not show a specific clinical picture, and can be confused  with other febrile illness such as malaria, dengue fever and staphylococcus aureus. to overcome the problem of cross reactivity specific epitope of the flagellar h antigen was immobilised on the testing kit strip eliminating chances  of cross reactivity and false positive results thereby increasing the specificity of the test. since the immunodiagnostic kit, uses the flagellar h antigen from bacteria present in our country, the antibodies present in the serum of patients  of our country will have maximum binding affinity, enhancing the sensitivity of our test kit. the immunodiagnostic kit on analysis gave a positive result with clinically diagnosed typhoid positive patient serum and negative results were obtained with the sera of clinically diagnosed malaria, abscess of staphylococcus aureus and visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of nanodispersed thymol in tryptic soy broth.
AB  == food safety is a continuing challenge for the food industry due to sporadic illness outbreaks caused by foodborne pathogens. plant essential oils have been studied extensively as natural antimicrobials to control foodborne pathogens. however, their hydrophobic nature makes application in foods difficult because of their low water solubility, adverse impact on sensory quality, and binding with food components, which can interfere with antimicrobial efficacy. the objective of this study was to characterize antimicrobial activities of transparent nanodispersions of thymol encapsulated in whey protein isolate-maltodextrin conjugates, with comparison to free thymol. tests were conducted for escherichia  coli o157:h7 strains atcc 43889 and 43894, salmonella typhimurium strain 2576, listeria monocytogenes strains scott a and 101, and staphylococcus aureus strains 27708 and sa113 in tryptic soy broth at various phs and temperatures. results indicate that the mic for nanodispersed and free thymol against all strains of both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens tested was 500 ppm at ph 6.8 and at the optimal growth temperature, with the exception of e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes strain scott a, which were inhibited by 300 ppm of free thymol. nanodispersed thymol was further tested at 500 ppm for inhibition of e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes at 35, 32, 25, and 4 degrees c in tryptic soy broth  adjusted to ph 5.5 and 3.5. at ph 5.5, l. monocytogenes was completely inhibited  after 3 h, and e. coli o157:h7 showed a reduction of 1.0 to 3.0 log cfu/ml after  48 h. at ph 3.5, l. monocytogenes controls did not grow, but e. coli o157:h7 survived. at both ph 5.5 and 3.5, no significant effect of temperature on antimicrobial activity was observed at 500 mg/ml nanodispersed thymol. the present study demonstrated that transparent nanodispersions of thymol have promising antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of foodborne pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of essential oils from mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar  diffusion method. the essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and  gram-negative strains (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for most essential oils examined, s. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while p. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. in general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.

TI  == antiradical, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of commercial beetroot pomace.
AB  == the by-product of food processing is often utilized as feed, and for the preparation of dietary fiber and biofuel. however, these products are also promising sources of bioactive antioxidants and color giving compounds, which could be used as additives in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. the aim of this study was to investigate the phytochemical profile, and the antiradical, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of industrial beetroot pomace extract (bpe). the content of phenolics (45.68 mg gallic acid equivalents g(-1)), flavonoids (25.89 mg rutin equivalents g(-1)) and betalains (4.09 mg betanin g(-1); 7.32 mg vulgaxanthin i g(-1)) were determined spectrophotometrically. the  antiradical activity on dpph (ec(50)(dpph.) = 0.0797 mg ml(-1)), hydroxyl (ec(50)(.oh) = 0.0655 mg ml(-1)) and superoxide anion (ec(50)(o2.-) = 1.0625 mg ml(-1)) radicals were measured by electron spin resonance (esr) spectroscopy. the antimicrobial activity was determined using the agar-well diffusion method. gram(-) bacteria (salmonella typhimurium, citrobacter freundii) and gram(+) bacteria, (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus sciuri, bacillus cereus) showed  high susceptibility, while yeasts and moulds were resistant. bpe exhibits cytotoxic properties against ehrlich carcinoma (eac) cells in vivo due to induction of oxidative stress. the largest decreases in eac cell numbers were observed in the pre-treated male (approximately 53%) and female (approximately 47%) mice, and also the eac cell viability was decreased after administration of  bpe. the activities of the antioxidant enzymes, xanthine oxidase (xod) and peroxidase (px), were significantly different between the untreated eac control group and all other groups that were treated with bpe. the xod and px activities  were very low in untreated malignant cells, but increased significantly after administration of bpe. our results show that bpe holds promise in the food industry as a source of bioactive compounds.

TI  == inefficient antimicrobial functions of innate phagocytes render infant mice more  susceptible to bacterial infection.
AB  == neonates and infants, due to the immaturity in their adaptive immunity, are thought to depend largely on the innate immune system for protection against bacterial infection. however, the innate immunity-mediated antimicrobial response in neonates and infants is incompletely characterized. here, we report that infant mice were more susceptible to microbial sepsis than adult mice, with significantly reduced bacterial clearance from the circulation and visceral organs. infant pmns exhibited less constitutive expression of the chemokine receptor cxcr2, and bacterial infection caused further reduction of pmn cxcr2 in  infant mice compared with adult mice. this correlates with diminished in vitro chemotaxis of infant pmns toward the chemoattractant cxcl2 and impaired in vivo recruitment of infant pmns into the infectious site. furthermore, consistent with the reduced antimicrobial response in vivo, infant macrophages displayed an impaired bactericidal activity with a defect in phagosome maturation after ingestion of either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. thus, infant mice exhibit an increased vulnerability to microbial infection with delayed bacterial  clearance, which is associated with the inefficiency in their innate phagocyte-associated antimicrobial functions characterized by defects in pmn recruitment and macrophage phagosome maturation during microbial sepsis.

AB  == we demonstrated the new antibody/gold nanoparticle/magnetic nanoparticle nanocomposites (antibody/aunp/mnps) and their application in the detection of the foodborne pathogen, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), in milk. the nanocomposites were synthesized by coating the mnps with bovine serum albumin (bsa) then adsorbing the aunps and anti-s. aureus antibodies on their surface. using the completed immunomagnetic nanostructures, s. aureus inoculated in the milk sample was captured and isolated from the medium using the permanent magnet. the nanoparticle-bound cells as well as the unbound cells in the supernatant were enumerated via surface plating to evaluate the target binding capacity of the nanocomposites. the capture efficiencies of the antibody/aunp/mnps were 96% and 78% for s. aureus in pbs and the milk sample respectively, which were significantly higher than those of the antibody-coupled mnps without any aunp. the captured cells were also applied to the selective filtration system to produce color signals that were used for the detection of the target pathogen. during the filtration, the cells bound to the antibody/aunp/mnps remained on the  surface of the membrane filter while unbound nanoparticles passed through the uniform pores of the membrane. after the gold enhancement, the cells-particles complex resting on the membrane surface rendered a visible color, and the signal  intensity became higher as the target cell concentration increased. the detection limits of this colorimetric sensor were 1.5x10(3) and 1.5x10(5)cfu for s. aureus  in pbs and the milk sample respectively. this sensing mechanism also had the high specificity for s. aureus over the other pathogens such as escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica. the assay required only 40min to obtain the results. with the use of the appropriate antibodies, our immunomagnetic nanocomposites-based detection strategy can provide an easy, convenient, and rapid sensing method for a wide range of pathogens.

TI  == systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide in laying hens stimulates antimicrobial properties of egg white against staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the natural protective system of eggs relies on egg yolk immunoglobulins and on antimicrobial proteins/peptides mainly concentrated in the egg white. there is much evidence concerning the specific stimulation of immunoglobulins by antigens  but to date, the influence of the hen milieu on the regulation of the egg innate  molecular immunity has not been established. to explore the hypothesis of modulation in egg antimicrobial molecules, laying hens were immune-challenged with intravenous injections of salmonella enterica enteritidis lipopolysaccharide (lps) at 24 h intervals. eggs of the control and lps groups were collected over a period of 21 days following the first lps injection and the egg white activities  against staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli were assessed. the increase in egg white anti-s. aureus activity reached 20.9% and 23.4% (p<0.05) respectively on days 5 and 6 after the first lps injection. anti-e. coli activity increased moderately only on days 9 and 15 after the lps treatment. to explore the origin of these increased antimicrobial activities, we analyzed the lysozyme and proteases inhibiting (anti-trypsin and anti-chymotrypsin) activities and the ph variations of egg whites. we recorded no significant variations between the two experimental groups for these potential modulating factors. finally, using rt-qpcr we studied the expression of several genes coding for antimicrobial proteins and peptides involved in the immune response in the infundibulum and the magnum, out of the 11 genes, only tlr4 in the magnum and ovocalyxin-36 in infundibulum were over-expressed respectively 24h and 8 days after the first lps  injection. the other candidate genes showed similar or down regulated expression  in the lps group as compared to the control especially during the first 24h. our  results suggest that the hen enhances the albumen antimicrobial activity of its eggs when exposed to immune stimulations or infections. this could be an attempt  to preventively reinforce the protection of the embryo with nonspecific antimicrobial agents in addition to the specific antibodies exported to the egg.  the origin of this stimulation of egg molecular immunity remains to be characterized amongst the numerous novel egg proteins recently identified.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

AB  == there has been an increasing interest in the use of natural plant materials as alternative food preservatives. we examined the antimicrobial effects of natural  plant materials used as additives against foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and sulgidduk, oriental-style rice cakes. cinnamon, mugwort, and garlic powder solutions (3%) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against pathogens in laboratory media. sulgidduk prepared with different amounts of cinnamon powder (1, 3, and 6%) was inoculated with a staphylococcus aureus or bacillus cereus cocktail. the samples were air or vacuum packaged and stored at 22 +/- 1 degrees  c for 72 h, and microbial growth was determined. cinnamon powder showed more inhibitory properties against pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, s. aureus, and b.  cereus than did mugwort or garlic powder. the populations of s. aureus and b. cereus in sulgidduk containing cinnamon powder were significantly lower than in the control during storage time. different packaging methods did not result in a  significant difference in pathogen growth. in a sensory evaluation, sulgidduk containing 1 and 3% cinnamon powder did not significantly differ from the control sample in any of the attributes tested other than flavor. these results indicate  that natural plant materials such as cinnamon powder could be used as food additives to improve the microbiological stability of rice cakes.

TI  == bactericidal activities of health-promoting, food-derived powders against the foodborne pathogens escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == we evaluated the relative bactericidal activities (ba(50) ) of 10 presumed health-promoting food-based powders (nutraceuticals) and, for comparison, selected known components against the following foodborne pathogens: escherichia  coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the relative activities were evaluated using quantitative bactericidal activity [(ba(50) value, defined as the percentage of the sample in the assay mixture that resulted in a 50% decrease in colony forming units]. the ba(50) values were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal curve by regression analysis using concentration-antimicrobial response data. antimicrobial activity  is indicated by a low ba(50) value; meaning less material is needed to kill 50% of the bacteria. olive pomace, olive juice powder, and oregano leaves were active against all 4 pathogens, suggesting that they behave as broad-spectrum antimicrobials. all powders exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against s. aureus. the following powders showed exceptionally high activity against s. aureus (as indicated by the low ba(50) values shown in parentheses): apple skin extract (0.002%); olive pomace (0.008%); and grape seed extract (0.016%). listeria bacteria were also highly susceptible to apple skin extract (0.007%). the most active substances provide candidates for the evaluation of antimicrobial effectiveness in human food and animal feed. practical application: plant-derived health-promoting food supplements, high in bioactive compounds, are candidates for use as antimicrobials in food.

TI  == snptree--a web-server to identify and construct snp trees from whole genome sequence data.
AB  == background: the advances and decreasing economical cost of whole genome sequencing (wgs), will soon make this technology available for routine infectious disease epidemiology. in epidemiological studies, outbreak isolates have very little diversity and require extensive genomic analysis to differentiate and classify isolates. one of the successfully and broadly used methods is analysis of single nucletide polymorphisms (snps). currently, there are different tools and methods to identify snps including various options and cut-off values. furthermore, all current methods require bioinformatic skills. thus, we lack a standard and simple automatic tool to determine snps and construct phylogenetic tree from wgs data. results: here we introduce snptree, a server for online-automatic snps analysis. this tool is composed of different snps analysis  suites, perl and python scripts. snptree can identify snps and construct phylogenetic trees from wgs as well as from assembled genomes or contigs. wgs data in fastq format are aligned to reference genomes by bwa while contigs in fasta format are processed by nucmer. snps are concatenated based on position on  reference genome and a tree is constructed from concatenated snps using fasttree  and a perl script. the online server was implemented by html, java and python script.the server was evaluated using four published bacterial wgs data sets (v.  cholerae, s. aureus cc398, s. typhimurium and m. tuberculosis). the evaluation results for the first three cases was consistent and concordant for both raw reads and assembled genomes. in the latter case the original publication involved extensive filtering of snps, which could not be repeated using snptree. conclusions: the snptree server is an easy to use option for rapid standardised and automatic snp analysis in epidemiological studies also for users with limited bioinformatic experience. the web server is freely accessible at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/snptree-1.0/.

TI  == a novel synthetic peptide from a tomato defensin exhibits antibacterial activities against helicobacter pylori.
AB  == defensins are a class of cysteine-rich proteins, which exert broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. in this work, we used a bioinformatic approach to identify putative defensins in the tomato genome. fifteen proteins had a mature peptide that includes the well-conserved tetradisulfide array. we selected a representative member of the tomato defensin family; we chemically synthesized its gamma-motif and tested its antimicrobial activity. here, we demonstrate that  the synthetic peptide exhibits potent antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus a170, staphylococcus epidermidis, and listeria monocytogenes, and gram-negative bacteria, including salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi, escherichia coli, and helicobacter pylori. in addition, the synthetic peptide shows minimal (<5%) hemolytic activity and absence of cytotoxic effects against thp-1 cells. finally, solyc exerts an anti-inflammatory activity in vitro, as it downregulates the level of the proinflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and ifn-gamma.

TI  == manipulation of innate immunity by a bacterial secreted peptide: lantibiotic nisin z is selectively immunomodulatory.
AB  == innate immunity is triggered by a variety of bacterial molecules, resulting in both protective and potentially harmful pro-inflammatory responses. further, innate immunity also provides a mechanism for the maintenance of homeostasis between the host immune system and symbiotic or non-pathogenic microorganisms. however, the bacterial factors that mediate these protective effects have been incompletely defined. here, it was demonstrated that the lantiobiotic nisin z is  able to modulate host immune responses and mediate protective host immunity. nisin z induced the secretion of the chemokines mcp-1, il-8 and gro-alpha, and significantly reduced tnf-alpha induction in response to bacterial lps in human pbmc. the results correlated with the ability of nisin z to confer protection against both the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus, and the gram-negatives salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium and escherichia coli in murine challenge models. mechanistic studies revealed that nisin z modulates host immunity through similar mechanisms as natural host defense peptides, engaging multiple signal transduction pathways and growth factor receptors. the results presented herein demonstrate that, in addition to nisin z, other bacterial cationic peptides and, in particular, the lantibiotics, could represent a new class of secreted bacterial molecule with immunomodulatory activities.

TI  == behaviour of co-inoculated pathogenic and spoilage bacteria on poultry following  several decontamination treatments.
AB  == the potential of chemical decontaminants to cause harmful effects on human health is among the causes of the rejection of antimicrobial treatments for removing surface contamination from poultry carcasses in the european union. this study was undertaken to determine whether decontaminants might give a competitive advantage to pathogenic bacteria on poultry and involve a potential risk to consumer. a total of 144 chicken legs were co-inoculated with similar concentrations of pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis or escherichia coli) and spoilage bacteria (brochothrix thermosphacta or pseudomonas fluorescens). samples were dipped for 15min in solutions (w/v) of trisodium phosphate (12%; tsp), acidified sodium chlorite (1200ppm; asc), citric acid (2%; ca), peroxyacids (220ppm; pa) or chlorine dioxide (50ppm; cd), or were left untreated (control). microbiological analyses were carried out on day 0 and every 24h until day 7 of storage (at 10+/-1 degrees c). the modified gompertz equation was used as the primary model to fit observed data. tsp, asc and ca were effective in extending the lag phase (l, ranging from 1.47+/-1.34days to 4.06+/-1.16days) and in decreasing the concentration of bacteria during the stationary phase (d, ranging  from 2.46+/-0.51 log(10) cfu/cm(2) to 8.64+/-0.53 log(10) cfu/cm(2)), relative to the control samples (l values ranging from 0.59+/-0.38days and 2.52+/-2.28days, and d values ranging from 6.32+/-0.89 log(10) cfu/cm(2) to 9.39+/-0.39 log(10) cfu/cm(2), respectively). both on untreated and on most decontaminated samples the overgrowth of spoilage bacteria among the species tested was observed throughout storage, suggesting that spoilage would occur prior to any noteworthy  increase in the levels of pathogenic microorganisms. however, l. monocytogenes counts similar to, or higher than, those for spoilage bacteria were observed on samples treated with tsp, asc or ca, suggesting that these treatments might pose  a danger to consumers. however, these results derive from laboratory-based experiments testing artificially-inoculated bacteria. further investigations of the natural micro-biota of poultry carcasses would be appropriate in order to substantiate these findings.

AB  == sample preparation methods (pummeling, pulsifying, sonication, and shaking by hand) were compared for achieving maximum recovery of foodborne pathogens from iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, green pepper, and cherry tomato. antimicrobial and dehydration effects also were examined to investigate causes of poor recovery of pathogens. each produce type was inoculated with escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus at 6.0 log cfu/cm(2), and samples were prepared using the four methods. bacterial populations recovered from the five types of produce  were significantly different (p < 0.05) according to sample preparation methods and produce type. the bacterial populations recovered from pummeled and pulsified samples were higher (p < 0.05) than those recovered from sonicated and hand-shaken samples, except for cherry tomato. the number of bacteria recovered from produce was reduced (p < 0.05) from that of the inoculum by 0.16 to 2.69 log cfu/cm(2). although extracts of iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, and green pepper had no antimicrobial activity, the populations of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, b. cereus, and l. monocytogenes in cherry tomato extract  were slightly reduced after these treatments (p < 0.05). the pathogen populations on perilla leaves and cherry tomatoes decreased by >2 log cfu/cm(2) after exposure to 40% relative humidity for 1 h. no reduction was observed when the five pathogens were exposed to 90% relative humidity. these data suggest that pummeling and pulsifying are optimal sample preparation methods for detection of  microorganisms. acidic produce such as cherry tomato should be treated with a method that does not cause sample breakdown so that acid stress on the bacteria can be minimized. dehydration stress also affects recovery of pathogens from produce.

TI  == residual viral and bacterial contamination of surfaces after cleaning and disinfection.
AB  == environmental surfaces contaminated with pathogens can be sources of indirect transmission, and cleaning and disinfection are common interventions focused on reducing contamination levels. we determined the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection procedures for reducing contamination by noroviruses, rotavirus, poliovirus, parechovirus, adenovirus, influenza virus, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella enterica from artificially contaminated stainless steel surfaces. after a single wipe with water, liquid soap, or 250-ppm free chlorine solution, the numbers of infective viruses and bacteria were reduced by 1 log(10) for poliovirus and close to 4 log(10) for influenza virus. there was no significant difference in residual contamination levels after wiping with water, liquid soap, or 250-ppm chlorine solution. when a single wipe with liquid soap was followed by a second wipe using 250- or 1,000-ppm chlorine, an extra 1- to 3-log(10) reduction was achieved, and except for rotavirus and norovirus genogroup i, no significant additional effect of 1,000 ppm compared to 250 ppm was found. a reduced correlation between reduction in pcr units (pcru) and reduction in infectious particles suggests that at least part of the reduction achieved in the second step is due to inactivation instead of removal alone. we used data on infectious doses and transfer efficiencies to estimate a target level to which the residual contamination should be reduced and found that a single wipe with liquid soap followed by a wipe with 250-ppm free chlorine solution was sufficient to reduce the residual contamination to below the target level for most of the pathogens tested.

TI  == antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  == the aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, salmonella enterica ser. enteritidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa). for these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. the tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. in the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the ph values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. the inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. phosphates obviously made the development of most gram-positive bacteria impossible. especially micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. on the other  hand, gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. the exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. it should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates hexa68 and hexa70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. by comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be  concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on ph values.

TI  == differential modulation of intracellular survival of cytosolic and vacuolar pathogens by curcumin.
AB  == curcumin, a principal component of turmeric, acts as an immunomodulator regulating the host defenses in response to a diseased condition. the role of curcumin in controlling certain infectious diseases is highly controversial. it is known to alleviate symptoms of helicobacter pylori infection and exacerbate that of leishmania infection. we have evaluated the role of curcumin in modulating the fate of various intracellular bacterial pathogens. we show that pretreatment of macrophages with curcumin attenuates the infections caused by shigella flexneri (clinical isolates) and listeria monocytogenes and aggravates those caused by salmonella enterica serovar typhi ct18 (a clinical isolate), salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica. thus, the antimicrobial nature of curcumin is not a general phenomenon. it modulated the intracellular survival of cytosolic (s. flexneri and l. monocytogenes) and vacuolar (salmonella spp., y. enterocolitica, and s. aureus) bacteria in distinct ways. through colocalization experiments, we demonstrated that curcumin prevented the active phagosomal escape of cytosolic pathogens and enhanced the active inhibition of lysosomal fusion by vacuolar pathogens. a chloroquine resistance assay confirmed that curcumin retarded the escape of the cytosolic pathogens, thus reducing their inter- and intracellular spread. we have demonstrated that the membrane-stabilizing activity of curcumin is crucial for its differential effect on the virulence of the bacteria.

AB  == food-borne pathogens may develop certain strategies that enable them to defy harsh conditions such as chemical sanitization. biofilm formation represents a prominent one among those adopted strategies, by which food-borne pathogens protect themselves against external threats. thus, bacterial biofilm is considered as a major hazard for safe food production. this study was designed to investigate the adherence and the biofilm formation ability of some food-borne pathogens on stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces using chip assay, and to  validate regular sanitizing process (sodium hypochlorite 250 mg/l) for effective  elimination of those pathogens. sixteen pathogenic bacterial strains, previously  isolated from raw milk and dairy products at zagazig city, egypt (9 staphylococcus aureus, 4 cronobacter sakazakii and 3 salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium), were chosen for this study. strains showed different patterns of adherence and biofilm formation on tested surfaces with minor significance between surfaces. the ability of sodium hypochlorite to completely eradicate either adhered or biofilm-embedded pathogens varied significantly depending on the strain and type of surface used. whilst, sodium hypochlorite reduced tested pathogens counts per cm(2) of produced biofilms, but it was not able to entirely  eliminate neither them nor adherent cronobacter sakazakii to stainless steel surface. this study revealed that biofilm is considered as a sustainable source of contamination of dairy products with these pathogens, and also emphasized the  need of paying more attention to the cleaning and sanitizing processes of food contact surfaces.

TI  == modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment of bacteria to abiotic surfaces and shrimp by malaysian herb extracts.
AB  == the use of simple crude water extracts of common herbs to reduce bacterial attachment may be a cost-effective way to control bacterial foodborne pathogens,  particularly in developing countries. the ability of water extracts of three common malaysian herbs (andrographis paniculata, eurycoma longifolia, and garcinia atroviridis) to modulate hydrophobicity and attachment to surfaces of five food-related bacterial strains (bacillus cereus atcc 14576, escherichia coli atcc 25922, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 10145, salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923) were determined. the bacterial attachment to hydrocarbon assay was used to determine bacterial hydrophobicity. staining and direct microscopic counts were used to determine attachment of bacteria to glass  and stainless steel. plating on selective media was used to determine attachment  of bacteria to shrimp. all extracts were capable of either significantly ( p < 0.05) increasing or decreasing bacterial surface hydrophobicity, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. bacterial attachment to all surfaces was either significantly (p < 0.05) increased or decreased, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. overall, hydrophobicity did not show a significant correlation (p > 0.05) to bacterial attachment. for specific combinations of bacteria, surface material, and plant extract, significant correlations (r > 0.80) between hydrophobicity and attachment were observed. the  highest of these was observed for s. aureus attachment to stainless steel and glass after treatment with the e. longifolia extract (r = 0.99, p < 0.01). the crude water herb extracts in this study were shown to have the potential to modulate specific bacterial and surface interactions and may, with further work,  be useful for the simple and practical control of foodborne pathogens.

TI  == two novel bioactive glucosinolates from broccoli (brassica oleracea l. var. italica) florets.
AB  == two novel glucosinolates along with one known glucosinolate were isolated from broccoli (brassica oleracea l. var. italica) florets. their structures were established mainly by 1d ((1)h and (13)c nmr), 2d nmr ((1)h-(1)h cosy, dept 135 degrees , hsqc and hmbc), and tandem ms-ms spectrometric data as 2-mercaptomethyl sulfinyl glucosinolate [(z)-4-(methylsulfinyl)-n-(sulfooxy)-2-((2's,3'r,4's,5's,6'r)-3',4',5'-trihydroxy -6'(hydroxylmethyl)-2'-mercapto tetrahydro-2h-pyran-2-yl) butane amide] 1, (z)-1-((2s,5s)-5-hydroxytetra-hydro-2h-pyran-2-ylthio)-2-(1h-indol-3-yl) ethylidene amino sulfate 2 and a known cinnamoyl [6'-o-trans-(4''-hydroxy cinnamoyl)4-(methylsulphinyl)butyl glucosinolate] 3. compound 1 exhibited scavenging activity against dpph with an inhibitory concentration ic(50) of 20 mm, whereas compound 3 was a weak antioxidant when compared to the standard quercetin (5 mm) as a positive control. both the compounds showed a significant and similar antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus with an ic(50) of <625 mug/ml when compared to antibiotic duricef. against salmonella typhimurium the ic(50) of 1 and 3 was determined as <625 mug/ml and <1250 mug/ml, respectively, when compared to ampicillin (ic(50) </= 39 mug/ml) as a positive control.

TI  == whole blood-derived microrna signatures in mice exposed to lipopolysaccharides.
AB  == background: lipopolysaccharide (lps) is recognized as the most potent microbial mediator presaging the threat of invasion of gram-negative bacteria that implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis and septic shock. this study was designed to examine the microrna (mirna) expression in whole blood from mice injected with intraperitoneal lps. methods: c57bl/6 mice received intraperitoneal injections of varying concentrations (range, 10-1000 mug) of lps from different bacteria, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, and serratia marcescens and were killed 2, 6, 24, and 72 h after lps injection. whole blood samples were obtained and tissues,  including lung, brain, liver, and spleen, were harvested for mirna expression analysis using an mirna array (phalanx mirna onearray(r) 1.0). upregulated expression of mirna targets in the whole blood of c57bl/6 and tlr4(-/-) mice injected with lps was quantified using real-time rt-pcr and compared with that in the whole blood of c57bl/6 mice injected with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from staphylococcus aureus. results: following lps injection, a significant increase of 15 mirnas was observed in the whole blood. among them, only 3 mirnas showed up-regulated expression in the lung, but no mirnas showed a high expression level in the other examined tissues. upregulated expression of the mirna targets (let-7d, mir-15b, mir-16, mir-25, mir-92a, mir-103, mir-107 and mir-451) following lps injection on real-time rt-pcr was dose- and time-dependent. mirna induction occurred after 2 h and persisted for at least 6 h. exposure to lps from different bacteria did not induce significantly different expression of these mirna targets. additionally, significantly lower expression levels of let-7d, mir-25, mir-92a, mir-103, and mir-107 were observed in whole blood of tlr4(-/-) mice. in contrast, lta exposure induced moderate expression of mir-451 but not of the other 7 mirna targets. conclusions: we identified a specific whole blood-derived mirna signature in mice exposed to lps, but not to lta, from different gram-negative bacteria. these whole blood-derived mirnas are promising  as biomarkers for lps exposure.

TI  == surface decontamination and quality enhancement in meat steaks using plant extracts as natural biopreservatives.
AB  == nine plant extracts were evaluated as biopreservatives to decontaminate and maintain the quality of meat steaks. most of the extracts exhibited a remarkable  antibacterial activity against antibiotic resistant strains from salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. the pomegranate peel extract (ppe), cinnamon bark extract (cbe), and lemon grass leaves extract (lge) were the most effective as bactericides, with minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 250, 350, and 550 mug/ml, respectively. the most effective treatments, for decontaminating meat steak surfaces, were the application of combined ppe, cbe, and lge at their mic values and the treatment with double mic from ppe; these treatments resulted in complete bacterial inhibitions during the first 2 days of  storage period for 7 days. the sensory evaluation of treated steaks revealed that these two treatments had the highest panelist overall scores. the highest scores, for individual attributes, were observed in the treated steaks with double mic from ppe. application of plant extracts could be impressively recommended for comprehensive meat decontamination and quality attributes enhancement.

TI  == the antimicrobial profile of extracts of a phormidium-like cyanobacterium changes with phosphate levels.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of lipophilic extracts of mat-forming phormidium-like  cyanobacterium isolated from egypt was investigated under different phosphate concentrations. the antimicrobial profile changed with different phosphate levels indicating metabolic changes under stressful conditions. the fractions that resulted in highest antimicrobial activity from the three different phosphate concentrations were chosen for further analyses. the bioactive compounds were identified using chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques including uv, ftir, gc-ms and proton-nmr. the chemical analyses indicated that the compound at standard phosphate concentration was eugenol whereas the bioactive compound at half phosphate concentration was 4-tert-butylcyclohexanol. the third bioactive compound at quarter phosphate concentration was octadecanoic acid. the eugenol is known for its antimicrobial as well as pain relief properties and can be used in  many pharmaceutical preparations whereas the octadecanoic acid and cyclohexanol derivative are used in some antimicrobial pharmaceuticals. the study highlights the change in antimicrobial profile of bioactive compounds derived from cyanobacteria through manipulating the concentration of a key nutrient in growth  medium. this strategy can be employed for mass production of these compounds and  others for future biotechnological applications.

TI  == the antimicrobial effects of propolis collected in different regions in the basque country (northern spain).
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of 19 propolis extracts prepared in different solvents (ethanol and propylene glycol) (eep/pep), was evaluated against some bacterial and fungal isolates using the agar-well diffusion method. it was verified that all the samples tested showed antimicrobial activity, although results varied considerably between samples. results revealed that both types of propolis extracts showed highly sensitive antimicrobial action against gram-positive bacteria and fungi at a concentration of 20% (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisae) with a minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 mg/ml, with a moderate effect against streptococcus pyogenes (mic from 17 to 26 mg/ml). to our  knowledge, this is the first study showing elevated antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria [salmonella enterica (mic from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/ml)]  and lesser activity against helicobacter pylori (mic from 6 to 14 mg/ml), while escherichia coli was resistant. this concluded that the basque propolis had a strong and dose-dependent activity against most of the microbial strains tested,  while database comparison revealed that phenolic substances were responsible for  this inhibition, regardless of their geographical origin and the solvent employed for extraction. statistical analysis showed no significant differences (p </= 0.05) between eep and pep extracts.

TI  == activation of type iii interferon genes by pathogenic bacteria in infected epithelial cells and mouse placenta.
AB  == bacterial infections trigger the expression of type i and ii interferon genes but little is known about their effect on type iii interferon (ifn-lambda) genes, whose products play important roles in epithelial innate immunity against viruses. here, we studied the expression of ifn-lambda genes in cultured human epithelial cells infected with different pathogenic bacteria and in the mouse placenta infected with listeria monocytogenes. we first showed that in intestinal lovo cells, induction of ifn-lambda genes by l. monocytogenes required bacterial  entry and increased further during the bacterial intracellular phase of infection. other gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis, also induced ifn-lambda genes when internalized by lovo cells. in contrast, gram-negative bacteria salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, shigella flexneri and chlamydia trachomatis did not substantially induce ifn-lambda. we also found that ifn-lambda genes were up-regulated in a549 lung epithelial cells infected with mycobacterium tuberculosis and in hepg2 hepatocytes and bewo trophoblastic cells infected with  l. monocytogenes. in a humanized mouse line permissive to fetoplacental listeriosis, ifn-lambda2/lambda3 mrna levels were enhanced in placentas infected  with l. monocytogenes. in addition, the feto-placental tissue was responsive to ifn-lambda2. together, these results suggest that ifn-lambda may be an important  modulator of the immune response to gram-positive intracellular bacteria in epithelial tissues.

TI  == screening of commercial and pecan shell-extracted liquid smoke agents as natural  antimicrobials against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == liquid smoke extracts have traditionally been used as flavoring agents, are known to possess antioxidant properties, and serve as natural alternatives to conventional antimicrobials. the antimicrobial efficacies of commercial liquid smoke samples may vary depending on their source and composition and the methods  used to extract and concentrate the smoke. we investigated the mics of eight commercial liquid smoke samples against salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli . the commercial liquid smoke samples purchased were supplied by the manufacturer as water-based or concentrated extracts of smoke from different wood sources. the mics of the commercial smokes to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens ranged from 0.5 to 6.0% for e. coli, 0.5 to 8.0% for salmonella, and 0.38 to 6% for s. aureus. the mic for each liquid smoke sample was similar in its effect on both e. coli and salmonella. solvent-extracted antimicrobials prepared using pecan shells displayed significant differences between their inhibitory concentrations depending on the  type of solvent used for extraction. the results indicated that the liquid smoke  samples tested in this study could serve as effective natural antimicrobials and  that their inhibitory effects depended more on the solvents used for extraction than the wood source.

TI  == igg opsonization of bacteria promotes th17 responses via synergy between tlrs and fcgammariia in human dendritic cells.
AB  == dendritic cells (dcs) are essential in inducing adaptive immune responses against bacteria by expressing cytokines that skew t-cell responses toward protective th17 cells. although it is widely recognized that induction of these cytokines by dcs involves activation of multiple receptors, it is still incompletely characterized which combination of receptors specifically skews th17-cell responses. here we have identified a novel role for fcgammariia in promoting human th17 cells. activation of dcs by bacteria opsonized by serum igg strongly promoted th17 responses, which was fcgammariia-dependent and coincided with enhanced production of selected cytokines by dcs, including th17-promoting il-1beta and il-23. notably, fcgammariia stimulation on dcs did not induce cytokine production when stimulated individually, but selectively amplified cytokine responses through synergy with tlr2, 4, or 5. importantly, this synergy  is mediated at 2 different levels. first, tlr-fcgammariia costimulation strongly  increased transcription of pro-il-1beta and il-23p19. second, fcgammariia triggering induced activation of caspase-1, which cleaves pro-il-1beta into its bioactive form and thereby enhanced il-1beta secretion. taken together, these data identified cross-talk between tlrs and fcgammariia as a novel mechanism by which dcs promote protective effector th17-cell responses against bacteria.

AB  == background: pathogenic bacteria are able to develop various strategies to counteract the bactericidal action of antibiotics. silver nanoparticles (agnps) have emerged as a potential alternative to conventional antibiotics because of their potent antimicrobial properties. the purpose of this study was to synthesize chitosan-stabilized agnps (cs-agnps) and test for their cytotoxic, genotoxic, macrophage cell uptake, antibacterial, and antibiofilm activities. methods: agnps were synthesized using chitosan as both a stabilizing and a reducing agent. antibacterial activity was determined by colony-forming unit assay and scanning electron microscopy. genotoxic and cytotoxic activity were determined by dna fragmentation, comet, and mtt [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assays. cellular uptake and intracellular antibacterial activity were tested on macrophages. results: cs-agnps exhibited potent antibacterial activity against different human pathogens and also impeded bacterial biofilm formation. scanning electron microscopy analysis indicated that cs-agnps kill bacteria by disrupting the cell  membrane. cs-agnps showed no significant cytotoxic or dna damage effect on macrophages at the bactericidal dose. propidium iodide staining indicated active  endocytosis of cs-agnps resulting in reduced intracellular bacterial survival in  macrophages. conclusion: the present study concludes that at a specific dose, chitosan-based agnps kill bacteria without harming the host cells, thus representing a potential template for the design of antibacterial agents to decrease bacterial colonization and to overcome the problem of drug resistance.

TI  == caenorhabditis elegans immune conditioning with the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus strain ncfm enhances gram-positive immune responses.
AB  == although the immune response of caenorhabditis elegans to microbial infections is well established, very little is known about the effects of health-promoting probiotic bacteria on evolutionarily conserved c. elegans host responses. we found that the probiotic gram-positive bacterium lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm is not harmful to c. elegans and that l. acidophilus ncfm is unable to colonize the c. elegans intestine. conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm significantly decreased the burden of a subsequent enterococcus faecalis infection in the nematode intestine and prolonged the survival of nematodes exposed to pathogenic  strains of e. faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates. preexposure of nematodes to bacillus subtilis did not provide any beneficial effects. importantly, l. acidophilus ncfm activates key immune signaling pathways involved in c. elegans defenses against gram-positive bacteria, including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (via tir-1 and pmk-1) and the beta-catenin signaling pathway (via bar-1). interestingly, conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm had a minimal effect on gram-negative infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa or salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium  and had no or a negative effect on defense genes associated with gram-negative pathogens or general stress. in conclusion, we describe a new system for the study of probiotic immune agents and our findings demonstrate that probiotic conditioning with l. acidophilus ncfm modulates specific c. elegans immunity traits.

AB  == to develop novel antimicrobial peptides (amps) with shorter lengths, improved prokaryotic selectivity and retained lipolysaccharide (lps)-neutralizing activity compared to human cathelicidin amp, ll-37, a series of amino acid-substituted analogs based on ig-19 (residues 13-31 of ll-37) were synthesized. among the ig-19 analogs, the analog a4 showed the highest prokaryotic selectivity, but much lower lps-neutralizing activity compared to parental ll-37. the analogs, a5, a6,  a7 and a8 with higher hydrophobicity displayed lps-neutralizing activity comparable to that of ll-37, but much lesser prokaryotic selectivity. these results indicate that the proper hydrophobicity of the peptides is crucial to exert the amalgamated property of lps-neutralizing activity and prokaryotic selectivity. furthermore, to increase lps-neutralizing activity of the analog a4  without a remarkable decrease in prokaryotic selectivity, we synthesized trp-substituted analogs (a4-w1 and a4-w2), in which phe(5) or phe(15) of a4 is replaced by trp. despite their same prokaryotic selectivity, a4-w2 displayed much higher lps-neutralizing activity compared to a4-w1. when compared with parental ll-37, a4-w2 showed retained lps-neutralizing activity and 2.8-fold enhanced prokaryotic selectivity. these results suggest that the effective site for trp-substitution when designing novel amps with higher lps-neutralizing activity, without a remarkable reduction in prokaryotic selectivity, is the amphipathic interface between the end of the hydrophilic side and the start of the hydrophobic side rather than the central position of the hydrophobic side in their alpha-helical wheel projection. taken together, the analog a4-w2 can serve  as a promising template for the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of endotoxic shock and bacterial infection.

AB  == a sensitive luminescent bioassay for the simultaneous detection of salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus was developed using aptamer-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles (mnps) for both recognition and concentration elements and using upconversion nanoparticles (ucnps) as highly sensitive dual-color labels. the bioassay system was fabricated by immobilizing aptamer 1 and aptamer 2 onto the surface of mnps, which were employed to capture and concentrate s. typhimurium and s. aureus. nay(0.78)f(4):yb(0.2),tm(0.02) ucnps modified aptamer  1 and nay(0.28)f(4):yb(0.70),er(0.02) ucnps modified aptamer 2 further were bond  onto the captured bacteria surface to form sandwich-type complexes. under optimal conditions, the correlation between the concentration of s. typhimurium and the luminescent signal was found to be linear within the range of 10(1)-10(5) cfu ml(-1) (r(2)=0.9964), and the signal was in the range of 10(1)-10(5) cfu ml(-1) (r(2)=0.9936) for s. aureus. the limits of detection of the developed method were found to be 5 and 8 cfu ml(-1) for s. typhimurium and s. aureus, respectively. the ability of the bioassay to detect s. typhimurium and s. aureus in real water  samples was also investigated, and the results were compared to the experimental  results from the plate-counting methods. improved by the magnetic separation and  concentration effect of mnps, the high sensitivity of ucnps, and the different emission lines of yb/er- and yb/tm-doped nayf(4) ucnps excited by a 980 nm laser, the present method performs with both high sensitivity and selectivity for the two different types of bacteria.

TI  == [epidemiology, microbiology, and outcomes of septicemia in children treated at the charles de gaulle university pediatric hospital in burkina faso].
AB  == the aim of this study is to describe the epidemiological and microbiological characteristics and outcome of children with septicemia at the charles de gaulle  university pediatric hospital of ouagadougou to help improve probabilistic antibiotic therapy in this type of infection. this retrospective descriptive study covered all the children from 0 to 15 years old seen over a period of 7 years in any hospital department with suspected bacteriemia and for whom the bacteriology laboratory performed a blood culture. during the study period, the laboratory received 842 requests for blood cultures and found 154 (18.3%) of them to be positive. files for 81 of the 154 patients could be found and examined. the distribution according to age showed septicemia was most frequent among those aged 6-15 years (61.7% of the cases). microbial identification showed the dominant species to be salmonella enterica (serovars paratyphi and typhi) (58%) followed by staphylococcus aureus (12.3%). the salmonella isolates had a high rate of resistance to amoxicillin, chloramphenicol and cotrimoxazole. staphylococci were always sensitive to the antibiotics with which they were tested, although to a lesser extent for penicillin g. all patients routinely received antibiotic treatment, and 81.5% (n=66) were cured (5 children died and 10 left the hospital against medical advice). this study shows that the bacterial epidemiology of septicemia in our setting is dominated by salmonella. trends in bacterial resistance to antibiotics showed that common antibiotics such as amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole are no longer acceptable as probabilist therapy here. they should be replaced in this type of infection by injectable third generation cephalosporin alone or combined with aminoglycosides.

TI  == [septic arthritis of hip due to salmonella typhi in a patient with multiple sclerosis].
AB  == the most common microorganisms isolated from septic arthritis are staphylococcus  aureus and streptoccocci. septic arthritis due to salmonella spp. are rare and the most commonly isolated species are s.choleraesuis and s.typhimurium. however  the number of septic arthritis cases due to s.typhi is low in literature. in this report, septic arthritis of hip due to s.typhi in a multiple sclerosis patient who was under steroid therapy, was presented. a 25-year-old female patient was admitted to our clinic with the complaints of fever, left hip pain, standing and  walking disability for 10 days. her anamnesis revealed that she had had a multiple sclerosis attack and underwent triple pulse steroid therapy. laboratory  findings were as follows; wbc count: 16.300/mm3 (70% polymorphonuclear leukocyte), hemoglobin: 10.6 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 140 mm/hour, crp: 28.7 g/l, ast: 86 u/l and alt: 77 u/l. in lumbosacral magnetic resonance imaging, trochanteric bursitis and generalized myositis were detected in left hip joint compatible with septic arthritis. s.typhi was isolated from patient's blood and operational tissue samples. serum salmonella to and th titers were found as 1/400 and 1/200, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility test was performed by disk diffusion method, and the isolate was found susceptible to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole. the patient was treated by surgery and also by two weeks parenteral (2 x 400 mg)  and 6 weeks oral (2 x 500 mg) ciprofloxacin treatment. six months follow-up of the patient revealed that clinical, radiological and laboratory findings were normal. as far as the national literature was considered, this was the first s.typhi septic arthritis case involving the hip joint and demonstrating bacterial growth both in blood and operational tissue. the presentation of the infection as arthritis plus diffuse myositis and bursitis, is also noteworthy.

TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == antibacterial activity of clarithromycin loaded plga nanoparticles.
AB  == novel drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles (nps) have been proved to enhance the effectiveness of many drugs. clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic, used in many infectious conditions like upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and skin and other soft tissue infections. this paper describes the preparation and enhanced in vitro antibacterial activities of clarithromycin loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga) nanoparticles. a modified quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion (mqesd) method was used to prepare clarithromycin (clr) nps. the antibacterial activity of the nps was evaluated using the agar well diffusion method against escherichia coli (ptcc 1330), haemophilus influenzae (ptcc 1623), salmonella typhi (ptcc 1609), staphylococcus  aureus (ptcc 1112) and streptococcus pneumoniae (ptcc 1240). the inhibition zone  diameters related to each nano formulation were compared with those for untreated clr at the same concentrations. the results indicated that the mean inhibition zone diameters of nps against all the bacteria tested were significantly higher than those of untreated clr, particularly in the case of s. aureus. the increased potency of clr nps may be related to some physicochemical properties of nps like  modified surface characteristics, lower drug degradation, and increased drug adsorption and uptake.

TI  == isolation of a paenibacillus sp. strain and structural elucidation of its broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic.
AB  == this research was initiated to search for novel antimicrobial compounds produced  by food or environmental microorganisms. a new bacterial strain, designated osy-se, which produces a unique and potent antimicrobial agent was isolated from  soil. the isolate was identified as a paenibacillus sp. through cultural, biochemical, and genetic analyses. an antimicrobial compound was extracted from paenibacillus osy-se with acetonitrile and purified using liquid chromatography.  after analyses by mass spectrometry (ms) and nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr), the antimicrobial compound was determined to be a cyclic lipopeptide consisting of a c(15) fatty acyl (fa) chain and 13 amino acids. the deduced sequence is fa-orn-val-thr-orn-ser-val-lys-ser-ile-pro-val-lys-ile. the carboxyl-terminal ile is connected to thr by ester linkage. the new compound, designated paenibacterin, showed antagonistic activities against most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria tested, including listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, and salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium. paenibacterin is resistant to trypsin, lipase, alpha-glucosidase, and lysozyme. its antimicrobial activity was lost after digestion by pronase and  polymyxin acylase. paenibacterin is readily soluble in water and fairly stable to exposure to heat and a wide range of ph values. the new isolate and its antimicrobial agent are being investigated for usefulness in food and medical applications.

TI  == screening for efflux pump systems of bacteria by the new acridine orange agar method.
AB  == aim: development of a non-toxic, fluorescent-based, agar system for the screening of overexpressed bacterial efflux pump systems with common, inexpensive uv accessories. materials and methods: wild type gram-negative and positive bacteria expressing intrinsic efflux pumps and their progeny that overexpress a specific efflux pump were selected for evaluation of efflux pump activity in a mueller-hinton agar, containing increasing concentrations of the non-toxic fluorescent chromophore acridine orange (ao). the method is based on the same principle as the first-generation ethidium bromide method, according to which the concentration of the fluorescent dye that first produces fluorescence of the overlying bacterial colony represents the maximum concentration of the dye that the bacterium can extrude. the higher the concentration needed to produce fluorescence, the greater the ability of the bacterial efflux pump to extrude the dye. results: progeny of escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis and staphylococcus aureus that over-expressed a given efflux pump fluoresced (i.e. accumulated ao) at concentrations of ao that were much greater than the ones required for the emission of fluorescence by their corresponding wild-type counterpart which expressed an intrinsic efflux pump. conclusion: the ao agar method readily identifies strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria that overexpress efflux pump systems compared to their wild-type progeny.

TI  == lack of interchangeability of hfq-like proteins.
AB  == hfq is an rna-binding protein that participates in the regulatory activity of small non-coding rnas (srnas) in many species of bacteria. hfq protein was first  crystallized from staphylococcus aureus and this crystal structure constitutes a  hallmark for bacterial sm-like proteins. paradoxically, however, the functional relevance/role of s. aureus hfq (hfq(sa)) remains uncertain, as growing evidence  suggests that the hfq(sa) gene is expressed at very low levels or unexpressed in  many s. aureus strains. to gather further insight, in the present work we exchanged the structural portion of the hfq gene of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (hfq(stm)) with hfq(sa) and analyzed the effects of the replacement on various hfq-related phenotypes. our results show that the replacement strain - in spite of expressing hfq(sa) at levels comparable to hfq(stm) in wild-type salmonella - behaves as an hfq null mutant in three discrete small rna-mediated regulatory responses. these defects correlate with an abrupt reduction in the intracellular concentration of srnas, as observed in an hfq null mutant. failure  of hfq(sa) to protect salmonella srnas from degradation suggests that hfq(sa) does not bind to these srnas. a parallel study with the borrelia burgdorferi hfq  gene (hfq(bb)) gave essentially identical results: when made from a single copy chromosomal gene, hfq(bb) fails to substitute for hfq(stm) in srna-mediated regulation.

TI  == enhanced antibacterial activity of amino acids-functionalized multi walled carbon nanotubes by a simple method.
AB  == multi-walled carbon nanotubes (mwcnts) were first functionalized by arginine and  lysine under microwave radiation. surface functionalization was confirmed by fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy, raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (tem). after the mwcnts were functionalized by arginine and lysine, the antibacterial activity of all treated samples was increased significantly against all bacteria that were tested. based on the observed minimum inhibitory concentration and radial diffusion assay, the sequence of antibacterial activity was mwcnts-arginine>mwcnts-lysine>pristine mwcnts. the functionalized mwcnts were especially effective against gram-negative bacteria (e.g., escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium). interestingly, the  mwcnt samples were effective against the resistant strain staphylococcos aureus.  the enhanced antibacterial activity was attributed to electrostatic adsorption of bacteria membrane due to positive charges of the functional groups on mwcnts surface. since mwcnts have lower cytotoxicity than single-walled carbon nanotubes, their functionalization with cationic amino acids could be a beneficial approach in the disinfection industry.

TI  == the role of p-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (bcrp) in bacterial attachment to human gastrointestinal cells.
AB  == background and aims: active efflux proteins such as p-glycoprotein (p-gp) are thought to have a protective role in the intestinal tract by preventing xenotoxin absorption. some bacteria also need to adhere to the intestinal tract before causing disease through adhesin secretion. thus, this study was initiated to examine whether any association exists between bacterial adhesion. methods: three human cell lines (caco2, rko, and mcf7), and 6 species of bacteria were used in this study (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium sporogenes and pseudomonas aeruginosa). following incubation of our cells with active efflux inhibitors, bacteria incubated with a stable fluorescent dye were co-incubated at 37 degrees c for various times up to 240min. fluorescence intensity was used to compare bacterial  attachment to these cell lines with either normal efflux protein expression or with induction or inhibition of efflux proteins. results: p-gp inhibition by either psc-833 or gf120918 resulted in a significant increase of all bacterial attachment to caco2 cells up to 3 fold. rko cells and mcf7 cells did not alter their bacterial attachment with psc-833. fumitremorgen c, a dedicated bcrp inhibitor had no effect. in addition, rifampicin, a p-gp inducer, resulted in some limited reduction in salmonella and klebsiella attachment only. conclusions: these results indicate p-gp expression may contribute to the resistance of potential bacterial toxicity, by preventing them adhering to human enterocytes cells in the gastrointestinal tract, which may reduce the risk or intensity of gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == context mediates antimicrobial efficacy of kinocidin congener peptide rp-1.
AB  == structure-mechanism relationships are key determinants of host defense peptide efficacy. these relationships are influenced by anatomic, physiologic and microbiologic contexts. structure-mechanism correlates were assessed for the synthetic peptide rp-1, modeled on microbicidal domains of platelet kinocidins. antimicrobial efficacies and mechanisms of action against susceptible ((s)) or resistant ((r)) salmonella typhimurium (st), staphylococcus aureus (sa), and candida albicans (ca) strain pairs were studied at ph 7.5 and 5.5. although rp-1  was active against all study organisms, it exhibited greater efficacy against bacteria at ph 7.5, but greater efficacy against ca at ph 5.5. rp-1 de-energized  sa and ca, but caused hyperpolarization of st in both ph conditions. however, rp-1 permeabilized st(s) and ca strains at both ph, whereas permeabilization was  modest for st(r) or sa strain at either ph. biochemical analysis, molecular modeling, and ftir spectroscopy data revealed that rp-1 has indistinguishable net charge and backbone trajectories at ph 5.5 and 7.5. yet, concordant with organism-specific efficacy, surface plasmon resonance, and ftir, molecular dynamics revealed modest helical order increases but greater rp-1 avidity and penetration of bacterial than eukaryotic lipid systems, particularly at ph 7.5. the present findings suggest that ph- and target-cell lipid contexts influence selective antimicrobial efficacy and mechanisms of rp-1 action. these findings offer new insights into selective antimicrobial efficacy and context-specificity  of antimicrobial peptides in host defense, and support design strategies for potent anti-infective peptides with minimal concomitant cytotoxicity.

TI  == wfdc2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
AB  == wap four disulfide core domain 2 (wfdc2) is a four disulfide core (4-dsc) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. it is comprised of two 4-dsc domains  assigned domain iii at the nh2-terminal end and domain ii at the cooh-terminal end. the wfdc2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. the wfdc2 protein showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain ii. there was no antibacterial activity detected against enterococcus faecalis. the observed expression pattern  of tammar wfdc2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by s. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. the latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as e. faecalis.

TI  == evaluation of additional cooking procedures to achieve lethality microbiological  performance standards for large, intact meat products.
AB  == the u.s. department of agriculture food safety and inspection service (usda-fsis) has a specific lethality performance standard for ready-to-eat products. to assist meat processing establishments in meeting the performance standard, usda-fsis developed appendix a, which provides guidelines for cooking temperatures, times, and relative humidity. this project determined whether the usda-fsis performance standards for lethality were met when using parameters other than those identified in appendix a to cook large hams and beef inside rounds. the effects of alternative lethality parameters on the reduction of salmonella typhimurium and coliforms and on the toxin production of staphylococcus aureus were evaluated. large (9- to 12-kg) cured bone-in hams (n = 80) and large (8- to 13-kg) uncured beef inside rounds (n = 80) were used in this study. the products were subjected to 1 of 10 treatments defined by combinations  of final internal product temperatures (48.9, 54.4, 60.0, 65.6, or 71.1 degrees c) and batch oven relative humidities (50 or 90 % ). for all treatments, at least a 6.5-log reduction in salmonella typhimurium was achieved. the coliform counts were also substantially reduced for both hams and rounds. across all treatments for both products, s. aureus toxin production was not detected. the relative humidity did not alter the lethality effectiveness for any of the treatments. the final internal temperatures and relative humidity combinations used in this project achieved the lethality performance standard established by usda-fsis for  fully cooked, ready-to-eat products.

TI  == growth and survival of foodborne pathogens in beer.
AB  == this work aimed to assess the growth and survival of four foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) in beer. the effects of ethanol, ph, and storage temperature were investigated for the gram-negative pathogens (e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium), whereas the presence of hops ensured that the gram-positive pathogens (l. monocytogenes and s. aureus) were rapidly inactivated in alcohol-free beer. the pathogens e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium could not grow in the mid-strength or full-strength beers, although they could survive for more than 30 days in the mid-strength beer when held at 4 degrees c.  these pathogens grew rapidly in the alcohol-free beer; however, growth was prevented when the ph of the alcohol-free beer was lowered from the "as received" value of 4.3 to 4.0. pathogen survival in all beers was prolonged at lowered storage temperatures.

TI  == antibacterial characteristics and activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives  prepared by the maillard reaction.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives prepared by maillard reactions against staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, shigella dysenteriae, and salmonella typhimurium was examined. relatively high antibacterial activity against various  microorganisms was noted for the chitosan-glucosamine derivative as compared to the acid-soluble chitosan. in addition, it was found that the susceptibility of the test organisms to the water-soluble chitosan derivative was higher in deionized water than in saline solution. metal ions were also found to reduce the antibacterial activity of the water-soluble chitosan derivative on s. aureus. the marked increase in glucose level, protein content and lactate dehydrogenase (ldh) activity was observed in the cell supernatant of s. aureus exposed to the water-soluble chitosan derivative in deionized water. the results suggest that the water-soluble chitosan produced by maillard reaction may be a promising commercial substitute for acid-soluble chitosan.

TI  == acanthamoeba polyphaga, a potential environmental vector for the transmission of  food-borne and opportunistic pathogens.
AB  == the endosymbiotic relationship could represent for many bacteria an important condition favouring their spread in the environment and in foods. for this purpose we studied the behaviour of some food-borne and opportunistic pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, aeromonas hydrophila, yersinia enterocolitica) when internalized in acanthamoeba polyphaga. our results confirm the capability of the bacteria tested to grow within amoebal hosts. we can observe two types of interactions of the bacteria internalized in a. polyphaga. the first type, showed by y. enterocolitica and a. hydrophila, was characterized by an early replication, probably followed by the killing and digestion of the bacteria. the  second type, showed by e. faecalis and s. aureus was characterized by the persistence and grow inside the host without lysis. lastly, when amoebae were co-cultured with l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis, an eclipse phase followed by an active intracellular growth was observed, suggesting a third type of predator-prey trend. the extracellular count in presence of a. polyphaga, as a result of an intracellular multiplication and subsequent release, was characterized by an increase of e. faecalis, s. aureus, l. monocytogenes and s. enteritidis, and by a low or absent cell count for y. enterocolitica and a. hydrophila. our study suggests that the investigated food-borne and opportunistic pathogens are, in most cases, able to interact with a. polyphaga, to intracellularly replicate and, lastly, to be potentially spread in the environment, underlining the possible role of this protozoan in food contamination.

TI  == inhibition of growth of highly resistant bacterial and fungal pathogens by a natural product.
AB  == the continuous escalation of resistant bacteria against a wide range of antibiotics necessitates discovering novel unconventional sources of antibiotics. b. oleracea l (red cabbage) is health-promoting food with proven anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. however, it has not been researched adequately for  its antimicrobial activity on potential resistant pathogens. the methanol crude extract of b. oleracea l. was investigated for a possible anti-microbial activity. the screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 22 pathogenic bacteria and fungi. it was followed by evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). moreover, the antibacterial and the antifungal activities were confirmed using the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and  the minimum fungicidal concentration (mfc), respectively. remarkable, antibacterial activity was evident particularly against highly infectious microorganisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium as well as against human fungal pathogens, trichophyton rubrum and aspergillus terreus. red cabbage is a rich source of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins being the most abundant class, which might explain its potent antimicrobial action. this extract is potentially  novel for future antimicrobials, inexpensive, and readily available at a large scale for pharmaceutical companies for further investigation and processing.

TI  == protection activity of a novel probiotic strain of bacillus subtilis against salmonella enteritidis infection.
AB  == the activity of 240 bacterial isolates screened from the gastrointestinal tracts  of native chickens were evaluated for use as a potential probiotic in food animal production in order to protect against animal diseases and reduce pathogenic contamination of human food products. in observing the antagonistic activity of 117 bacilli isolates, 10 of these isolates exhibited higher growth inhibition of  seven foodborne pathogens, including salmonella enteritidis, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and vibrio cholerae. beneficial probiotic criteria from these isolates - which included non-pathogenicity, acid and bile salt tolerance, hydrophobicity, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells - exhibited that one  isolate of nc11 had the most potential as a probiotic. 16s rrna gene sequencing showed that this nc11 isolate was bacillus subtilis. this b. subtilis nc11 was sensitive to all antibiotics and was not cytotoxic to intestinal epithelial cells. reduction of s. enteritidis attachment to the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells via action of a cultured medium from b. subtilis nc11 was observed by scanning electron microscopy. b. subtilis nc11 cells, as well as the  bacterial cultured medium or the cultured medium adjusted to ph 7, significantly  inhibited s. enteritidis invasion (p<0.01) of intestinal epithelial cells. this study indicates that b. subtilis nc11 has characteristics of a potential probiotic, and exhibits strong inhibition activity against s. enteritidis infection to intestinal epithelial cells.

TI  == defining treatment conditions for pulsed electric field pasteurization of apple juice.
AB  == the influence of temperature and the presence of n(alpha)-lauroyl ethylester (ethyl lauroyl arginate, lae) on the inactivation caused by continuous pulsed electric field treatments (pef) in escherichia coli o157:h7 suspended in apple juice have been investigated to define treatment conditions applicable at industrial scale that promote an equivalent safety level when compared with thermal processing. in the range of experimental conditions investigated (outlet  temperature: 20-40 degrees c, electric field strength: 20-30 kv, treatment time:  5-125 mus) at outlet temperatures equal or lower than 55+/-1 degrees c, the inactivation of e. coli o157:h7 treated in apple juice ranged from 0.4 to 3.6 log(1)(0) cycles reduction and treated in apple juice supplemented with lae (50 ppm) ranged from 0.9 to 6.7 log(1)(0) cycles reduction. an empirical mathematical model was developed to estimate the treatment time and total specific energy input to obtain 5 log(1)(0) cycles reduction in the population of e. coli o157:h7 suspended in apple juice supplemented with 50 ppm of lae at different electric field strengths and inlet temperatures. treatment conditions established for e. coli o157:h7 were validated with other pef resistant gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (salmonella enterica  serovar typhimurium) strains. when the treatment was applied to the apple juice,  a treatment of 25 kv/cm for 63 mus corresponding with an outlet temperature of 65 degrees c and input energy of 125 kj/kg was required to achieve more than 5 log(1)(0) cycles in the four strains investigated. the addition of lae reduced the treatment time required to obtain an equivalent inactivation (>5 log(1)(0) cycles) in the four microorganisms to 38.4 mus, the outlet temperature to 55 degrees c, and the input energy to 83.2 kj/kg.

TI  == evaluation of abelmoschus moschatus extracts for antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities using in vitro assays.
AB  == background: abelmoschus moschatus medik. leaves and seeds are considered as valuable traditional medicine. the aromatic seeds of this plant are aphrodisiac,  ophthalmic, cardio tonic, antispasmodic and used in the treatment of intestinal complaints and check queasiness. to give a scientific basis for traditional usage of this medicinal plant, the seed and leaf extracts were evaluated for their antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. methods: in this study, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of a. moschatus extracts were evaluated in a series  of in vitro assay involving free radicals, reactive oxygen species and their ic50 values were also determined. the antioxidant activities of the seed and leaf extracts of a. moschatus were determined by total antioxidant, dpph, and ferrous  reducing antioxidant property (frap) methods. in addition, the antiproliferative  activity was also evaluated using colorectal adenocarcinoma and retinoblastoma human cancer cell lines. moreover, six bacterial reference strains, two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus), four gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and salmonella enterica paratyphi) and one fungal strain (candida albicans) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. results: the results from this study showed  that the antioxidant activities of a. moschatus as determined by the total phenol, flavonoids, total antioxidant and frap methods were higher in leaf than that of the seed extracts. on the other hand, the aqueous overnight seed extract  (ams-i) has shown significant radical scavenging activity as in 1, 1- diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide and lipid peroxidation as compared to other seed and leaf extracts. the ams-i and aml-iv have shown activity against six and seven microorganisms respectively. simulteneously, ams-iv and aml-iv have demonstrated potential antiproliferative activity against two human cell lines - colorectal adenocarcinoma (colo-205) and  retinoblastoma (y79). conclusion: the seed and leaf extracts of a. moschatus possess significant antioxidant activity and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger, or substitute, probably as primary antioxidants. the plant possesses moderate antibacterial activity against bacterial strains used in this study. hydroalcoholic seed and leaf extracts also exhibited antiproliferative activity against two human cancer cell lines. a. moschatus may  therefore, be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutics.

TI  == characterization of d-boroala as a novel broad-spectrum antibacterial agent targeting d-ala-d-ala ligase.
AB  == d-boroala was previously characterized as an inhibitor of bacterial alanine racemase and d-ala-d-ala ligase enzymes (biochemistry, 28, 1989, 3541). in this study, d-boroala was identified and characterized as an antibacterial agent. d-boroala has activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms, with minimal inhibitory concentrations down to 8 mug / ml. a structure-function study on the alkyl side chain (nh(2) -chr-b(or')(2) ) revealed that d-boroala is  the most effective agent in a series including borogly, d-borohomoala, and d-boroval. l-boroala was much less active, and n-acetylation completely abolished activity. an lc-ms / ms assay was used to demonstrate that d-boroala exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibition of d-ala-d-ala ligase. d-boroala is bactericidal at 1x minimal inhibitory concentration against staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, which each encode one copy of d-ala-d-ala ligase, and at 4x minimal inhibitory concentration against escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, which each encode two copies of d-ala-d-ala ligase. d-boroala demonstrated a frequency of resistance of 8 x 10(-8) at 4x minimal inhibitory concentration in s. aureus. these results demonstrate that d-boroala has promising antibacterial activity and could serve as the lead agent in a new class of d-ala-d-ala ligase targeted antibacterial agents. this study also demonstrates d-boroala as a possible probe for d-ala-d-ala ligase function.

AB  == cathelicidins secreted in milk may be central to autocrine feedback in the mammary gland for optimal development in addition to conferring innate immunity to both the mammary gland and the neonate. this study exploits the unique reproductive strategy of the tammar wallaby (macropus eugenii) model to analyse differential splicing of cathelicidin genes and to evaluate the bactericidal activity and effect of the protein on mammary epithelial cell proliferation. two  linear peptides, con73 and con218, derived from the heterogeneous carboxyl end of cathelicidin transcripts, maeucath1 and maeucath7 respectively, were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. both con73 and con218 significantly inhibited the growth of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aureginosa, enterococcus faecalis and salmonella enterica. in addition both maeucath1 and maeucath7 stimulated proliferation of primary tammar wallaby mammary epithelial cells (wallmec). lactation-phase specific alternate spliced transcripts were determined for maeucath1 showing utilisation of both antimicrobial and proliferative functions are required by the mammary gland and the suckled young. the study has shown for  the first time that temporal regulation of milk cathelicidins may be crucial in antimicrobial protection of the mammary gland and suckled young and mammary cell  proliferation.

AB  == metabolomics, or metabolite profiling, is an approach that is increasingly used to study the metabolism of diverse organisms, elucidate biological processes and/or find characteristic biomarkers of physiological states. here, we describe  the optimization of a method for global metabolomic analysis of bacterial cultures, with the following steps. cells are grown to log-phase, starting from an overnight culture and bacterial concentrations are monitored by measuring the  optical density of the cultures at 600 nm. at an appropriate density they are harvested by centrifugation, washed three times with nacl solution and metabolites are extracted using methanol and a bead-mill. dried extracts are methoxymated and derivatized with methyltrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (mstfa)  then analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (gc-ms/tof). finally, patterns in the acquired data are examined by  multivariate data modeling. this method enabled us to obtain reproducible metabolite profiles of yersinia pseudotuberculosis, with about 25% compound identification, based on comparison with entries in available gc-ms libraries. to assess the potential utility of the method for comparative analysis of other bacterial species we analyzed cultures of pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa). multivariate analysis of the acquired data showed that it was possible to differentiate the species according to their metabolic profiles. our results show that the presented procedure can be used for metabolomic analysis of a wide range of bacterial species of clinical interest.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the application of established d-value calculations to survival curves for various bacteria using the following  antimicrobials: acidified sodium chlorite, triclosan, octanoic acid, and sodium hydroxide. d-values can be calculated in 3 ways, a linear regression, an endpoint calculation, or an average of multiple endpoint calculations. the assumption made in calculating a d-value is that the rate of kill follows 1st-order kinetics under specified treatment conditions. each antimicrobial solution was challenged  with approximately 108 cfu/ml of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, and escherichia coli independently and in triplicate. test systems were sampled at each of the 10 time points over a period of 7 min, neutralized, pour plated then incubated at 35 degrees c for 48 h (aoac  official method 960.09). survival curves using the log-transformed data were calculated using regression analysis. correlations coefficients for all linear regression analyses ranged between 0.291 and 0.982, with 6 of the 16 different treatment systems having an r2 value below 0.7. methods used for calculating d-values should lead to the same result if the survival curve in a given condition is linear. the calculated d-values were different using endpoint analysis (stumbo method), linear regression, and average of multiple endpoints. this study demonstrates the nonlinearity of inactivation curves of antimicrobials. d-value estimations cannot be reliably used to illustrate biocidal activity in antimicrobial test systems.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by kimchi prepared with bacteriocin-producing starter culture.

AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effect of nacl on the biofilm formation of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, shigella boydii, and salmonella typhimurium. the biofilm cells were cultured in media containing different nacl concentrations (0% to 10%) for 10 d of incubation at 37 degrees c using a 24-well polystyrene microtiter plate, collected by swabbing methods, and enumerated using plate count method. the attachment and detachment kinetic patterns were estimated according to the modified gompertz model. the cell surface hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation were observed at different nacl concentrations. most strains showed 2 distinctive phases at lower than 6% nacl, while the numbers of adhered cells gradually increased throughout the incubation period at 4% to 10% nacl. at  0% nacl, the numbers of adhered l. monocytogenes, s. aureus, s. boydii, and s. typhimurium cells rapidly increased up to 7.04, 6.47, 6.39, and 7.27 log cfu/cm(2), respectively, within 4 d of incubation. the maximum growth rate (k(a)) and specific growth rate (mu(a)) of adherent pathogenic cells were decreased with increasing nacl concentration. noticeable decline in the numbers of adherent cells was observed at low concentration levels of nacl (<2%). the adherence abilities of foodborne pathogens were influenced by the physicochemical surface properties. the hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation enhanced the biofilm formation during the incubation periods. therefore, this study could provide useful information to better understand the adhesion and detachment capability of foodborne pathogens on food contact surfaces.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
AB  == a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.

TI  == antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == to study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. the microbiological quality of  honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. the bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. all honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, streptococcus pyogenes, bacillus cereus and bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more  resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in  the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.

TI  == behavior of salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and shigella flexneri and shigella sonnei during production of pulque, a traditional mexican beverage.
AB  == pulque is a typical fermented alcoholic beverage of central mexico, produced from the nectar of maguey agave plants. production systems are largely artisanal, with inadequate hygiene conditions and exposure to multiple contamination sources. no  data exist on pulque microbiological safety and the behavior of pathogenic microorganisms in agave nectar and pulque. an initial trial was done of the behavior of salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and shigella flexneri and shigella sonnei during fermentation of nectar from a single producer, nectar mixture from different producers, and seed  pulque. a second trial simulating artisanal pulque production was done by contaminating fresh nectar with each of the five strains, storing at 22 degrees c for 14 h, adding seed pulque, and fermenting until pulque was formed. during incubation at 16 or 22 degrees c in the first trial, all the pathogenic strains multiplied in both the single producer nectar and the nectar mixture, reaching maximum concentrations at 12 h. strains concentration then decreased slowly. in the seed pulque, the strains did not multiply and tended to die. in the second trial, all strains increased concentration from 0.7 to 1.6 log at 22 degrees c, and from 0.5 to 1.1 at 16 degrees c in the first 14 h. after addition of seed pulque, they were quickly deactivated until none was detected in the final product. the results suggest that the potential risk to consumers of contracting  any of the five tested pathogenic bacterial strains from pulque is low.

TI  == diversity and antimicrobial activity of pseudovibrio spp. from irish marine sponges.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the diversity and antimicrobial activity present among pseudovibrio spp. isolated from marine sponges. methods and results: seventy-three bacterial isolates from the marine sponges polymastia boletiformis, axinella dissimilis and haliclona simulans were identified as pseudovibrio spp. using phylogenetic analysis of 16s rrna gene sequences. genetic diversity among these isolates was estimated using random amplification of polymorphic dna (rapd), and 33 rapd types were identified among the 73 pseudovibrio isolates. these pseudovibrio spp. were assayed for the production of compounds with antimicrobial activity against various clinically relevant pathogens. sixty-two (85%) of the isolates showed activity against at least one of the pathogens tested, including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and clostridium difficile. pcr screens of the pseudovibrio isolates also revealed the presence of potential  antibiotic-producing polyketide synthase genes. conclusions: marine sponges harbour a diverse population of pseudovibrio spp., the majority of which demonstrate antimicrobial activity. the identification of several different antimicrobial activity spectra suggests that the pseudovibrio isolates may produce a suite of antimicrobial compounds. significance and impact of the study: this is the first study in which an extended population of pseudovibrio isolates  from marine sponges has been analysed and establishes the little-studied pseudovibrio as a potentially important genus in the search for antimicrobial compounds of clinical relevance.

TI  == lingonberry (vaccinium vitis-idaea) and european cranberry (vaccinium microcarpon) proanthocyanidins: isolation, identification, and bioactivities.
AB  == european, small-fruited cranberries (vaccinium microcarpon) and lingonberries (vaccinium vitis-idaea) were characterized for their phenolic compounds and tested for antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiadhesive, and antiinflammatory effects. the main phenolic compounds in both lingonberries and cranberries were proanthocyanidins comprising 63-71% of the total phenolic content, but anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, and flavonols were also found. proanthocyanidins are polymeric phenolic compounds consisting mainly  of catechin, epicatechin, gallocatechin, and epigallocatechin units. in the present study, proanthocyanidins were divided into three groups: dimers and trimers, oligomers (mdp 4-10), and polymers (mdp > 10). catechin, epicatechin, a-type dimers and trimers were found to be the terminal units of isolated proanthocyanidin fractions. inhibitions of lipid oxidation in liposomes were over 70% and in emulsions over 85%, and in most cases the oligomeric or polymeric fraction was the most effective. polymeric proanthocyanidin extracts of lingonberries and cranberries were strongly antimicrobial against staphylococcus  aureus, whereas they had no effect on other bacterial strains such as salmonella  enterica sv. typhimurium, lactobacillus rhamnosus and escherichia coli. polymeric fraction of cranberries and oligomeric fractions of both lingonberries and cranberries showed an inhibitory effect on hemagglutination of e. coli, which expresses the m hemagglutin. cranberry phenolic extract inhibited lps-induced no  production in a dose-dependent manner, but it had no major effect on inos of cox-2 expression. at a concentration of 100 mug/ml cranberry phenolic extract inhibited lps-induced il-6, il-1beta and tnf-alpha production. lingonberry phenolics had no significant effect on il-1beta production but inhibited il-6 and tnf-alpha production at a concentration of 100 mug/ml similarly to cranberry phenolic extract. in conclusion the phenolics, notably proanthocyanidins (oligomers and polymers), in both lingonberries and cranberries exert multiple bioactivities that may be exploited in food development.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antimutagenic activities of selected marine natural products and tobacco cembranoids.
AB  == multidrug resistance (mdr) in microorganisms is a cause of major concern for clinicians and pharmaceutical industries. continuous development of new antimicrobial drugs with multiple targets and potentials is expected to efficiently combat mdr in these microorganisms. in a continued exploration of new antimicrobial drug leads, 11 marine natural products, semisynthetic, or related synthetic analogs (1-11) and two tobacco cembranoids (12 and 13) were screened for their antimicrobial, antioxidant, and antimutagenic activities. eight compounds showed varying levels of both antibacterial and antifungal activities.  compounds such as 17-o-methyllatrunculin-a, verongiaquinol, (1s,2e,4r,6r,7e,11e)-2,7,11-cembratriene-4,6-diol), and manzamine-a showed a broad spectrum of activity, inhibiting six of seven tested bacteria with zone of  inhibition diameter from 9 to 30 mm. four of these active compounds also showed antifungal activity. the findings of the in vitro time-kill assay of the most active compound, verongiaquinol, against staphylococcus aureus indicated its subinhibitory effect at the level lower than the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values (i.e., 2 and 4 microg/ml). at the mic (8 microg/ml), bacterial cells were completely killed within 18 hours of incubation. dpph free radical scavenging activity was demonstrated by five compounds in the range of 89.65-36.19% decolorization. further, four compounds evaluated for their antimutagenic activity against the directly acting mutagens, methyl methanesulfonate and sodium azide, in salmonella typhimurium strains, interestingly, showed no sign of mutagenicity. verongiaquinol and manzamine a, in fact, reduced the mutagenicity by 50-75% at a dose of 5 microg/plate in different test strains. our study seems to provide some novel antimicrobial leads with strong antioxidant potential and the associated ability of antimutagenicity.

AB  == caseicin a (ikhqglpqe) and caseicin b (vlnenllr) are antimicrobial peptides generated through the bacterial fermentation of sodium caseinate, and on the basis of this and previous studies, they are active against many gram-negative pathogens (cronobacter sakazakii, cronobacter muytjensii, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas fluorescens) as well as the gram-positive organism staphylococcus aureus. here we describe further studies with the aim of establishing the importance of specific  (charged and nonpolar aliphatic) residues within the caseicin peptides and the effects that they have on the bacteria listed above. in order to achieve our objective, we created four derivatives of each caseicin (a1 to a4 and b1 to b4) in which specific residues were altered, and results obtained with these derivatives were compared to wild-type caseicin activity. although conversion of  cationic residues to alanine in caseicins b1 (r8a change), a1 (k2a), a2 (h3a), and a3 (k2a-h3a) generally resulted in their activity against microbial targets being reduced or unaltered, c. sakazakii dpc6440 was unusual in that it displayed enhanced sensitivity to three peptides (caseicins a1, a3, and b2) in which positively charged residues had been eliminated. while the replacement of leucine with alanine in selected variants (b3 and b4) resulted in reduced activity against a number of strains of cronobacter and, in some cases, s. typhimurium, these changes enhanced the activities of these peptides against dpc6440 and a number of s. aureus strains. it is thus apparent that the importance of specific  residues within the caseicin peptides is dependent on the strain being targeted.

TI  == resistance and tolerance to tropodithietic acid, an antimicrobial in aquaculture, is hard to select.
AB  == the antibacterial compound tropodithietic acid (tda) is produced by bacteria of the marine roseobacter clade and is thought to explain the fish probiotic properties of some roseobacters. the aim of the present study was to determine the antibacterial spectrum of tda and the likelihood of development of tda resistance. a bacterial extract containing 95% tda was effective against a range  of human-pathogenic bacteria, including both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. tda was bactericidal against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 and staphylococcus aureus nctc 12493 and killed both growing and nongrowing cells. several experimental approaches were used to select mutants resistant to tda or subpopulations of strains with enhanced tolerance to tda. no  approach (single exposures to tda extract administered via different methods, screening of a transposon library for resistant mutants, or prolonged exposure to incremental concentrations of tda) resulted in resistant or tolerant strains. after more than 300 generations exposed to sub-mic and mic concentrations of a tda-containing extract, strains tolerant to 2x the mic of tda for wild-type strains were selected, but the tolerance disappeared after one passage in medium  without tda extract. s. typhimurium mutants with nonfunctional efflux pump and porin genes had the same tda susceptibility as wild-type strains, suggesting that efflux pumps and porins are not involved in innate tolerance to tda. tda is a promising broad-spectrum antimicrobial in part due to the fact that enhanced tolerance is difficult to gain and that the tda-tolerant phenotype appears to confer only low-level resistance and is very unstable.

TI  == detection of aaca-aphd, qacedelta1, mara, flor, and teta genes from multidrug-resistant bacteria: comparative analysis of real-time multiplex pcr assays using evagreen((r)) and sybr((r)) green i dyes.
AB  == we have developed multiplex real-time pcr assays that utilize dna-intercalating dyes, sybr green i (sg) and evagreen (eg), with two primer sets (set 1=qacedelta1, teta and aaca-aphd; set 2=teta, mara, and flor) to simultaneously amplify the qacedelta1, teta, aaca-aphd, mara, and flor genes. validity of the multiplex pcr assays was confirmed by testing 83 bacterial isolates, including staphylococcus aureus (28 isolates), enterococcus spp. (17 isolates), salmonella  enterica serovar typhimurium (8 isolates), citrobacter spp. (9 isolates), escherichia coli (14 isolates) and aeromonas veronii (7 isolates), and performing sequence analysis of representative pcr products. agarose gel analysis revealed the presence of correct size pcr products, and the differences in their thermal melting (t(m)) curves were used to distinguish various pcr products. although t(m) peaks of different amplicons after eg-based singleplex and multiplex pcr assays were resolved nicely, only one or two peaks were seen for sg-bound amplicons. eg-based multiplex real-time pcr assays provided better peak resolution. there was a good correlation with a better linear relationship between the c(t) and log input dna concentration for the set 1 and set 2 genes in eg-based assays (r(eg)(2)=0.9813and0.9803) than in sg-based assays (r(sg)(2)=0.5276and0.6255). the sensitivities of detection were 2.5-25fg and 25-250fg of template dna in eg and sg-based singleplex and multiplex pcr assays,  respectively. the assays, which could be completed in less than 45min, offer sensitive and rapid detection of qacedelta1, aaca-aphd, mara, flor, and teta genes from a diverse group of multiple antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains.

TI  == extremely low frequency electromagnetic field exposure does not modulate toll-like receptor signaling in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
AB  == the effects of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (elf-emf) on human  health remain unclear. it has been reported that elf-emf may modulate the innate  immune response to microorganisms in animal models and mammalian cell-lines. with the recently gained insight in innate immune signaling and the discovery of pattern recognition, we aim to study whether elf-emf modulates innate inflammatory signaling pathways. we used human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs), isolated from blood from healthy volunteers, which we stimulated with specific tlr2 and tlr4 ligands, and with several microorganisms. the cells were subsequently exposed in b(dc)=3 mut to a highly controlled and standardized elf-emf signal (20-5000hz, b(ac)=5 mut, 30 min) and cytokine production was measured at different time points after stimulation. no significant difference in immune response, as reflected by il-1beta, il-6, tnfalpha, il-8 and il-10 production, could be detected after stimulation with lps (tlr4 ligand), pam3cys (tlr2 ligand) or a panel of heat killed microorganisms: mycobacterium tuberculosis, salmonella typhimurium, candida albicans, aspergillus fumigatus and staphylococcus aureus (multiple tlr ligands). we therefore conclude that under our experimental conditions, elf-emf does not modulate the innate immune response of human primary cells after tlr stimulation in vitro.

TI  == separation and detection of multiple pathogens in a food matrix by magnetic sers  nanoprobes.
AB  == a rapid and sensitive method was developed here for separation and detection of multiple pathogens in food matrix by magnetic surface-enhanced raman scattering (sers) nanoprobes. silica-coated magnetic probes (mnps@sio(2)) of ~100 nm in diameter were first prepared via the reverse microemulsion method using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant and tetraethyl orthosilicate as the silica precursor. the as-prepared mnps@sio(2) were functionalized with specific pathogen antibodies to first capture threat agents directly from a food  matrix followed by detection using an optical approach enabled by sers. in this scheme, pathogens were first immuno-magnetically captured with mnps@sio(2), and pathogen-specific sers probes (gold nanoparticles integrated with a raman reporter) were functionalized with corresponding antibodies to allow the formation of a sandwich assay to complete the sensor module for the detection of  multiple pathogens in selected food matrices, just changing the kinds of raman reporters on sers probes. here, up to two key pathogens, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus, were selected as a model to illustrate the probability of this scheme for multiple pathogens detection. the lowest cell concentration detected in spinach solution was 10(3) cfu/ml. a blind  test conducted in peanut butter validated the limit of detection as 10(3) cfu/ml  with high specificity, demonstrating the potential of this approach in complex matrices.

TI  == a subtractively optimized dna microarray using non-sequenced genomic probes for the detection of food-borne pathogens.
AB  == in this study, we present the successful detection of food-borne pathogens using  randomly selected non-sequenced genomic dna probes-based dna microarray chips. three food-borne pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), and bacillus cereus, were subjected for the preparation of the dna microarray probes. initially, about 50 dna probes selected randomly from non-sequenced genomic dna of each pathogen were prepared by using a set of restriction enzyme pairs. the proto-type of dna microarray chip for detecting three different pathogens simultaneously was fabricated by using those dna probes prepared for each pathogen. this proto-type  dna microarray has been tested with three target pathogens and additional seven bacteria, and successfully verified with a few cross-hybridized probes. after this primary verification of the dna microarray hybridization, this proto-type dna microarray chip was redesigned and successfully optimized by eliminating a few cross-hybridized probes. the specificity of this redesigned dna microarray chip to each pathogen was confirmed without any serious cross-hybridizations, and its multiplexing capability in its pathogen detection was found to be possible. this randomly selected non-sequenced genomic dna probes-based dna microarray was  successfully proved to be the high-throughput simultaneous detection chip for the detection of food-borne pathogens, without knowing the exact sequence information of the target bacteria. this could be the first fabrication of dna microarray chip for the simultaneous detection of different kinds of food-borne pathogens.

TI  == fates of foodborne pathogens in raw hams manufactured rapidly using a new patented method.
AB  == to manufacture raw ham in an efficient manner, we recently developed a new system in which presliced pork loin was used, and the processing time was reduced to 5%  of the conventional method. this study aimed to examine whether this raw ham could be as safe as ham produced by the conventional method. pork loin spiked with enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli serotype o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes  serotype 1/2c, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus were processed using either the new or conventional method. the fate of the foodborne pathogens and behavior of hygiene indicator bacteria were examined. whereas nitrite had disappeared during the conventional packaging process, the reduced processing time in the new system allowed for the ham to be vacuum packed with retention of the nitrite (6.9+/-1.2 ppm, p<0.01). this accounts for the prominent decrease in l. monocytogenes (2.3 log reduction in 35 days) and s. aureus (3.3 log reduction in 13 days) counts during storage. e. coli o157 and salmonella enteritidis were likely resistant to the nitrite in the ham. however,  they were unable to multiply in the ham and decreased gradually as in the conventionally produced ham. the bacteriostatic nature of the raw ham was also indicated by the gradual decrease in coliforms (1.3 log reduction in 13 days) in  nonspiked ham. in conclusion, the raw ham produced using presliced pork loin is practically as safe as conventionally produced raw ham. it is worth validating these results in a small-scale production setting.

TI  == antibacterial activity of traditional medicinal plants used by haudenosaunee peoples of new york state.
AB  == background: the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance, as well as the evolution of new strains of disease causing agents, is of great concern to the global health community. our ability to effectively treat disease is dependent on the development of new pharmaceuticals, and one potential source of novel drugs is traditional medicine. this study explores the antibacterial properties of plants used in haudenosaunee traditional medicine. we tested the hypothesis that  extracts from haudenosaunee medicinal plants used to treat symptoms often caused  by bacterial infection would show antibacterial properties in laboratory assays,  and that these extracts would be more effective against moderately virulent bacteria than less virulent bacteria. methods: after identification and harvesting, a total of 57 different aqueous extractions were made from 15 plant species. nine plant species were used in haudenosaunee medicines and six plant species, of which three are native to the region and three are introduced, were not used in traditional medicine. antibacterial activity against mostly avirulent (escherichia coli, streptococcus lactis) and moderately virulent (salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus) microbes was inferred through replicate disc  diffusion assays; and observed and statistically predicted mic values were determined through replicate serial dilution assays. results: although there was  not complete concordance between the traditional use of haudenosaunee medicinal plants and antibacterial activity, our data support the hypothesis that the selection and use of these plants to treat disease was not random. in particular, four plant species exhibited antimicrobial properties as expected (achillea millefolium, ipomoea pandurata, hieracium pilosella, and solidago canadensis), with particularly strong effectiveness against s. typhimurium. in addition, extractions from two of the introduced species (hesperis matronalis and rosa multiflora) were effective against this pathogen. conclusions: our data suggest that further screening of plants used in traditional haudenosaunee medicine is warranted, and we put forward several species for further investigation of activity against s. typhimurium (a. millefolium, h. matronalis, i. pandurata, h.  pilosella, r. multiflora, s. canadensis).

TI  == fast detection of volatile organic compounds from bacterial cultures by secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry.
AB  == we propose a novel application of secondary electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (sesi-ms) as a real-time clinical diagnostic tool for bacterial infection. it is known that volatile organic compounds (vocs), produced in different combinations and quantities by bacteria as metabolites, generate characteristic odors for certain bacteria. these vocs comprise a specific metabolic profile that can be used for species or serovar identification, but rapid and sensitive analytical methods are required for broad utility. in this study, the voc profiles of five bacterial groups from four genera, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium, and salmonella enterica serovar pullorum, were characterized by sesi-ms. thirteen compounds were identified from these bacterial cultures, and the combination of these vocs creates a unique pattern for each genus. in addition, principal component analysis (pca) was applied for the purpose of species or serovar discrimination. the first three principal components exhibit a clear separation between the metabolic volatile profiles of these five bacterial  groups that is independent of the growth medium. as a first step toward addressing the complexity of clinical application, in vitro tests for mixed cultures were conducted. the results show that individual species or serovars in  a mixed culture are identifiable among a biological voc background, and the ratios of the detected volatiles reflect the proportion of each bacterium in the  mixture. our data confirm the utility of sesi-ms in real-time identification of bacterial species or serovars in vitro, which, in the future, may play a promising clinical role in diagnosing infections.

AB  == the microbial surface ripening consortia of 49 soft cheeses were investigated with respect to their inhibition of listeria monocytogenes. when l. monocytogenes egde (serovar 1/2a) was cultivated in cell-free supernatants obtained from consortia grown for 8 h in liquid medium, a strong bactericidal activity was observed in several cases. the cell-free supernatants of 2 of these consortia (i  and ii) reduced an initial l. monocytogenes inoculum of 5 x 10(7) cfu/ml to zero  after 24 h of incubation. no inhibitory substances could be washed off the complex consortia when incubated for a 10-min period. a taxonomical analysis of the antilisterial consortia i and ii using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy yielded a considerable species diversity, with lactic acid bacteria  increasing strongly during the 8-h cultivation. therefore, 23 lactic acid bacteria bacteriocin genes were assayed using specific pcr primers, identifying 3 bacteriocin genes in both microbial communities. however, no transcription of these genes was found on cheese surfaces or in consortia propagated in liquid culture. individual lactic acid bacteria isolates of consortia i and ii displayed no or only weak inhibition of l. monocytogenes on solid medium. the complex cell-free supernatants i and ii, in contrast, exhibited an unusually broad inhibitory spectrum, killing l. monocytogenes ssp., bacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, as well as gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli dh5alpha and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. inhibition could not be abolished by heating to 100 degrees c or by proteinase k treatment. initial purification of an inhibitory substance from consortium i by solid-phase extraction and hplc indicates the presence of rather small, extremely stable compounds, which, most probably, are not bacteriocins.

TI  == development and validation of a predictive model for foodborne pathogens in ready-to-eat pork as a function of temperature and a mixture of potassium lactate and sodium diacetate.
AB  == we developed and validated secondary models that can predict growth parameters of salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus in cooked-pressed ready-to-eat (rte) pork as a function of concentrations (0 to 3%) of a commercial potassium lactate and sodium diacetate mixture (pl+sda) and temperature (10 to 30 degrees c). the primary growth data were fitted to a gompertz equation to determine the lag time (lt) and growth rate (gr). at 10 degrees c, the growth of salmonella typhimurium and s. aureus in cooked-pressed rte pork containing 2% and 3% pl+sda  was completely inhibited. the effects of temperature and concentration of pl+sda  on the growth kinetics of salmonella typhimurium and s. aureus in cooked-pressed  rte pork were modeled by response surface analysis using polynomial models of the natural logarithm transformation of both lt and gr. model performance was also evaluated by use of the prediction bias (b(f)) and accuracy (a(f)) factors, median relative error, and mean absolute relative error, as well as the acceptable prediction zone method. the results showed that lt and gr models of salmonella typhimurium and s. aureus in cooked-pressed rte pork are acceptable models. thus, both the lt and gr growth models developed herein can be used for the development of tertiary models for salmonella typhimurium and s. aureus in cooked-pressed rte pork in the matrix of conditions described in the present study.

TI  == osteomyelitis in adults: an underrecognized clinical entity in immunocompetent hosts. a report of six cases.
AB  == objective: osteomyelitis is rare in adults and typically occurs in patients with  risk factors such as sickle cell disease or immune deficiency. cases in immunocompetent adults without sickle cell disease are extremely rare. the objective of this work was to describe the epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological features and the management of long-bone osteomyelitis in immunocompetent adults without sickle cell disease. methods: we conducted a retrospective descriptive study of all immunocompetent adults without sickle cell disease who were admitted to our center between november 2002 and november 2008 for long-bone osteomyelitis. in all patients, the clinical symptoms started in adulthood, in the absence of a childhood history of osteomyelitis. results: we identified six patients meeting our inclusion criteria over the 6-year study period. the causative microorganism was methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus in four patients and salmonella in two patients (wild-type s. typhi and s. enterica, respectively). in each patient, there was a single focus of osteomyelitis and a single causative microorganism. the symptoms developed insidiously and lacked specificity. at presentation, the patients had moderate pain with or without a swelling. there was no fever initially in five patients, three of whom had major diagnostic delays as a result. treatment associated antibiotics and surgery in all patients and the initial outcome was consistently  favorable (median follow-up: 15 months; range: 8-72). conclusion: osteomyelitis can occur even in immunocompetent adults. the protracted course and atypical presentation of osteomyelitis in immunocompetent adults may lead to major diagnostic delays.

TI  == seasonal variation, chemical composition, and analgesic and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd  in southern brazil.
AB  == the seasonal variation of the chemical composition of the essential oil from fresh leaves of tetradenia riparia (hochst.) codd grown in southern brazil was analyzed by gc-ms, and the analgesic and antimicrobial activities of this oil were assayed. the yield of essential oil ranged from 0.17% to 0.26%, with the maximum amount in winter and the minimum in spring. the results obtained from principal components analysis (pca) revealed the existence of high chemical variability in the different seasons. the samples were clearly discriminated into three groups: winter, autumn, and spring-summer. samples collected during winter  contained the highest percentages of calyculone (24.70%), abietadiene (13.54%), and viridiflorol (4.20%). in autumn, the major constituents were ledol (8.74%) and cis-muurolol-5-en-4-alpha-ol (13.78%). samples collected in spring-summer contained the highest percentages of fenchone (12.67%), 14-hydroxy-9-epi-caryophyllene (24.36%), and alpha-cadinol (8.33%). oxygenated sesquiterpenes were predominant in all the samples analyzed. the observed chemovariation might be environmentally determined by a seasonal influence. the essential oil, when given orally at a dose of 200 mg/kg, exhibited good analgesic activity on acetic acid-induced writhing in mice, inhibiting the constrictions by 38.94% to 46.13%, and this effect was not affected by seasonal variation. the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil against the bacterial strains: staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, proteus  mirabilis, morganella morganii, and enterobacter cloacae, and the pathogenic fungus candida albicans was assessed by the disc diffusion method and determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration. the results obtained, followed by measurement of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), indicated  that s. aureus, b. subtilis, and candida albicans were the most sensitive microorganisms, showing largest inhibition, and the lowest mic values varied from 15.6 to 31.2 microg/ml, 7.8 to 15.6 microg/ml, and 31.2 to 62.5 microg/ml, respectively.

AB  == effective antimicrobials currently in use in europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the european congress of  clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (eccmid). as extensively discussed  in an oral session entitled worldwide dissemination of resistances by 10 specialists from across europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (roede, b.m. et al., abst o127; huenger, f. et al., abst o395; mera, r.m. et al., abst o483). while many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals  and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (derde, l. et al., abst o464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the austria center in vienna. the war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. treatments of the diseases  caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by  new research and population surveys. however, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.

TI  == enhancement of antimicrobial and antimutagenic activities of korean barberry (berberis koreana palib.) by the combined process of high-pressure extraction with probiotic fermentation.
AB  == background: to evaluate the combined effects of high pressure extraction (hpe) and probiotic fermentation on the antimicrobial and antimutagenic activities, berberis koreana was subjected to 500 mpa for 30 min and then fermented with bifidobacterium longum b6 (hpe-blf) and lactobacillus paracasei (hpe-lpf) at 37 degrees c for 6 days. results: the phenol content was significantly increased to  228 mg gae g(-1) by the hpe compared to the conventional extraction (ce, 188 mg gae g(-1)). the hpe-blf and hpe-lpf showed the highest antimicrobial activity (mic < 4 mg ml(-1)) against beta-lactam antibiotic sensitive and resistant staphylococcus aureus. no significant mutagenic effect was observed for ce, hpe,  hpe-blf, and hpe-lpf extracts. the highest antimutagenic activities against frame-shift mutant salmonella typhimurium were observed at the hpe-lpf (82%), followed by the hpe-blf (77%). conclusion: the combined hpe and fermentation process could be used as an alternative extraction method for improving the extraction efficacy of medicinal plants. the results will provide pharmaceutically useful information and potential direction for finding new drug  sources from medicinal plants.

TI  == phenothiazines, bacterial efflux pumps and targeting the macrophage for enhanced  killing of intracellular xdrtb.
AB  == phenothiazines have their primary effects on the plasma membrane of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. among the components of the prokaryotic plasma membrane affected  are efflux pumps, their energy sources, energy providing enzymes such as atpases, and genes that regulate and code for permeability aspects of the bacterium. the responses of multi-drug (mdr) and extensively drug resistant (xdr) mycobacterium  tuberculosis to the neuroleptic phenothiazine thioridazine are reviewed. the information collated suggests that this phenothiazine has the potential to cure xdr and mdr tuberculosis infections, a potential that has been recently demonstrated by its ability to cure 10 patients who presented with xdr tb infections. the mechanism by which this phenothiazine produces the desired effects within the infected macrophage is also discussed.

TI  == on-farm multi-contamination of pigs by food-borne bacterial zoonotic hazards: an  exploratory study.
AB  == application of risk analysis to control pork-borne zoonoses on farms is a major aim of the current european food safety legislation. the prevalence, levels of contamination and variations in pig contaminations according to herds and batches must therefore be studied to define relevant methods for control of zoonoses. the aims of this exploratory study were to provide information on the prevalence and  levels of infection of finisher/fattening pigs by campylobacter spp., clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica and staphylococcus aureus, and to quantify the respective effects of batches and herds. one hundred  and twenty-seven pooled fresh feces samples and 120 pooled cutaneous swab samples were tested from 37 batches in 14 farrowing-to-finishing farms. campylobacter spp. was identified in all fecal samples on farms whereas l. monocytogenes was never found. c. perfringens was identified in 48% of samples, salmonella in 2%, and s. aureus in 48%. the decomposition of variance of on-farm prevalence and levels of contamination and a general linear model showed a systematically significant effect of herd, and an effect of batch only for levels of contamination with campylobacter and c. perfringens and for prevalence of s. aureus. the contamination status of pigs seems to be mainly explained by herd status linked to poor biosecurity measures. further studies are needed to explain such correlations in order to define farm indicators for food-borne zoonotic hazards.

TI  == a multipathogen selective enrichment broth for simultaneous growth of salmonella  enterica serovar enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == a selective enrichment broth (ssl) was formulated to allow concurrent growth of 3 prominent food-borne pathogens: salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes. nalidixic acid, lithium chloride, and potassium tellurite were added as the selective agents, while sodium pyruvate and mannitol were employed as the supplemented elements. in the individual growth trial, the target pathogens were capable of growing in ssl to as high as 7-8 log(10) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml after 24 h incubation at 37  degrees c when being inoculated at 50-100 cfu/ml. in the simultaneous growth trial, the 3 combined target pathogens showed similar growth rates. the results show that ssl could support the successful simultaneous enrichment of 3 pathogens; however, ssl inhibited the growth of nontarget bacteria. in the artificial contaminated raw beef and ready-to-eat chicken, a high recovery of these 3 target pathogens was obtained in ssl. finally, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and l. monocytogenes were detected from 710 suspicious food samples by ssl with real-time pcr, and no false-positive or -negative results were reported. in summary, ssl has been shown to be a suitable broth for  the simultaneous detection of the 3 prominent food-borne pathogens by multipathogen detection on a single-assay platform.

TI  == antibacterial activity of extracts from plants of central argentina--isolation of an active principle from achyrocline satureioides.
AB  == the great increase in bacterial infections is fueling interest in the search for  antibacterial products of plant origin. extracts obtained from 51 native and naturalized plants from central argentina were therefore evaluated for their in vitro inhibitory activity on pathogenic bacteria with the aim of selecting the most active ones as new sources of effective antibiotics. the susceptibility of reference and clinical strains of enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, and staphylococcus aureus was determined. extracts from achyrocline  satureioides, flourensia oolepis, lepechinia floribunda, and lithrea molleoides were the most potent, with mic and mbc values ranging from 0.006 to 2 and 0.012 to 10 mg/ml, respectively, on both gram-positive and negative bacteria. the antibacterial activity-guided isolation of a. satureioides ethanol extract showed 23-methyl-6-o-desmethylauricepyrone (1) to be the most active compound. this compound showed inhibitory effects against gram-positive bacteria with mic and mbc values of 0.002 and 0.008 mg/ml, respectively, while on gram-negative strains, the mic and mbc were 0.062-0.250 and 0.062-0.500 mg/ml, respectively. the strong antibacterial activity shown by the four plant extracts or the compound isolated from a. satureioides suggests that they could become part of the arsenal of antibacterial drugs currently used.

TI  == functional analysis of an alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide derived from a novel mouse defensin-like gene.
AB  == gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides (amps) are an essential component of the innate immune system in many species. analysis of beta-defensin gene expression in mouse tissue using primers that were specific for conserved sequences located  outside of the beta-defensin translated region identified a novel small gene. the novel gene had an open reading frame of 114bp and encoded a predicted protein of  37 amino acid residues. a search of the genome database revealed that the gene locus and the sequence of exon 1 of this novel gene were similar to subgroup 1 mouse beta-defensins. a small peptide, k17 (fspqmlqdiiekktkil), derived from the  amino acid sequence of this novel gene was synthesized. circular dichroism (cd) spectroscopic analysis of chemically synthesized peptide demonstrated that the peptide exhibited random coil conformation in aqueous solution, but the peptide adopted helical conformation in the presence of trifluoroethanol or sodium dodecyl sulfate, a membrane-mimicking environment. the peptide exhibited bactericidal activity against salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (gram negative) and staphylococcus aureus (gram positive); it was not cytotoxic in cultures of mammalian cells or hemolytic in cultures of erythrocytes. these results suggested that k17 may be a candidate therapeutic for the treatment of bacterial infection.

AB  == the ability of the foodborne pathogens escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus to attach, colonize, and survive on stone fruit surfaces was investigated. fifty microliters of bacterial suspension was spot inoculated onto the sterile intact fructoplane of whole peaches and plums. minimum time required for initial adhesion and attachment was recorded for different surface contact times. surface colonization patterns of the four pathogens and survival under simulated commercial export conditions also were evaluated. l. monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium attached immediately to stone fruit surfaces. e. coli o157:h7 and s. aureus were visibly attached after 30 s and 1 h, respectively, of direct exposure. holding freshly harvested stone fruit at 0.5 degrees c to simulate cold storage conditions significantly lowered the titer of  e. coli o157:h7 on plums and the titers of l. monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium on stone fruit. e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes at a low inoculum level and s. aureus and salmonella typhimurium at high and low levels did not survive the simulated export chain conditions at titers that exceeded the minimum infectious dose. however, e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes were able  to survive on stone fruit surfaces when inoculated at an artificially high level. in this case, the final titer at the end of the supply chain was higher than the  infectious dose. in this laboratory experiment, e. coli o157:h7, l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and s. aureus at potential natural contamination levels were unable to survive simulated export conditions.

TI  == the cyclotide cycloviolacin o2 from viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to determine the antibacterial activity of small cyclic plant proteins, i.e. cyclotides, and the importance of the surface exposed charged residues for activity. methods: prototypic cyclotides, including the mobius kalata b1 and the bracelet cycloviolacin o2 (cyo2), were isolated using reversed-phase hplc. initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (rdas) and mic assays with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus as test strains. for  the most active peptide, cyo2, time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. charged residues in cyo2 were  chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays. results: cyo2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and e. coli in rdas and mic assays, while the other peptides were less active. in time-kill assays, cyo2 also had bactericidal  activity against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas  aeruginosa. in contrast, none of the cyclotides had high activity against s. aureus. chemical masking of the charged glu and lys residues in cyo2 caused a near total loss of activity against salmonella, while masking arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction. conclusions: cyo2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the charged residues in cyo2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. in combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides, cyo2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.

AB  == background: in this study the antimicrobial effectiveness of oregano and sage essential oils (eos) incorporated into two different matrices, whey protein isolate (wpi) and cellulose-based filter paper, was analysed. results: antimicrobial properties of wpi-based films containing oregano and sage eos were  tested against listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis. oregano eo showed antimicrobial activity against all three micro-organisms. the highest inhibition zones were against l. innocua. however, sage eo did not show antimicrobial activity against any of the micro-organisms. antimicrobial activity was confirmed for both eos using cellulose-based filter paper as supporting matrix, although it was significantly more intense for oregano eo. inhibition surfaces were significantly greater when compared with those of the wpi films. this finding is likely due to the higher porosity and diffusivity of the active compounds in the filter paper. conclusion: the interactions between the eos and the films have a critical effect on the diffusivity of the active compounds and therefore on the final antimicrobial activity. as a result, to obtain active edible films, it is necessary to find the equilibrium point between the nature and concentration of the active compounds in the eo and the formulation of the film.

AB  == in this study, an effective substance was isolated from bacillus subtilis sc-8, which was obtained from traditionally fermented soybean paste, cheonggukjang. the substance was purified by hplc, and its properties were analyzed. it had an adequate antagonistic effect on bacilluscereus, and its spectrum of activity was  narrow. when tested on several gram-negative and gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as salmonella enterica, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes, no antagonistic effect was observed. applying the derivative from b. subtilis sc-8 within the same genus did not inhibit the growth of major soybean-fermenting bacteria such as bacillus subtilis, bacillus licheniformis, and bacillus amyloquefaciens. the range of ph stability of the purified antagonistic substance was wide (from 4.0 to >10.0), and the substance was thermally stable up to 60 degrees c. in the various enzyme  treatments, the antagonistic activity of the purified substance was reduced with  proteinase k, protease, and lipase; its activity was partially destroyed with esterase. spores of b. cereus did not grow at all in the presence of 5mug/ml of the purified antagonistic substance. the isolated antagonistic substance was thought to be an antibiotic-like lipopeptidal compound and was tentatively named  bsap-254 because it absorbed to uv radiation at 254nm.

TI  == optical imaging of bacterial infection in living mice using deep-red fluorescent  squaraine rotaxane probes.
AB  == two structurally related fluorescent imaging probes allow optical imaging of bacterial leg infection models in living athymic and immunocompetent mice. structurally, the probes are comprised of a deep-red fluorescent squaraine rotaxane scaffold with two appended bis(zinc(ii)-dicolylamine) (bis(zn-dpa)) targeting ligands. the bis(zn-dpa) ligands have high affinity for the anionic phospholipids and related biomolecules that reside within the bacterial envelope, and they are known to selectively target bacterial cells over the nearly uncharged membrane surfaces of healthy mammalian cells. planar, whole-animal optical imaging studies showed that intravenous dosing of either probe (10 nmol)  allowed imaging of localized infections of gram-positive staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. high selectivity for the infected target leg (t) over the contralateral nontarget leg (nt) was reflected by t/nt ratios up to six. the infection imaging signal was independent  of mouse humoral immune status, and there was essentially no targeting at a site  of sterile inflammation induced by injection of lambda-carrageenan. furthermore,  the fluorescent probe imaging signal colocalized with the bioluminescence signal  from a genetically engineered strain of s. enterica serovar typhimurium. although not highly sensitive (the localized infection must contain at least approximately 10(6) colony forming units for fluorescence visualization), the probes are remarkably selective for bacterial cells considering their low molecular weight (<1.5 kda) and simple structural design. the more hydrophilic of the two probes produced a higher t/nt ratio in the early stages of the imaging experiment and washed out more rapidly from the blood clearance organs (liver, kidney). therefore, it is best suited for longitudinal studies that require repeated dosing and imaging of the same animal. the results indicate that fluorescent probes based on squaraine rotaxanes should be broadly useful for in vivo animal imaging studies, and they further validate the ability of imaging probes with bis(zn-dpa) ligands to selectively target bacterial infections in living animals.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of polyphenols extracted from almond skins.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from natural and blanched almond skins, the latter being a by-product from the almond processing industry. methods and results: almond skin extracts were tested against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, serratia marcescens), gram-positive bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus hirae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus  durans) and the yeast candida albicans. almond skin fractions were found to have  antimicrobial activity against l. monocytogenes and staph. aureus in the range 250-500 microg ml(-1), natural skins showing antimicrobial potential against the  gram-negative salm. enterica. the interactions between three almond skin flavonoids were also evaluated with isobolograms. conclusions: pairwise combinations of protocatechuic acid, naringenin and epicatechin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions against salm. enterica and staph. aureus. antagonism was observed against l. monocytogenes with all combinations tested. further studies need to be performed to understand the mechanisms responsible for these interactions. significance and impact of the study: almond  skins are a potential source of natural antimicrobials.

AB  == aim: to study the effects of sea microalgae exometabolites on reproduction of pathogenic bacteria. materials and methods: experiments were performed with unialgal cultures of sea microalgae phaeodactylum tricornutum, chlorella minutissima, chroomonas salina. strains of lysteria monocytogenes 4b, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium with typical cultural, morphologic, biochemical and antigenic characteristics were used as model bacteria. cultivation of microalgae was performed in synthetic and natural sea water (salinity 32 per thousand). the algae were grown on modified goldberg medium. natural sea water was taken in different seasons of year. exometabolites were obtained by extraction from microalgae cultural fluid with solvents in the order  of increase of their polarity (hexane, benzol, ethyl acetate) as appropriate fractions (hf, bf, eaf). results: obtained fractions of exometabolites of sea microalgae cultivated in synthetic sea water influenced weakly on the reproduction of pathogenic bacteria, which differed depending on type of both microalga and microorganism. however eaf fraction of exometabolites of p. tricornutum obtained during its cultivation in natural sea water (especially obtained in summer time) significantly stimulated growth of all tested microorganisms. conclusion: it is possible that stimulation of growth of pathogenic bacteria could be caused by either changes of medium composition (and, consequently, appearance of other metabolites than in synthetic sea water) or enhancement of effect of microalgae's own metabolites by metabolites of natural sea water, in which plenty organic compounds produced by numerous sea inhabitants exist.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy using a highly pure chlorin e6.

TI  == precursor processing of human defensin-5 is essential to the multiple functions in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == human defensin-5 (hd-5) is one of the major antimicrobial peptides secreted by paneth cells in the human small intestine. hd-5 is produced and stored as a propeptide in paneth cell granules, secreted in response to stimulation by cholinergic reagents or bacterial antigens. the activation process by trypsin occurs in the intestinal lumen to produce mature hd-5. this study evaluated the difference between prohd-5 and mature hd-5 in bactericidal activity and induction of chemokine secretion in vitro. mature hd-5 showed bactericidal activities against all bacterial strains. though, prohd-5 without enzymatic cleavage possessed less antimicrobial ability against salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli but not against staphylococcus aureus. mature hd-5 also induced  intestinal epithelial cells to increase the protein and mrna levels of interleukin-8. furthermore, the peptides were applied to dextran sulfate sodium-induced mouse colitis. the expression of endogenous mouse defensins was not changed in the small intestine, and the additional injection of exogenous hd-5 improved mortality (p < 0.05). this study demonstrated the multifunctional roles of the activation process in human defensin and the possibility of using antimicrobial peptides for the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases in future applications.

TI  == the growth and survival of food-borne pathogens in sweet and fermenting brewers'  wort.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the factors affecting the survival and growth of four food-borne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) in sweet and fermenting brewery wort. the gram-negative pathogens (e. coli and salm. typhimurium) were capable of growth during the initial stages of fermentation in  hopped wort, although they were quickly inactivated when added during the later stages of fermentation. when the wort was left unpitched, the two gram-negative pathogens grew unabated. pathogen growth and survival was enhanced as the ph was  increased, and as both the ethanol and original gravity were decreased. although  having no effect on the gram-negative pathogens, low levels of hop iso-alpha-acids were sufficient to inhibit l. monocytogenes, and a synergistic antimicrobial effect between iso-alpha-acids and ph was observed. s. aureus failed to initiate growth in all of the test worts. there appears to be no reason for concern of the safety of a "typical" wort during fermentation, however due attention should be paid when wort is stored or antimicrobial hurdles are lowered, for example in the production of reduced and alcohol-free beer, and in unpasteurised products.

AB  == cereal doughs are an important part of human diet, but at the same time can act as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogenic bacteria. in the present study, four pathogenic or toxinogenic bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated in a dough made from corn flour in combination with the single antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol (2npoh). survival of single and mixed populations in the treated doughs incubated at 37 degrees c was followed by culture-dependent and independent methods (ttge). all strains were completely inactivated within 24 h by the tested compounds at 5% final concentration, but showed variable inhibition at lower concentrations of 0.5% and 2%. sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds was in general modified when strains were tested in cocultures compared with single cultures. b. cereus was more sensitive to carvacrol (minimum bactericidal concentration, mbc, 0.5%) in coculture with s. aureus. it was also more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with  s. aureus and with s. enterica (mbc, 2% in both cases). s. aureus was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with b. cereus, e. coli, as well as s. enterica. however, sensitivity to 2npoh was not modified in any of the coculture experiments (mbc, 2%). e. coli was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with s. aureus and with s. enterica. resistance of e. coli to 2npoh also increased in cocultures with b. cereus (mbc, 5%) and with s. aureus (mbc, 2%), but not with s. enterica (mbc, 0.5%). s. enterica was more resistant to carvacrol (mbc, 5%) in cocultures with e. coli, but it was more sensitive to 2npoh in cocultures with b. cereus as well as with s. aureus (mbc, 2% in both cases). ttge analysis of survivors from cocultures treated with 2npoh or carvacrol allowed a good estimation of the identity of survivors according to their dna band patterns. results from this study indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobials such as carvacrol and 2npoh is greatly influenced by the complexity of the microbial populations under target and the relationships between individual populations.

TI  == a pilot study of the microbiological quality of culturally diverse, ready-to-eat  foods from selected retail establishments in melbourne, australia.
AB  == in recent years, there has been an increasing number of foodborne outbreaks linked to the consumption of culturally diverse foods. this appears to be because of the increasing quantity of culturally diverse foods available and a preference to store these foods, some of which are considered potentially hazardous, at ambient temperature. this practice may contravene temperature requirements defined by the food standards code. a lack of understanding of the hazardous nature of some culturally prepared foods also poses difficulties in applying the  australian food safety legislation by regulators. this pilot study examined the normal microbiota of four culturally diverse foods: nem chua, che dau trang, kueh talam, and banh tet nhan man, which are traditionally stored and consumed at ambient temperature. challenge testing was conducted to investigate the ability of these foods to support the growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens. two of the products (kueh talam and che dau) were found to be microbiologically unsatisfactory because of the high standard plate counts. challenge testing indicated that kueh talam, che dau, and banh tet nhan man were able to support the growth of bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella (1-2 log increases over 6 hours at 25 degrees c), suggesting that these foods may require temperature control during storage. however, nem chua was unable to support the growth of test bacteria, probably because of its acidic nature (ph 4.5), suggesting that ambient storage of this food may be safe. this study provided some preliminary evidence to support the need for further sampling and challenge testing of these products.

AB  == inhibition of bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial receptors by the consumption of natural food components is an attractive strategy for the prevention of microbial related gastrointestinal illness. we hypothesised that muc1, a highly glycosylated mucin present in cows' milk, may be one such food component. purified bovine muc1 was tested for its ability to inhibit binding of  common enteric bacterial pathogens to caco-2 cells grown in vitro. muc1 caused dose-dependent binding inhibition of escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium), staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis. this inhibition was more pronounced for the gram negative compared with gram positive bacteria. it was also demonstrated that muc1, immobilised on a membrane, bound all these bacterial species in a dose-dependent manner, although  there was greater interaction with the gram negative bacteria. a range of monosaccharides, representative of the muc1 oligosaccharide composition, were tested for their ability to prevent binding of e. coli and s. typhimurium to caco-2 cells. inhibition was structure dependent with sialic acid, l(-) fucose and d(+) mannose significantly inhibiting binding of both gram negative species.  n-acetylglucosamine and n-acetylgalactosamine significantly inhibited binding of  e. coli whilst galactose, one of the most abundant muc1 monosaccharides, showed the strongest inhibition against s. typhimurium. treatment with sialidase significantly decreased the inhibitory properties of muc1, demonstrating the importance of sialic acid in adhesion inhibition. it is concluded that bovine muc1 prevents binding of bacteria to human intestinal cells and may have a role in preventing the binding of common enteropathogenic bacteria to human intestinal epithelial surfaces.

TI  == development of a dna microarray to detect antimicrobial resistance genes identified in the national center for biotechnology information database.
AB  == to understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (ar), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. to achieve this, ar genes in the national center for biotechnology information genbank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. a dna microarray was constructed of 70mer  oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. the microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of salmonella enterica: typhimurium lt2 (sensitive) and typhi ct18 (multidrug resistance [mdr]). all resistance genes encoded on the mdr  plasmid, phcm1, harbored by ct18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in lt2. the microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including mdr salmonella enterica serovars, escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, listeria spp., and clostridium difficile. the results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all ar genes found in the national center for biotechnology information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.

TI  == improving the aoac use-dilution method by establishing a minimum log density value for test microbes on inoculated carriers.
AB  == the aoac use-dilution methods, 955.14 (salmonella enterica), 955.15 (staphylococcus aureus), and 964.02 (pseudomonas aeruginosa), are used to measure the efficacy of disinfectants on hard inanimate surfaces. the methods do not provide procedures to assess log density of the test microbe on inoculated penicylinders (carrier counts). without a method to measure and monitor carrier counts, the associated efficacy data may not be reliable and repeatable. this report provides a standardized procedure to address this method deficiency. based on carrier count data collected by four laboratories over an 8 year period, a minimum log density value is proposed to qualify the test results. carrier count  data were collected concurrently with 242 use-dilution tests. the tests were conducted on products bearing claims against p. aeruginosa and s. aureus with and without an organic soil load (osl) added to the inoculum (as specified on the product label claim). six carriers were assayed per test for a total of 1452 carriers. all 242 mean log densities were at least 6.0 (geometric mean of 1.0 x 10(6) cfu/carrier). the mean log densities did not exceed 7.5 (geometric mean of  3.2 x 10(7) cfu/carrier). for all microbes and osl treatments, the mean log density (+/- sem) was 6.7 (+/- 0.07) per carrier (a geometric mean of 5.39 x 10(6) cfu/carrier). the mean log density for six carriers per test showed good repeatability (0.29) and reproducibility (0.32). a minimum mean log density of 6.0 is proposed as a validity requirement for s. aureus and p. aeruginosa. the minimum level provides for the potential inherent variability that may be experienced by a wide range of laboratories and the slight effect due to the addition of an osl. a follow-up report is planned to present data to support the  carrier count procedure and carrier counts for s. enterica.

TI  == infective endocarditis caused by salmonella enteritidis in a dialysis patient: a  case report and literature review.
AB  == background: infective endocarditis is significantly more common in haemodialysis  patients as compared with the general population, the causative pathogen is generally staphylococcus aureus; there have been no previously reported cases of  infective endocarditis caused by a salmonella species in haemodialysis patients.  case presentation: we report the case of a 68 year-old woman on haemodialysis who developed infective endocarditis as a result of salmonella enteritidis. although  we treated the patient with ceftriaxone combined with ciprofloxacin, infective endocarditis was not detected early enough and unfortunately developed into cerebral septic emboli, which ultimately resulted in death. conclusion: although  there are several reports that salmonella endocarditis without cardiac failure can be successfully treated with antibiotics alone, early surgical intervention is essential for some cases to prevent life-threatening complications. transesophageal echocardiography should be performed in any patient with high clinical suspicion of infective endocarditis. to the best of our knowledge, this  is the first case-report of salmonella endocarditis in a haemodialysis patient.

TI  == synergistic antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity of temporin a and modified temporin b in vivo.
AB  == temporins are antimicrobial peptides secreted by the granular glands of the european red frog (rana temporaria). they are 10-14 amino acid long polypeptides  active prevalently against gram positive bacteria. this study shows that a synthetic temporin b analogue (tb-yk), acquires the capacity to act in synergism  with temporin a and to exert antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity in vivo against gram positive and gram negative bacteria. administration of 3.4 mg/kg of  temporin a (ta)+1.6 mg/kg tb-yk, given to individual mice concurrently with a lethal dose of bacteria (gram positive or negative), rescued 100% of the animals. more importantly, the same doses of temporins, administered one week after experimental infection with a sub lethal dose of bacteria, sterilized 100% of the animals within 3-6 days. also, it is described an animal model based on the use of sub lethal doses of bacteria, which closely mimics bacterial infection in humans. the model offers the possibility to test in a preclinical setting the true potential of ta and tb-yk in combination as antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory agents.

TI  == integration of microfiltration and anion-exchange nanoparticles-based magnetic separation with maldi mass spectrometry for bacterial analysis.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms) is powerful in characterizing and identifying bacterial isolates. however, sufficient quantities of bacterial cells are required for generating maldi mass spectra and a procedure to isolate and enrich target bacteria from sample matrix  prior to maldi-ms analysis is often necessary. in this paper, anion-exchange superparamagnetic nanoparticles (nps), i.e., fluidmag-deae and fluidmag-q, were employed to capture aeromonas, salmonella, pseudomonas, enterococcus, bacillus, staphylococcus and escherichia coli from aqueous solutions and fresh water. the magnetically isolated bacteria were then characterized by whole cell maldi-ms. the capture efficiency was found to be dependent on bacterial species, medium ph, the functional group and concentration of the nps. the experimental results demonstrated that fluidmag-deae and fluidmag-q were broad spectrum probes for bacteria. furthermore, both dead and live bacteria could be captured by the nps,  and the live bacteria captured remained viable. membrane filtration prior to the  magnetic isolation could increase enrichment factor and eliminate potential matrix interference. a detection limit of 1 x 10(3)cfu/ml was achieved for the bacteria spiked in tap water and reservoir water, and the analytical time was around 2h.

TI  == the structure of a cytolytic alpha-helical toxin pore reveals its assembly mechanism.
AB  == pore-forming toxins (pfts) are a class of potent virulence factors that convert from a soluble form to a membrane-integrated pore. they exhibit their toxic effect either by destruction of the membrane permeability barrier or by delivery  of toxic components through the pores. among the group of bacterial pfts are some of the most dangerous toxins, such as diphtheria and anthrax toxin. examples of eukaryotic pfts are perforin and the membrane-attack complex, proteins of the immune system. pfts can be subdivided into two classes, alpha-pfts and beta-pfts, depending on the suspected mode of membrane integration, either by alpha-helical  or beta-sheet elements. the only high-resolution structure of a transmembrane pft pore is available for a beta-pft--alpha-haemolysin from staphylococcus aureus. cytolysin a (clya, also known as hlye), an alpha-pft, is a cytolytic -helical toxin responsible for the haemolytic phenotype of several escherichia coli and salmonella enterica strains. clya is cytotoxic towards cultured mammalian cells,  induces apoptosis of macrophages and promotes tissue pervasion. electron microscopic reconstructions demonstrated that the soluble monomer of clya must undergo large conformational changes to form the transmembrane pore. here we report the 3.3 a crystal structure of the 400 kda dodecameric transmembrane pore  formed by clya. the tertiary structure of clya protomers in the pore is substantially different from that in the soluble monomer. the conversion involves more than half of all residues. it results in large rearrangements, up to 140 a,  of parts of the monomer, reorganization of the hydrophobic core, and transitions  of -sheets and loop regions to -helices. the large extent of interdependent conformational changes indicates a sequential mechanism for membrane insertion and pore formation.

TI  == [active efflux as the multidrug resistance mechanism].
AB  == active efflux is a common resistance mechanism in a wide range of bacterial pathogens. it is responsible for the transport of such toxic compounds as drugs,  toxins, and detergents. pumps with broad substrate profiles promote the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens that are a particular threat to contemporary medicine, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella enterica sv typhimurium. one can distinguish five major class of transport systems on the basis of their structure and function: mfs (major facilitator superfamily), smr (small multidrug-resistance family), mate (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family), abc (atp binding cassette superfamily), and rnd (resistance nodulation cell division family). substrate transport may include hydrogen proton exchange or energy generated via atp hydrolysis. the transport is effectively regulated by local regulatory proteins.such as bmrr from bacillus subtilis, or by the global bacterial regulatory system. investigations into efflux pumps and their substrate profiles and regulatory mechanisms have led to the discovery of new therapeutics  and pump inhibitors that could potentially become alternative and effective antimicrobial drugs. additionally, some alternative therapies such as photodynamic inactivation could be more effective if the synergistic action of efflux pump inhibitors are used.thus research into efflux transport systems seems to be an important element of contemporary medicine .

AB  == aims: microbial contamination of powdered infant formula (pif) is known to cause  gastrointestinal infections in infants. of concern is intrinsic contamination of  the formula with (for example) salmonella enterica as well as extrinsic contamination from inappropriate handling or ineffective disinfection. the aim of this study was to evaluate organic and microbial contamination of 'in-use' bottles used for feeding infants powdered formula milk in south wales, uk. methods: to establish baseline contamination levels of 'in-use' bottles, 75 'uncleaned' and 150 'cleaned and ready to re-use' bottles used for feeding infants pif were analyzed. the microbiological analysis included aerobic colony counts (accs), presence/absence and counts of enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus. the level of residual adenosine tri-phosphate (atp) was determined as an indicator of organic soiling. all bottles were sampled in four sites; inner screwcap, bottle interior; bottle outer rim and teat interior. results: microbial counts up to 10(5)/area were sampled and atp levels up to 100,051 relative light units (rlus) were obtained from 'uncleaned' bottles. findings varied according to bottle site. enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from 12-15% of 'unclean' bottles/components (up to 10(2) cfu/area sampled) and contamination was most frequently detected from the screw cap and teat interiors. data indicated that after use, prior to cleaning, considerable microbial and organic soil remained in the cumulative bottles. of the ready-to-use bottles reportedly cleaned and disinfected, some had accs up to  5.8 x 10(4) cfu/area sampled. staphylococcus aureus was detected from 4% bottles/components but no enterobacteriaceae were detected. conclusions: cumulatively, findings indicate the presence of organic soiling and the potential for survival of bacteria between infant feeds. there is a need for effective education on effective bottle decontamination procedures. this may be achieved by using an audience-centred approach to re-enforce messages to parents and caregivers to implement good hygiene practices, effectively wash and rinse items  before disinfection and follow manufacturers' guidelines for disinfection.

TI  == selection of lactic acid bacteria from fermented plant beverages to use as inoculants for improving the quality of the finished product.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) from fermented plant beverages were selected based on  their antibacterial actions against potential food borne pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus psscmi 0004, escherichia coli psscmi 0001, salmonella typhimurium psscmi 0034 and vibrio parahaemolyticus vp 4). antibacterial activities were measured using an agar spot method. the lactobacillus plantarum w90a strain isolated from a wild forest noni (morinda coreia ham) beverage was used as an inoculant. three different inoculation procedures were conducted with  the fruit of wild forest noni fermentations to establish which one was the best for controlling the numbers of yeast in the finished product. a 5% inoculum of l. plantarum w90a (lab set), initial cell density 8.6 log cfu ml(-1), produced a better product and inhibitory properties against the test organisms, particularly e. coli psscmi 0001 than one with no inoculum or with a 5% inoculum from a previous natural fermented product. an lab inoculum resulted in a reduced total bacterial count and no yeast throughout fermentation period (90 days). the lower  yeast resulted in a reduction of the ethanol content to 2.9 g l(-1) compared to 12.2 g l(-1) inthe culture with no inoculum. the highest acidity (1.3-1.4%) with  the same ph (3.3) was observed in both sets of inoculated fermentations, whereas  the uninoculated set gave a ph value of 3.7 (1.2% acidity).

TI  == quorum sensing in veterinary pathogens: mechanisms, clinical importance and future perspectives.
AB  == under certain circumstances the individuals of a bacterial population may find advantages in acting together and making "collective decisions". this phenomenon  is better known as quorum sensing. when the concentration of signal molecules produced by the surrounding bacteria exceeds a certain threshold, the bacterial population acts as a single organism, collectively expressing virulence genes, biofilm forming genes, etc. several mechanisms of quorum sensing are discussed, each with its distinct signal molecules and respective receptors. some of these mechanisms are restricted to sensing intraspecies signalling, but interspecies and even interkingdom signalling have also been described. several veterinary pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus pseudintermedius, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium use quorum sensing as a means to optimize virulence gene expression and host colonization. therefore, targeting of the qs mechanisms may provide a novel strategy for combating bacterial infections, also in veterinary medicine.

TI  == bacterial particle endocytosis by epithelial cells is selective and enhanced by tumor necrosis factor receptor ligands.
AB  == bacterial pathogens use virulence strategies to invade epithelial barriers, but active processes of epithelial cells may also contribute to the endocytosis of microbial particles. to focus on the latter, we studied the uptake of fixed and fluorescently labeled bacterial particles in intestinal and bronchoepithelial cell cultures and found it to be enhanced in caco-2bbe and nci-h292 cells after treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha and an agonist antibody against the lymphotoxin beta receptor. confocal fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, and  transmission electron microscopy revealed that staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica were readily endocytosed, although there was scant uptake of shigella sonnei, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and klebsiella pneumoniae particles. endocytosed staphylococcus was often associated with cytoplasmic claudin-4 vesicles; this was not found for yersinia, suggesting that  cytokine treatment upregulated two distinct endocytosis pathways. interestingly,  when staphylococcus and yersinia were coincubated with epithelial monolayers, the cells were unlikely to take up yersinia unless they had also endocytosed large numbers of staphylococcus particles, although the two bacteria were apparently processed in distinct compartments. cytokine treatment induced an upregulation and redistribution of beta1 integrin to the apical surface of nci-h292 cells; consistent with this effect, treatment with anti-beta1 integrin antibody blocked  uptake of both yersinia and staphylococcus in nci-h292 and caco-2bbe cells. our results suggest that capture of bacterial particles by mucosal epithelial cells is selective and that different endocytic mechanisms are enhanced by proinflammatory cytokines.

TI  == reduction in infection risk through treatment of microbially contaminated surfaces with a novel, portable, saturated steam vapor disinfection system.
AB  == background: surface-mediated infectious disease transmission is a major concern in various settings, including schools, hospitals, and food-processing facilities. chemical disinfectants are frequently used to reduce contamination, but many pose significant risks to humans, surfaces, and the environment, and all must be properly applied in strict accordance with label instructions to be effective. this study set out to determine the capability of a novel chemical-free, saturated steam vapor disinfection system to kill microorganisms,  reduce surface-mediated infection risks, and serve as an alternative to chemical  disinfectants. methods: high concentrations of escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), salmonella enterica, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, ms2 coliphage (used as a surrogate for nonenveloped viruses including norovirus), candida albicans, aspergillus niger, and the endospores of clostridium difficile were dried individually onto porous clay test surfaces. surfaces were treated with the saturated steam vapor disinfection system for brief periods and then numbers of surviving microorganisms were determined. infection risks were calculated from the kill-time data using microbial dose-response relationships published in the scientific literature, accounting for surface-to-hand and hand-to-mouth transfer efficiencies. results:  a diverse assortment of pathogenic microorganisms was rapidly killed by the steam disinfection system; all of the pathogens tested were completely inactivated within 5 seconds. risks of infection from the contaminated surfaces decreased rapidly with increasing periods of treatment by the saturated steam vapor disinfection system. conclusions: the saturated steam vapor disinfection system tested for this study is chemical-free, broadly active, rapidly efficacious, and  therefore represents a novel alternative to liquid chemical disinfectants.

AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == antibacterial terpenes from the oleo-resin of commiphora molmol (engl.).
AB  == two octanordammaranes, mansumbinone (1) and 3,4-seco-mansumbinoic acid (2), and two sesquiterpenes, beta-elemene (3) and t-cadinol (4) have been isolated from the oleo-resin of commiphora molmol (engl.). the structures of these compounds were established unambiguously by a series of 1d and 2d-nmr analyses. we have also unambiguously assigned all (1)h and (13)c nmr resonances for 2 and revised its (13)c data. the crude extract of the oleo-resin of c. molmol displayed potentiation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline against s. aureus, several salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains and two k. pneumoniae strains. the antibacterial activity of terpenes 1-4 was determined against a number of staphylococcus aureus strains: sa1199b, atcc25923, xu212, rn4220 and emrsa15 and  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values were found to be in the range of 4-256 microg/ml. the highest activity was observed by the seco-a-ring octanordammarane 2 with an mic of 4 microg/ml against sa1199b, a multidrug-resistant strain which over-expresses the nora efflux transporter, the  major characterized antibiotic pump in this species. this activity compared favorably to the antibiotic norfloxacin with an mic of 32 microg/ml. compound 2 also displayed weak potentiation of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline activity against strains of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 and l10.

TI  == attachment of ampicillin to expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene): surface reactions leading to inhibition of microbial growth.
AB  == the broad spectrum antibiotic, ampicillin (am), was reacted to expanded poly (tetrafluoroethylene) (eptfe) surfaces and resulted in the formation of antimicrobial surfaces effective against gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus thuringiensis, and enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative, escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, and salmonella enterica bacteria. these eptfe surface modifications were accomplished by utilization of microwave maleic anhydride (ma) plasma reactions leading to the formation of acid groups, followed by amidation reactions of heterofunctional nh 2/cooh-terminated polyethylene glycol (peg). the final step, the attachment of am to the peg spacer, was achieved by amidation reactions between cooh-terminated peg and nh 2 groups of am. this approach protects the cooh-am functionality and diminishes the possibility of hydrolysis of the antimicrobial active portion of am. these studies also show that approximately 90% of am molecules are still covalently attached to peg-ma-eptfe surfaces after exposure to the bacteria solutions. even after a 24 h period, the  am volume concentration changes only from 2.25 to 2.04 microg/m3, and depending upon the bacteria type, the bacteria suspensions containing am-peg-ma-eptfe specimens retain 85-99% of their initial optical density.

TI  == copper and quaternary ammonium cations exert synergistic bactericidal and antibiofilm activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == biofilms are slimy aggregates of microbes that are likely responsible for many chronic infections as well as for contamination of clinical and industrial environments. pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent hospital pathogen that is well known for its ability to form biofilms that are recalcitrant to many different antimicrobial treatments. we have devised a high-throughput method for  testing combinations of antimicrobials for synergistic activity against biofilms, including those formed by p. aeruginosa. this approach was used to look for changes in biofilm susceptibility to various biocides when these agents were combined with metal ions. this process identified that cu(2+) works synergistically with quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs; specifically benzalkonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, myristalkonium chloride, and polycide) to kill p. aeruginosa biofilms. in some cases, adding cu(2+) to qacs resulted in a 128-fold decrease in the biofilm minimum bactericidal concentration compared to that for single-agent treatments.  in combination, these agents retained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that  also eradicated biofilms of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serovar cholerasuis, and pseudomonas fluorescens. to investigate the mechanism of action, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to show that cu(2+) and qacs do not interact in aqueous solutions, suggesting that each agent  exerts microbiological toxicity through independent biochemical routes. additionally, cu(2+) and qacs, both alone and in combination, reduced the activity of nitrate reductases, which are enzymes that are important for normal biofilm growth. collectively, the results of this study indicate that cu(2+) and  qacs are effective combinations of antimicrobials that may be used to kill bacterial biofilms.

TI  == probing structure-activity relationships in bactericidal peptide betapep-25.
AB  == cationic peptides, known to disrupt bacterial membranes, are being developed as promising agents for therapeutic intervention against infectious disease. in the  present study, we investigate structure-activity relationships in the bacterial membrane disruptor betapep-25, a peptide 33-mer. for insight into which amino acid residues are functionally important, we synthesized alanine-scanning variants of betapep-25 and assessed their ability to kill bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus) and to neutralize lps (lipopolysaccharide). activity profiles were found to vary with the bacterial strain examined. specific cationic and smaller hydrophobic alkyl residues were crucial to optimal bactericidal activity against the gram-negative bacteria, whereas larger hydrophobic and cationic residues mediated optimal activity against gram-positive staph. aureus. lysine-substituted norleucine (n-butyl group) variants demonstrated that both charge and alkyl chain length mediate optimal activity. in terms of lps neutralization, activity profiles were essentially the same against four species of lps (e. coli 055 and 0111, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae), and different for two others (ps. aeruginosa and serratia marcescens), with specific  hydrophobic, cationic and, surprisingly, anionic residues being functionally important. furthermore, disulfide-bridged analogues demonstrated that an anti parallel beta-sheet structure is the bioactive conformation of betapep-25 in terms of its bactericidal, but not lps endotoxin neutralizing, activity. moreover, betapep-25 variants, like the parent peptide, do not lyse eukaryotic cells. this research contributes to the development and design of novel antibiotics.

TI  == characterization of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated from kefir grains: potential use as probiotic.
AB  == considering that several health promoting properties are associated with kefir consumption and a reliable probiotic product requires a complete identification of the bacterial species, the present work evaluates several proved markers of probiotic potential of eleven isolates of homofermentative lactobacilli isolated  from kefir grains and molecular identification and genotypic diversity. using restriction analysis of amplified ribosomal dna (ardra) and analysis of the 16s-23s rrna internal spacer region we confirmed that all homofermentative lactobacilli belong to the species lactobacillus plantarum. rapd-pcr analysis allowed the discrimination of lactobacilli in five clusters. all isolates exhibited high resistance to bile salt. high survival after one hour of exposure  to ph 2.5 was observed in lb. plantarum cidca 8313, 83210, 8327 and 8338. all isolates were hydrophilic and non autoaggregative. isolate cidca 8337 showed the  highest percentage of adhesion among strains. all tested lactobacilli had strong  inhibitory power against salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. seven out of eleven isolates showed inhibition against sal. enterica and five isolates were effective against sal. gallinarum. only cidca 8323 and cidca 8327 were able to inhibit sal. sonnei. we did not find any correlation between the five clusters based on rapd-pcr and the probiotic properties, suggesting that these isolates have unique characteristics.

TI  == the potential influence of fruit polyphenols on colonic microflora and human gut  health.
AB  == the effect of common dietary polyphenols on growth of human gut bacteria and their adhesion to enterocytes was investigated. the influence on the growth of a  probiotic (lactobacillus rhamnosus), a commensal (escherichia coli) and two pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium) was determined, together with effects on adhesion of pathogenic and probiotic bacteria to cultured caco-2 cells. all polyphenols, except rutin, were found to affect the viability of representative gut flora in vitro, at doses likely to be  present in the gastrointestinal tract, but to differing degrees. naringenin and quercetin were the most active with the lowest minimum inhibitory concentrations  for all the four bacteria tested. the remaining polyphenols had the most marked effect on the gram positive enteropathogen s. aureus. naringenin and phloridzin were the most effective inhibitors of s. typhimurium adherence to caco-2 enterocytes while phloridzin and rutin enhanced the adherence of the probiotic l. rhamnosus. polyphenols appear to have potential to alter gut microecology and, by affecting the total number of beneficial microflora in the gut, may confer positive gut health benefits.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == statin (cerivastatin) protects mice against sepsis-related death via reduced proinflammatory cytokines and enhanced bacterial clearance.
AB  == background: death attributable to septic shock syndrome depends highly on the inflammatory response and cytokine production. inhibition of inflammation is one  of the many pleiotropic effects of statins. the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that statins have a role in altering the host response to bacterial infections and thus would prove beneficial in the prevention of microbial sepsis. methods: male c57bl/6 and c3h/hen mice received cerivastatin (4 mg/kg) or phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) intraperitoneally (i.p.), 24 and 1 h before and 24, 48, and 72 h after bacterial challenges. sepsis was induced by i.p. injection of lipopolysaccharide (lps) (45 mg/kg), staphylococcus aureus (5 x 10(7) colony-forming units [cfu]/mouse), or salmonella typhimurium (2.5 x 10(6) cfu/mouse). results: administration of cerivastatin improved significantly the survival rate of mice challenged with lps (31% vs. 19% in the pbs group; p = 0.001), s. aureus (56% vs. 20% in pbs group; p = 0.01), or s. typhimurium (48% vs. 10% in pbs group; p = 0.03). significantly reduced release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha and interleukin (il)-6 was evident in cerivastatin-treated mice after lps challenge. cerivastatin-treated mice showed insignificant reductions in serum tnf-alpha and  il-6 concentrations after bacterial challenge. however, significantly accelerated bacterial clearance was demonstrated in cerivastatin-treated mice 24 h after s. typhimurium infection and 48 h after s. aureus infection. conclusions: cerivastatin protects mice against lps- and live bacteria-induced death, an effect associated with cerivastatin-attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine production and enhanced bacterial clearance. hence, application of statins in the clinical setting may prove beneficial in prevention of lps or bacterial infection-related sepsis.

AB  == staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus)-specific bacteriophage was used as a probe for  detection of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in aqueous solution using a novel optical method. biorecognition phage monolayers transferred to glass substrates using langmuir-blodgett (lb) technique were exposed individually to mrsa in solution at logarithmic concentrations ranging from 10(6) to 10(9)cfu/ml, and observed for real-time binding using a cytoviva optical light microscope system. results indicate that lb monolayers possessed high levels of elasticity (k), measuring 22 and 29 mn/m for 10(9) and 10(11)pfu/ml phage concentrations, respectively. near-instantaneous mrsa-phage binding produced 33+/-5%, 10+/-1%, 1.1+/-0.1%, and 0.09+/-0.01% coverage of the substrate that directly correlated to a decrease in mrsa concentrations of 10(9), 10(8), 10(7), and 10(6)cfu/ml. the exclusive selectivity of phage monolayers was verified with salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium (s. typhimurium) and bacillus subtilis.

TI  == interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  == protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. we investigated the interactions of bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), with the amoeba, acanthamoeba polyphaga. there was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except l. monocytogenes and s. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that s. aureus survived and may even multiply within a. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of l. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.

TI  == enzyme-assisted processing increases antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of bilberry.
AB  == the effects of nine cell wall-degrading enzymes on the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of bilberry were studied. antimicrobial activity was measured using the human pathogens salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus as test strains. enzyme treatments liberated phenolics from the cell wall matrix, which clearly increased the antimicrobial activity of berry juices, press cakes, and berry mashes on the basis of plate counts. antibacterial effects were stronger against salmonella than against staphylococcus bacteria. in general, the increase in activity measured as colony-forming units per milliliter was 3-5 logarithmic units against salmonella and 1-2 units against staphylococcus bacteria. increase in antimicrobial activity was observed only in acidic conditions, which is also the natural environment in various berry products, such as juices. the activity profile of the pectinase preparation affected the chemistry of the phenolics due to the presence of deglycosylating activities in some preparations. the difference in phenolic profiles was reflected in the antimicrobial effects. bilberry mashes treated with pectinex ultra sp-l, pectinex 3 xl, and pectinex be xxl were most efficient against salmonella bacteria, whereas mashes treated with pectinex smash, pectinex be 3-l, and biopectinase ccm showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus bacteria. due  to the liberation of phenolics from the cell wall matrix the antioxidant activity measured as radical scavenging activity was also increased on average about 30% by the enzymatic treatments. the highest increase in phenolic compounds was about 40%. highest increases in anthocyanins and in antioxidant activity were observed  in berry mash treated with pectinex smash xxl enzyme, and the lowest increase was observed after treatment with pectinex be 3-l. enzyme-assisted processing is traditionally used to improve berry and fruit juice yields. however, enzymatic treatments also have an impact on the functional properties of the products. the  increased liberation of phenolics from the cell wall matrix can prolong the shelf life of berry products by limiting the growth of contaminants during processing or storage. the increased amount of phenolic compounds may also have a positive effect on gut well-being.

TI  == survival of enteric microorganisms on grass surfaces irrigated with treated effluent.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

TI  == characterization of antarctic psychrotrophic bacteria with antibacterial activities against terrestrial microorganisms.
AB  == five-hundreds and eighty bacterial strains, isolated from various antarctic marine sources and locations, were screened for antimicrobial activity against terrestrial microorganisms. twenty-two antarctic isolates (3.8%), mainly retrieved from the water column at terra nova bay (ross sea), expressed antagonistic activity against one to three indicator organisms. escherichia coli  and proteus mirabilis resulted as the more susceptible, followed by micrococcus luteus and bacillus subtilis. none of the isolates inhibited the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and the eukaryotic fungus candida albicans. active antarctic isolates, identified by 16s  rdna sequencing and phenotypically characterized by classical methods, were phylogenetically affiliated to the actinobacteria (16 strains) and the gamma-proteobacteria (6 strains). inhibition patterns, as well as phenotypic characteristics, highly vary for different isolates, even though they were affiliated to the same genus or closely related to the identical microorganism retrieved from the database, suggesting that these features were more likely strain-rather than species-specific.results obtained from the present study confirm previous observations and highlight the potentiality of antarctic marine  bacteria as novel source of antibacterial substances.

TI  == broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activities of clay minerals against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.
AB  == objectives: the capacity to properly address the worldwide incidence of infectious diseases lies in the ability to detect, prevent and effectively treat  these infections. therefore, identifying and analysing inhibitory agents are worthwhile endeavours in an era when few new classes of effective antimicrobials  have been developed. the use of geological nanomaterials to heal skin infections  has been evident since the earliest recorded history, and specific clay minerals  may prove valuable in the treatment of bacterial diseases, including infections for which there are no effective antibiotics, such as buruli ulcer and multidrug-resistant infections. methods: we have subjected two iron-rich clay minerals, which have previously been used to treat buruli ulcer patients, to broth culture testing of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria to assess the feasibility of using clay minerals as therapeutic agents. results: one specific mineral, csag02, demonstrated bactericidal activity against pathogenic escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) e. coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium marinum, and a combined bacteriostatic/bactericidal effect against staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and mycobacterium smegmatis, whereas another mineral with similar structure and bulk  crystal chemistry, csar02, had no effect on or enhanced bacterial growth. the <0.2 microm fraction of csag02 and csag02 heated to 200 or 550 degrees c retained bactericidal activity, whereas cation-exchanged csag02 and csag02 heated to 900 degrees c no longer killed e. coli. conclusions: our results indicate that specific mineral products have intrinsic, heat-stable antibacterial properties, which could provide an inexpensive treatment against numerous human bacterial infections.

TI  == effects of sub-lethal concentrations of hexanal and 2-(e)-hexenal on membrane fatty acid composition and volatile compounds of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli.
AB  == in recent years, the interest in the possible use of natural alternatives to food additives to prevent bacterial and fungal growth has notably increased. plants and plant products can represent a source of natural alternatives to improve the  shelf-life and the safety of food. some of these compounds, i.e. hexanal, hexanol, 2-(e)-hexenal and 3-(z)-hexenol, produced throughout the lipoxygenase pathway have important roles in plant defence with a protective action towards microbial proliferation in wounded areas. otherwise, hexanal and 2-(e)-hexenal have evidenced a marked antimicrobial activity against food spoilage and pathogenic microbial species both in model and real systems. the precise mechanisms of action of all these antimicrobial compounds are not yet clear. because the usage of these compounds as antimicrobials in foods has to be supported by the comprehension of mechanisms of action of these compounds, the overall purpose of this work was to study the modifications of the cell membrane  and volatile compounds of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli during the growth in the presence of  sub-lethal doses of these two aldehydes. the results obtained evidenced that the  tested molecules induced noticeable modifications of the composition of cell membrane and the volatile compounds produced during the growth. although specific differences in relation to the species considered were identified, 2-(e)-hexenal  and hexanal induced a marked increase of some membrane associated fatty acids, both linear and branched fatty acids as well as unsaturated fatty acids, and released free fatty acids.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of flavonoids extracted from bergamot (citrus bergamia risso) peel, a byproduct of the essential oil industry.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of flavonoid-rich fractions derived from bergamot peel, a byproduct from the citrus fruit processing industry and the influence of enzymatic deglycosylation on their activity against different bacteria and yeast. methods and results: bergamot ethanolic fractions were tested against gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, salmonella enterica), gram-positive bacteria (listeria innocua, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, lactococcus lactis) and the yeast saccharomyces  cerevisiae. bergamot fractions were found to be active against all the gram-negative bacteria tested, and their antimicrobial potency increased after enzymatic deglycosylation. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the fractions and the pure flavonoids, neohesperidin, hesperetin (aglycone), neoeriocitrin, eriodictyol (aglycone), naringin and naringenin (aglycone), were found to be in the range 200 to 800 microg ml(-1). the interactions between three bergamot flavonoids were also evaluated. conclusion: the enzyme preparation pectinase 62l  efficiently converted common glycosides into their aglycones from bergamot extracts, and this deglycosylation increased the antimicrobial potency of citrus  flavonoids. pairwise combinations of eriodictyol, naringenin and hesperetin showed both synergistic and indifferent interactions that were dependent on the test indicator organism. significance and impact of the study: bergamot peel is a potential source of natural antimicrobials that are active against gram-negative  bacteria.

TI  == improved diagnosis specificity in bone and joint infections using molecular techniques.
AB  == objectives: the microbiological diagnosis of osteoarticular infections currently  relies on microbiological cultures, to specifically target treatment. however, these conventional methods sometimes lack of sensitivity and of specificity to establish definitive diagnosis. this study was conducted to determine whether molecular method could improve bacterial bone and joint infection diagnosis. methods: we evaluated the performance of nucleic acid extraction with the semi-automated nuclisens minimag instrument coupled to 16s rdna sequencing on 76  samples collected from 51 patients with suspected infections: prosthetic-joint infection (15), spondylodiscitis (7) acute septic arthritis (11) and 18 controls. no pre-treatment of the sample was done before nucleic acid extraction. classification in infected group required an accumulation of arguments. results:  our molecular method identified a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and fastidious bacteria like neisseria gonorrhoeae and fusobacterium  nucleatum. the overall pcr sensitivity was 73.3%: 53.8% for prosthetic-joint infections and 88.2% for infections without prostheses. the overall pcr specificity was 95.2%, whereas culture specificity was only 85.7%. conclusions: the instrument was simple to use and provided nucleic acids free of pcr inhibitors and free of contamination by foreign bacterial dna. our study highlights the need for still improved molecular diagnostic sensitivity.

TI  == subtractive screening for probiotic properties of lactobacillus species from the  human gastrointestinal tract in the search for new probiotics.
AB  == in the search for new probiotics, 61 lactobacillus spp. isolates, belonging to 12 species and isolated as dominant lactic acid bacteria from the feces of healthy humans, were subjected to a subtractive system of in vitro analyses, which included desirable and undesirable traits. twenty-four isolates were able to grow in 2% bovine bile, of which 13 grew in acidified broth at ph 3.5 in acidified cysteine-containing mrs broth. intrinsic resistance to certain antimicrobial agents (cefoxitin, metronidazole, vancomycin) was observed in most isolates, but  atypical resistances to erythromycin, clindamycin, or tetracycline were also found in 5 strains. undesirable traits such as alpha-chymotrypsin or n-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase activities were not detected, but low beta-glucuronidase and moderate beta-glucosidase activities were recorded in 2 strains. two lactobacillus gasseri and 2 lactobacillus paracasei selected strains inhibited several intestinal pathogens in an agar spot test, including strains of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus. they also adhered to human caco-2 and ht-29 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to lactobacillus rhamnosus strain gg, and were unable to degrade pig gastric mucin in a plate assay. together, these results suggest these 4 strains to be good probiotic candidates, concluding that the subtractive screening devised in this work could be a valuable tool in large-scale surveys for probiotics.

TI  == reduction of bacteria on spinach, lettuce, and surfaces in food service areas using neutral electrolyzed oxidizing water.
AB  == food safety issues and increases in food borne illnesses have promulgated the development of new sanitation methods to eliminate pathogenic organisms on foods  and surfaces in food service areas. electrolyzed oxidizing water (eo water) shows promise as an environmentally friendly broad spectrum microbial decontamination agent. eo water is generated by the passage of a dilute salt solution ( approximately 1% nacl) through an electrochemical cell. this electrolytic process converts chloride ions and water molecules into chlorine oxidants (cl(2), hocl/clo(-)). at a near-neutral ph (ph 6.3-6.5), the predominant chemical species is the highly biocidal hypochlorous acid species (hocl) with the oxidation reduction potential (orp) of the solution ranging from 800 to 900mv. the biocidal activity of near-neutral eo water was evaluated at 25 degrees c using pure cultures of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis. treatment of these organisms,  in pure culture, with eo water at concentrations of 20, 50, 100, and 120ppm total residual chlorine (trc) and 10min of contact time resulted in 100% inactivation of all five organisms (reduction of 6.1-6.7log(10)cfu/ml). spray treatment of surfaces in food service areas with eo water containing 278-310ppm trc (ph 6.38)  resulted in a 79-100% reduction of microbial growth. dip (10min) treatment of spinach at 100 and 120ppm trc resulted in a 4.0-5.0log(10)cfu/ml reduction of bacterial counts for all organisms tested. dipping (10min) of lettuce at 100 and  120ppm trc reduced bacterial counts of e. coli by 0.24-0.25log(10)cfu/ml and reduced all other organisms by 2.43-3.81log(10)cfu/ml.

TI  == evidence of lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacterial pathogens exposed to high-intensity pulsed-plasma gas discharges.
AB  == aims: to apply scanning electron microscopy, image analysis and a fluorescent viability stain to assess lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacteria exposed to pulsed-plasma gas discharges (ppgd). methods and results: the fluorescent redox probe 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) was used for enumerating actively respiring cells of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium that were suspended in sterile water at 4 degrees c and exposed to separate ppgd and heat treatments. while there was good agreement between use of respiratory staining (rs) and direct-selective agar plate counting (pc) for enumerating untreated bacteria, there were c. 1 and 3 log-unit differences in surviving cell numbers per millilitre for test organisms subjected to ppgd and heat treatments respectively, when enumerated by these different viability indicators. ppgd-treated bacteria were markedly altered at the cellular level when examined by scanning electron microscopy. conclusions: use of this rs  method revealed that substantial subpopulations of test bacteria rendered incapable of forming colonies by separate ppgd and heat treatments may remain metabolically active. significance and impact of the study: use of this rs method offers interesting perspectives on assessing established and novel microbial inactivation methods, and may also provide a better understanding of mechanisms involved in microbial inactivation induced by high-intensity ppgd treatments.

TI  == development of a new water sterilization device with a 365 nm uv-led.
AB  == ultraviolet (uv) irradiation is an effective disinfection method. in sterilization equipment, a low-pressure mercury lamp emitting an effective germicidal uvc (254 nm) is used as the light source. however, the lamp, which contains mercury, must be disposed of at the end of its lifetime or following damage due to physical shock or vibration. we investigated the suitability of an  ultraviolet light-emitting diode at an output wavelength of 365 nm (uva-led) as a sterilization device, comparing with the other wavelength irradiation such as 254 nm (a low-pressure mercury lam) and 405 nm (led). we used a commercially available uva-led that emitted light at the shortest wavelength and at the highest output energy. the new sterilization system using the uva-led was able to inactivate bacteria, such as escherichia coli dh5 alpha, enteropathogenic e. coli, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis. the inactivations of the bacteria were dependent on the accumulation of uva irradiation. taking advantage of the safety and compact size  of led devices, we expect that the uva-led sterilization device can be developed  as a new type of water sterilization device.

AB  == 1. the repeatability and heritability of growth inhibition by egg albumen of two  major pathogenic bacteria, a gram-negative (salmonella enteritidis) and a gram-positive (staphyloccocus aureus) and of two antimicrobial albumen proteins,  lysozyme and ovotransferrin, were estimated in commercial pedigree hens. 2. repeatability was evaluated in 100 egg-type hens at the beginning, middle and end of the laying cycle on eggs collected for 3 weeks. heritabilities were estimated  at 36 to 40 weeks of age on 400 pedigree hens (2 eggs/hen), which were the offspring of 25 sires each mated with 4 dams. ovotransferrin and lysozyme were quantified by elisa. salmonella enteritidis (s.e.) and staphyloccocus aureus (s.a.) were inoculated into a sample of sterilised albumen and enumerated after incubation. 3. total protein content in albumen decreased with age of laying hens, whereas there were increases in lysozyme or ovotransferrin concentrations and in the bacteriostatic effect of albumen. 4. repeatability for bacterial growth in albumen ranged from 0.29 to 0.39 for the number of s.e. (log cfu/ml) one day post inoculation (p.i.) but was lower and more variable at 5 d p.i. or for s.a. number. it ranged from 0.27 to 0.38 for s.e. and s.a. number at the mid  period of the laying cycle. repeatabilities were low and variable for total egg albumen protein or lysozyme and ovotranferrin concentrations (0 to 0.22). 5. negative phenotypic correlations were observed between lysozyme concentrations and s.e. number but that between lysozyme and s.a. number was not significant. 6. heritabilities were low (0.01 to 0.09) for protein traits. they were 0.11 for s.a. number and 0.16 for s.e. number one day p.i. 7. it appears to be more efficient to select on global bacterial growth than on specific antimicrobial proteins. the most promising trait is the number of s.e. one day p.i.

TI  == outbreaks where food workers have been implicated in the spread of foodborne disease. part 1. description of the problem, methods, and agents involved.
AB  == food workers in many settings have been responsible for foodborne disease outbreaks for decades, and there is no indication that this is diminishing. the committee on control of foodborne illnesses of the international association for  food protection was tasked with collecting and evaluating any data on worker-associated outbreaks. a total of 816 reports with 80,682 cases were collected from events that occurred from 1927 until the first quarter of 2006. most of the outbreaks reviewed were from the united states, canada, europe, and australia, with relatively few from other parts of the world, indicating the skewed set of data because of availability in the literature or personal contact. outbreaks were caused by 14 agents: norovirus or probable norovirus (338), salmonella enterica (151), hepatitis a virus (84), staphylococcus aureus (53), shigella spp. (33), streptococcus lancefield groups a and g (17), and parasites cyclospora, giardia, and cryptosporidium (23). streptococcal, staphylococcal, and typhoid outbreaks seem to be diminishing over time; hepatitis a virus remains static, whereas norovirus and maybe nontyphoidal salmonella are increasing. multiple foods and multi-ingredient foods were identified most frequently with outbreaks, perhaps because of more frequent hand contact during preparation and serving.

TI  == predicting microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments.
AB  == the aim of this study was to develop an equation that accurately predicts microbial heat inactivation under nonisothermal treatments at constantly rising heating rates (from 0.5 to 5 degrees c/min) in media with different ph values (4.0 or 7.4). the survival curves of all bacteria (enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella senftenberg 775w, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) tested under isothermal treatments were nearly linear. for the most heat-resistant microorganism (e. faecium), the estimated dt-values at ph 7.4 were at least 100 times those of the second most thermotolerant microorganism (salmonella senftenberg 775w). the heat resistance of e. faecium was up to 30 times lower at ph 4.0 than at ph 7.4. however, e. faecium was still the most heat-resistant microorganism under nonisothermal treatments at both ph values. inactivation under nonisothermal conditions was not accurately estimated from heat resistance parameters of isothermal treatments when microbial adaptation or sensibilization occurred during the heating up lag phases. the under-prediction of the number of survivors might be greater than 15  log cfu within the nonisothermal treatment conditions investigated. therefore, the nonisothermal survival curves of the most heat-resistant microorganisms were  fitted with the following equation: log s(t) = -(t/delta)p. this equation accurately described the survival curves of all the bacteria tested. we observed  a linear relationship between the log of the scale parameter (delta) and the log  of the heating rate. a p value characteristic of each microorganism and ph tested was calculated. two equations capable of predicting the inactivation rate of all  bacteria tested under nonisothermal treatments at ph 7.4, 5.5, or 4.0 were developed. the model was evaluated in skim milk and apple juice. the results of this study could be used to help minimize public health risks and to extend the shelf life of those foods requiring long heating up lag phases during processing.

TI  == membrane toxicity of antimicrobial compounds from essential oils.
AB  == natural antimicrobial compounds perform their action mainly against cell membranes. the aim of this work was to evaluate the interaction, meant as a mechanism of action, of essential oil antimicrobial compounds with the microbial  cell envelope. the lipid profiles of escherichia coli o157:h7, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, pseudomonas fluorescens, and brochothrix thermosphacta cells treated with thymol, carvacrol, limonene, eugenol, and cinnamaldehyde have been analyzed by gas chromatography. in line with the fatty acids analysis, the treated cells were also observed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) to evaluate structural alterations. the overall results showed a strong decrease of the unsaturated fatty acids (ufas) for the treated cells; in particular, the c18:2trans and c18:3cis underwent a notable reduction contributing to the total ufa decreases, while the saturated fatty acid c17:0 raised the highest concentration in cinnamaldehyde-treated cells. sem images showed that the used antimicrobial compounds quickly exerted their antimicrobial  activities, determining structural alterations of the cell envelope.

TI  == differential requirement of p2x7 receptor and intracellular k+ for caspase-1 activation induced by intracellular and extracellular bacteria.
AB  == interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in host defense and inflammatory diseases. the maturation and secretion of il-1beta are mediated by caspase-1, a protease that processes pro-il-1beta into biologically active il-1beta. the activity of caspase-1 is controlled by the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex formed by nlr proteins and the adaptor asc, that induces the activation of caspase-1. the current model proposes that changes in the intracellular concentration of k(+) potentiate caspase-1 activation induced by the recognition of bacterial products. however, the roles of p2x7 receptor and intracellular k(+) in il-1beta secretion induced by bacterial infection remain unknown. here we show that, in response to toll-like receptor agonists such as lipopolysaccharide or infection with extracellular bacteria staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli, efficient caspase-1 activation is only triggered by addition of atp, a signal that promotes caspase-1 activation through depletion of intracellular k(+) caused by stimulation of the purinergic p2x7 receptor. in contrast, activation of caspase-1 that relies on cytosolic sensing of flagellin or intracellular bacteria did not require atp stimulation or depletion of cytoplasmic k(+). consistently, caspase-1 activation induced by intracellular salmonella or listeria was unimpaired in macrophages deficient in p2x7 receptor. these results indicate that, unlike caspase-1 induced by toll-like receptor agonists and atp, activation of the inflammasome by intracellular bacteria and cytosolic flagellin proceeds normally  in the absence of p2x7 receptor-mediated cytoplasmic k(+) perturbations.

TI  == specific bifidobacterium strains isolated from elderly subjects inhibit growth of staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == cell-free, ph-controlled supernatants of thirty-eight bifidobacterium strains isolated from healthy elderly subjects were subjected to antimicrobial activity assay. bioluminescent indicator strains staphylococcus aureus rn4220, escherichia coli k-12, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028 were used as targets of antimicrobial activity. the effect of nutrient depletion on the inhibition was eliminated with spent-culture controls. three out of thirty-eight  bifidobacterium strains were capable of inhibiting the growth of s. aureus. the inhibition was equal to 23.2+/-19.1% to 50.4+/-26.7% of the inhibition caused by  50 iu/ml nisin. reuterin-producing positive strain lactobacillus reuteri sd2112 was capable of 86.0+/-24.6% inhibition, but bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, a known probiotic strain, showed no inhibition. none of the strains was capable of inhibiting the growth of e. coli or s. enterica. the observed inhibition by bifidobacteria was related to hydrogen peroxide formation and possible production of heat-stable proteinaceous compounds. the results suggest that production of antimicrobial substances other than organic acids is not common among bifidobacterium strains typical of elderly subjects. however, specific strains were identified which showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. aureus.

TI  == polyamine effects on antibiotic susceptibility in bacteria.
AB  == biogenic polyamines (e.g., spermidine and spermine) are a group of essential polycationic compounds found in all living cells. the effects of spermine and spermidine on antibiotic susceptibility were examined with gram-negative escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium bacteria and clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus bacteria, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). exogenous spermine exerted a dose-dependent inhibition effect on the growth of e. coli, s.  enterica serovar typhimurium, and s. aureus but not p. aeruginosa, as depicted by mic and growth curve measurements. while the mics of polymyxin and ciprofloxacin  were in general increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine in p. aeruginosa,  this adverse effect was not observed in enteric bacteria and s. aureus. it was found that spermine and spermidine can decrease the mics of beta-lactam antibiotics in all strains as well as other types of antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner. significantly, the mics of oxacillin for mrsa mu50 and n315 were decreased more than 200-fold in the presence of spermine, and this effect of spermine was retained when assessed in the presence of divalent ions (magnesium or calcium; 3 mm) or sodium chloride (150 mm). the effect of spermine  on the sensitization of p. aeruginosa and mrsa to antibiotics was further demonstrated by population analysis and time-killing assays. the results of checkerboard assays with e. coli and s. aureus indicated a strong synergistic effect of spermine in combination with beta-lactams and chloramphenicol. the decreased mics of beta-lactams implied that the possible blockage of outer membrane porins by exogenous spermine or spermidine did not play a crucial role in most cases. in contrast, only the mic of imipenem against p. aeruginosa was increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine, and this resistance effect was abolished in a mutant strain devoid of the outer membrane porin oprd. in e. coli, the mics of carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were decreased in two acra mutants devoid of a major efflux pump, acrab. however, retention of the  spermine effect on antibiotic susceptibility in two acra mutants of e. coli suggested that the acrab efflux pump was not the target for a synergistic effect  by spermine and antibiotics and ruled out the hypothesis of spermine serving as an efflux pump inhibitor in this organism. in summary, this interesting finding of the effect of spermine on antibiotic susceptibility provides the basis for a new potential approach against drug-resistant pathogens by use of existing beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == [inhibitory effect of combined bacterin on growth of sarcoma 180 in mice].
AB  == background & objective: it was reported that the symptoms of tumor patients may be alleviated markedly and even the tumor may be regressed completely after acute infection. bacterin ok-432 has notable inhibitory effect on the growth of various tumors in animals. at present, ok-432 has been used in clinical immunotherapy for tumors with no other adverse events besides fever and leucocytosis. this study was to investigate the effects of combined bacterin on the serum level of interleukin 12(p70)[il-12(p70)] and the growth of sarcoma 180 (s180) in mice. methods: after transplantation of s180, the mice were randomized into 5 groups, and received injection of staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, mycobacteria phlei, and combined bacterin containing the 3 bacteria strains, respectively, or received no treatment (blank control). the weight of s180 xenografts, the thymus, and the spleen in mice was measured. the serum level of il-12(p70) was detected by elisa. results: the mean weight of s180 tumors was 1.39 g in staphylococcus aureus group, 1.50 g in salmonella typhimurium group, 1.36 g in mycobacteria phlei group, 0.62 g in combined bacterin group, and 2.40 g in blank control group; the differences among the 5 groups were significant (f=66.73, p<0.001). the mean weight of s180 tumors was significantly lower in the 4 bacterin groups than in control group, and significantly lower in combined bacterin group than in the 3 single bacterin groups (q test, p<0.001). the weights of the thymus and the spleen among the 5 groups had no significant difference (f=2.36, p>0.05; f=1.89, p>0.05). the inhibition rate of tumor growth  was significantly higher in combined bacterin group than in staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, and mycobacteria phlei groups (74.17% vs. 42.08%, 37.50%, and 43.33%, p<0.01). the mean serum level of il-12(p70) was 19.44 pg/ml in combined bacterin group, 12.41 pg/ml in staphylococcus aureus group, 10.35 pg/ml in salmonella typhimurium group, 11.68 pg/ml in mycobacteria phlei group, and 4.45 pg/ml in control group; the difference among the 5 groups was significant (f=15.76, p<0.0001), but the difference among the 3 single bacterin groups was not significant (q test, p>0.05), while the differences between other  groups were significant (q test, p<0.01). conclusions: the chosen bacterins in this study can induce the mice to produce il-12(p70) and suppress the growth of s180. the effect of the combined bacterin is much better than the single bacterins.

TI  == an anti-infective peptide that selectively modulates the innate immune response.
AB  == we show that an innate defense-regulator peptide (idr-1) was protective in mouse  models of infection with important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. when given from 48 h before to 6 h after infection, the peptide was effective by both local and systemic administration. because protection by idr-1 was prevented by in vivo depletion of monocytes and macrophages, but not neutrophils or b- and t-lymphocytes, we conclude that monocytes and macrophages are key effector cells. idr-1 was not directly antimicrobial: gene and protein expression analysis in human and mouse monocytes and macrophages indicated that idr-1, acting through mitogen-activated protein kinase and other signaling pathways, enhanced the levels of monocyte chemokines while reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine responses. to our knowledge, an innate defense regulator that counters infection by selective modulation of innate immunity without obvious toxicities has not been reported previously.

TI  == fluorescent nanoparticles for multiplexed bacteria monitoring.
AB  == rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of pathogenic bacteria is extremely important for proper containment, diagnosis, and treatment of diseases like foodborne illness, sepsis, and bioterrorism. most current bacterial detection methods are time-consuming and laborious and can detect only one bacterial pathogen at a time. we have developed a method for sensitive, multiplexed monitoring of bacterial pathogens within 30 min using multicolored fret (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) silica nps (nanoparticles). by varying the ratio of three tandem dyes coencapsulated into the nps, we have synthesized nps that emit unique colors upon excitation with a single wavelength. when these  nps were conjugated to monoclonal antibodies specific for the pathogenic bacteria species escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus, and  then incubated with small concentrations of the bacteria, simultaneous and sensitive detection of the multiple bacterial targets was achieved.

TI  == adhesive and chemokine stimulatory properties of potentially probiotic lactobacillus strains.
AB  == five lactobacillus plantarum strains and two lactobacillus johnsonii strains, stemming either from african traditionally fermented milk products or children's  feces, were investigated for probiotic properties in vitro. the relationship between the hydrophobic-hydrophilic cell surface and adhesion ability to ht29 intestinal epithelial cells was investigated, and results indicated that especially the l. johnsonii strains, which exhibited both hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface characteristics, adhered well to ht29 cells. four l. plantarum and two l. johnsonii strains showed high adherence to ht29 cells, generally higher than that of the probiotic control strain lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. most strains with high adhesion ability also showed high autoaggregation ability. the two l. johnsonii strains coaggregated well with the  intestinal pathogens listeria monocytogenes scott a, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028. the l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii 6128 strains furthermore inhibited the adhesion of at least two of these intestinal pathogens in coculture with ht29 cells in a strain-dependent way. these two potential probiotic strains  also significantly increased interleukin-8 (il-8) chemokine production by ht29 cells, although modulation of other cytokines, such as il-1, il-6, il-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), did not occur. altogether, our results suggested that l. plantarum bfe 1685 and l. johnsonii bfe 6128 showed good adherence, coaggregated with pathogens, and stimulated chemokine production of intestinal epithelial cells, traits that may be considered promising for their development as probiotic strains.

TI  == modular determinants of antimicrobial activity in platelet factor-4 family kinocidins.
AB  == mammalian platelets contain an array of antimicrobial peptides, termed platelet microbicidal proteins (pmps). human and rabbit pmps include known chemokines, such as platelet factor-4 (hpf-4); pmp-1 is the rabbit orthologue of hpf-4. chemokines that also exert direct antimicrobial activity have been termed kinocidins. a consensus peptide domain library representing mammalian pf-4 family members was analyzed to define structural domains contributing to antimicrobial activity against a panel of human pathogens. secondary conformations were assessed by circular dichroism spectrometry, and molecular modeling was employed  to investigate structural correlates of antimicrobial efficacy. antimicrobial activity against isogenic peptide-susceptible or -resistant staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium, and candida albicans strain pairs mapped to the c-terminal hemimer (38-74) and modular domains thereof (49-63 and 60-74). increasing electrostatic charge and steric bulk were general correlates of efficacy. structural data corroborated spatial distribution of charge, steric bulk and putative secondary structure with organism-specific efficacy. microbicidal efficacies of the cpmp antimicrobial hemimer and c-terminal peptide  (60-74) were retained in a complex human-blood biomatrix assay. collectively, these results suggest that modular determinants arising from structural components acting independently and cooperatively govern the antimicrobial functions of pf-4 family kinocidins against specific target pathogens.

TI  == structural correlates of antimicrobial efficacy in il-8 and related human kinocidins.
AB  == chemokines are small (8-12 kda) effector proteins that potentiate leukocyte chemonavigation. beyond this role, certain chemokines have direct antimicrobial activity against human pathogenic organisms; such molecules are termed kinocidins. the current investigation was designed to explore the structure-activity basis for direct microbicidal activity of kinocidins. amino acid sequence and 3-dimensional analyses demonstrated these molecules to contain  iterations of the conserved gamma-core motif found in broad classes of classical  antimicrobial peptides. representative cxc, cc and c cysteine-motif-group kinocidins were tested for antimicrobial activity versus human pathogenic bacteria and fungi. results demonstrate that these molecules exert direct antimicrobial activity in vitro, including antibacterial activity of native il-8  and mcp-1, and microbicidal activity of native il-8. to define molecular determinants governing its antimicrobial activities, the il-8 gamma-core (il-8gamma) and alpha-helical (il-8alpha) motifs were compared to native il-8 for antimicrobial efficacy in vitro. microbicidal activity recapitulating that of native il-8 localized to the autonomous il-8alpha motif in vitro, and demonstrated durable microbicidal activity in human blood and blood matrices ex vivo. these results offer new insights into the modular architecture, context-related deployment and function, and evolution of host defense molecules  containing gamma-core motifs and microbicidal helices associated with antimicrobial activity.

TI  == use of linear, weibull, and log-logistic functions to model pressure inactivation of seven foodborne pathogens in milk.
AB  == survival curves of six foodborne pathogens suspended in ultra high-temperature (uht) whole milk and exposed to high hydrostatic pressure at 21.5 degrees c were  obtained. vibrio parahaemolyticus was treated at 300 mpa and other pathogens, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus were treated at 600 mpa. all the survival curves showed a rapid initial drop in bacterial counts followed by tailing caused by a diminishing inactivation rate. a linear model and two nonlinear models were fitted to these data and the performances of these models were compared using mean square error (mse) values.  the log-logistic and weibull models consistently produced better fits to the inactivation data than the linear model. the mean mse value of the linear model was 6.1, while the mean mse values were 0.7 for the weibull model and 0.3 for the log-logistic model. there was no correlation between pressure resistance and the  taxonomic group the bacteria belong to. the order, most to least pressure-sensitive, of the single strains tested was: v. parahaemolyticus (gram negative)<l. monocytogenes (gram positive)<salmonella typhimurium (gram negative) approximately = salmonella enteritidis (gram negative)<e. coli o157:h7 approximately = staphylocollus aureus (gram positive)<shigella flexneri (gram negative). the most pressure-resistant gram-negative bacterium, shigella flexneri, and most pressure resistant gram-positive bacterium, staphylocollus aureus, were pressurized at 50 degrees c. staphylocollus aureus was treated at 500 mpa and shigella flexneri at 600 mpa. elevated temperature considerably enhanced pressure inactivation of these two pathogens, but did not affect the overall shape of the survival curves. pressure level (250 mpa) and substrate (1%  peptone water plus 3% nacl) in which v. parahaemolyticus was suspended affected the shape of survival curves of v. parahaemolyticus.

TI  == survival and growth of foodborne pathogens during cooking and storage of oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  == fresh cooked rice cakes for retail sale are typically held at room temperature because refrigeration dramatically reduces their quality. room temperature, high  water activity, and a ph of > 4.6 provided an environment conducive to pathogen growth. to date, no studies have been published regarding survival and growth of  foodborne pathogens in fresh cooked rice cakes. this study was undertaken to investigate the effect of steam cooking on foodborne pathogens and their subsequent growth in five varieties of rice cakes made from flours of regular rice, sweet rice, white rice, tapioca, and mung bean. bacillus cereus spores were detected in white rice, tapioca, and mung bean samples. the rice cake flours were inoculated with non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7,  salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus) or spore-forming bacteria (bacillus cereus) and steam cooked (100 degrees c) for 30 min. steam cooking significantly reduced (> 6 log cfu/g) non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens in all samples and inactivated spores of b. cereus by 1 to 2 log cfu/g. although spores of b. cereus survived steam cooking and germinated during 3 days of storage at room temperature, populations in most rice cakes remained below 106 cfu/g, which is the threshold for producing toxin. rice cakes made from mung bean flour supported growth and germination of b. cereus spores above that critical level. in mung bean rice cakes, enterotoxin production was detected by the second day, when b cereus cell  populations reached about 6.9 log cfu/g. the toxin concentration increased with storage time. however, our results suggest that rapid growth of total mesophilic  microorganisms by more than 7 to 8 log cfu/ml during the first day of storage produced off flavors and spoilage before b. cereus was able to grow enough to produce toxins. therefore, steam-cooked rice cakes made from a variety of flours  including mung bean flour are safe for sale for up to 1 day after storage at room temperature and are free of b. cereus toxins.

AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

AB  == the fate of staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and vibrio vulnificus in oysters treated with chitosan was investigated. three concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 2.0%) of chitosan in 0.5% hydrochloric acid were prepared and coated onto raw oysters, which were then stored at 4 degrees c for 12 days. untreated oysters and oysters coated with 0.5% hydrochloric acid without chitosan were used as controls. s. aureus cells were most sensitive to 2.0% chitosan followed by 0.5 and 1.0%. in general, chitosan treatment of oysters produced a decline in the population of s. aureus by 1 to 4 log cfu/ml compared with the untreated control. chitosan treatment had no influence on the reduction  of salmonella typhimurium over the 12-day storage period; inhibition of salmonella typhimurium growth was similar in both the control samples and the chitosan-treated samples. however, time of storage had a major effect on the survival of salmonella typhimurium on oysters. neither time nor chitosan concentration had a significant effect on the growth of v. vulnificus during storage. all treatments were similar in inhibiting v. vulnificus growth.

TI  == screening of bacillus strains as potential probiotics and subsequent confirmation of the in vivo effectiveness of bacillus subtilis ma139 in pigs.
AB  == a total of 124 samples were collected from the intestine of broiler chickens, piglet faeces, fermented foods, soils and chinese herbs. more than 750 strains of aerobic, spore-forming bacteria were isolated from these samples. the inhibitory  activity of these spore-forming strains against escherichia coli k88, e. coli k99, salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus was assessed using a disc plate diffusion assay. the six bacilli with the largest inhibition zones against  the four indicator bacteria were chosen and assessed for their resistance to unfavorable conditions within simulated gut environments. the strain bacillus subtilis ma139 showed full resistance to ph 2, 0.3% bile salts and exhibited the  highest antimicrobial activity. based on these results, b. subtilis ma139 was selected as a potential probiotic and fed to piglets at concentrations of 2.2 x 10(5), 2.2 x 10(6) or 2.2 x 10(7) cfu/g of feed during a 28-day feeding trial. a  negative control consisting of the basal diet with no additives and a positive control consisting of the basal diet supplemented with 16 g/ton flavomycin were also included. ninety piglets between 35 and 40 days old were used in the in vivo animal trials. b. subtilis ma139 enhanced daily gain (p = 0.10) and feed conversion (p = 0.03) compared with the negative control. the performance of pigs fed b. subtilis ma139 supplemented diets did not differ from that of pigs fed the antibiotic diet. there was a significant increase in lactobacilli cell counts (p  = 0.02) and a numerical decrease in e. coli counts (p = 0.05) in the faecal samples of pigs fed b. subtilis ma139 with 2.2 x 10(5) cfu/g of feed. the overall results of this study show that the use of initial co-culture with indicator pathogens, a disc plate diffusion assay and simulated gut environment tolerance tests is one of effective methods of screening bacillus for probiotic use and that b. subtilis ma139 is a promising alternative to antibiotics for use as a feed additive in piglet diets.

TI  == comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal  action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal  microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol,  were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.

TI  == berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. the most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were helicobacter pylori and bacillus cereus. campylobacter jejuni and candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. however, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined salmonella strains as indicated by 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine (npn) uptake  increase and analysis of liberation of [14c]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested salmonella strains, and significant increase in the npn uptake was recorded. the stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using escherichia coli and nonvirulent salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. the amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.

TI  == [splenic abscess: presentation of nine cases].
AB  == relatively rare, splenic abscess is difficult to diagnose and often fatal if left untreated. the disease is thought to be growing in frequency because of the increasing number of inmunocompromised patients. several mechanisms for the development of splenic abscess may exist. some studies demonstrate that prior splenic injury in addition to bacteraemia is required for a splenic abscess to occur. in our series, 9 non immunocompromised patients were identified to have this disease during a 6 years period. pathogens isolated included salmonella sp,  staphylococcus sp and enterococcus sp. splenectomy was performed in three patients; in another a percutaneous drainage was done. one patient died. in summary, though rare, splenic abscess presents with high morbidity and mortality. in our experience, risk factors as immunocompromise seem not to be so prevalent in patients with splenic abscess and therefore this diagnosis should be considered in all patients with fever of unknown origin.

AB  == the effect of the disinfectant sodium hypochlorite (naclo), with or without mild  heat (50 degrees c) and fumaric acid, on native bacteria and the foodborne pathogens staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, and salmonella typhimurium dt104 attached to iceberg lettuce leaves was examined. the retail lettuce examined consistently harbored 6 to 7 log cfu/g of native bacteria throughout the study period. inner leaves supported 1 to 2 log cfu/g fewer bacteria than outer leaves. about 70% of the native bacterial flora was removed by washing five times with 0.85% nacl. s. aureus, e. coli, and salmonella allowed to attach to lettuce leaves for 5 min were more easily removed by washing than when allowed to attach for 1 h or 2 days, with more s. aureus being removed than  e. coli or salmonella typhimurium. an increase of time for attachment of pathogens from 5 min to 2 days leads to decreased efficiency of the washing and sanitizing treatment. treatment with fumaric acid (50 mm for 10 min at room temperature) was the most effective, although it caused browning of the lettuce,  with up to a 2-log reduction observed. the combination of 200 ppm of sodium hypochlorite and mild heat treatment at 50 degrees c for 1 min reduced the pathogen populations by 94 to 98% (1.2- to 1.7-log reduction) without increasing  browning.

AB  == eight foodborne pathogens were suspended in ultrahigh-temperature whole milk and  treated at pressure levels of 0.1 to 690 mpa at 21.5 degrees c for 10 min. there  was no clear trend in pressure resistance between gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. the order of the single strains tested, from most to least pressure sensitive, was vibrio parahaemolyticus < yersinia enterocolitica < listeria monocytogenes < salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium < s. enterica serovar enteritidis < escherichia coli o157:h7 approximately equal to staphylococcus aureus < shigella flexneri. for each organism there existed a pressure range in which log(number of survivors) had a near linear relationship when plotted versus treatment pressure level. in this study, a decimal reduction pressure (dp) value  was defined and used to measure the sensitivity of these pathogens to pressure changes. l. monocytogenes and v. parahaemolyticus were most sensitive to pressure changes, and s. flexneri was most resistant. the d(p) values were 16.3 mpa for l. monocytogenes, 21.7 mpa for v. parahaemolyticus, and 127.0 mpa for s. flexneri. the most pressure-resistant gram-negative bacterium, s. flexneri, and most pressure-resistant gram-positive bacterium, s. aureus, were treated at 50 degrees c and pressures of 0.1 to 650 mpa for 10 min. high temperature considerably enhanced pressure inactivation of these two organisms and affected their sensitivities to pressure changes. the effect of treatment time on the d(p) values of l. monocytogenes and v. parahaemolyticus was also determined, and it was found that it did not significantly affect their d(p) values.

TI  == the mammalian ionic environment dictates microbial susceptibility to antimicrobial defense peptides.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) have been shown in animal and human systems to be effective natural antibiotics. however, it is unclear how they convey protection; they often appear inactive when assayed under culture conditions applied to synthetic antibiotics. this inactivation has been associated with loss of function in physiological concentrations of nacl or serum. in this study we show  that the balance of host ionic conditions dictate microbial sensitivity to amps.  carbonate is identified as the critical ionic factor present in mammalian tissues that imparts the ability of amps such as cathelicidins and defensins to kill at physiological nacl concentrations. after adapting to carbonate-containing solutions, global changes occur in staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli structure and gene expression despite no change in growth rate. our findings show that changes in cell wall thickness and sigma factor b expression correspond to the increased susceptibility to the amp ll-37. these observations provide new insight into the factors involved in enabling function of innate immune effector  molecules, and suggest that discovery of new antimicrobials should specifically target pathogens as they exist in the host and not the distinctly different phenotype of bacteria grown in culture broth.

TI  == bapa, a large secreted protein required for biofilm formation and host colonization of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis.
AB  == in environmental settings, biofilms represent the common way of life of microorganisms. salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, the most frequent cause  of gastroenteritis in developed countries, produces a biofilm whose matrix is mainly composed of curli fimbriae and cellulose. in contrast to other bacterial biofilms, no proteinaceous compound has been reported to participate in the formation of this matrix. here, we report the discovery of bapa, a large cell-surface protein required for biofilm formation by s. enteritidis. deletion of bapa caused the loss of the capacity to form a biofilm whereas the overexpression of a chromosomal copy of bapa increased the biofilm biomass formation. we provide evidence that overproduction of curli fimbriae and not cellulose can compensate for the biofilm deficiency of a bapa mutant strain. bapa is secreted through a type i protein secretion system (bapbcd) situated downstream of the bapa gene and was found to be loosely associated with the cell  surface. experiments with mixed bacterial populations positive or negative for bapa showed that bapa minus cells are not recruited into the biofilm matrix. the  expression of bapa is coordinated with that of genes encoding curli fimbriae and  cellulose, through the action of csgd. studies on the contribution of bapa to s.  enteritidis pathogenesis revealed that orally inoculated animals with a bapa-deficient strain survived longer than those inoculated with the wild-type strain. also, a bapa mutant strain showed a significantly lower colonization rate at the intestinal cell barrier and consequently a decreased efficiency for organ  invasion compared with the wild-type strain. taken together, these data demonstrate that bapa contributes both to biofilm formation and invasion through  the regular salmonella infection route.

TI  == qualitatively distinct patterns of cytokines are released by human dendritic cells in response to different pathogens.
AB  == dendritic cells produce cytokines that regulate the class of the adaptive immune  response. microbial recognition is mediated, at least in part, by pattern recognition receptors such as toll-like receptors, which influence dendritic cell maturation. in humans it is not yet clear how intact pathogens modulate the developing immune response. to address the effects of intact pathogens on the maturation and effector functions of human dendritic cells, we investigated their responses to a number of microbial pathogens. we studied a range of micro-organisms including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium), gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus aureus) and atypical bacteria (mycobacterium tuberculosis and mycoplasma hominis) as well as  the human protozoal parasite trichomonas vaginalis. the micro-organisms were fixed in formaldehyde to prevent replication whilst preserving surface morphology. all the pathogens induced similar up-regulation of dendritic cell activation-associated cell surface markers but there was a profound difference in the patterns of cytokines produced by the stimulated dendritic cells. some pathogens (e. coli, salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium and s. aureus) induced interleukin-12 (il-12), il-10 and interferon-alpha whereas others (m. tuberculosis, mycoplasma hominis and t. vaginalis) induced only il-10. this differential effect was not altered by costimulation of the dendritic cells through cd40. these results support the notion that human dendritic cells are plastic in their response to microbial stimuli and that the nature of the pathogen dictates the response of the dendritic cell.

AB  == objective: to evaluate effectiveness of 4% peroxymonosulfate disinfectant applied as a mist to surfaces in a large animal hospital as measured by recovery of staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. design: field  trial. sample population: polyester transparencies inoculated with bacteria. procedure: polyester transparencies were inoculated with s aureus or s typhimurium and placed in various locations in the hospital. after mist application of the peroxygen disinfectant, viable bacterial numbers were quantified and compared with growth from control transparencies to assess reduction in bacterial count. results: when applied as a mist directed at environmental surfaces contaminated with a geometric mean of 4.03 x 10(7) cfus of s aureus (95% confidence interval [ci], 3.95 x 10(7) to 4.11 x 10(7)) or 6.17 x 10(6) cfus of s typhimurium (95% cl, 5.55 x 10(6) to 6.86 x 10(6)), 4% peroxymonosulfate reduced the geometric mean number of viable s aureus by 3.04 x  10(7) cfus (95% cl, 8.6 x 10(5) to 1.7 x 10(6)) and s typhimurium by 3.97 x 10(6) cfus (95% cl, 8.6 x 10(5) to 3.5 x 10(6)). conclusions and clinical relevance: environmental disinfection with directed mist application of a 4% peroxymonosulfate solution was successful in reducing counts of bacterial cfus by > 99.9999%. directed mist application with this peroxygen disinfectant as evaluated in this study appeared to be an effective and efficient means of environmental disinfection in a large animal veterinary hospital and would be less disruptive than more traditional approaches to intensive environmental cleaning and disinfection.

TI  == inactivation of staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis in tryptic soy broth and caviar samples by high pressure processing.
AB  == we studied the action of high pressure processing on the inactivation of two foodborne pathogens, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538 and salmonella enteritidis atcc 13076, suspended in a culture medium and inoculated into caviar samples. the baroresistance of the two pathogens in a tryptic soy broth suspension at a concentration of 10(8)-10(9) colony-forming units/ml was tested for continuous and cycled pressurization in the 150- to 550-mpa range and for 15-min treatments  at room temperature. the increase of cycle number permitted the reduction of the  pressure level able to totally inactivate both microorganisms in the tryptic soy  broth suspension, whereas the effect of different procedure times on complete inactivation of the microorganisms inoculated into caviar was similar.

TI  == role of the acrab-tolc efflux pump in determining susceptibility of haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415 (mic range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however,  on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. insertional inactivation of the h. influenzae acrb or tolc gene in strain nb65044 (rd strain kw20) increased  susceptibility to lbm415, confirming a role for the acrab-tolc pump in determining resistance. consistent with this, sequencing of a pcr fragment generated with primers flanking the acrra region from an lbm415-hypersusceptible  h. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acra. inactivation  of acrb or tolc in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to lbm415 (mic of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. examination of acrr, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. supporting this, nb65044 acrr mutants selected by exposure to lbm415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to lbm415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.

TI  == the nematode panagrellus redivivus is susceptible to killing by human pathogens at 37 degrees c.
AB  == caenorhabditis elegans has been used as a host for the study of bacteria that cause disease in mammals. however, a significant limitation of the model is that  c. elegans is not viable at 37 degrees c. we report that the gonochoristic nematode panagrellus redivivus survives at 37 degrees c and maintains its life cycle at temperatures up to and including 31.5 degrees c. the c. elegans pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, but not yersinia pseudotuberculosis, reduced p. redivivus lifespan. of four strains of burkholderia multivorans tested, one reduced p. redivivus lifespan at both temperatures, one was avirulent at both temperatures and two strains reduced p. redivivus lifespan only at 37 degrees c. the mechanism by which one of these strains killed p. redivivus at 37 degrees c, but not at 25 degrees c, was investigated further. killing required viable bacteria, did not involve bacterial invasion of tissues, is unlikely to be due to a diffusible, bacterial toxin and was not associated with increased numbers of live bacteria within the intestine of the worm. we believe b. multivorans may kill p. redivivus by a temperature-regulated mechanism similar to b. pseudomallei killing of c. elegans.

TI  == peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. we used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive nthi strain r2866 (also called int1). over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward r2866 in a dose-dependent manner. five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (kqrtsirategclps; clone hi3/17),  while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. all of the bactericidal  phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of  clinical nthi isolates and h. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica) bacteria. these data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of blood isolates from a teaching hospital in north india.
AB  == bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality worldwide. in this study, we examined antimicrobial susceptibility patterns by reviewing the data on 5,704 blood samples that were collected from patients with fever/sepsis admitted to government medical college and hospital, chandigarh, india, over a period of 1 year from august 2003 to july 2004. among the 567 qualifying samples, pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.75%), escherichia coli (15.17%), klebsiella pneumoniae (14.99%), and salmonella enterica serovar typhi (12.87%) were the most frequently isolated gram-negative bacteria other than citrobacter, acinetobacter, proteus, and enterobacter spp. collectively accounting for 80.96% of the isolates. staphylococus aureus (13.86%) and enterococcus feacalis (2.35%) were most frequently isolated gram-positive bacteria other than other streptococcus and staphylococcus spp. collectively accounting for 18% of the isolates. among the antibiotics used for susceptibility testing of gram-negative isolates, amikacin showed higher activity (76.61%) against enterobacteriaceae and ciprofloxacin (65.17%) against non-fermenters. however, cefoperazone + sulbactum showed the highest activity (82.66%) among all  gram-negative isolates. for gram-positive isolates, vancomycin (100%), ciprofloxacin (89.74%) showed the highest activity against staphylococcus spp. combinations of antibiotics are often prescribed as emperic therapy for bacteremia, especially for gram-negative pathogens. hence the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of blood isolates reported here may be a useful guide for physicians initiating emperic therapy with antibiotics.

TI  == aerosolization as novel sanitizer delivery system to reduce food-borne pathogens.
AB  == aims: as a preliminary experiment on new sanitizer delivery tools, the efficacy of aerosolized sanitizer on food-borne pathogens was investigated in larger model chamber system. methods: peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide were aerosolized in a model system against artificially inoculated target micro-organisms on laboratory media. cultures of four different food-borne pathogens were inoculated and affixed onto three different heights (bottom, wall and ceiling), and three different orientations (face-down, vertical and face-down) inside a commercial semi-trailer cabinet (14.6 x 2.6 x 2.8 m). sanitizer was aerosolized into 2 microm droplet size fog and treated for 1 h at ambient temperature. results: populations of bacillus cereus, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhimurium were reduced by an average of 3.09, 7.69, 6.93 and 8.18 log units per plate respectively. interestingly, l. innocua, staph. aureus, and salm. typhimurium showed statistically not different (p >/= 0.05) reduction patterns relative to height and orientation that were never expected in a spraying system. conclusions: aerosolized sanitizers diffuse like gaseous sanitizers. significance and impact of the study: aerosolization has great potential for use in commercial applications.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of myotoxic phospholipases a2 from crotalid snake venoms and synthetic peptide variants derived from their c-terminal region.
AB  == a short peptide derived from the c-terminal region of bothrops asper myotoxin ii, a lys49 phospholipase a(2) (pla(2)), was previously found to reproduce the bactericidal activity of its parent molecule. in this study, a panel of eight pla(2) myotoxins purified from crotalid snake venoms, including both lys49 and asp49-type isoforms, were all found to express bactericidal activity, indicating  that this may be a common action of the group iia pla(2) protein family. a series of 10 synthetic peptide variants, based on the original c-terminal sequence 115-129 of myotoxin ii and its triple tyr-->trp substituted peptide p115-w3, were characterized. in vitro assays for bactericidal, cytolytic and anti-endotoxic activities of these peptides suggest a general correlation between the number of  tryptophan substitutions introduced and microbicidal potency, both against gram-negative (salmonella typhimurium) and gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus)  bacteria. peptide variants with high bactericidal activity also tended to be more cytolytic towards skeletal muscle c2c12 myoblasts, thus limiting their potential  in vivo use. however, the peptide variant pem-2 (kkwrwwlkalakk) showed reduced toxicity towards muscle cells, while retaining high bactericidal potency. this peptide also showed the highest endotoxin-neutralizing activity in vitro, and was shown to functionally interact with lipopolysaccharide (lps) using a chimeric bacteria model. the bactericidal and anti-endotoxic properties of pem-2, combined with its relatively low toxicity towards eukaryotic cells, highlight it as a promising candidate for further evaluation of its antimicrobial potential in vivo.

TI  == antimicrobial action of carvacrol at different stages of dual-species biofilm development by staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB  == the effects of carvacrol, a natural biocide, on dual-species biofilms formed by staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were investigated with a constant-depth film fermentor. biofilm development reached a  quasi-steady state in 12 days at 25 degrees c with s. aureus predominance ( approximately 99%). cryosectional analysis detected viable s. aureus and s. enterica serovar typhimurium at depths of 320 and 180 mum from the film surface,  respectively. carvacrol pulses (1.0 mmol/h) inhibited s. aureus by 2.5 log cfu/biofilm during the early stages of film formation, ultimately causing a significant reduction (p < 0.001) of the staphylococcal population at quasi-steady state. initial carvacrol pulsing elicited a 3 log cfu/biofilm reduction in viable s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and additional periodic carvacrol pulses instigated significant inhibition of salmonellae (1 to 2 log cfu/biofilm) during biofilm development. carvacrol pulsing reduced protein levels fivefold (p < 0.001) during initial biofilm development. comparative studies with a peroxide-based commercial sanitizer (spor-klenz rtu) revealed that this commercial sanitizer was more biocidal than carvacrol during early biofilm development. when the biofilm reached quasi-steady state, however, periodic pulses with 1 mmol of carvacrol per h (p = 0.021) elicited a significantly higher inhibition than spor-klenz rtu (p = 0.772). dual-species microcolonies formed under the influence of continuously fed low carvacrol concentrations (1.0 mmol/h) but failed to develop into a mature quasi-steady-state biofilm and did not reach  any stage of film formation in the presence of high concentrations (5.0 mmol/h).  these data show that carvacrol is an effective natural intervention to control dual-species biofilm formation.

AB  == antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. however, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin b, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland. the checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. the aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. in one case salmonella enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. additive effects were predominant--49%. in 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations fic indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. in combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. the best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.

TI  == growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
AB  == twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (alcaligenes faecalis, aspergillus niger, bacillus stearothermophilus, geotrichum candidum, lactobacillus acidophilus, penicillium expansum, pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica ser. typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. they were also tested for specific activity against s. aureus 9144 and b. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. honey inhibited bacterial  growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. the ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. antibacterially active samples in this study included montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. furthermore, the bacteria were not  uniformly affected by honey. varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of s. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. b. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay  and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included a. faecalis and l. acidophilus. non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against b. stearothermophilus. further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.

TI  == premature salmonella typhimurium growth inhibition in competition with other gram-negative organisms is redox potential regulated via rpos induction.
AB  == aims: to identify the role of oxidation-reduction (redox) potential in the premature growth inhibition and rpos induction in salmonella serotype typhimurium in competitive growth experiments. methods and results: oxidation-reduction potential was measured throughout the growth of a minority population of salm. typhimurium in mixed cultures with other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. a lux-based reporter was also used to evaluate rpos activity in salm.  typhimurium in competitor studies. in a mixed culture, the multiplication of a minority population of salm. typhimurium was inhibited when competing gram-negative organisms entered the stationary phase. this was not seen when the  competing flora was gram-positive. the change in redox potential during growth in mixed cultures was closely linked to the inhibition of salm. typhimurium growth by gram-negative competitors. an artificially induced drop in redox potential earlier during growth in mixed cultures with gram-negative organisms reduced the  time to rpos induction in salm. typhimurium and thus inhibited its multiplication prematurely. in contrast, rpos induction and growth inhibition were prevented under high redox potential conditions. conclusions: this work shows that the inhibitory activity of competitive organisms can be mediated through their effect on redox potential-regulated rpos induction. significance and impact of the study: redox potential is shown to be an important determinant of salm. typhimurium growth, an observation with practical implications both for its control and detection.

TI  == a rapid method for determining the antimicrobial activity of novel natural molecules.
AB  == preservatives used in the agro-food industries may be of natural origin or obtained chemically. because of the increasing interest of consumers in food products that contain only natural ingredients, studies on preservative molecules of natural origin, such as organic acids or peptides, have been reported in the past several years. such studies, which require numerous assays, may be limited by the large amount of molecules required. microscale assays provide an opportunity for testing natural components available in low quantity. this study  examined a rapid method that used microplates for the evaluation of anti-microbial substances. the method was validated using five foodborne pathogens. it required a low amount of product and was convenient for the determination of correlations between the bacterial growth inhibition and concentration of the antimicrobial substance.

AB  == antimicrobial activity of water-soluble arrowroot tea extract was evaluated against escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus in ground beef and mushroom soup. the concentrations of arrowroot tea used were 0, 3, and 6% (wt/wt) for ground beef and 0, 1, 5, and 10% (wt/vol) for mushroom soup. samples without tea  extract were considered controls. each sample was stored for 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days at 7 degrees c for ground beef and for 0, 1, 3, and 5 days at 35 degrees c for mushroom soup. on each sampling time, proper dilutions were spread plated on  each pathogen-specific agar. viable cell counts of each pathogen were performed after incubation at 35 degrees c for 24 to 48 h. for ground beef, salmonella enteritidis and l. monocytogenes were slightly suppressed by approximately 1.5 log, compared with the control, on day 7 at 3 and 6% arrowroot tea treatment. for mushroom soup, all test pathogens were suppressed by 6.5, 4.7, 3.4, and 4.3 log at 5% and 6.0, 4.7, 5.0, and 4.3 log at 10% against e. coli o157:h7, salmonella enteritidis, l. monocytogenes, and s. aureus, respectively, compared with the control on day 5. mushroom soup with 1% arrowroot tea also showed 2.3- and 2.7-log growth suppression of salmonella enteritidis and s. aureus, respectively, compared with the control on day 5. this study showed that the use of arrowroot tea would effectively inhibit the microbial growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive foodborne pathogens in various foods, especially liquid foods.

TI  == international dissemination of antibiotic resistant strains of bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the increasing incidence of methicillin and multiple resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) in nosocomial infections is mainly associated with a wide, international dissemination of well defined clonal lineages (epidemic mrsa) which are clearly different from community acquired mrsa by molecular typing patterns and structure of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome containing the meca gene. although belonging to a definite subpopulation within the species enterococcus faecium, hospital associated vancomycin resistant isolates also containing the esp gene have very likely evolved by acquisition of glycopeptide resistance gene  clusters at different occasions and at different times by a susceptible already disseminated clonal lineage. there is obviously a continuous selection of new types of extended spectrum beta-lactamases in enterobacteriaceae and also horizontal spread of bla-genes. intrahospital dissemination of particular strains has often been observed, however, an international dissemination until now has been described only for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium producing the ctx-m-3 enzyme. multiresistant isolates of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium phage type dt104 harbour a multiresistant gene cluster with resistance genes from taxonomically more unrelated species (tetg, flor, bla(pse1)). although in vitro transduction has been demonstrated, this gene cluster has only rarely been reported from isolates exhibiting other phage patterns of the same serovar or from other serovars of s. enterica.

TI  == control of salmonella dissemination in vivo by macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-3alpha/ccl20.
AB  == while chemokines are clearly important in the generation of protective immunity,  the role of individual chemokines in the control of bacterial infection is still  poorly understood. in this study, we investigated the role of macrophage inflammatory protein (mip)-3alpha/ccl20, a chemokine that attracts activated t and b lymphocytes and immature dendritic cells, in host responses to bacterial infection. ccl20 production was induced in subcutaneous tissue in the balb/c mouse in response to salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and zymosan, with s. enteritidis being the most potent. s. enteritidis induced ccl20 production in the spleen following either oral administration or injection into the peritoneal cavity. in contrast, no increase was observed in the peyer's patches. in this model, following intraperitoneal injection, dose-dependent colonization of the spleen and peyer's patches by s. enteritidis, expression of ifngamma and il-4, and production of antibodies against the s. enteritidis surface antigen sefa were observed. prior treatment with neutralizing antibodies  against ccl20 enhanced bacterial dissemination to the spleen and peyer's patches  and strongly biased the ifngamma/il-4 ratio towards a type 2 profile in the spleen, while the humoral response was unaffected. in contrast, treatment with neutralizing anti-mip-1alpha/ccl3 antibodies enhanced the bacterial burden in the peyer's patches but not in the spleen, had no significant effect on the cytokine  ratio, but significantly inhibited anti-sefa production. together, these results  demonstrate an important role for ccl20 in the control of bacterial infection and more specifically in the regulation of cell-mediated immunity against intracellular bacteria such as s. enteritidis.

AB  == aims: to evaluate the effect of crude water-soluble arrowroot tea extracts on microbial growth of food-borne pathogens in liquid medium and to confirm the damage to bacterial cells using transmission electronic microscopy (tem). methods and results: inhibition of growth of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus was investigated using brain heart infusion (bhi) broth containing 0 (control), 0.63, 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0% (w/v) arrowroot tea. bacterial cell counts were performed on specific selective agar on days 0, 1, 3 and 5. bhi containing 5.0% arrowroot tea extract showed a 6-7 log suppression of growth for all test strains on days 3 and 5, compared with the control. even 0.63% arrowroot tea effectively  inhibited microbial growth of all test strains on day 5. tem images of the samples treated with 5.0% arrowroot tea revealed the rupture of cell walls and nonhomogeneous disposition of cytoplasmic materials within treated bacteria. conclusions: crude water-soluble arrowroot tea extract strongly inhibited microbial growth of all test pathogens in liquid medium. significance and impact  of the study: water-soluble arrowroot tea extract has the potential to be used directly on foods or as a spray on the surfaces of food handling and processing facilities in order to prevent microbial growth of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB  == comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. this process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial dna. many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. two situations can be distinguished: vibrio cholerae, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. these prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile dna elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. in many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific dna sequences. in addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. the current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.

TI  == differential effects of lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid on the primary antibody response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin of chickens selected for high or low antibody responses to sheep red blood cells.
AB  == various bacterial components are potent activators of the innate immune system and probably (in)directly determine subsequent specific immune responses. therefore, effects of i.v. administered salmonella enteriditis-derived lipopolysaccharide (lps) and staphylococcus aureus-derived lipoteichoic acid (lta), respectively, on the primary antibody (ab) response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (klh) were studied in cocks from 2 lines divergently selected for high (h line) and low (l line) ab responses to srbc. the ab responses to klh were significantly affected by a line-by-treatment-by-time interaction. significantly  higher ab titers to klh, s. aureus lta, and s. enteriditis lps were found in h line birds than in the l line birds. ab titers to klh were enhanced if the chickens were intravenously pretreated 24 h earlier with lta but decreased if the chickens were intravenously pretreated 24 h earlier with lps. ab responses to s.  enteriditis lps were significantly enhanced when birds were immunized with klh or pretreated with s. aureus lta. ab responses to s. aureus lta were also significantly enhanced when birds were immunized with klh or pretreated with lta  and subsequently immunized with klh. our findings suggest that lta and lps have immunomodulatory features in chickens, albeit in opposite directions. in addition, klh acted in an immunomodulatory role too. possible mechanisms underlying our observations and the role of lta and lps in polarization of the specific immune response in chickens are discussed.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == functional comparison of the mouse dc-sign, signr1, signr3 and langerin, c-type lectins.
AB  == the mouse (m) dc-sign family consists of several homologous type ii transmembrane proteins located in close proximity on chromosome 8 and having a single carboxyl  terminal carbohydrate recognition domain. we first used transfected non-macrophage cell lines to compare the polysaccharide and microbial uptake capacities of three of these lectins--dc-sign, signr1 and signr3--to another homologue mlangerin. each molecule shares a potential mannose-recognition epn-motif in its carbohydrate recognition domain. using an anti-tag antibody to follow tag-labeled transfectants, we found that each molecule could be internalized, although the rates differed. however, mdc-sign was unable to take up fitc-dextran, fitc-ovalbumin, zymosan or heat-killed candida albicans. the other three lectins showed distinct carbohydrate recognition properties, assessed by blocking fitc-dextran uptake at 37 degrees c and by mannan binding activity at 4 degrees c. furthermore, only signr1 was efficient in mediating the capture by transfected cells of gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, while none of the lectins tested were competent to capture gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus. interestingly, transfectants with signr1 lacking the cytoplasmic domain were capable of binding  fitc-zymosan in a manner that was abolished by edta or mannan, but not laminarin. in addition, resident peritoneal cd11b+ cells expressing signr1 bound zymosan at  4 degrees c in concert with a laminarin-sensitive receptor. therefore these homologous c-type lectins have distinct recognition patters for microbes despite  similarities in the carbohydrate recognition domains.

TI  == injury recovery of foodborne pathogens in high hydrostatic pressure treated milk  during storage.
AB  == bacteria are expected to be injured or killed by high hydrostatic pressure (hhp). this depends on pressure levels, species and strain of the microorganism and subsequent storage. injured bacteria may be repaired which could affect the microbiological quality of foodstuffs with an important safety consideration especially in low acid food products. in this study two gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes ca and staphylococcus aureus 485) and two gram-negative (escherichia coli o157:h7 933 and salmonella enteritidis fda) relatively pressure resistant strains of foodborne pathogens were pressurized at 350, 450 and 550 mpa in milk (ph 6.65) and stored at 4, 22 and 30 degrees c. the results of shelf life studies indicated two types of injury, i1 and i2, for all the pathogens studied.  it is obvious that i2 type injury is a major injury and after its repair (i2 to i1), the cells can form colonies on non-selective but not on selective agar. the  formation of colonies on both selective and non-selective agar occurs only after  full recovery of injury (i1 to ac). the results presented in this study show that even if injured cells are not detected immediately after hhp treatment, i2 type injury could be potentially present in the food system. therefore, it is imperative that shelf life studies must be conducted over a period of time for potential repair of i2 type injury either to detectable injury (i1) or to active  cells (ac) to ascertain microbiological safety of low acid food products.

TI  == harmonization of antimicrobial susceptibility testing among veterinary diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries.
AB  == a total of 100 bacterial strains (25 escherichia coli, 25 salmonella enterica, 25 staphylococcus aureus, and 25 enterococcus strains) and four reference strains were tested for susceptibility toward 8-12 antimicrobial agents in 12 veterinary  diagnostic laboratories in the five nordic countries using routine methodology. in addition, the 25 enterococcus strains were identified to species level. a total of 22,598 (97.2%) out of 23,259 test results were in accordance when the data were categorized as susceptible or resistant. when the reported results were categorized according to the national committee of clinical laboratory standards  breakpoints, the percentage of concordant results increased to 98.4% and the performance between laboratories varied between 94.2 and 99.4% concordant results. for e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella, all laboratories except one had  more than 97% concordant results, whereas for enterococcus spp., two laboratories had less than 90% concordant results. susceptibility testing of salmonella to fluoroquinolones gave rise to almost 0.5% nonconcordant results and susceptibility testing of s. aureus to vancomycin resulted in that 1.8% of the strains were incorrectly reported as vancomycin resistant. ten laboratories identified the enterococcus spp. to species level. all five enterococcus faecium  and 10 enterococcus faecalis selected from the strain collection at the danish veterinary institute were correctly identified by all laboratories, whereas some  problems were observed identifying other enterococcal species. this study showed  a good performance and agreement in antimicrobial susceptibility testing at the 12 participating laboratories and that surveillance data covering susceptibility  test results of e. coli, s. aureus, and salmonella from animals in the nordic countries are comparable. but it also showed that some aspects can be improved. in addition, the study showed that the different laboratories are capable of identifying e. faecalis and e. faecium.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
AB  == a water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. this 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (lmwc), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kda, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with  a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. lmwc has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including bacillus cereus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does lmwc. accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against e. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of lmwc.

TI  == inhibition of foodborne bacteria by the lactoperoxidase system in a beef cube system.
AB  == biopreservatives are being developed to inhibit the growth of foodborne pathogens and thus improve food safety. the lactoperoxidase system (lps) is a naturally occurring system that has potential for use as an antimicrobial agent in foods. growth of single strains of the pathogens staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa and beef microflora were assessed on lps-treated meat surfaces in an experimental system.  beef cubes inoculated with approximately 10(4) cfu cm(-2) of bacteria were treated with the lps and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h, 12 degrees c for 7 days or in a chilling regime: 12 to -1 degrees c over 1 week and held at -1 degrees c for 4 weeks. treatment with lps was more effective at storage temperatures non-permissive for rapid bacterial growth with strong inhibition of  growth achieved on lps-treated cubes at 12 degrees c and reduction in pathogen viable counts at chilling temperatures. at chilling temperatures, the lps inhibited the growth of native pseudomonads but did not prevent the development of native lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == detection of pcr amplicons from bacterial pathogens using microsphere agglutination.
AB  == for rapid and inexpensive detection of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplicons, a novel microsphere agglutination assay has been developed. pcr is carried out using biotinylated forward and reverse primers, and the amplified dna fragments are able to agglutinate streptavidin-coated microspheres (5.7 microm in diameter). purification of pcr amplicons is unnecessary when initial primer concentrations are 250 nm. agglutination can be identified visually within 2 min  without any additional equipment or reagents. using listeriolysin (lisa)-specific biotinylated primers, we have successfully detected and identified listeria monocytogenes lisa+ cells among salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli o157:h7 cells. the simplicity of this protocol considerably reduces the time and cost of diagnostic pcr experiments. this procedure is potentially useful for various studies and field applications.

TI  == infection-induced up-regulation of the costimulatory molecule 4-1bb in osteoblastic cells and its inhibitory effect on m-csf/rankl-induced in vitro osteoclastogenesis.
AB  == bacterial infection sometimes impairs bone metabolism. in this study, we infected the osteoblastic cell line mc3t3-e1 with mycobacterium bovis bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg) and identified genes that were up-regulated in the bcg-infected cells by the suppression subtractive hybridization method. a gene encoding 4-1bb (cd137), a member of the tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor family, was found to be one of the up-regulated genes. up-regulation of 4-1bb was also observed by infection with escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and staphylococcus aureus, and by treatment with lipopolysaccharides and heat-killed  bcg. bone marrow cells and the macrophage-like cell lines j774 and raw264.7 were  found to express 4-1bb ligand (4-1bbl). recombinant 4-1bb (r4-1bb) that was immobilized on culture plates strongly inhibited macrophage colony stimulating factor (m-csf)/receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappab ligand (rankl)-induced in vitro osteoclast formation from bone marrow cells. anti-4-1bbl antibody also inhibited osteoclast formation to a lesser extent, indicating involvement of reverse signaling through 4-1bbl during inhibition of osteoclast formation. a casein kinase i (cki) inhibitor markedly suppressed the inhibitory effect of r4-1bb on m-csf/rankl-induced osteoclast formation, suggesting that cki might be  involved in 4-1bb/4-1bbl reverse signaling. r4-1bb showed no effects on m-csf- or rankl-induced phosphorylation of i-kappab, erk1/2, p38, or jnk, whereas rankl-induced phosphorylation of akt, a downstream target of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k), was completely abolished by r4-1bb, suggesting that 4-1bb/4-1bbl reverse signaling may interfere with pi3k/akt pathway. r4-1bb also abolished rankl-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated t cells-2. this study may elucidate a novel role of 4-1bb in cell metabolism, especially osteoclastogenesis.

TI  == tolerance of salmonella enteritidis and staphylococcus aureus to surface cleaning and household bleach.
AB  == effective cleaning and sanitizing of food preparation sites is important because  pathogens are readily spread to food contact surfaces after preparation of contaminated raw products. tolerance of salmonella enteritidis and staphylococcus aureus to surface cleaning by wiping with regular, microfiber, and antibacterial-treated cloths was investigated. wiping with cleaning cloths resulted in a considerable reduction of microorganisms from surfaces, despite the greater difficulty in removing s. aureus than salmonella enteritidis. depending on the cloth type, s. aureus were reduced on surfaces from initial numbers of approximately 10(5) cfu/100 cm2 to numbers from less than 4 cfu/100 cm2 (below the detection limit) to 100 cfu/100 cm2. directly after the cloths were used to clean the contaminated surfaces, they contained high numbers of bacteria (10(4) to 10(5) cfu/100 cm2), except for the disposable antibacterial-treated cloths, in which no bacteria could be detected. the tolerance of these pathogens to sodium hypochlorite was studied in the suspension test and in cloths. s. aureus showed a better tolerance for sodium hypochlorite than salmonella enteritidis. inactivation of microorganisms in cloths required a higher concentration of sodium hypochlorite than was needed in the suspension test. repeated exposure to  sodium hypochlorite, however, resulted in an increase in susceptibility to this compound. this study provides essential information about the transfer of bacteria when wiping surfaces and highlights the need for a hygiene procedure with cleaning cloths that sufficiently avoids cross-contamination in the household environment.

TI  == bacterial infection induces expression of functional mhc class ii molecules in murine and human osteoblasts.
AB  == a growing body of evidence has shown that bacterially challenged osteoblasts can  play a significant role in the initiation of inflammatory immune responses at sites of bone disease. we have recently demonstrated the surprising ability of osteoblasts exposed to bacteria to express cd40, a molecule that plays a critical costimulatory role in the activation of t lymphocytes. in the present study, we have extended our investigations into the ability of osteoblasts to interact with cd4+ t lymphocytes by determining the expression of antigen-presenting major histocompatibility complex (mhc) class ii molecules in murine and human osteoblasts following exposure to two common pathogens of bone, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella. cultured osteoblasts were found to respond rapidly to bacterial challenge by induction of mrna encoding mhc class ii molecules or its transcriptional regulator. increased mrna expression translated into expression of mhc class ii proteins in murine and human osteoblasts as determined by western blot analysis and by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent microscopy. furthermore, the increased surface expression of these molecules on osteoblasts exposed to bacteria was confirmed by facs analysis. finally, we show that bacterial challenge results in the elevated functional expression of mhc class ii molecules on osteoblasts by demonstrating the enhanced ability of these cells to  interact with t lymphocytes and to initiate antigen-specific t cell activation. taken together, these data suggest a previously unappreciated role for osteoblasts in the initiation of t lymphocyte activation at sites of bacterial infection in bone tissue.

AB  == the phosphoenolpyruvate : sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) catalyses translocation with concomitant phosphorylation of sugars and hexitols and it regulates metabolism in response to the availability of carbohydrates. the pts forms an interface between energy and signal transduction and its inhibition is likely to have pleiotropic effects. it is present in about one-third of bacteria  with fully sequenced genomes, including many common pathogens, but does not occur in eukaryotes. enzyme i (ptsi) is the first component of the divergent protein phosphorylation cascade. ptsi deletions were constructed in salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae and virulence of the mutants was characterized in an intraperitoneal mouse model. the log(attenuation) values were 2.3, 1.4 and 0.9 for the sal. typhimurium, sta. aureus and h. influenzae ptsi mutants, respectively. the degree of attenuation is correlated with the complexity of the respective pts, which comprises approximately 40 components in sal. typhimurium, but only 5 in h. influenzae.

TI  == survival of staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis on salted sardines (sardina pilchardus) during ripening.
AB  == the ripening period for salted sardines ranges from 4 to 6 months, depending on the season. sometimes producing industries need to distribute the product earlier owing to market needs, and when this happens the product's safety needs to be assured. the purpose of this work was to study the survival of staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis on salted sardines during a ripening period of  115 days. salted sardines were inoculated with pure cultures of s. aureus and salmonella enteritidis (10(5) cfu/g of fish on day 0). after 5 days of ripening,  the water activity value for the sardines decreased from 0.93 to 0.69. the survival of both pathogens and that of total viable cells were evaluated during the ripening process. total viable counts decreased by 2 log units over the 115-day ripening period. salmonella enteritidis and s. aureus survived for 60 and 90 days, respectively. therefore, the use of a 90-day ripening period could be effective in assuring the safety of the final product.

TI  == duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  == background: recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. results: it is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. furthermore, the gc3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. conclusions: the results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. the importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.

TI  == survival of foodborne pathogens on stainless steel surfaces and cross-contamination to foods.
AB  == the retention of bacteria on food contact surfaces increases the risk of cross-contamination of these microorganisms to food. the risk has been considered to be lowered when the surfaces are dry, partly because bacterial growth and survival would be reduced. however, some non-spore-forming bacteria might be able to withstand dry conditions on surfaces for an extensive period of time. in this  study the survival of salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus and campylobacter jejuni on stainless steel surfaces at different initial levels was  determined at room temperature. the transfer rates of these pathogens from kitchen sponges to stainless steel surfaces and from these surfaces to foods were also investigated. staph. aureus was recovered from the surfaces for at least 4 days when the contamination level was high (10(5) cfu/cm2) or moderate (10(3) cfu/cm2). at low levels (10 cfu/cm2), the surviving numbers decreased below the detection limit (4 cfu/100 cm2) within 2 days. s. enteritidis was recovered from  surfaces for at least 4 days at high contamination levels, but at moderate level, the numbers decreased to the detection limit within 24 h and at low level within  1 h. c. jejuni was the most susceptible to slow-air-drying on surfaces; at high contamination levels, the numbers decreased below the detection limit within 4 h. the test microorganisms were readily transmitted from the wet sponges to the stainless steel surfaces and from these surfaces to the cucumber and chicken fillet slices, with the transfer rates varied from 20% to 100%. this study has highlighted the fact that pathogens remain viable on dry stainless steel surfaces and present a contamination hazard for considerable periods of time, dependent on the contamination levels and type of pathogen. systematic studies on the risks of pathogen transfer associated with surface cleaning using contaminated sponges provide quantitative data from which a model of risks assessment in domestic setting could lead.

TI  == chlamydia pneumoniae binds to platelets and triggers p-selectin expression and aggregation: a causal role in cardiovascular disease?
AB  == objective: evidence linking chlamydia pneumoniae to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is expanding. platelets are considered to play an essential role in cardiovascular diseases; however, so far platelets have not been associated with an infectious cause of atherosclerosis. this study aims to clarify the interaction between c pneumoniae and platelets and possibly present a novel mechanism in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. methods and results: the  effects of c pneumoniae on platelet aggregation and secretion were assessed with  lumiaggregometry, and the ability of c pneumoniae to bind to platelets and stimulate expression of p-selectin was analyzed with flow cytometry. we found that c pneumoniae, at a chlamydia:platelet ratio of 1:15, adheres to platelets and triggers p-selectin expression after 1 minute and causes an extensive aggregation and atp secretion after 20 minutes of incubation. inhibition of glycoprotein iib/iiia with arg-gly-asp-ser or abciximab markedly reduced c pneumoniae-induced platelet aggregation. exposure of c pneumoniae to polymyxin b, but not elevated temperature, abolished the stimulatory effects on platelet activation, suggesting that chlamydial lipopolysaccharide has an active role. in  contrast, other tested bacteria had no or only moderate effects on platelet functions. conclusions: our findings demonstrate a new concept of how c pneumoniae activates platelets and thereby may cause atherosclerosis and thrombotic vascular occlusion.

AB  == association of rifampicin with polybutylcyanoacrylate nanoparticles provided considerable enhancement of drug antibacterial activity. in vitro nanoparticle-loaded rifampicin was more active against staphylococcus aureus and  mycobacterium avium, localized in isolated alveolar macrophages. level of rifampicin in macrophages increased 2-3-fold after incubation with rifampicinloaded nanoparticles comparing to the free drug. high therapeutic efficacy of colloidal rifampicin was demonstrated in vivo. use of nanoparticles provided 2-fold increase in rifampicin efficacy, comparing with the free drug at  treatment of staphylococcus sepsis in mice. single administration of nanoparticulate rifampicin in the dose 25 mg/kg resulted in 80% survival of mice  with salmonellosis, while 50 mg/kg of free rifampicin could provide only 10% survival. it may be considered that high antibacterial efficacy of rifampicin bound to nanoparticles is due to its effective delivery to macrophages.

TI  == inflammatory agonist stimulation and signal pathway of oxidative burst in neonatal chicken heterophils.
AB  == heterophils are the predominant polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) in poultry. the oxidative burst of activated heterophils, which generates reactive oxygen species (ros), is one of the first line cellular defenses against invading microorganisms. in this report, the oxidative response of heterophils from neonatal chicks to in vitro stimulation by various inflammatory agonists was investigated using a fluorescence microplate assay. both non-opsonized formalin-killed salmonella enteritidis and staphylococcus aureus were able to stimulate heterophil oxidative burst. the phorbol myristate acetate (pma) was the most potent stimulant for the chicken heterophil oxidative response, whereas, the bacterial cell surface components lipopolysaccharide (lps) and lipoteichoic acid  (lta) were less effective. protein kinase c (pkc) is an essential signaling component regulating heterophil oxidative response to stimulation by pma, lps, lta and s. enteritidis. however, inhibition of pkc did not affect the oxidative response to stimulation by s. aureus, suggesting differential signaling pathway responsible for the activation of oxidative burst by gram-negative s. enteritidis and gram-positive s. aureus. inhibition of mitogen activated protein (map) kinase p38 and extracellular response kinase (erk) by sb 203580 and pd 098059, respectively, did not inhibit activated oxidative burst.

AB  == influence of diacetyl on cellular leakage and/or death of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus; fri-100) and salmonella typhimurium (s. typhimurium) in the presence  and absence of 30% sucrose and nz-amine broth at 37, 45 and 55 degrees c was studied using microbiological and spectrophotmetric techniques. diacetyl exists naturally in starter distillate and is usually added to enhance the flavor at the end of the fermentation process. our objective was to examine its use before the  onset of fermentation towards the safety of fermented products. results showed significant difference (p < 0.05) between control and diacetyl treatments; average mean difference was > 5 log colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml) within 1 hour (h). interesting trends were also observed when differences with respect to  absorbance ratios when data was normalized. results also showed that diacetyl (0.1%) caused more cellular leakage and death of s. aureus at 45 degrees c as compared to 37 degrees c, and that cellular leakage per se was not directly related to death. diacetyl, however, caused rapid death of s. aureus and s. typhimurium in the presence of 30% sucrose and nz-amine broth at 55 degrees c; >  7 log cfu/ml death within 1 and 2 h respectively. we also conducted a study with  commercial starter distillate (7%) and proved its ability to control both organisms under the same test conditions within 1 h at 55 degrees c. it is concluded that diacetyl is a potential candidate for the control of foodborne pathogens especially under low water activity conditions such as those encountered during meat fermentation.

TI  == oxidative burst mediated by toll like receptors (tlr) and cd14 on avian heterophils stimulated with bacterial toll agonists.
AB  == toll-like receptors (tlrs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (pamps) such as lipopolysaccharide (lps) and lipoteichoic acid (lta), which are found in the cell walls of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. this study was conducted to determine if tlrs are present on chicken heterophils and if these receptors mediate oxidative burst. heterophils isolated from neonatal chicks were exposed to gram-negative salmonella enteritidis (se), gram-positive staphylococcus aureus (sa), se-lps, and sa-lta and the oxidative burst quantitated by luminol-dependent chemiluminescence. se, sa, se-lps, and sa-lta stimulated a significant increase in oxidative burst from  heterophils. furthermore, we measured the inhibitory effects of polyclonal antibodies on rat cd14, human tlr2 and tlr4 on the oxidative burst of heterophils when stimulated with lps and lta. the data suggest that tlr2 and tlr4 mediate lps-stimulated oxidative burst while cd14 and tlr2 mediate lta-stimulated oxidative burst in heterophils. this is the first report of pamps from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria interacting with tlrs of avian heterophils.

TI  == functional cd40 expression induced following bacterial infection of mouse and human osteoblasts.
AB  == bacterially induced bone infections often result in significant local inflammatory responses which are coupled with loss of bone. however, the mechanisms necessary for the protective host response, or those responsible for pathogen-induced bone loss, are not clear. recent evidence demonstrates that bacterially infected osteoblasts secrete chemokines and cytokines, suggesting that these cells may have an unappreciated role in supporting localized inflammation. in this study, mouse and human osteoblasts were investigated for their ability to express functional cd40 upon exposure to two important pathogens of bone, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica serovar dublin. bacterial  infection of cultured mouse or human osteoblasts resulted in increased cd40 mrna  and cd40 protein expression induced by either pathogen. importantly, cd40 expression by osteoblasts was functional, as assessed by ligation of this molecule with recombinant, soluble cd154. cd40 activity was assessed by induction of interleukin-6 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in osteoblasts following ligation. cocultures of activated cd4(+) t lymphocytes and  osteoblasts could interact via cd40 and cd154, since an antibody against cd40 could block macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha secretion. taken together, these studies conclusively demonstrate that infected osteoblasts can upregulate expression of functional cd40 molecules which mediate cytokine secretion. this surprising result further supports the notion that bone-forming osteoblasts can directly interact with cd154-expressing cells (i.e., t lymphocytes) and can contribute to the host response during bone infection.

TI  == eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  == this study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. the electrophoretic profile of sds-page showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting  of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. three bacteria species, pseudomonas aureginosa, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/ml). on the other hand, escherichia coli and salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. the present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.

AB  == corticosteroids in bacterial meningitis: a randomised multicentre study on meningitis in adults versus a placebo showed significant benefits of corticoids in terms of reduction in mortality and neurological complications. these results  were essentially observed in pneumococcal infections. the interest in monitoring  blood cultures: several works on staphylococcus aureus bacteremia have confirmed  the necessity of monitoring hemocultures, 48-72 hours following initiation of treatment. the persistence of bacteremia strongly suggests the poor prognosis and endocardial grafting should be envisaged. cardiovascular risk: persisting salmonella enterica bacteremia in an adult aged over 50 must lead to search for a cardiovascular infection, notably mycotic aneurism, in view of the risk of rupture and the necessity of early surgery. this type of infection is observed in 10 to 23% of cases. bacterial endocarditis: the size of the vegetations > 2 cm and the neurological complications of embolic nature are clearly identified as predictive factors of death in endocarditis of drug addicts. early surgery in the case of voluminous vegetations, including in the right endocardium, is therefore  discussed. urinary infections: a randomised study against a placebo in asymptomatic urinary infections of diabetic women showed no significant benefits  of the antibiotherapy on reducing morbidity.

AB  == the objective of this study was to understand more of the innate immune response  to helicobacter pylori by determining the expression of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) in various gastric mucosal tissues and mkn45 gastric cancer cells with or without h. pylori. semi-quantitative taqman rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry were  carried out. the antimicrobial effects of a transfected hbd-2 gene against h. pylori were also evaluated. the results showed that hbd-2 was expressed in inflamed gastric mucosal tissues with h. pylori infection, but not in the absence of h. pylori infection. expression was also detected in gastric cancers in patients with h. pylori infection. expression was induced in the mkn45 gastric cancer cell line by h. pylori in a manner dependent on the abundance of bacteria. hbd-2-transfected 3t3j2-1 cells secreted hbd-2 protein into the culture medium and this protein inhibited growth of h. pylori completely. the results suggest that hbd-2 may be involved in the pathophysiology of h. pylori-induced gastritis.

TI  == the salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium smva, yddg and ompd (porin) genes are required for the efficient efflux of methyl viologen.
AB  == in gram-negative bacteria, a subset of inner membrane proteins in the major facilitator superfamily (mfs) acts as efflux pumps to decrease the intracellular  concentrations of multiple toxic substrates and confers multidrug resistance. the salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium smva gene encodes a product predicted to be an mfs protein most similar to qaca of staphylococcus aureus. like mutations in qaca, mutations in smva confer increased sensitivity to methyl viologen (mv). mutations in the adjacent ompd (porin) and yddg (drug/metabolite transporter) genes also confer increased sensitivity to mv, and mutations in smva are epistatic to mutations in ompd or yddg for this phenotype. yddg and ompd probably comprise a second efflux pump in which the ompd porin acts as an outer membrane channel (omc) protein for the efflux of mv and functions independently of the smva pump. in support of this idea, the pump dependent on yddg and ompd has a different substrate specificity from the pump dependent on smva. mutations in tolc, which encodes an omc protein, confer increased resistance to mv. tolc apparently facilitates the import of mv, and a subset of omc proteins including the ompd porin and tolc may facilitate both import and export of distinct subsets of toxic substrates.

TI  == multiresistant clones of salmonella enterica: the importance of dissemination.
AB  == increasing anitmicrobial resistance among foodborne pathogens has prompted calls  for the reduction of anitmicrobial use in livestock to prevent future emergence or resistance. in the case of salmonella enterica, clonal dissemination may play  a more critical role in regional changes in antimicrobial resistance in salmonellae than antimicrobial selection pressure. multi-resistant salmonella typhimurium definitive type 104 (mr-dt104) emerged from an unknown location and was disseminated globally during the 1980s and 1990s. other clones of salmonella  typhimurium and non-typhimurium salmonellae have demonstrated an ability to disseminate widely. the clonal epidemiology of mr-dt104 is in contrast with that  of campylobacter jejuni, in which antimicrobial resistance is polyclonal and seems to develop in response to local antimicrobial pressures. the epidemiology of mr-dt104 is more similar to that of methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, which is also characterized by international transmission of a few clonal subtypes. control measures for multiresistant disseminated clones of salmonellae  must focus on the interruption of dissemination in order to be effective.

TI  == multidrug pump inhibitors uncover remarkable activity of plant antimicrobials.
AB  == plant antimicrobials are not used as systemic antibiotics at present. the main reason for this is their low level of activity, especially against gram-negative  bacteria. the reported mic is often in the range of 100 to 1,000 micro g/ml, orders of magnitude higher than those of common broad-spectrum antibiotics from bacteria or fungi. major plant pathogens belong to the gram-negative bacteria, which makes the low level of activity of plant antimicrobials against this group  of microorganisms puzzling. gram-negative bacteria have an effective permeability barrier, comprised of the outer membrane, which restricts the penetration of amphipathic compounds, and multidrug resistance pumps (mdrs), which extrude toxins across this barrier. it is possible that the apparent ineffectiveness of plant antimicrobials is largely due to the permeability barrier. we tested this hypothesis in the present study by applying a combination of mdr mutants and mdr  inhibitors. a panel of plant antimicrobials was tested by using a set of bacteria representing the main groups of plant pathogens. the human pathogens pseudomonas  aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were also tested. the results show that the activities of the majority of plant antimicrobials were considerably greater against the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bacillus megaterium and that disabling of the mdrs in gram-negative species leads to a striking increase in antimicrobial activity. thus, the activity of rhein, the principal antimicrobial from rhubarb, was potentiated 100- to 2,000-fold (depending on the bacterial species) by disabling  the mdrs. comparable potentiation of activity was observed with plumbagin, resveratrol, gossypol, coumestrol, and berberine. direct measurement of the uptake of berberine, a model plant antimicrobial, confirmed that disabling of the mdrs strongly increases the level of penetration of berberine into the cells of gram-negative bacteria. these results suggest that plants might have developed means of delivering their antimicrobials into bacterial cells. these findings also suggest that plant antimicrobials might be developed into effective, broad-spectrum antibiotics in combination with inhibitors of mdrs.

TI  == bacterium-induced cxcl10 secretion by osteoblasts can be mediated in part through toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == two common pathogens known to cause bone infection, salmonella and staphylococcus aureus, were investigated to determine their abilities to induce chemokine expression in cultured mouse and human osteoblasts. while these cells are responsible for bone formation, we were surprised to find that they could respond to bacterial infection by upregulating expression of the chemokine cxcl10 (ip-10). however, there were significant differences in the abilities of the gram-negative bacterium salmonella and the gram-positive bacterium s. aureus to induce expression of cxcl10. reverse transcription-pcr and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses showed high levels of salmonella-induced cxcl10 mrna and protein expression, respectively, whereas the osteoblast response to s. aureus was significantly less. consistent with these findings, salmonella-derived lipopolysaccharide (lps), but not s. aureus-derived peptidoglycan, could induce expression of cxcl10. an antibody against toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4) could block the lps-induced cxcl10 production, demonstrating the functional expression of tlr4 by osteoblasts. despite the inducible nature of tlr2 mrna expression by bacterium-infected osteoblasts, peptidoglycan failed to stimulate cxcl10 secretion. immunofluorescent staining of bacterium-infected calvaria (i.e., skull bone) demonstrated the presence of cxcl10 in osteoblasts. the fact that osteoblasts did not express cxcr3 mrna, whereas t lymphocytes can express high levels of this receptor, suggests that osteoblast-derived cxcl10 may recruit t lymphocytes to the sites of bone infections.

TI  == route of administration differentially affects fevers induced by gram-negative and gram-positive pyrogens in rabbits.
AB  == we have investigated the febrile responses of new zealand white rabbits to a gram-negative pyrogen (bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) from salmonella typhosa), commonly associated with systemic infection, and a gram-positive pyrogen (staphylococcus aureus), more frequently associated with superficial soft tissue infection, each administered via one of four different routes (intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal) at each of three different doses (lps: 0.1, 1 and 10 microg kg(-1); s. aureus: 1.5 x 10(7), 1.5 x  10(8) and 1.5 x 10(9) cell walls kg(-1)). intravenous administration of lps evoked rapid, dose-dependent biphasic fever. injection of lps by the other routes also evoked dose-dependent fever. however, these fevers were monophasic, had increased latency of onset, and were of lower amplitude. it is important to note  that a dose of approximately 10 and 100 times that of the standard intravenous dose was required to produce a similar peak rise in temperature when administered subcutaneously and intraperitoneally, respectively. intravenous injection of the  highest dose of s. aureus evoked dose-dependent biphasic fever, with short latency of onset, which was very similar to that induced by intravenous lps. at lower doses, intravenous s. aureus induced monophasic fever. no fever occurred when the same doses of s. aureus were administered by any other route. we conclude that any of the four routes may be used for the study of lps-induced fever, provided that the doses are adjusted. however, studies of s. aureus-induced fever, and detection of contamination with either pyrogen, requires intravenous injection.

TI  == the role of lipopolysaccharide binding protein in resistance to salmonella infections in mice.
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) and lps-binding protein (lbp) are both components of the innate immune system. lbp is a plasma protein that binds to lipid a and enhances the biological activity of lps 100- to 1000-fold. recently it was reported that lbp-deficient mice are more susceptible to salmonella typhimurium infection. here we report that lbp ko mice are more susceptible to salmonella peritonitis, but not to oral or i.v. infection. lbp knockout (ko) mice responded normally to i.p. injections of staphylococcus aureus and casein, but not to i.p. injection of s. typhimurium or salmonella lps. mice with a mutation in toll-like receptor 4 (c3h/hej) have a similar defect in pmn chemotaxis. in normal mice s. typhimurium stimulated production of the cxc chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein-2 and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, but levels of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 were greatly reduced in the lbp ko mice. lbp ko mice pretreated with casein to attract pmn in an lbp-independent manner were more resistant to salmonella infection, but neutropenic mice were not protected by casein. splenic  tnf-alpha mrna levels were also lower in lbp ko than in control mice infected with salmonella. since tnf-alpha can activate pmn, lbp ko mice may have both fewer and less active pmn in the first few hours after salmonella are injected, making lbp ko mice more susceptible. this work confirms the importance of pmn in  resistance to salmonella infections and shows that this is facilitated by lbp.

AB  == aqueous extracts of the leaf of harungana madagascariensis were analysed phytochemically and evaluated for antimicrobial activity against strains of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi and  pseudomonas aeruginosa. glycosides, tannins, saponins, flavonoids and alkaloids were detected in the plant material. b. subtilis, e. coli and s. typhi, but not ps. aeruginosa, showed susceptibility at mics of 2.0 and 15.6 mg/ml; and mbcs of  2.0-3.9 mg/ml and 15.6-31.3 mg/ml, respectively, for the cold and hot extracts. staph. aureus showed susceptibility only to the hot extract. concentrations of 2.5-10.0 mg/ml of the cold extract killed over 7 log(10) of the test bacterial population within 30-60 min of exposure. the hot extract needed higher concentrations and longer treatment to achieve similar levels of bacterial cell killing. the results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of h. madagascariensis leaf extracts for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == how do bacteria resist human antimicrobial peptides?
AB  == cationic antimicrobial peptides (camps), such as defensins, cathelicidins and thrombocidins, are an important human defense mechanism, protecting skin and epithelia against invading microorganisms and assisting neutrophils and platelets. staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and other bacterial pathogens have evolved countermeasures to limit the effectiveness of camps, including the repulsion of camps by reducing the net negative charge of the bacterial cell envelope through covalent modification of anionic molecules (e.g.  teichoic acids, phospholipids and lipid a); expelling camps through energy-dependent pumps; altering membrane fluidity; and cleaving camps with proteases. mutants susceptible to camps are more efficiently inactivated by phagocytes and are virulence-attenuated, indicating that camp resistance plays a  key role in bacterial infections.

TI  == antimicrobial synergistic effect of linolenic acid and monoglyceride against bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of linolenic acid with or without monoglyceride (glycerol laurate or glycerol myristate) against six food-borne microorganisms was determined in broth medium. minimum inhibitory concentration of linolenic acid on bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus was 20 and 50 ppm, respectively. the growth of b. cereus treated with linolenic acid at 10 ppm with  10 ppm monoglyceride was more inhibitory than that of linolenic acid alone, and the viable cell population was reduced 2-4 log cycles compared to that of the control. when linolenic acid was added at that level, the adenosine triphosphate  (atp) concentration of extracellular fluid was drastically increased compared with that of the control, and the combined effect with monoglyceride was higher than that with linolenic acid alone. however, the intracellular atp concentration decreased compared with that of the control. from these results, we concluded that linolenic acid has a strong antimicrobial activity against b. cereus and s.  aureus, and that linolenic acid combined with monoglyceride showed stronger antimicrobial activity than using linolenic acid alone.

TI  == effects of antibacterial dishwashing liquid on foodborne pathogens and competitive microorganisms in kitchen sponges.
AB  == in response to increasing concern about home hygiene, the use of antibacterial products to reduce microorganisms in kitchen sponges and cleaning cloths is strongly promoted by some producers of detergent for domestic use. the effects of an antibacterial dishwashing liquid on escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis,  staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus were investigated in a modified suspension test and in used sponges with and without food residues under laboratory conditions. a limited study was conducted in households to assess the  efficacy of antibacterial dishwashing liquid as used by the consumer. in the suspension tests, s. aureus and b. cereus were shown to be susceptible to low concentrations of antibacterial dishwashing liquid (0.5%), whereas e. coli and salmonella enteritidis maintained their initial numbers for at least 24 h at 25 degrees c. at higher concentrations (2 to 4%), all test organisms decreased to below the detection limit after 24 h. over a 24-h period, the antibacterial dishwashing liquid did not significantly reduce these organisms in used sponges in which food residues were present. the antibacterial product did not reduce the competitive microorganisms either. similar results were found for sponges involved in daily household use. the results of this study demonstrate that the antibacterial dishwashing liquid was effective in reducing pathogens in the suspension test but not in the used sponges. this finding indicates that to determine the efficacy of antibacterial products, their use in a household setting must be considered.

AB  == the bax system, a pcr-based assay, was evaluated for detecting salmonella typhimurium in pharmaceutical raw materials and products contaminated with mixed  bacterial cultures of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhimurium. artificially contaminated samples were preenriched in lactose broth with and without tween 20. after preenrichment, samples were analyzed by pcr and standard methods. ten of 25 samples did not show presence of the specific salmonella spp. 740-base pair dna fragment. however, s.  typhimurium was isolated and identified by standard methods from all 25 samples.  to optimize s. typhimurium detection in pcr negative samples, lactose broth was replaced by buffered peptone water (bpw) as the preenrichment broth. when bpw was used, all 10 samples were pcr positive. bpw enrichments increased s. typhimurium  growth resulting in rapid pcr detection. the presence of non-salmonella bacteria  influenced the performance of the pcr-based assay. optimization of s. typhimurium pcr detection in mixed culture required the use of different preenrichment broths. however, the bax system detected s. typhimurium within 27 hours while standard methods required 5-7 days.

TI  == molecular mechanisms of bacteria induced apoptosis.
AB  == interaction of mammalian cells with pathogenic bacteria results in a whole variety of responses in the infected cells including internalization or phagocytosis of the bacterium, release of cytokines, secretion of defensins or production of oxygen radicals. however, recent studies pointed out that many bacteria are able to trigger apoptosis in the host cell. the induction of apoptosis upon infection results from a complex interaction of bacterial proteins with cellular proteins finally mediating apoptosis. thus, bacteria are able to activate several pro-apoptotic proteins, e.g. caspases, to inactivate anti-apoptotic proteins, e.g. nf(kappa)b or map-kinases, or to upregulate endogenous receptor/ligand systems, that induce apoptosis, on the surface of the  infected cell. host cell apoptosis very often serves the bacteria to attack the host and to gain access to the tissue. however, in some infections, apoptosis of  mammalian cells significantly contributes to the host defense against the bacteria further indicating the role of apoptosis in host-pathogen interactions.

TI  == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining  the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

AB  == two common pathogens of bone, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella, were investigated for their ability to induce chemokine expression in bone-forming osteoblasts. cultured mouse or human osteoblasts could rapidly respond to bacterial infection by upregulating the mrna encoding the chemokine, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1). this rapid induction occurred on infection with either the gram-positive pathogen, s. aureus, or the gram-negative pathogen, salmonella. increased mrna expression translated into mcp-1 secretion by cultured mouse or human osteoblasts in response to viable bacteria, whereas uv-killed bacteria were less effective in stimulating chemokine secretion. there was a dose-response relationship observed between the amount of input bacteria and increases in mcp-1 secretion. immunohistochemical staining of infected osteoblasts indicated that the majority of cells could express mcp-1, with some osteoblasts having a higher intensity of staining than others. organ cultures of  mouse calvaria (skullcap) bone showed increases in mcp-1 immunostaining following bacterial infection. the immunoreactive mcp-1 in infected calvaria localized to areas containing active osteoblasts. taken together, these studies demonstrate a  conserved osteoblast-derived mcp-1 response to two very different pathogens of bone.

AB  == control of the foodborne pathogens escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes during sufu fermentation was evaluated. before fermentation, pathogens were inoculated onto tofu (substrate for sufu) at 5 log cfu/g or 3 log cfu/g, and starter culture (actinomucor elegans) was inoculated at 3 log cfu/g. after 2 days of fermentation at 30 degrees c, the four pathogens reached 7 to 9 log cfu/g, and the mold count  reached 6 to 7 log cfu/g. after fermentation, sufu samples were aged in a solution of 10% alcohol + 12% nacl. after 1 month of aging, the total bacterial count was 6 to 7 log cfu/g, but all foodborne pathogens and mold were reduced to  nondetectable levels. the total bacterial count decreased after aging for 2 months and 3 months, but the differences were not significant (p > 0.05) compared with the count after 1 month. microorganism in experimental sufu from different aging periods and in commercial sufu were compared. a total of 270 isolates were  purified and identified by the bbl crystal identification system. from the experimental sufu samples, 49 bacillus spp. (20.4%), 167 enterococcus spp. (69.6%), 6 shewanella putrefaciens (2.4%), and 18 miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli (7.5%) were identified. from commercial sufu samples, 17 bacillus spp. (56.7%), 2 enterococcus durans (6.7%), 5 miscellaneous gram-negative bacilli (16.7%), 5 corynbacterium aquaticum (16.7%), and 1 shewanella putrefaciens (3.3%) were obtained. although the longer aging period did not significantly decrease the total bacterial count, it may help in the development of sufu flavor. this study showed that sufu fermentation and aging can control common foodborne pathogens, so sufu is a safe product even though its preparation does not include pasteurization.

TI  == expression of full-length bioactive antimicrobial human lactoferrin in potato plants.
AB  == a cdna fragment encoding human lactoferrin (hlf) linked to a plant microsomal retention signal peptide (sek-del) was stably integrated into the solanum tuberosum genome by agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated leaf disk transformation methods. the lactoferrin gene was expressed under control of both the auxin-inducible manopine synthase (mas) p2 promoter and the cauliflower mosaic virus (camv) 35s tandem promoter. the presence of the hlf cdna in the genome of regenerated transformed potato plants was detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification methods. full-length hlf protein was identified by immunoblot analysis in tuber tissue extracts from the transformed plants by immunoblot analysis. the hlf produced in transgenic plant tissues migrated during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as a single band with an approximate molecular mass equal to hlf. auxin activation of the mas p2 promoter increased lactoferrin  expression levels in transformed tuber and leaf tissues to approximately 0.1% of  total soluble plant protein. antimicrobial activity against four different human  pathogenic bacterial strains was detected in extracts of lactoferrin-containing potato tuber tissues. this is the first report of synthesis of full length, biologically active hlf in edible plants.

AB  == the antibacterial activity of a chitooligosaccharide mixture prepared by digestion of shrimp chitosan with cellulase at 50 degrees c for 14 h was evaluated. sugars with 1 to 8 degrees of polymer (dp) were found in this chitooligosaccharide mixture, and the weight percentage of sugars with dp > or =  6 was 44.3%. minimal lethal concentrations of this mixture against aeromonas hydrophila, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, shigella dysenteriae, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahaemolyticus in nutrient broth were 5 to 29 ppm, which were much lower than those of the chitosan reactant (50 to 1,000 ppm). the antibacterial activity of this mixture in the sterilized milk against e. coli o157, l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and s. aureus was much stronger at 4 degrees c than at 37 degrees c. when raw milk was supplemented with either 0.24% or 0.48% (wt/vol) of this oligosaccharide mixture and stored at 4 degrees c for 12 days, its mesophilic and psychrotrophic counts were reduced by at least 3  log cycles, and there was very little change in ph. in addition, this mixture retarded the growth of salmonella species and caused quicker reduction of staphylococcus species in raw milk. accordingly, the shelf life of raw milk at 4  degrees c was extended by at least 4 days.

TI  == photosensitizing activity of hematoporphyrin on staphylococcus aureus cells.
AB  == the photosensitizing action of hematoporphyrin (hp) on two staphylococcus aureus  strains was investigated to determine if the photoprocess induces in vivo damage  in dna in addition to that occurring at the level of the cytoplasmic membrane. the results obtained demonstrate that the photokilling is dependent on the hp dose even though the two strains, having a similar hp-binding capacity, show different levels of photosensitivity. the electrophoretic analysis of cytoplasmic membrane proteins and dna (chromosomal and plasmidial) suggests that the membrane represents the primary target of the photoprocess, while the dna, that is damaged both in vivo and in vitro only at relatively long irradiation time, might be a secondary target. moreover, the photoprocess results in mutagenesis for salmonella typhimurium tester strains. this information is particularly important in view of the potential use of photodynamic therapy for the treatment of microbial infections.

TI  == apoptosis of human keratinocytes after bacterial invasion.
AB  == in this study, we examined the invasive capacity of staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhi in human keratinocytes and monitored the number of viable intracellular bacteria at different post-infection times. the strains tested entered keratinocytes; both s. typhi and s. aureus were internalized within 30 min to 2 h after infection. no intracellular multiplication was observed, but s.  typhi and s. aureus remained viable 72 h after infection. we also demonstrated that keratinocyte death following s. typhi and s. aureus invasion occurs by apoptosis as shown by dna fragmentation. after 24 h of infection with s. typhi, the number of cells undergoing apoptosis were higher compared to infection with s. aureus. for prolonged infection times (48 h, 72 h) with both bacteria, there was no significant change in the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. the results demonstrated that viable intracellular s. typhi and s. aureus induced apoptosis in keratinocyte cells.

TI  == effects of the hinge region of cecropin a(1-8)-magainin 2(1-12), a synthetic antimicrobial peptide, on liposomes, bacterial and tumor cells.
AB  == a 20-residue hybrid peptide (ca(1-8)-ma(1-12): kwklfkkigigkflhsakkf-nh(2)) incorporating 1-8 residues of cecropin a (ca) and 1-12 residues of magainin 2 (ma) has potent antibiotic activity without hemolytic activity. in order to investigate the effects of the flexible hinge sequence, gly-ile-gly of ca(1-8)-ma(1-12) (ca-ma) on antibiotic activity, ca-ma and its three analogues, ca-ma1, ca-ma2 and ca-ma3 were synthesized. the gly-ile-gly sequence of ca-ma was deleted in ca-ma1 and replaced with pro and gly-pro-gly in ca-ma2 and ca-ma3, respectively. ca-ma1 and ca-ma3 caused a significant decrease in the bactericidal rate against escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the tumoricidal activity  against four different tumor cells, and the pc/ps (4:1, w/w) vesicle-aggregating  and disrupting activities. however, ca-ma2 showed a similar bactericidal rate and antitumor, vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities, as compared with ca-ma. these results suggested that the flexibility or beta-turn induced by gly-ile-gly  or pro in the central part of ca-ma may be important in the electrostatic interaction of the cationic short alpha-helical region in the n-terminus with the cell membrane surface and the hydrophobic interaction of amphipathic alpha-helical region in the c-terminus with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the cell membrane. ca-ma3 exhibited lower activity in antibacterial, antitumor, and vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities than ca-ma and ca-ma2. this result  suggested that the excessive beta-turn structure by gly-pro-gly in ca-ma3 seems to interrupt the ion channel/pore formation on the lipid bilayer. it was concluded that the appropriate flexibility or beta-turn structure provided by the central hinge is responsible for the effective antibiotic activity of the antimicrobial peptides with the helix-hinge-helix structure.

TI  == bacterial adhesion at synthetic surfaces.
AB  == a systematic investigation into the effect of surface chemistry on bacterial adhesion was carried out. in particular, a number of physicochemical factors important in defining the surface at the molecular level were assessed for their  effect on the adhesion of listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the primary experiments involved the grafting of groups varying in hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, chain length, and chemical functionality onto glass substrates such that the surfaces were homogeneous and densely packed with functional groups. all of the surfaces were found to be chemically well defined, and their measured surface energies varied from 15 to 41 mj. m(-2). protein adsorption experiments were performed with (3)h-labelled bovine serum albumin and cytochrome c prior to bacterial attachment studies. hydrophilic uncharged surfaces showed the greatest resistance to protein adsorption; however, our studies also showed that the effectiveness of poly(ethyleneoxide) (peo) polymers was not simply a result of its hydrophilicity  and molecular weight alone. the adsorption of the two proteins approximately correlated with short-term cell adhesion, and bacterial attachment for l. monocytogenes and e. coli also correlated with the chemistry of the underlying substrate. however, for s. aureus and s. typhimurium a different pattern of attachment occurred, suggesting a dissimilar mechanism of cell attachment, although high-molecular-weight peo was still the least-cell-adsorbing surface. the implications of this for in vivo attachment of cells suggest that hydrophilic passivating groups may be the best method for preventing cell adsorption to synthetic substrates provided they can be grafted uniformly and in sufficient density at the surface.

TI  == effect of multiple antigenic exposures in the gut on oral tolerance and induction of antibacterial systemic immunity.
AB  == we have analyzed oral tolerance of microbial antigens in an experimental model in which mice are treated orally with a single small dose of soluble antigen and challenged systemically with the antigen in complete freund's adjuvant. we found  that, while oral administration of sonicated extracts of either leishmania major, leishmania donovani, or staphylococcus aureus was tolerogenic, as was administration of the nominal antigen ovalbumin or conalbumin, oral administration of escherichia coli or salmonella typhimurium sonicated extract was not. since e. coli is an enteric commensal that colonizes the intestine soon  after birth, these data suggested that lack of demonstrable oral tolerance may be related to the frequency of oral exposure to an antigen. in support of this, we found that multiple oral doses of ovalbumin or s. aureus or l. donovani antigens  did not increase systemic hyporesponsiveness beyond that achieved with a single oral dose. we have also tested the ability of mice fed with sonicates of the tolerogenic s. aureus or the nontolerogenic s. typhimurium to clear a subsequent  systemic infection with the homologous bacteria and found that, while clearance of s. aureus was unaffected by prior feeding, clearance of s. typhimurium was actually enhanced. the data suggest that frequent oral antigenic exposure may eventually lead to induction of systemic immunity in tolerant mice.

TI  == ubiquicidin, a novel murine microbicidal protein present in the cytosolic fraction of macrophages.
AB  == previously we have identified and characterized three murine microbicidal proteins purified from the granule fraction of cells from the murine macrophage cell line raw264.7. during these studies evidence was obtained for the presence of an additional antimicrobial protein in the cytosolic fraction of raw264.7 cells that had been activated with interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma). in this study we have purified this protein, designated ubiquicidin, to apparent homogeneity and demonstrated that it is a cationic, small (mr 6654) protein. ubiquicidin displayed marked antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. using a gel overlay procedure evidence was obtained that  the protein also displays activity against escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and an avirulent strain of yersinia enterocolitica. aminoterminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis of purified ubiquicidin indicated  that it is most likely identical to the ribosomal protein s30. this protein is produced by posttranslational processing of the fau protein, a 133-amino-acid fusion protein consisting of s30 linked to an unusual peptide with significant homology to ubiquitin. the fau gene has been reported to be expressed in a variety of tissues in humans and various animal species. the presence of ubiquicidin in the cytosol of macrophages may serve to restrict the intracellular growth of microorganisms. in addition, because macrophage disintegration will likely lead to release of ubiquicidin into the extracellular environment, it may  contribute to host defense after macrophage death.

AB  == this paper describes a novel approach, termed the 'phage amplification assay', for the rapid detection and identification of specific bacteria. the technique is based on the phage lytic cycle with plaque formation as the assay end-point. it is highly sensitive, quantitative and gives results typically within 4 h. the assay comprises four main stages: (1) phage infection of target bacterium; (2) destruction of exogenous phage; (3) amplification of phage within infected host and (4) plaque formation from infected host with the aid of helper bacteria. a key component of this assay is a potent virucidal agent derived from natural plant extracts, pomegranate rind extract (pre). in combination with ferrous sulphate pre can bring about an 11 log-cycle reduction in phage titre within 3 min. this is achieved without any injury to the infected target bacteria. subsequently, any resulting plaques are derived only from infected target organisms. data are presented for a range of bacterial hosts including pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. the detection limit for ps. aeruginosa was 40 bacteria ml-1 in a time of 4 h and 600  bacteria m-1 for salm. typhimurium. application of the principles of this technology to other bacterial genera is discussed.

TI  == the survival and growth of acid-adapted mesophilic pathogens that contaminate meat after lactic acid decontamination.
AB  == lactic acid decontamination (lad) may adapt pathogens to lactic acid. such organisms may have an increased resistance to acid and can contaminate meat after lad. the survival and growth of acid adapted campylobacter jejuni, salmonella typhimurium. escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus inoculated on skin surface of still warm pork belly cuts 2 h after lad was examined during chilled (4 degrees c) storage and refrigeration abuse equivalent to 12.5 degrees  c. lactic acid decontamination included dipping in 1, 2 or 5% lactic acid solutions at 55 degrees c for 120 s. lactic acid decontamination brought sharp reductions in meat surface ph, but these recovered with time after lad at approximately 1-1.5 ph units below that of water-treated controls. a sharp decrease in the number of cfu of pathogens occurred on chilled 2-5% lactic acid treated pork belly cuts when the skin surface was less than ph 4.8-5.2. the reductions ranged from 0.1-0.3 log10 cfu cm-2 for e. coli o157:h7 to over 1.7-2.4 log10 cfu cm-2 for camp. jejuni, respectively. increase in storage temperature from 4 to 12.5 degrees c reduced delayed decrease in numbers of all pathogens except camp. jejuni by a factor of two. deaths in camp. jejuni at 12.5 degrees c  slightly exceeded those at 4 degrees c. after the initial sharp decline, the number of cfu of mesophilic pathogens decreased gradually at a rate similar to that on water-treated controls. growth of all mesophilic pathogens except camp. jejuni on 2-5% lad meat occurred during storage at 12.5 degrees c when the meat surface ph exceeded 4.8-5.2, and was slower than on water-treated controls. low temperature and acid-adapted e. coli o157:h7, salm. typhimurium and staph. aureus, and acid adapted camp. jejuni that contaminate skin surface after hot 2-5% lad, did not cause an increased health hazard, although microbiota and intrinsic parameters (lactic acid content, ph) were created that could advantage  their survival and growth.

TI  == sensitivity of food pathogens to garlic (allium sativum).
AB  == the inhibitory activity of garlic (allium sativum) against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes was measured by the 'turbidity' method. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of garlic at 80% inhibition level was calculated for these bacteria. all bacterial pathogenic strains tested were inhibited by garlic; e. coli was most sensitive and listeria  monocytogenes was least sensitive. therefore, garlic has potential for the preservation of processed foods.

TI  == synthesis of some novel 2-oxo-pyrano(2,3-b)- and 2-oxo-pyrido(2,3-b)quinoline derivatives as potential antimalarial, diuretic, clastogenic and antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the 2-chloro-3-formyl quinoline derivatives (1a-e) on treatment with acetic anhydride and sodium acetate, afforded the corresponding novel 2-oxopyrano(2,3-b) quinoline derivatives (2a-e), and these were subjected to ammonia treatment to yield the corresponding naphthyridine derivatives (3a-e). the prepared compounds  (2a-e) were tested for their antimalarial, diuretic, clastogenic and antimicrobial properties. not all the compounds showed a diuretic effect and the  significant increase in the frequency of micronuclei shows that they are non-clastogens, whereas the 7-chloro derivative (2e) was a very effective antimalarial agent against the mosquito species. all the compounds were found to  have optimum antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and salmonella typhi. compounds 2d and 2e were found to be most active against the bacteria tested.

AB  == the antimicrobial properties of 21 plant essential oils and two essences were investigated against five important food-borne pathogens, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes. the oils of bay, cinnamon, clove and thyme were the most inhibitory, each having a bacteriostatic concentration of 0.075% or less against  all five pathogens. in general, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oils than the gram-negative bacteria. campylobacter jejuni was the most resistant of the bacteria investigated to plant essential oils, with only the oils of bay and thyme having a bacteriocidal concentration of less than 1%. at 35 degrees c, l. monocytogenes was extremely sensitive to the oil of nutmeg. a concentration of less than 0.01% was bacteriostatic and 0.05% was bacteriocidal, but when the temperature was reduced to 4 degrees, the bacteriostatic concentration was increased to 0.5% and the bacteriocidal concentration to greater than 1%.

TI  == antibacterial activity of a novel 26-kda serine protease in the yellow body of sarcophaga peregrina (flesh fly) pupae.

AB  == a series of organotin complexes with pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde 2-hydroxybenzoylhydrazone (h3mfps) and pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde 2-picolinoylhydrazone (h2mfpp) was investigated. the ir, 1h, and 119sn nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic characterization of all the compounds is reported and discussed in connection with the ligand behaviour of the hydrazone and the structure of the organotin complex. complexes exhibit antibacterial properties higher than those of the corresponding ligands but they turn out to be less potent than the parent organotin compounds. sn(h3mfps) (c6h5)2cl2.2h2o and sn(hmfpp)(n-c4h9)2cl are the most active antibacterial compounds showing mic values between 3-6 micrograms/ml against bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus and between 6-25 micrograms/ml against escherichia coli; the first compound also strongly inhibits the growth of aspergillus niger. all the ligands  and complexes are devoid of dna-damaging activity in the bacillus subtilis rec-assay. h2mfpp and its complexes sn(hmfpp)(c2h5)2cl and sn3(hmfpp)(mfpp) (c6h5)3cl6 are shown by the salmonella-microsome assay to be mutagenic substances in the presence of a metabolic activation system. the obtained results are discussed on the basis of structure-activity relationships.

TI  == differential cytokine production in stimulated blood cultures from intensive care patients with bacterial infections.
AB  == mice infected with bacteria develop an interferon-gamma (ifn-gamma) dependent hypersensitivity to lipopolysaccharide (lps) and other bacterial components. the  broader aim of this study is to find out whether such hypersensitivity also occurs in patients suffering from bacterial infections. the capacity of stimulated peripheral blood cells from infected, intensive-care patients to produce cytokines (ifn-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6)) was compared to that of healthy donors. culturing of the cells was carried out preferentially in whole blood diluted 1:3. whole blood cultures (wbc) were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (lps), whole killed salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus and concanavalin a (cona), and the cytokine production was determined. two main findings emerged from this study: the ifn-gamma production by wbc of patients was, compared to healthy donors, markedly suppressed, regardless of stimulus used. further, patients' wbc  exhibited a suppressed tnf-alpha production after stimulation with lps. surprisingly, following stimulation with bacteria (s. typhimurium and s. aureus)  an elevated tnf-alpha and il-6 response was obtained. thus, in severely infected  patients the cytokine responses of peripheral blood cells to lps may be suppressed, while the response to other bacterial components is enhanced.

TI  == genetic map of the virulence plasmid of salmonella enteritidis and nucleotide sequence of its replicons.
AB  == partial sequencing of a genomic library of the virulence plasmid of salmonella enteritidis has been used to localize in the restriction map of this plasmid the  genetic loci already described in other salmonella plasmids. the comparison of the vestigial tra region with the corresponding genes in the f plasmid allowed us to define the extent of the deletions that the s. enteritidis plasmid should have suffered. the putative replicons of the plasmid, repb and repc, were isolated and both proved to be functional in escherichia coli, but repc was segregationally unstable. the nucleotide sequence of repb showed the typical organization of repfiia replicons, although the similarity was lower than usual in this group of  replicons. the highest homology was found with the replicon of the virulence plasmid pyve439-80 from yersinia enterocolitica (72.5%). replicon repc also showed a maximum identity of 72.6% with known replicons, namely the repfib of pcolv-k30 and p307, both virulence plasmids isolated from e. coli. we conclude that the s. enteritidis plasmid could arise from the s. typhimurium plasmid through deletions, and that they are evolutionary distant from other incfi and incfii plasmids.

TI  == ultrastructure of colony-like communities of bacteria.
AB  == colony-like communities are poorly studied forms of bacterial growth on agar. these communities are formed after the growth of large amounts of bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar, while "classical" colonies are formed as a result of single bacterial cell multiplication. colony-like communities of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria differ from "classical" microbial colonies in their ultrastructural organization. almost every cell in colony-like communities has an individual capsule-like envelope (glycocalyx). the cells in these communities are characterized by accelerated ageing. in the course of their development both bacterial colony-like communities and "classical" colonies produce a film, the basic part of which is represented by an elementary  membrane. in contrast to "classical" colonies, the thickness of the amorphous layers of this film in colony-like communities did not significantly increase after 24 h of cultivation. the formation of a three-dimensional network of cells  in colony-like communities is similar to this process in "classical" colonies. the intercellular matrix of colony-like communities contains numerous membrane vesicles, and has a more amorphous structure and higher electron density than that of "classical" bacterial colonies.

TI  == genetic evidence for a role of parc mutations in development of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance in escherichia coli.
AB  == fifteen strains of escherichia coli with mics of ciprofloxacin (cip) between 0.015 and 256 micrograms/ml were examined for the presence of mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining region of the gyra gene and in an analogous region of the parc gene. no mutation was found in a susceptible isolate (mic of cip, 0.015 microgram/ml). four moderately resistant strains (mic of cip 0.06 to 4 micrograms/ml) carried one gyra mutation affecting serine 83, but in only one strain was an additional parc mutation (gly-78 to asp) detected. all ten highly resistant strains examined (mic of cip, > 4 micrograms/ml) carried two gyra mutations affecting residues serine 83 and aspartate 87, and at least one parc mutation. these parc mutations included alterations of serine 80 to arginine or isoleucine and glutamate 84 to glycine or lysine. the parc+ and two mutant alleles (parci-80 and parci-80,g-84) were inserted into the mobilizable vector pbp507. transfer of a plasmid-coded parc+ allele into parc+ strains did not alter the susceptibilities towards ciprofloxacin or nalidixic acid, while a significant increase in susceptibility was detectable for parc mutants. this increase, however, did not restore wild-type susceptibility, whereas transfer of a plasmid-coded gyra+ allele alone or in combination with parc+ did. these data are in agreement with the view that topoisomerase iv is a secondary, less sensitive target for quinolone action in escherichia coli and that the development of high-level fluoroquinolone resistance in e. coli requires at least one parc mutation in addition to the gyra mutation(s).

TI  == comparative microbicidal activity of synovial fluid on arthritogenic organisms.
AB  == there is strong circumstantial evidence to support the concept that local microbial antigens play a key role in the synovitis of reactive arthritis (rea) patients. it is not at all clear whether these antigens reflect the sequelae of previously viable organisms once resident in the joint. to address the microbicidal activity of synovial fluid (sf) we performed quantitative cultures of arthritogenic organisms (salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae) and controls (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus) in the presence of sf from patients with rea. there was a dramatic inhibitory effect of  sf on the gram-negative organisms (mean 1.35x10(5) organisms at 3h; 0 organisms at 24 h) in contrast to staph. aureus (1.61x10(5) at 3h; 5.70x10(5) at 24 h). this sf bactericidal phenomenon was observed in 11/11 rea patients, 5/8 rheumatoid arthritis (ra) patients and 1/8 osteoarthritis (oa) patients. using a  sandwich elisa, we measured sf levels of bactericidal/permeability-increasing protein (bpi). bpi was detectable in all rea sf (range 4.6-333ng/ml)) and ra sf (range 343-2570ng/ml), but was absent in 5/6 oa sf tested. anti-bpi antibodies, however, did not fully neutralize the bactericidal activity of inflammatory sf. in contrast to the sf effects observed on gram-negative bacteria, chlamydia trachomatis cultured within hela cells thrived in the presence of sf. indeed extracellular chlamydia could easily be passaged through cultured synovial fibroblasts in the presence of sf. these findings indicate that the potent microbicidal activity of sf may account for the failure to recover viable organisms from the joint in rea. chlamydia alone amongst these organisms demonstrates resistance to microbicidal effect of sf, which may relate to the pathogenesis of chlamydia-induced arthritis.

TI  == mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the integrin beta1 chain indicate a role for endocytosis factors in bacterial internalization.
AB  == mutations that result in defective beta1-integrin focal adhesion formation were analyzed for effects on bacterial internalization. mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of the beta1 chain that disrupt the sequence npiy resulted in integrins deficient in bacterial uptake. other mutations in the beta1 chain that reduced cytoskeletal association showed enhanced bacterial uptake. replacement of the npiy sequence of the beta1 subunit by the endocytosis internalization sequence ppgy resulted in integrin receptors highly proficient in bacterial internalization, yet severely defective in focal contact localization. electron microscopy indicated that coated structures associated specifically with bacteria-binding beta1-integrins, with an apparent recruitment of coated pits from ventral cell surfaces to apical surfaces corresponding to nascent bacterial  phagosomes. clathrin inhibition studies indicated a role for the adaptor molecule ap2 as well as clathrin in integrin-mediated bacterial internalization. these results indicate that association of beta1-integrins with the cytoskeleton at focal contacts interferes with integrin-mediated bacterial internalization. also, although actin polymerization is required for bacterial uptake, clathrin is probably involved in bacterial uptake promoted by beta-1-integrins.

AB  == the structure-function relationship of bacterial prolipoprotein diacylgyceryl transferase (lgt) has been investigated by a comparison of the primary structures of this enzyme in phylogenetically distant bacterial species, analysis of the sequences of mutant enzymes, and specific chemical modification of the escherichia coli enzyme. a clone containing the gene for lgt, lgt, of the gram-positive species staphylococcus aureus was isolated by complementation of the temperature-sensitive lgt mutant of e. coli (strain sk634) defective in lgt activity. in vivo and in vitro assays for prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl modification activity indicated that the complementing clone restored the prolipoprotein modification activity in the mutant strain. sequence determination of the insert dna revealed an open reading frame of 837 bp encoding a protein of  279 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31.6 kda. s. aureus lgt showed 24% identity and 47% similarity with e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and  haemophilus influenzae lgt.s. aureus lgt, while 12 amino acids shorter than the e. coli enzyme, had a hydropathic profile and a predicted pi (10.4) similar to those of the e. coli enzyme. multiple sequence alignment among e. coli, s. typhimurium, h. influenzae, and s. aureus lgt proteins revealed regions of highly conserved amino acid sequences throughout the molecule. three independent lgt mutant alleles from e. coli sk634, sk635, and sk636 and one lgt allele from s. typhimurium se5221, all defective in lgt activity at the nonpermissive temperature, were cloned by pcr and sequenced. the mutant alleles were found to contain a single base alteration resulting in the substitution of a conserved amino acid. the longest set of identical amino acids without any gap was h-103-gglig-108 in lgt from these four microorganisms. in e. coli lgt mutant sk634, gly-104 in this region was mutated to ser, and the mutant organism was temperature sensitive in growth and exhibited low lgt activity in vitro. diethylpyrocarbonate inactivated the e. coli lgt with a second-order rate constant of 18.6 m-1s-1, and the inactivation of lgt activity was reversed by hydroxylamine at ph 7. the inactivation kinetics were consistent with the modification of a single residue, his or tyr, essential for lgt activity.

AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence of the rpob gene which encodes the beta subunit  of s. aureus rna polymerase has been determined. the rpob protein, consists of 1182 amino acids and has a novel initiation codon uug which initiates protein synthesis with methionine. there is a very strong shine-dalgarno complementarity  and the -10 and -35 promoter hexameric sequences are taatat and ccgttt, respectively. a rho-dependent termination site, caatcaa, is present which overlaps the -35 promoter sequence of the adjacent rpoc gene a feature which may  have a role in the co-ordinate expression of the two genes. a strong homology and conserved regions were found to exist over the predicted amino acid sequences coding for s. aureus rpob and the equivalent proteins in escherichia coli, pseudomonas putida, salmonella typhimurium, chlamydia trachomatis, cyanobacterium anabaena sp. strain pcc 7120.

TI  == detection of bacterial pyrogens on the basis of their effects on gamma interferon-mediated formation of neopterin or nitrite in cultured monocyte cell lines.
AB  == in a number of mammalian cell types, pteridine biosynthesis from guanosine 5'-triphosphate and formation of nitric oxide from l-arginine are induced by gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps). we assessed  the possibility of using such metabolic alterations for the in vitro detection of pyrogens. products from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and related synthetic compounds were tested for their potential to induce either of these pathways. stimulation of pteridine biosynthesis was monitored as the formation of neopterin in the human myelomonocytic cell line thp-1. the formation of nitric oxide was determined as nitrite in murine j774a.1 macrophage cultures. the substances tested included toxic and detoxified parts of lps and lipid a from escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella minnesota, and klebsiella pneumoniae as well as lipoteichoic acid and toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 from staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, two cell wall compounds from mycobacterium tuberculosis, trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate and n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine, which are active components of freund's  adjuvant, were used. when applied as a single stimulus, only the whole lps molecule potently stimulated neopterin or nitrite formation. lipid a and products from gram-positive bacteria were weakly active. for neopterin formation, lipid a  required the presence of fetal calf serum. besides detoxified lps and independently from the presence of serum, all bacterial compounds tested strongly increased the effects mediated by ifn-gamma. our results show that bacterial pyrogens can be detected by monitoring the formation of neopterin or nitrite. this may provide a basis for the development of an in vitro assay for the detection of pyrogenic contamination with the aim of replacing the currently used animal test.

TI  == cloning and primary structure of staphylococcus aureus dna topoisomerase iv: a primary target of fluoroquinolones.
AB  == a 4.6 kb staphylococcus aureus dna fragment containing dna gyrase-like genes (grla and grlb) was cloned and sequenced. the proteins grla and grlb exhibit more than 30% identity with e. coli dna topoisomerase iv subunits and with the gyrase  subunits from s. aureus and escherichia coli. the combined e. coli cell extracts  of grla and grlb overproducing strains catalysed atp-dependent relaxation and decatenation specific to dna topoisomerase iv. the temperature-sensitive phenotype of salmonella typhimurium parc and pare mutants was complemented by the s. aureus grla and grlb genes, when the two genes were co-expressed. these results show that grla and grlb are the subunits of s. aureus dna topoisomerase iv. the gyra subunit of dna gyrase has been previously defined as a primary target of quinolones based on genetic and biochemical experiments essentially carried out in e. coli. single-point mutations occurring in the 'quinolone resistance-determining region' (qrdr) of gyra were found in bacteria exhibiting quinolone resistance, the most common mutation being a substitution of ser-83 on  the e. coli gyra sequence. we analysed eight s. aureus fluoroquinolone-resistant  clinical isolates and observed that mutations in the qrdr of gyra are not present in the low-quinolone-resistant isolates. in contrast, ser-80 of grla, which corresponds to ser-83 of e. coli gyra, is substituted to phe or tyr in both high- and low-quinolone-resistant isolates. we propose that dna topoisomerase iv is a primary target of fluoroquinolones in s. aureus.

TI  == factors that interact with the antibacterial action of thyme essential oil and its active constituents.
AB  == the viable counts of salmonella typhimurium on nutrient agar (na) decreased upon  the addition of either the essential oil of thyme or its constituent thymol, especially under anaerobic conditions. antagonistic effects of thymol against staphylococcus aureus were also greater under anaerobic conditions. in contrast to the phenolic constituents of the oil, thymol and carvacrol, the chemically related terpenes p-cymene and gamma-terpinene had no antagonistic effects against salm. typhimurium. the addition of desferal to na counteracted the antibacterial  effects of both thyme oil and thymol. no support was obtained, however, for a possible role of iron in the oxygen-related antibacterial action of the thyme oil and thymol or for the observed effect of desferal. in the presence of thymol, the viable counts of salm. typhimurium obtained on a minimal medium (mm) were lower than those obtained on na. addition of bovine serum albumin (bsa) neutralized the antibacterial action of thymol. it is suggested that the effects of bsa or desferal are due to their ability to bind phenolic compounds through their amino  and hydroxylamine groups, respectively, thus preventing complexation reactions between the oil phenolic constituents and bacterial membrane proteins. this hypothesis is supported by the marked decrease in the viable counts of salm. typhimurium caused by either thyme oil or thymol when the ph of the medium was changed from 6.5 to 5.5 or the concentration of tween 80 in the medium was reduced.

TI  == distribution and kinetics of superantigen-induced cytokine gene expression in mouse spleen.
AB  == the polyclonal stimulation of t cells by bacterial superantigens is involved in the pathogenesis of the toxic shock syndrome in certain staphylococcal and streptococcal infections. here we describe the onset and kinetics of superantigen-induced cytokine production in situ in spleens of normal balb/c mice monitored at the level of cytokine mrna expression by in situ hybridization. messenger rnas for interleukin 2 (il-2), interferon gamma, and tumor necrosis factors (tnf) alpha and beta were not expressed at detectable levels in spleens of unstimulated animals but became visible already 30 min after intraperitoneal application of 50 micrograms staphylococcal enterotoxin b. all mrna levels showed peak expression approximately 3 h after injection and a slow decrease up to 24 h  after injection. expression of the mrnas was restricted to the t cell-dependent area of the periarteriolar lymphatic sheets of the spleen. interestingly, tnf-alpha mrna showed a biphasic response, the early appearing mrna had the same  localization as the other mrnas, whereas after 3 h tnf-alpha mrna showed a broader distribution indicating a second cell population producing tnf-alpha. the expression of il-2 and tnf proteins in the serum increased in parallel to the observed mrna changes with a slight delay. the presence of macrophages was not required for the expression of the cytokine mrnas in the spleen as the expression was unchanged in macrophage-depleted mice. only the second phase of tnf-alpha mrna expression was abrogated in such animals. the expression of all mrnas was completely suppressed by prior administration of cyclosporin a. these data show that nonphagocytic cells are the essential superantigen-presenting cells in vivo  and indicate that at least part of the pathogenetic tnf-alpha is t cell derived.

TI  == heat and acid sensitivity of motile aeromonas: a comparison with other food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  == the present study was undertaken to compare the heat and acid sensitivity of aeromonads with those of other food-poisoning bacteria. it became obvious that aeromonads were more sensitive to heat than escherichia coli o157:h7, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella typhimurium. aeromonads were killed in peptone water within 2 min at 55 degrees c, while the other bacteria survived heating at 55 degrees c for more than 15 min. aeromonas cells were also less resistant to heat in hamburger steaks. these findings suggest that aeromonas infection can easily be prevented by heat treatment, although correct handling of food is required to avoid recontamination since aeromonads are very common in various kinds of food. e. coli, s. aureus and s. typhimurium cells survived in buffer at ph 3.2 and in foods seasoned with vinegar. by contrast, aeromonas cells were found to be highly sensitive to acid. however, the resistance of aeromonas to acid may be sufficient to allow it to infect the gastrointestinal tract since  vibrio parahaemolyticus, which causes numerous outbreaks of food-poisoning every  year in japan, was susceptible to acid to the same extent as aeromonas.

TI  == effect of low concentrations of quinolone antibiotics on bacterial virulence mechanisms.
AB  == recent studies have shown that exposure to quinolone antibiotics at or below the  minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) results in reduction in the level of production or total elimination of certain factors that contribute to the virulence of bacteria. this study was designed to determine whether low concentrations of enoxacin, lomefloxacin, and ciprofloxacin altered the morphology or affected the production of various virulence factors in several different genera of bacteria. the factors studied were nuclease and a toxin production in staphylococcus aureus, cell size, pili and fimbriae production, and adherence of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa to urinary epithelial cells and dog bladder cells, and the major virulence factor in yersinia pseudotuberculosis. in addition, the effect of growth in low levels of enoxacin on phagocytosis of s. aureus by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) was studied. following exposure to subinhibitory levels of quinolones tested, significant reduction in activity or complete elimination was seen in all of those factors measured. minor differences were noted in the efficiency of elimination among the three quinolones tested. at as low as 1/8 mic there is significant enhancement of phagocytic activity by human pmns. these data suggest  that exposure to quinolones at concentrations below the mic disrupts the regulatory mechanisms that control cell morphology, adherence as well as exocellular enzyme production and plasmid maintenance. this may mean that certain virulent organisms that survive exposure to quinolone antibiotics may be less likely to produce or maintain the disease state in susceptible hosts.

AB  == the structure of the surface of colonies of various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria was examined by transmission electron microscopy. the results indicate that bacterial colonies in the course of their development produce a film which becomes thicker with increased duration of growth. the basic part of the film is an elementary membrane, which is a stable structure with a large surface area. the inner and outer surfaces of the film membrane are covered by amorphous layers. these layers are thicker in the surface film of gram-negative bacterial colonies than in those of gram-positive bacteria. membrane vesicles from the bacterial colonies take part in the formation of the surface film. the presence of the film on the surface of the colonies of different bacteria suggests that this structure may play an important role.

AB  == rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria,  such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid,  277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did  not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither  np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.

AB  == the growth and survival of staphylococcus aureus and salmonella typhimurium were  investigated during the manufacturing and ripening of raw milk montasio cheese. initial inoculated populations in the cheese milk were about 10(5) cfu/ml for s.  aureus and 10(6) cfu/ml for s. typhimurium. samples of curds and cheeses were taken during manufacturing and storage and analysed for ph and microbial populations. s. aureus increased slightly in number during the early period of ripening and attained a population of about 10(6) cfu/ml during the remaining period of storage. s. typhimurium decreased during cheesemaking and storage but persisted through 90 days. the addition of lactobacillus plantarum culture (0.2%  v/v) produced a marked reduction in populations of the test strains in 10 days of storage. enterotoxin a was not detected in montasio cheese even with a s. aureus  population of 1.1 x 10(7) cfu/ml. l. plantarum strains were also tested by the spot method and the associative growth approach for their antagonistic activity against s. aureus and s. typhimurium. the compound excreted by l. plantarum was active only toward s. aureus. furthermore, its activity was destroyed by protease treatment. these results indicated that while the growth of s. typhimurium is reduced by the acid production, s. aureus inhibition can be ascribed to bacteriocin production.

TI  == sugar transport by the bacterial phosphotransferase system. structural and thermodynamic domains of enzyme i of salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == enzyme i, the first in the sequence of phosphocarrier proteins of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:glycose phosphotransferase system, is a potential critical point for regulating sugar uptake. the thermal stability of enzyme i was studied  by high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry. at ph 7.5, thermal unfolding of the protein exhibits two peaks with maxima (tm) at 47.6 and 55.1 degrees c, indicating that the protein comprises two cooperative unfolding structures. interaction between the two domains is markedly dependent on ph within the range 6.5-8.5. at ph 7.5, catalytic activity was unaffected by heating through the first transition but was lost by heating through the second. cleavage of enzyme i (63.5 kda) by trypsin, chymotrypsin, or staphylococcus aureus v8 protease yields a 30-kda fragment, ei-n, containing the nh2 terminus and the active site, his-189. protease and differential scanning calorimetry experiments  show that ei-n is the structural domain corresponding to the cooperative region in the intact enzyme that unfolds at the higher tm. ei-n catalyzes one activity of enzyme i; it accepts a phosphoryl group from phosphohistidine-containing phosphocarrier protein but cannot be phosphorylated by phospho-enzyme i or phosphoenolpyruvate. the phosphoryl transfer between ei-n and the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein is reversible. portions of the salmonella typhimurium ptsi dna sequence are known; the complete sequence is presented here and compared to escherichia coli ptsi.

TI  == bactericidal potency and mechanistic specificity of neutrophil defensins against  bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == two neutrophil defensins, rabbit peptides np-1 and np-5, were examined for their  in vitro antibacterial activity against a panel of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms isolated from mastitic cows. incubation for 60 minutes with 5 micrograms/ml of np-1 in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer resulted in substantial killing (greater than 95%) of all organisms tested. although np-5 was virtually inactive under these same conditions, supplementation of the incubation mixture with dilute nutrient media sensitized otherwise resistant organisms to this defensin. for both np-1 and np-5, bactericidal activity was dependent on time and concentration. our findings demonstrate that the spectrum of defensin bactericidal activities include clinically important bovine pathogens. further, the data demonstrate that np-1 and np-5, peptides which are homologous in 18 of their 33 residue positions, possess distinct mechanisms of action.

TI  == toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 enhances synthesis of endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor in mice.
AB  == toxic shock syndrome toxin 1 (tsst-1) was tested for its ability to enhance the production of endotoxin-induced tumor necrosis factor (tnf) in c3h/hen mice. the  tnf level in serum was quantified by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). it was found that when mice were injected with 20 micrograms of tsst-1 12 h before exposure to 1 micrograms of endotoxin, the serum endotoxin-induced tnf was 20 times as high as that found in mice exposed to endotoxin alone. although 20 micrograms of tsst-1 did induce a maximum level of near 1 ng of tnf per ml of serum 1.5 h after exposure, the tnf concentration was greatly diminished after 5 to 6 h and was no longer detectable after 12 h. pretreatment of mice with 20 micrograms of tsst-1 or 1 micrograms of endotoxin did not influence tnf induction by tsst-1 12 h later. also, pretreatment of mice with 1 micrograms of endotoxin did not enhance tnf induction by endotoxin 12 h later. enhancement was achieved only when mice were exposed to tsst-1 more than 4 h and  less than 24 h before injection of endotoxin. despite the relatively high serum tnf levels (30 to 50 ng/ml), no mortality was observed in the mice treated with both tsst and endotoxin.

TI  == oxygenase side reactions of acetolactate synthase and other carbanion-forming enzymes.
AB  == enzymes that mediate carbanion chemistry must protect their reactants from solvent and undesirable electrophiles, such as molecular oxygen. a number of enzymes that utilize carbanionic intermediates were surveyed for o2-consuming side reactions. several of these enzymes, acetolactate synthase, pyruvate decarboxylase, class ii aldolase, and glutamate decarboxylase, catalyze previously undetected oxygen-consuming reactions, while others such as class i aldolase, [(phosphoribosyl)amino]imidazole carboxylase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and triosephosphate isomerase do not. prior to this work, only ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase was known to catalyze an oxygenase side reaction. these new example indicate that while o2-consuming side reactions are a more general feature of enzyme-mediated carbanion chemistry  than has been previously appreciated, they are not necessarily an inevitable consequence of this chemistry. expression of an oxygenase activity not only depends on the accessibility of the carbanionic intermediate to molecular oxygen  but also may depend on the ability of the enzyme to stabilize the initially formed peroxide anion either through protonation with an appropriate enzymic group or through metal coordination.

TI  == hydrogen peroxide as an alternative hatching egg disinfectant.
AB  == the present study examined the effectiveness of h2o2 at different concentrations  to disinfect broiler hatching eggshell surfaces and to maintain hatching potential. under pure culture conditions, .50% h2o2 yielded over a 6 log kill in  30 s of three potential eggshell bacterial contaminants. under higher h2o2 demands, such as occurs on eggshell surfaces, h2o2 concentrations of 5% (vol/vol) were required to disinfect the shell surfaces (approximately 5 log reduction). hatchability of fertile eggs from a 44-wk-old flock was significantly increased by 2% following spraying 5% h2o2 in comparison to untreated controls. level of contaminated eggs and "early-dead" embryos were significantly reduced in the h2o2-treated eggs. in comparison with formaldehyde fumigation, no significant difference in hatchability due to h2o2 treatment was detected in eggs from a 30-  or 56-wk-old flock. eggshell permeability, as measured by egg moisture loss in an incubator, was not significantly affected by h2o2 (5%) or formaldehyde fumigation when compared with untreated or water-sprayed control eggs. these results demonstrated that h2o2 compared favorably to formaldehyde as a hatching egg disinfectant without adversely affecting hatching potential. under some conditions, h2o2 actually improved the hatching potential of fertile broiler eggs compared with hatchability of untreated eggs.

TI  == antigenic homology among gram-negative organisms isolated from cattle with clinical mastitis.
AB  == this study examined the degree of serologic homology among mastitis pathogens. antibodies were raised against the rc mutant, escherichia coli o111:b4 (strain j5) and affinity purified against lipopolysaccharide derived from the ra mutant,  salmonella typhimurium tv119. these antibodies reacted with a battery of unrelated gram-negative bacteria in whole cell elisa. bacteria with strong cross-reactions included a heterologous, smooth e. coli, salmonella dublin, s. typhimurium, salmonella newport, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. recognition of klebsiella pneumoniae and bordetella bronchisepticum was observed, but reactions  were weaker than with the other isolates. the reduced recognition of these isolates probably reflects a masking effect of the bacterial capsule and variations in lipopolysaccharide structure. the polyclonal antibody did not recognize a gram-positive isolate, staphylococcus aureus. these immunoglobulins were then tested using whole cell elisa against a panel of bacteria recovered from the mammary glands of cattle with clinical mastitis. marked reactivity was noted against a variety of gram-negative pathogens. gram-positive isolates had lower recognition by gram-negative core antigen specific immunoglobulin. the results suggest immunization with rough mutant bacteria may have broad application in the prevention of coliform mastitis.

TI  == response of body temperature and serum iron concentration to repeated pyrogen injection in rabbits.

AB  == the interaction of cells in microbial colonies has been studied by electron-microscopic techniques. two types of contacts between cells have been found to exist in the colonies of gram-negative bacteria of the genera escherichia, shigella and salmonella: close cell adhesion due to the fusion of cell-wall outer membranes and the formation of intersections consisting of membranous tubules. at the sites of close adhesion the fusion of cytoplasmic and  outer membranes have been found to occur in bayer's zones. in the colonies of gram-positive bacteria of the genera staphylococcus and brevibacterium only one type of contacts has been revealed: the fusion of the peptidoglycan layers of the cell walls. the results of this study indicate that in colonies bacteria are not  completely isolated; their interaction leads to the formation of a three-dimensional structure denoted as a cooperative cell system.

AB  == histamine release from human basophil leukocytes from allergic patients or controls was induced by specific antigens, anti-ige or calcium ionophore a23187.  influenza a virus, s. aureus and lipopolysaccharide from s. typhimurium increased the maximum release of histamine and caused a shift to the left of the dose-response curves showing increased cell sensitivity and lowering of the threshold to these stimuli. the mechanism of action was elucidated by examining the mediator release as a function of increasing extracellular concentration of calcium. in these experiments the dose-response curves were changed by the microorganisms and lipopolysaccharide as before. this indicates that the microorganisms and lipopolysaccharide change the basophil cell response to ige-dependent and non-immunological stimuli by causing a change in the subcellular handling of calcium.

TI  == mechanisms of zidovudine resistance in bacteria.
AB  == unlike their parent strains, zidovudine-resistant derivatives of escherichia coli kl16 and salmonella typhimurium nctc 5710 were found to be incapable of incorporating radiolabelled thymidine into their chromosomal dna. since incorporation was still prevented in the presence of edta, resistance to zidovudine was not associated with a permeability barrier, but appeared to result from the loss of thymidine kinase activity, required for the phosphorylation of zidovudine. pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is intrinsically zidovudine-resistant,  was also shown to be incapable of incorporating thymidine into its dna, but staphylococcus epidermidis sk360 and staph. aureus e3t, which are also intrinsically zidovudine-resistant, possessed thymidine kinase activity. this suggests that two distinct mechanisms of resistance to zidovudine exist in bacteria. zidovudine resistance did not appear to confer resistance to other antibacterial agents.

TI  == polyclonal activation of rat b cells. ii. dextran sulfate as a cofactor in mitogen-induced and antigen-induced differentiation of rat b lymphocytes.
AB  == salmonella typhimurium mitogen (stm) is a polyclonal activator of rat b lymphocytes, triggering them to proliferate, but not differentiate, to antibody-secreting cells. when lymphokines in the form of a supernatant from con  a-stimulated splenocytes (cas) are added to b cell cultures activated by stm, only a small number of cells are driven to differentiate. only with the addition  of a third signal provided by the polyanionic polysaccharide dextran sulfate (dxs) is significant rat b cell differentiation observed. in this study, we have  shown that this requirement for dxs is not unique to the stm mitogen. lps, staphylococcus aureus cowan i-fixed cells, and anti-ig antibody all induced rat b cell proliferation with little differentiation, even in the presence of cas. dxs  was necessary to induce differentiation in all cultures costimulated with mitogen and cas. the requirement for dxs for optimal b cell differentiation is also observed with other lymphokine preparations such as the supernatants from pma-stimulated el-4 cells and pha-stimulated human t cells. furthermore, this augmentative effect of dxs in rat b cell differentiation was not confined to polyclonal activation systems. ag-specific igg secretion was also increased when  dxs was added to ag and cas costimulated cultures of b cells harvested from the draining lymph nodes of rats immunized with dnp-keyhole limpet hemocyanin. within the polyclonal activation system, a method of staged additions of stm, dxs, and cas to b cell cultures was used to investigate the role of dxs during b cell differentiation. optimal differentiation occurred only when dxs was present in the b cell cultures in conjunction with cas. the augmentation in differentiation  seen with dxs did not appear to be due to the recruitment of an additional cas-responsive b cell subset, because cycling, low density b cell blasts showed large increases in igm secretion with subsequent exposure to dxs and cas. these studies suggest tha dxs acts as a cofactor to various differentiation factors, augmenting polyclonal and ag-specific rat b cell differentiation. the relevance of dxs to in vivo immune responses is discussed.

AB  == infection models were used to clarify the roles of serum and extravascular concentrations in the in-vivo efficacy observed with azithromycin. in-vivo experiments were designed to give serum concentrations well below the mic and tissue levels generally above the mic at time of challenge and during the course  of infection. the efficacy of azithromycin against a salmonella enteritidis oral  challenge (a tissue-associated infection model) in mice correlated directly with  azithromycin liver levels, but not serum concentrations. the significance of extravascular pharmacokinetics was observed in a comparative study of azithromycin and ciprofloxacin against the salmonella challenge. ciprofloxacin has a greater than 100-fold in-vitro potency advantage over azithromycin against  this organism, but azithromycin (5 mg/kg) produced a greater reduction in cfu than ciprofloxacin (100 mg/kg) at the primary site of infection (liver). in another model, extravascular fluid levels, measured by bioassay of implanted paper discs, were compared with plasma levels in relation to control of a localized staphylococcus aureus infection in rats. extravascular fluid levels of  azithromycin were greater than the mic of the strain used for five days after a 100 mg/kg dose, while erythromycin levels were less than 20% of the mic at 30 h after a 200 mg/kg dose. serum concentrations of both compounds were less than 20% of the mic at the time of challenge. the antibiotic levels at the site of infection correlated with the reduction of staph. aureus cfu (99% with azithromycin compared with controls, p less than 0.01; 0% with erythromycin) recovered from inoculated discs. the significance of extravascular concentrations of azithromycin was further supported in other models of localized infections induced with escherichia coli or a mixture of staph. aureus and bacteroides fragilis.

TI  == binding and killing of bacteria by bismuth subsalicylate.
AB  == bismuth subsalicylate (bss) is a compound without significant aqueous solubility  that is widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. bss was able to bind bacteria of diverse species, and these bound bacteria were subsequently killed. a 4-log10 reduction of viable bacteria occurred within 4 h after a 10 mm  aqueous suspension of bss was inoculated with 2 x 10(6) escherichia coli cells per ml. binding and killing were dependent on the levels of inoculated bacteria,  and significant binding but little killing of the exposed bacteria occurred at an inoculum level of 2 x 10(9) e. coli per ml. intracellular atp decreased rapidly after exposure of e. coli to 10 mm bss and, after 30 min, was only 1% of the original level. extracellular atp increased after exposure to bss, but the accumulation of extracellular atp was not sufficient to account for the loss of intracellular atp. the killing of bacteria exposed to bss may have been due to cessation of atp synthesis or a loss of membrane integrity. bactericidal activity of bss was also investigated in a simulated gastric juice at ph 3. killing of e.  coli at this ph was much more rapid than at ph 7 and was apparently due to salicylate released by the conversion of bss to bismuth oxychloride. it is proposed that the binding and killing observed for bss contribute to the efficacy of this compound against gastrointestinal infections such as traveler's diarrhea.

TI  == oxygen-independent antimicrobial action in sphingosine-treated neutrophils.
AB  == sphingosine is reported to inhibit the oxidative burst and superoxide anion production of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) phagocytosing in atmospheric oxygen (wilson et al., 1986). we have confirmed its effect on superoxide production and examined the antimicrobial phagocytic capacity of pmn treated with sphingosine, comparing them with pmn, untreated but phagocytosing either under anaerobic conditions or in atmospheric oxygen. sphingosine just like anaerobiosis partially inhibited, but did not eliminate, the bactericidal activity of pmn when compared to non-treated aerobic cells. in fact, sphingosine-treated pmn mimicked killing of staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and serratia marcescens (s. marcescens) due to anaerobic pmn. moreover, our results with salmonella typhimurium and sphingosine-treated cells duplicated results this laboratory published previously about comparative killing of salmonella in aerobic versus anaerobic neutrophils. in these studies sphingosine-treated pmn took up bacteria as avidly as untreated pmn and retained their viability, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion. while sphingosine should not be completely substituted for anaerobic studies, it is a convenient screening reagent for the study of non-oxidative killing mechanisms of pmn. results achieved with anaerobic and with sphingosine-treated cells suggest that o2-independent antimicrobial action is substantially more powerful than has been generally acknowledged.

TI  == studies on the domain structure of the salmonella typhimurium arac protein.
AB  == the salmonella typhimurium arac gene product is known to be susceptible to proteolytic degradation. limited cleavage by trypsin, kallikrein, elastase and pronase e yields stable fragments comprising approximately the n-terminal two thirds of the arac protein. these fragments have in common the ability to dimerize in solution and to bind l-arabinose and d-fucose. under appropriate conditions, hydrolysis of the arac protein with staphylococcus aureus v8 protease leads to a small c-terminal fragment which is able to bind specifically to a synthetic ara consensus sequence. these results indicate that, as with several other prokaryotic gene regulatory proteins, the basic functions of effector binding, subunit interaction and specific dna binding are segregated into distinct domains of the arac protein.

TI  == amino acid sequence of salmonella typhimurium branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase.
AB  == the complete amino acid sequence of the subunit of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (transaminase b, ec 2.6.1.42) of salmonella typhimurium was determined. an escherichia coli recombinant containing the ilvgeday gene cluster  of salmonella was used as the source of the hexameric enzyme. the peptide fragments used for sequencing were generated by treatment with trypsin, staphylococcus aureus v8 protease, endoproteinase lys-c, and cyanogen bromide. the enzyme subunit contains 308 residues and has a molecular weight of 33,920. to determine the coenzyme-binding site, the pyridoxal 5-phosphate containing enzyme  was treated with tritiated sodium borohydride prior to trypsin digestion. peptide map comparisons with an apoenzyme tryptic digest and monitoring radioactivity incorporation allowed identification of the pyridoxylated peptide, which was then isolated and sequenced. the coenzyme-binding site is the lysyl residue at position 159. the amino acid sequence of salmonella transaminase b is 97.4% identical with that of escherichia coli, differing in only eight amino acid positions. sequence comparisons of transaminase b to other known aminotransferase sequences revealed limited sequence similarity (24-33%) when conserved amino acid substitutions are allowed and alignments were forced to occur on the coenzyme-binding site.

TI  == [effect of high frequency treatment on several microorganisms important to food health].
AB  == there is an increasing consumer interest in the microwave oven as a more convenient and quicker means of meal preparation. this study investigated whether growth or inactivation of microorganisms in the microwave field follows the same  dynamics as conventional heat processing. product safety during microwave treatment of food products is of special interest. as parameters d-values of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus were calculated after microwave exposure and conventional heat treatment at +55 degrees c and +60 degrees c respectively. the irradiation frequency was 2450 mhz; the microwave power ranged from 0 to 1037 w. furthermore an assessment was made on the growth rates of e. coli at +37 degrees c and on the influence of microwaves on lyophilized e. coli-cells. with a special temperature measurement system (luxtron 1000 a) which used nonmetallic and microwave transparent fiber optic probes, the temperature was recorded during each experiment. at certain temperatures some of the strains showed slight although significant differences depending on which of the abovementioned techniques had been applied. however there was no particular trend evident from the results. d-values of e. coli at +55 degrees c and s. typhimurium at +55 degrees c and +60 degrees c obtained from both heat sources were coincided. microwave reduction of s. aureus at +55 degrees c was more rapid than conventional heat inactivation; on the other hand a slower  inactivation rate of s. aureus and e. coli at +60 degrees c was observed. growth  of e. coli was slightly delayed during microwave incubation. there are no effects concerning microwave-treated e. coli-cells. the hypothesis positing the existence of so called "athermal effects" was neither proved nor rejected on the basis of the experiments. in terms of product safety, it must be taken into account that microwave heat processing in general use may result in a markedly uneven distribution of temperature within the product. adequate means should be provided for heat conduction so as to allow temperatures of "hot" and "cold" spots to be sufficiently equilibrated.

TI  == effect of immune globulin intravenous on opsonization of bacteria by classic and  alternative complement pathways in premature serum.
AB  == the mechanisms involved in the effect of immune globulin intravenous (igiv) on bacterial opsonization by both complement pathways in premature serum were elucidated in this study. of the bacteria used, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enteritidis were nonencapsulated while streptococcus pyogenes and escherichia coli 07 k1 were encapsulated. as demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence, igiv showed specific antibody titers of 1:32 for s. aureus and s. enteritidis and of 1:8 for s. pyogenes and e. coli 07 k1. igiv alone had no direct opsonic activity against these organisms. addition of igiv did not alter the opsonic activity of normal adult serum against these organisms. in contrast, addition of igiv promoted the opsonic activity of premature serum against the nonencapsulated bacteria to levels matching that in normal adult serum. the igiv preparation significantly improved the opsonization of bacteria by the classic (from 39 to 68% of that in adult serum) and alternative (from 22 to 97% of that in adult serum) complement pathways in premature serum. igiv also  markedly augmented c3 deposition on the bacteria by both complement pathways. these studies suggest that igiv containing high titers of specific antibodies promote opsonization of bacteria by the enhancement of complement pathway activation, especially the alternative pathway, in premature serum.

TI  == photokilling of bacteria by the natural dye curcumin.
AB  == curcumin is a yellow-orange compound derived from the root of curcuma longa (zingiberaceae family), that has been used as a medicine, spice and coloring agent. curcumin has proved nontoxic in a number of cell culture and whole animal  studies. curcumin has, however, been reported to have bactericidal effects at very high concentrations. when illuminated, curcumin exerted potent phototoxic effects in micromolar amounts. gram-negative bacteria displayed greater resistance to curcumin phototoxicity relative to gram-positive bacteria. oxygen was required for curcumin phototoxicity. curcumin binding to cells was not required for photokilling; the reactive intermediate therefore must be relatively long-lived. the mechanism(s) of curcumin phototoxicity may involve hydrogen peroxide production. singlet excited oxygen was not detected.

TI  == anti-bacterial activity mediated by human platelets.

TI  == factors affecting the survival of pathogenic bacteria in subtropical river water.
AB  == the present study was carried out to determine the factors causing the disappearance of introduced salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio cholerae in natural river water. when large numbers of the above organisms (final level 10(7)-10(8) cfu per ml) were added to river water, the decline of their numbers coincided with increasing numbers of protozoa. furthermore, their survival was improved dramatically if the river water was amended with a eucaryote inhibitor. after comparing the survivals of the test organisms in physiological saline, filtered river water, and in dialysis tubes immersed in river water, the results suggested that for salmonella, predation was the most significant factor which caused the decline of its population in natural river water; starvation and toxic materials played lesser roles. staphylococcus and vibrio were also vulnerable to predation and toxic materials have molecular weights larger than 12,000. in the natural environment, these three factors together could cause rapid disappearance of the introduced microorganisms.

TI  == divergent changes in antimicrobial activity after immunologic activation of mouse peritoneal macrophages.
AB  == to find out whether activated macrophages display a nonspecific enhancement of antibacterial activity, we determined the intracellular killing of bacteria by peritoneal macrophages from cba and c57bl/10 mice infected with bcg and challenged with mycobacterial antigens (purified protein derivative (ppd]. after  in vivo phagocytosis, the rate of in vitro intracellular killing of listeria monocytogenes by bacillus calmette-guerin (bcg)-ppd-activated macrophages from cba mice increased by a factor of 1.7 and that of those from c57bl/10 mice by a factor of 2.0, relative to the rate in normal resident macrophages. the increased listericidal activity of bcg-ppd-activated macrophages could not have been due to an increased number of peroxidase-positive macrophages because exudate macrophages obtained after i.p. injection of proteose peptone into bcg-infected mice or ppd into control mice, killed ingested listeria about as efficiently as normal resident macrophages did. in contrast, bcg-ppd-activated macrophages from  both mouse strains killed salmonella somewhat less efficiently and escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus with the same efficiency as normal resident macrophages did. these cells, however, inhibited the intracellular replication of toxoplasma gondii. activated peritoneal macrophages from listeria-infected mice showed a similar increase of the rate of intracellular killing of listeria and absence of change in rate of intracellular killing of salmonella. consistent with the in vitro findings, the number of viable l. monocytogenes in the spleen and liver of bcg-infected cba and c57bl/10 mice decreased during the first 2 days after i.v. injection, whereas salmonella typhimurium proliferated in these organs of both mouse strains. checking the state of activation of bcg-ppd-activated macrophages showed that these cells displayed enhanced o2-consumption and h2o2 release after stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate compared with resident macrophages. the present findings show that the antimicrobial activity of immunologically activated macrophages is not uniformly increased: for certain microorganisms (l. monocytogenes, t. gondii), this effector function is enhanced, whereas for others (s. typhimurium, s. aureus, e. coli), it is not.

TI  == salmonella-typhimurium-specific difference in rate of intracellular killing by resident peritoneal macrophages from salmonella-resistant cba and salmonella-susceptible c57bl/10 mice.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to determine whether the difference between the  rate of intracellular killing of salmonella typhimurium by macrophages of salmonella-resistant cba and salmonella-susceptible c57bl/10 mice also holds for  other salmonellae and other bacteria species. after in vivo phagocytosis, the initial rate of in vitro intracellular killing of s. typhimurium phagetype 505, s. typhimurium phagetype 510, and s. typhimurium m206 by macrophages of cba mice  amounted always to approximately 1.7 times the value found for macrophages of c57bl/10 mice (p less than 0.001), indicating that the difference in killing efficiency between cba and c57bl/10 macrophages holds for various strains of s. typhimurium. however, some other salmonella species, i.e., s. dublin and s. heidelberg, as well as e. coli 054 and 02k1+, listeria monocytogenes egd and l347, and staphylococcus aureus were killed equally efficiently by macrophages of both mouse strains. these findings indicate that the difference between the rates of intracellular killing by macrophages of salmonella-resistant cba and salmonella-susceptible c57bl/10 does not hold for several other bacteria species  and thus might be specific for s. typhimurium. subsequent experiments showed that the in vivo proliferation of s. typhimurium 510 in the first 2 days after i.v. injection was 2.0-fold to 3.0-fold higher in the spleens and livers of c57bl/10 mice than in those of cba mice, whereas the in vivo proliferation of s. dublin and s. heidelberg was between 1.0-fold to 1.4-fold higher in the c57bl/10 mice. these findings suggest that the differences between the rate of in vitro intracellular killing of salmonella by cba and c57bl/10 macrophages are reflected in differences in the rate of in vivo proliferation of these microorganisms in cba and c57bl/10 mice. to gain insight into the involvement of the oxidative metabolism of cba and c57bl/10 macrophages in the difference in the rate of intracellular killing of s. typhimurium, the o2 consumption and h2o2 release by resident peritoneal macrophages was determined. the amplitudes of the respiratory burst and the release of h2o2 was identical in macrophages of the two mouse strains after triggering by either preopsonized heat-killed s. typhimurium or phorbol myristic acetate. these findings indicate that the mouse species-associated difference in the intracellular killing of s. typhimurium is not caused by a difference in the oxidative metabolism of cba and c57bl/10 macrophages.

TI  == kinetics of receptor modification. the multiply methylated aspartate receptors involved in bacterial chemotaxis.
AB  == a method for determining the extent of methyl esterification of each of the four  potential sites on the aspartate receptors involved in chemotaxis in escherichia  coli and salmonella typhimurium is presented. in this procedure, radioactive methyl esters are incorporated into the receptors, the receptors are cleaved by trypsin and the v8 protease from staphylococcus aureus, and the four fragments containing sites of methylation are separated by high performance liquid chromatography. using this technique, we find that the rate of methyl esterification increases at all four sites after stimulation with the "attractant" aspartate, suggesting that all four sites of modification are involved in adaptation to aspartate. we also find that the rate of methyl esterification at each site is correlated with the homology between the protein sequence at that site and the "consensus" sequence, glu-glu-x-x-ala-thr/ser.

AB  == the effect of 80% co2 (balance air) on the survival and growth of microorganisms  most often associated with spoilage and foodborne disease in poultry carcasses was compared to air at 2, 7, and 13 c. the co2 atmosphere substantially retarded  the growth of the total bacterial load in uninoculated ground chicken meat and parts at all temperatures when compared to air; however, temperature had a larger overall effect than atmosphere. ground chicken meat and synthetic broth were inoculated (greater than 10(4) cells/ml or g) with pseudomonas fragi, salmonella  typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, or clostridium sporogenes and the influence of 80% co2 and incubation temperature studied. with the exception of cl. sporogenes, 80% co2 was inhibitory when compared to air at any given temperature. in most cases, co2 was more inhibitory at 2 c than at 7 or 13 c. the cl. sporogenes inoculum failed to grow above initial inoculum levels in any combination of temperature and atmosphere, but samples packed in 80% co2 had higher numbers of colony forming units than air-packaged samples. this study does not indicate that modified atmosphere packaging of refrigerated poultry in elevated co2 atmospheres increases the microbial hazards when compared to air at  the same temperature.

TI  == propanediol oxidoreductases of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium. aspects of interspecies structural and regulatory differentiation.
AB  == the enzyme propanediol oxidoreductase, which converts the lactaldehyde formed in  the metabolism of fucose and rhamnose into propane-1,2-diol under anaerobic conditions, was investigated in escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and salmonella typhimurium. structural analysis indicated that the enzymes of e. coli and k. pneumoniae have the same mr and pi, whereas that of salm. typhimurium also has the same mr but a slightly different pi. one-dimensional peptide mapping showed identity between the e. coli and k. pneumoniae enzymes when digested with  alpha-chymotrypsin, staphylococcus aureus v8 proteinase or subtilisin. in the case of salm. typhimurium, this held only for the subtilisin-digested enzymes, indicating that the hydrophobic regions were preserved to a considerable extent.  anaerobically, the three species induced an active propanediol oxidoreductase when grown on fucose or rhamnose. an inactive propanediol oxidoreductase was induced in salm. typhimurium by either fucose or rhamnose under aerobic conditions, and this was activated once anaerobiosis was established. an inactive propanediol oxidoreductase was also induced in e. coli under aerobic conditions,  but only by growth on fucose. the inactive enzyme was not induced by either of the sugars in k. pneumoniae.

TI  == mouse chromosome 1 ity locus regulates microbicidal activity of isolated peritoneal macrophages against a diverse group of intracellular and extracellular bacteria.
AB  == the genotype of a mouse influences whether or not it will survive infection with  the agent of murine typhoid, salmonella typhimurium. the best-characterized murine salmonella response gene is a chromosome 1 locus designated ity. inbred strains of mice that express the itys allele are unable to contain the net growth of salmonella typhimurium within their spleens and livers, and usually die early  in the infection. by contrast, mice homozygous or heterozygous for the ityr allele are able to control the net multiplication of salmonella typhimurium within these organs. the ity gene also appears to regulate the extent of replication within murine reticuloendothelial cell tissues of the obligate intracellular parasite leishmania donovani, as well as the facultative intracellular bacteria mycobacterium bovis and mycobacterium lepraemurium. previous studies from our laboratory strongly suggested that ityr mice are more resistant to s. typhimurium infection than are itys mice, because resident ityr macrophages kill salmonellae more efficiently than do itys macrophages. in this study, we used an in vitro macrophage assay to assess the specificity of the enhanced killing capacity of ityr macrophages. we found that ityr macrophages were better able than itys macrophages to kill both intracellular bacteria (salmonella typhi) and extracellular bacteria (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, corynebacterium diphtheriae). thus, the diversity of organisms affected by ity expression suggests that the product of this gene may play a key regulatory role in the initial interaction of mice with a variety of microbial agents.

TI  == differences in initial rate of intracellular killing of salmonella typhimurium by resident peritoneal macrophages from various mouse strains.
AB  == to determine the underlining mechanism of the difference in innate susceptibility of mouse strains to infection by salmonella typhimurium, the ingestion and in vitro intracellular killing of s. typhimurium by resident peritoneal macrophages  of mouse strains that differ in natural resistance to this microorganism has been studied. the results revealed that the rate constants of in vitro phagocytosis (kph) in the presence of inactivated rabbit immune serum did not differ between macrophages of susceptible c57bl/10 and resistant cba mice (for both strains: kph = 0.021 min-1). the rate constant of in vitro intracellular killing (kk) was determined 1) after in vivo phagocytosis (cba, kk = 0.055 min-1; c57bl/10, kk = 0.031 min-1), 2) after in vitro phagocytosis of preopsonized bacteria (cba, kk =  0.020 min-1; c57bl/10, kk = 0.012 min-1), and 3) during continuous phagocytosis in vitro (cba, kk = 0.029 min-1; c57bl/10, kk = 0.013 min-1). with all three approaches, the initial rate of intracellular killing by normal macrophages of salmonella-resistant cba mice amounted to about 1.7 times the value found for macrophages of susceptible c57bl/10 mice (p less than 0.01). this trait difference was independent of the previous way of ingestion of the bacteria, unaffected by the kind of opsonization, and specific for s. typhimurium, because  staphylococcus aureus and listeria monocytogenes were killed by macrophages of these mouse strains with equal efficiency (p greater than 0.50). these findings indicate that a difference in genetic background expressed in the efficacy of intracellular killing by resident peritoneal macrophages immediately upon ingestion of s. typhimurium is relevant for the innate resistance of mice against s. typhimurium.

TI  == neutrophil bactericidal dysfunction towards oxidant radical-sensitive microorganisms during experimental iron deficiency.
AB  == we developed a clear-cut nutritional iron deficiency anemia without concomittant  malnutrition in rats given a low iron diet, and we restored normal iron and hemoglobin levels in these same animals with iron dextran injections. the neutrophil function studies performed during and after a period of iron deficiency showed the following: phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus 502a, streptococcus pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium was not altered by iron deficiency or by the administration of iron; phagocytosis of candida albicans was moderately abnormal during iron deficiency, and became normal with the restoration of iron sufficiency. microbicidal activity towards staphylococcus aureus 502a and candida albicans, two catalase-positive microorganisms, was markedly decreased (to 50% of control values) and returned to normal when iron sufficiency was restored. killing of a catalase-negative organism, streptococcus  pneumoniae was normal in iron-deficient rats. this pattern of differential bactericidal activities suggested an abnormality of the oxidant radical-generating machinery in neutrophils of iron-deficient animals. indeed, iron deficiency caused a marked decrease of neutrophil nitroblue tetrazolium dye  reduction, which disappeared after iron administration. neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity was slightly decreased in iron deficient rats and returned to normal after iron administration. microbicidal activity towards a gram-negative, catalase-positive organism, salmonella typhimurium, was equal in iron deficient and iron sufficient animals. our combined results suggest that a definite microbicidal defect is the consequence of nutritional iron deficiency, apart from any protein-calorie malnutrition. this defect affects the disposal in  pmns of two catalase-positive microorganisms (which require intracellular production of oxidant radicals for their destruction) but not of a catalase-negative bacterial species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sites of methyl esterification and deamination on the aspartate receptor involved in chemotaxis.
AB  == the receptors involved in bacterial chemotaxis are post-translationally modified  by specific enzymes which catalyze the deamination of glutaminyl residues and the methyl esterification and demethylation of glutamyl residues. in this work we identify the sites of these covalent modifications on the aspartate receptor from salmonella typhimurium. these were identified using the properties of the staphylococcus aureus v8 protease which cleaves peptide bonds following glutamyl  but not glutaminyl residues. we show here that bonds following methyl-esterified  glutamyl residues are also resistant to the protease. a comparison of the fragments obtained after v8 protease cleavage of methyl-esterified (or deaminated) peptides with the fragments from the corresponding unmodified peptides immediately yields the sites of modification. three of the four methyl-esterified glutamyl residues are located near the middle of the receptor amino acid sequence; one of these is synthesized as a glutaminyl residue and is deaminated by the esterase to form a glutamyl residue. the fourth site of methyl  esterification is located near the carboxyl terminus. all four sites occupy analogous positions in a well-conserved arrangement of residues which may form a  binding site for the esterase and the methyltransferase.

TI  == determination of surface charge of some bacteria by colloid titration.
AB  == the surface charge of bacteria is always negative except below ph 2. the negative charge depends mainly upon phosphate and carboxyl groups. the charge of six kinds of bacteria was determined by colloid titration between ph 2 and 11. when there is amino group on the cell surface, it is positive as ammonium cation between ph  2 and 10, and it combines with the negative groups to neutralize the negative charge. in the presence of formalin, the colloid titration results show that the  free amine is blocked by formalin, and the amino group can be estimated by the difference between the two titration results. above ph 10, the titration results  of escherichia coli and salmonella typhi in the presence of formalin implied the  existence of guanidyl group. the titration results of living bacterial suspensions were quite the same as those of heat-killed ones.

AB  == the integral membrane protein responsible for the transport and phosphorylation of d-mannitol in escherichia coli, the mannitol-specific enzyme ii of the phosphotransferase system (mr = 60,000), has been purified to apparent homogeneity using a modification of a previously published procedure (jacobson, g. r., lee, c. a., and saier, m. h., jr. (1979) j. biol. chem. 254, 249-252). the purified enzyme was dependent on lubrol px and phospholipid for maximal activity. it catalyzed both the phosphoenolpyruvate- and the mannitol 1-phosphate-dependent phosphorylation of d-mannitol with high specificity for the accepting sugar and the phosphoryl donor. both mannitol and mannitol 1-phosphate gave strong substrate inhibition at neutral ph in the transphosphorylation reaction catalyzed by the purified mannitol enzyme ii, while no substrate inhibition by mannitol was observed for the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent reaction. the purified enzyme did  not catalyze hydrolysis of mannitol 1-phosphate, a product of both reactions. antibody directed against the mannitol enzyme ii inhibited the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent activity to a greater extent than the transphosphorylation activity. limited proteolysis with trypsin rapidly inactivated both purified and membrane-bound mannitol enzyme ii, and the purified protein was concomitantly cleaved into fragments with apparent molecular weights  of about 29,000. these results show that although the mannitol enzyme ii is an integral membrane protein, a considerable portion of its polypeptide chain must also extend into a hydrophilic environment, presumably the cytoplasm.

TI  == effect of erythrocyte ingestion on macrophage antibacterial function.
AB  == individuals with sickle cell anemia are subject to serious infections caused by a number of bacteria, including salmonella species and staphylococcus aureus. it has been suggested that in sickle cell anemia, extensive erythrophagocytosis by macrophages may interfere with their antibacterial function and thereby predispose to infection. as a means of investigating this possibility, we evaluated the effects of erythrocyte ingestion on the killing of salmonella typhimurium by peritoneal macrophages and of s. aureus by alveolar macrophages. monolayers of rabbit macrophages were exposed to erythrocytes or latex particles  immediately before and during bacterial challenge. erythrophagocytosis markedly inhibited intracellular killing of s. typhimurium by peritoneal macrophages (bacterial survival was 181% of control) and of staphylococci by alveolar macrophages (bacterial survival was greater than 200% of control). exposure to latex particles depressed the bactericidal activity of alveolar macrophages to a  lesser degree. next we investigated the possibility that erythrophagocytosis inhibits oxidative bactericidal mechanisms in macrophages. hexose monophosphate shunt activity was stimulated by erythrocyte ingestion. however, zymosan-induced  superoxide generation and chemiluminescence were suppressed by erythrocytes. furthermore, a cell-free (hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase) system for chemiluminescence generation was also depressed in the presence of erythrocytes (intact or lysate) or by purified hemoglobin. these studies reveal that erythrophagocytosis inhibits macrophage antibacterial function, probably because  of interactions between erythrocyte components and reactive products of phagocyte oxygen metabolism. this host defense abnormality may predispose to bacterial infection in certain hemolytic anemias.

AB  == bacterial hydrophobicity was measured as the affinity of palmitic acid to the cell surface. cell surface and buffer were regarded as two immiscible phases with different affinity for the fatty acid. after equilibration of the system, the partition quotient (pq) between the two phases was calculated. the bacteria hydrophobicity was expressed as the amount of cell mass required to give a partition quotient of 10 between amount of fatty acid bound to cell surface and amount of fatty acid in buffer (pq 10). this system permits measurement of changes in hydrophobicity during bacterial growth as shown for staphylococcus aureus, strain v 8. the hydrophobicity of this bacterium increased 4-5 times during the exponential growth-phase of the culture. in the stationary growth-phase there was a loss of hydrophobicity, which continued for at least 48  hours, linearly with time. the system was also tested with a salmonella typhimurium strain and its rough mutant. the results were consistent with findings in other test systems measuring the hydrophobicity of these bacteria.

AB  == the general histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein (hpr) of the salmonella phosphotransferase system is required for the phosphorylation of all sugar substrates by this system. the complete amino acid sequence of hpr, consisting of 84 amino acid residues, has been established. the sequence was determined by cleaving the protein with cyanogen bromide, trypsin, and with a protease from staphylococcus aureus, followed by isolation and amino acid sequence determination of the resulting peptides. the salmonella typhimurium protein contains two histidine residues, at positions 15 and 75, respectively. the phosphoryl group in phospho-hpr was linked to the his-15 residue. based on several lines of evidence, the hpr protein from escherichia coli appears to be identical with the protein from s. typhimurium. the hpr protein from s. aureus has also been isolated in this laboratory and was shown to differ from the hpr proteins described above both with respect to amino acid composition and the inability of the s. aureus and e. coli hpr proteins to substitute for each other  in the in vitro sugar phosphorylation assays. the complete amino acid sequence of s. aureus hpr has been reported (beyreuther, k., raufuss, h., schrecker, o., and  hengstenberg, w. (1977) eur. j. biochem. 75, 275-286), and its secondary structure has been predicted; this protein contains 70 amino acid residues and only one histidine. in the present studies, three methods were used to predict the secondary structure of s. typhimurium hpr, the results were combined, and a secondary structure for the protein is proposed. although the amino acid compositions and sequences of the s. typhimurium and s. aureus hpr proteins are quite different, 13 residues are identical in the sequence of the two proteins, and most of these are located near the active site histidine residue. in addition, the predicted secondary structures of the two proteins are quite similar; the additional 14 residues in s. typhimurium, located at the carboxyl terminal end, are predicted to form an alpha-helix.

TI  == fate in model ecosystems of microbial species of potential use in genetic engineering.
AB  == the changes in populations of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, agrobacterium tumefaciens, rhizobium meliloti, and saccharomyces cerevisiae were measured after their introduction into samples of sewage, lake water, and soil. enumeration of small populations was possible because the strains used were resistant to antibiotics in concentrations and combinations such that few species native to these ecosystems were able to grow on agar containing the inhibitors. fewer than 2 cells per ml of sewage or lake water and 25 cells per g of soil could be detected. a. tumefaciens and r. meliloti persisted in significant numbers with little decline, but s. aureus, k. pneumoniae, s. typhimurium, s. cerevisiae, and  vegetative cells of b. subtilis failed to survive in samples of sewage and lake water. in sterile sewage, however, k. pneumoniae, b. subtilis, s. typhimurium, a. tumefaciens, and r. meliloti grew; s. cerevisiae populations were maintained at the levels used for inoculation; and s. aureus died rapidly. in sterile lake water, the population of s. aureus and k. pneumoniae and the number of vegetative cells of b. subtilis declined rapidly, r. meliloti grew, and the other species maintained significant numbers with little or a slow decline. the populations of  s. aureus, k. pneumoniae, a. tumefaciens, b. subtilis, and s. typhimurium declined in soil, but the first four species grew in sterile soil. it is suggested that some species persist in environments in which they are not indigenous because they tolerate abiotic stresses, do not lose viability readily  when starved, and coexist with antagonists. the species that fails to survive need only be affected by one of these factors.

TI  == enhancement of host susceptibility to lethal endotoxin shock by staphylococcal pyrogenic exotoxin type c.
AB  == staphylococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (pe) ty pe c enhanced the susceptibility of rabbits to lethal shock by endotoxin by as much as 50,000-fold. a graph of log pe type c dose used for pretreatment versus log 50% lethal dose of endotoxin gave a  straight line with a slope of approximately -1. rabbits that received pe type c alone showed fevers only, but those given both pe ty pe c and endotoxin showed initial fever followed by hypothermia, labored breathing, diarrhea, evidence of vascular collapse, and finally death. when a pe type c dose of 3 micrograms/kg was used, pretreatment of the animals with pe for 2 h before giving the endotoxin was required to obtain maximal susceptibility. however, when 15 micrograms of pe  type c per kg was utilized, the endotoxin could be given before, concurrently, or after pe type c. the capacity of pe type c to prepare rabbits for enhanced susceptibility to endotoxin was lost after 24 to 48 h. animals could be protected from enhanced susceptibility to endotoxin by prior immunization with either pe type c or endotoxin. however, 30% of the rabbits which were immunized with pe type c failed to develop immunity, and after three injections of pe type c, these animals developed gram-negative bacteremia and succumbed. in addition, rabbits with diarrhea initially, possibly caused by pasteurella infection, died less than 24 h after a single injection of pe type c.

TI  == polyclonal activation of human peripheral blood b lymphocytes by formaldehyde-fixed salmonella paratyphi b. ii. heterogeneity of b lymphocytes.
AB  == b-cell 'activation' in cultures stimulated with pokeweed mitogen (pwm), staphylococcus aureus strain cowan i, or formaldehyde-fixed salmonella paratyphi  b (spb) was evaluated by enumeration of cells secreting immunoglobulin (ig) and by quantitation of ig released into culture supernatants. a dissociation between  these two values was found after day 6 in cultures activated with pwm or spb, suggesting that ig-secreting cells (isc) are heterogeneous in terms of ig secretion rate. generation of isc in cultures activated with pwm or spb was partially inhibited by hydroxyurea, but ig levels in culture supernatants were not affected. these results indicate that there are at least two subpopulations of isc in stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures, one sensitive to, and  the other resistant to, hydroxyurea. the hydroxyurea-resistant subpopulation appeared to be more mature and to release most all of the ig detected in culture  supernatants. furthermore, time-course studies of isc numbers and ig levels showed that each isc in spb-stimulated cultures (but not in pwm-stimulated cultures) was more active in ig synthesis and secretion after day 8 than before day 6, indicating that after day 8 most of the isc in cultures activated with spb were hydroxyurea-resistant. these studies suggest that spb is another useful polyclonal b-cell 'activator' for studies of human b-cell differentiation and function, and that spb defines two distinct subsets of b cells.

TI  == hexachlorophene. secondary microorganism resistance to hexachlorophene. conjugative transfer inhibition by the r-plasmid-coded resistance by hexachlorophene.
AB  == strain resistance of the genus escherichia, salmonella, and pseudomonas to hexachlorophene is inducible. secondary resistance of the gram-negative microorganisms to hexachlorophene is an inherited property of these strains. there are not any explicit differences of primary sensitivity to hexachlorophene  between sensitive strains and those resistant to antibiotics. the secondary resistance level of gram-negative microorganisms to hexachlorophene is also not dependent on the natural resistance (or sensitivity) of strains to antibiotics. hexachlorophene, in concentration of 10 micrograms/ml of conjugation mixture, causes 100% inhibition of the conjugation transfer of the resistance determinants to antibiotics from tested strains with conjugative r-plasmid. the indirect secondary resistance conjugation transfer to hexachlorophene was verified in two  cases. the resistance to hexachlorophene was transferred, coupled with resistance to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and streptomycin, from the escherichia coli strains (no. 8) and salmonella typhimurium (no. 4) to the recipient escherichia coli strain k 12, szk-ec-329/74 (no. 2).

AB  == the adherence of staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae radiolabelled with 3h-thymidine to dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene prosthetic vascular graft materials was investigated using an in vitro method. adherence readily occurred after a few minutes of incubation. enterobacteriaceae adhered to dacron in a 10-100 times greater number per mm of length than to polytetrafluoroethylene. the addition of velour to the dacron graft further increased the number of adherent bacteria. in contrast, the adherence of coagulase-negative and positive staphylococci per mm of length was roughly the same to dacron and polytetrafluoroethylene. the adherence of bacteria to vascular graft materials may be part of the underlying pathogenesis of vascular graft infections and differential adherence amongst various graft materials could be of clinical importance. however, in the absence of controlled clinical studies, the significance of these findings remains to be determined.

AB  == we report a procedure for the isolation of iiiglc of salmonella typhimurium, a protein component of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system. iiiglc is a soluble protein with a molecular weight of 21,000, as determined by gel filtration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the purified protein is involved in the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of methyl alpha-glucoside in vitro. its affinity for octyl-sepharose may be an indication of the partial hydrophobic  nature of iiiglc. a specific antiserum against purified iiiglc was prepared. growth on different carbon sources did not affect the synthesis of iiiglc, as determined by quantitative immunoelectrophoresis. mutations which lower the adenosine 3',5'-phosphate level, such as cya and pts, do not alter the iiiglc level. the closely related enteric bacteria escherichia coli and klebsiella aerogenes contain a protein factor which is closely related to iiiglc of s. typhimurium, whereas staphylococcus aureus does not.

TI  == a genetic locus responsible for salmonella susceptibility in bsvs mice is not responsible for the limited t-dependent immune responsiveness of bsvs mice.
AB  == bsvs mice are known to be highly susceptible to salmonella infection. we have shown that the bulk of the difference in susceptibility between bsvs and salmonella-resistant a/j mice is the result of a genetic difference at a single locus not closely linked to h-2, igh-c, or hbb, and not x-linked. we have backcrossed the a/j allele at this locus into bsvs mice for 8 successive generations and have demonstrated that the salmonella resistance afforded by this allele is not the result of a restoration of the generalized poor t-dependent responsiveness of bsvs mice. the salmonella resistance locus we have examined with these 2 strains is probably the same as the ity locus described by others.

TI  == polyclonal activation of human peripheral blood b lymphocytes by formaldehyde-fixed salmonella paratyphi b. i. immunoglobulin production without dna synthesis.
AB  == a "new" polyclonal activator of human peripheral blood b cells, formaldehyde-fixed salmonella paratyphi b, is described. this bacterium does not  stimulate cell proliferation as measured by incorporation of tritiated thymidine  but does stimulate a subpopulation of b cells to secrete large amounts of igm, igg, and iga in 7-day cell cultures. the immunoglobulins (ig) produced by cells responding to s. paratyphi b are not specific antibodies against the bacterial antigens. in comparison with other b cell activators (pokeweed mitogen, staphylococcus aureus cowan i, and lipopolysaccharide), s. paratyphi b stimulation produced greater amounts of igm but less igg than pokeweed mitogen (pwm) or s. aureus cowan i; lipopolysaccharide failed to stimulate significant ig production on day 7 in most cases. in addition, the response to s. paratyphi apparently did not require t cell collaboration. these results suggest that the b cell subpopulation(s) responding to s. paratyphi b may be more differentiated b cells than those responding to either pwm or s. aureus cowan i. peripheral blood  mononuclear cells from five patients with common variable immunodeficiency without evidence of abnormal suppressor t cells or monocytes failed to respond to s. paratyphi b, whereas cells from two of the same patients responded well to s.  aureus cowan i and partially to pwm. thus, s. paratyphi b appears to be superior  to other b cell activators for studies of b cell function in normal and abnormal  states.

TI  == antibacterial functions of macrophages in experimental protein-calorie malnutrition. ii. cellular and humoral factors for chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and  intracellular bactericidal activity.
AB  == cellular and humoral aspects of the antibacterial activity of macrophages during  experimental protein-calorie malnutrition were studied. there were no defects in  chemotaxis or bactericidal activity of cells from protein-deficient animals, although phagocytosis-associated oxygen consumption and hexose monophosphate shunt activity were depressed. however, marked impairment of humoral chemotactic  factors generated in the peritoneal cavity by glycogen injection and of heatlabile serum opsonins for staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and salmonella enteritidis was found. the studies suggested that some macrophage antibacterial functions measured in vitro are not altered in experimental acute protein-calorie malnutrition, but that serum factors, presumably complement-derived, would limit their in vivo function. thymic involution and lymphocyte depletion would further impair in vivo cellular immune  reactions affected by macrophages. this model may therefore prove useful for the  study of specific aspects of cellular immunity in malnourished hosts and of specific rehabilitation strategies.

TI  == antibacterial activity of cefamandole in vitro.
AB  == cefamandole, a new cephalosporin derivative, was found to have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity against a cross-section of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria isolated clinically. gram-positive cocci, except for streptococcus faecalis, were extremely susceptible to cefamandole; penicillin g-resistant staphylococcus aureus also was highly susceptible. minimal bactericidal concentrations for gram-positive cocci approximated the minimal inhibitory concentrations. strains of haemophilus influenzae were very susceptible to the drug. most strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella species, and proteus species were inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole, salmonella typhi, including ampicillin- and chloramphenicol-resistant strains, was inhibited by low concentrations of cefamandole. susceptible bacteria became increasingly resistant as the inoculum size was increased. strains of pseudomonas were resistant to cefamandole.

TI  == hyperthermia and human leukocyte functions: effects on response of lymphocytes to mitogen and antigen and bactericidal capacity of monocytes and neutrophils.
AB  == it has recently been demonstrated that fever, or hyperthermia, results in enhanced survival of lizards infected by aeromonas hydrophila. in the present study, the effects of hyperthermia on certain immune functions were assayed in vitro with purified human leukocytes. lymphocyte transformation responses to the  mitogen phytohemagglutinin and the common antigen streptokinase-streptodornase were enhanced at 38.5 degrees c relative to 37 degrees c whether analyzed according to absolute counts per minute of incorporated tritiated thymidine or according to stimulation indexes. enhancement of response was not accompanied by  acceleration of response. augmentation of transformation response was generally not seen at 40 degrees c; incubation at that temperature was associated with decreased cellular viability. significant, though small, increases of the bactericidal capacity of polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 40 degrees c relative to 37 degrees c were shown at 1 h with escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes, but not with staphylococcus aureus. mononuclear phagocytes did not show enhanced bactericidal capacity at the elevated temperature with any of these organisms in this in vitro system. hyperthermia may enhance certain host defense mechanisms and warrants further study.

AB  == the phagocytic activity and the chemiluminescence response of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils were studied with normal human serum used as opsonin for s. typhimurium and s. aureus. when serum was heated, chelated with ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid (egta), or absorbed with zymosan, there were reduction of phagocytic activity for s. aureus and a comparable reduction of chemiluminescence; a 50 per cent decrease in phagocytosis by neutrophils corresponded to a 50 per cent reduction in the chemiluminescence response. in contrast, s. typhimurium was successfully phagocytized in serum treated with mgegta (complement--alternate pathway intact; classic pathway blocked), and chemiluminescence was reduced by only 20 per cent under the same conditions. both neutrophil phagocytic and chemiluminescence responses for s. typhimurium were abolished when serum was heated at 56 degrees c. or adsorbed with zymosan. these  findings suggest that both phagocytosis and chemiluminescence in neutrophils are  interrelated, and the chemiluminescence response of neutrophils may be a reliable assay for measuring serum opsonic activity.

TI  == effect of klebsiella pneumoniae enterotoxin on intestinal transport in the rat.
AB  == the effects on intestinal transport of either a semipurified preparation of enterotoxin elaborated by klebsiella pneumoniae or similaryly prepared control material were tested by marker perfusion studies in the small intestine of rats.  at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, the enterotoxin produced net secretion of water, na, and cl in both jejunal and ileal segments; hco3 transport was not affected. net secretion was evident within 30 min after intorduction of the toxin and was maximal after 90 min. the addition of 56 mm glucose to the enterotoxin-containing perfusion fluid resulted in reversal of water and na transport to net absorption  in both intestinal segments. the enterotoxin also produced a significant depression of xylose absorption in both the jejunum and ileum but did not affect  the absorption of either glucose or l-leucine. intestinal structure was not altered after perfusion of the toxin but insillation of approximately one-quarter of the total perfusion dose into a ligated jejunal loop for 18 h produced fluid secretion and structural abnormalities. these observations confirm the fact that  other species of coliform bacteria in addition to tescherichia coli are capable of elaborating an enterotoxin. such species commonly contaminate the small intestine of persons with tropical sprue and it is suggested that chronic exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the enterotoxin elaborated by these bacteria may be a factor in the pathogenesis of intestinal abnormalities in thid disorder.

TI  == systematic difference in the methylation of ribosomal ribonucleic acid from gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a survey of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms was performed to compare the distributionof n6-methylated adenine. it was found that (i) all the gram-positive strains tested, staphylococcus aureus, sarcina lutea, bacillus stearothermophilus, bacillus subtilis, and bacillus megaterium, contain neither n6-monomethyl adenine (m6a) nor n6-dimethyladenine (m26a) in 23s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rrna). in the case of s. aureus and streptococcus pyogenes, strains which are clinically resistant to erythromycin contain m26a. (ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but  not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed  systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI  == a theoretical approach of disinfectant testing.
AB  == the purpose of this study is to compare six methods of disinfectant testing, currently applied in europe. the testing techniques are analysed into the separate elements, which can influence the activity of the disinfectant. the differences observed in these components allow to explain why in each method other parameters are evaluated and consequently, why the interpretation of the results varies from method to method. the six tests examined are (1) the suspension test of the dghm, (2) the suspension test of the committee on phytopharmacy, (3) the a.o.a.c. use-dilution method, (4) the kelsey sykes test, (5) the surface-disinfection test of the dghm and (6) a modified version of this  latter. first of all the final concentrations of the disinfectant in the medication mixture are calculated. on the kelsey sykes test differs from the others, in using a much lower final dilution, up to 50% in the 3 rd stage. it is  also obvious that the longer the exposure time is, the greater the killing effect on the bacteria in the medication mixture will be. to determine the germicidal activity a method needs to pass the test, the germicidal effect has been assessed starting from the inoculum applied in the medication mixture and, in case of tests that consider the absence of growth in the subcultures as end-point, the minimum extinction required. the lowest number of bacteria is applied in the inoculum of the a.o.a.c. use-dilution method (ca. 10(6)) and the highest in the modified practical surface disinfection test (ca. 10(10)). so the required germicidal effect varies from 5 (in case of the committee on phytopharmacy's test and the modified practical test) to more than 8 (in case of the a.o.a.c. use-dilution method). further on, the protein content of the bacterial suspension which is added to the medication mixture, is experimentically verified. considerable differences are observed here. in some tests the presence of organic matter is negligible (the a.o.a.c. use-dilution method, the kelsey sykes test under clean conditions), whereas in others (the kelsey sykes test under dirty conditions and the practical surface disinfection tests) the protein added equals that of serum 10-30%. finally it is mentioned that the dilutions in the kelsey sykes test are made with artificial hard water. from a comparison of the factors  described above it clearly appears that in the distinct tests different parameters are used and that the results of one test cannot be applied to another.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentration (m.i.c.) values as determined by an agar-plate-dilution method for 60 bacterial isolates, consisting of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus of animal origin against 20 antimicrobial drugs are presented. of all the drugs,  gentamicin had the best in vitro antibacterial activity in terms of m.i.c. when considering all the species of organisms together, while spectinomycin had the least activity.an inoculum replicator was a convenient tool in carrying out the agar-plate-dilution method.a comparison of the m.i.c. values of 42 isolates of s. typhimurium with the results obtained by low level method and the bauer-kir-by method showed that with few exceptions, there is a general agreement.

TI  == drug resistance among pathogenic bacteria from animals in ontario.
AB  == prevalence of antimicrobial drug resistance among over 3000 clinical isolates of  animal pathogens in ontario during 1971-72 has been studied. a high number of multiple resistance patterns is prevalent among members of enterobacteriaceae, especially escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the most common resistance pattern among bovine strains was against not less than six drugs in common use. among different animal species the bovine population was found to be  the source of a high percentage of chloramphenicol resistant e. coli and s. typhimurium organisms. all the isolates resistant to this drug were in addition resistant to three or more other antibiotics of established therapeutic value. all the multiple resistant isolates of s. typhimurium tested had r factors and they transferred most of the resistance determinants including that for chloramphenicol to a recipient e. coli in vitro.penicillin resistance among staphylococcus aureus of bovine mammary origin did not appear to be high. antimicrobial drug susceptibility patterns of staphylococci, streptococci and corynebacterium sp indicate effective in vitro activity with many antimicrobial agents.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == radiometric detection of some food-borne bacteria.
AB  == studies on detection of bacteria by radiometric techniques have been concerned primarily with aerobic species in clinical specimens. the data presented here are related to detection of aerobic and anaerobic species that are of significance in foods, by measurement of (14)co(2) evolved from the metabolism of (14)c-glucose.  salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus were inoculated into tryptic soy broth containing 0.0139 muci of (14)c glucose/ml of medium. detection times ranged from 10 to 3 hr for inocula of 10(0) to 10(4) cells/ml of broth. heat-shocked spores of clostridium sporogenes or c. botulinum were incubated in tryptic soy broth supplemented with thiotone and nahco(3). the medium was rendered anaerobic with n(2). spores were detected when 0.0833 muci of labeled glucose was available/ml of medium but not when 0.0139 muci of glucose was present/ml. the spores required 3 to 4 hr longer for detection than did comparable numbers of aerobic vegetative cells. the results demonstrate the importance of availability of sufficient label in the media and the potential of  the application of this technique for sterility testing of foods.

AB  == factors influencing the antimicrobial properties of obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were studied. both of these compounds were soluble in acetone, alcohol, and olive oil. in water, they were soluble at concentrations of 34 and 53 mug/ml, respectively. the minimal inhibitory concentrations against gram-positive bacteria and yeast were below 100 mug/ml. the compounds were not effective against gram-negative bacteria at 200 mug/ml or lower concentrations. with initial populations of cells greater than 10(6)/ml, the concentrations of these compounds required to prevent growth were greater than with lower cell populations. changing the ph of the growth medium did not decrease the effectiveness of these two compounds in the ph range of 3 through 8. both obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were rapidly bactericidal to staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus at 25 mug/ml.

TI  == the hygiene and marketing of fresh cream as assessed by the methylene blue test.  a report by a working party to the director of the public health laboratory service.
AB  == the hygiene and marketing of fresh cream in england and wales was investigated by a working party of the public health laboratory service (phls) between 1 october  1968 and 31 july 1969. thirty-one cream-producing dairies were visited and observations made in the light of the code of practice published by the milk and  milk products technical advisory committee of the ministry of agriculture, fisheries and food, and the scottish home and health department. suggestions are  made in this report to strengthen the code.a total of 5184 samples of fresh cream comprising 4385 heat-treated, 282 clotted and 517 untreated were examined. details of production, age of the cream, distance and mode of distribution along  the retail chain were available for most samples, and this history was, as far as possible, related to the laboratory findings. in the laboratory the samples were  examined by the methylene blue test, colony count, coliform and escherichia coli  i test and for pathogens. staphylococcus aureus was grown from 59 out of 3417 samples of cream; 54 of these were from untreated cream. phage typing indicated that a proportion of these strains were of animal, presumably bovine, origin. other human pathogens isolated included one each of salmonella typhimurium, brucella abortus, e. coli type o126 and clostridium welchii.it appeared that heat-treated cream was much better, bacteriologically, than untreated; and that large dairies, in general, had better premises, more hygienic methods of preparation and the advantages of mechanical filling and capping of cartons; thus they offered the consumer a better product, bacteriologically, than some of the smaller dairies.a statistical analysis of the results of the tests used showed the methylene blue test, in spite of some anomalies, to be of more use as a screening test than any of the others. as this test is cheap and easy to carry out, the working party thought that it should be the test of choice. in view of the known anomalies, however, the working party recommends that the test should remain a screening or advisory test and have no penal function. results should be reported as follows: cream not decolorizing the dye in 4 hr. at 37 degrees c. (+/- 0.5 degrees ) after overnight incubation at 20 degrees c. (+/- 0.5 degrees ) would be accepted as satisfactory; between (1/2) and 4 hr. at 37 degrees c. (+/-  0.5 degrees ) as fairly satisfactory; but if the dye were decolorized at the end  of the overnight incubation the sample would be provisionally classified as ;unsatisfactory; requires further investigation'. a repeat sample would then be examined. if samples were repeatedly unsatisfactory, consultations would be arranged between the local authority, the laboratory and the dairy, with perhaps  inspection of the dairy premises and retail storage conditions and further, more  searching tests on samples made in an effort to eradicate production faults.

AB  == strongly basic anion-exchange resins form stable, water-insoluble combinations with triiodide ions. the combinations have remarkable antibacterial properties: 3.0 x 10(5)escherichia coli cells per ml were killed when passed through a 3.8-g  column of commercially available resin treated with triiodide (volume 4 ml after  treatment). in an attempt to deplete the resin-triiodide complex, 1.14 x 10(9)e.  coli cells in 15 liters were passed through the column with no significant loss of effectiveness. the antibacterial capabilities of the resin-triiodide columns ranged from 10(6)salmonella typhimurium per ml to 1.1 x 10(4)streptococcus faecalis per ml. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also tested and killed at concentrations of 1.8 x 10(4) and 1.3 x 10(5) per ml, respectively. the cells were not filtered from the water. they emerged from the column in nonviable form. this was demonstrated by using (14)c-labeled bacteria.  the irreversible nature of the antibacterial action was revealed when attempts to wash the damaged cells did not restore viability.

TI  == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB  == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus  faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that  female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s.  aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective  effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

AB  == heat-killed strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or group a streptococci. challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. other bacteria tested included lancefield streptococcal groups b, c, d, e, g, h, l, and o, pneumococcus types ii, iii, xiv and a rough strain, corynebacterium xerosis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus vulgaris, neisseria catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis. none of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. pretreatment of recipients with gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well  as in group a streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.

TI  == the non-medical use of antibiotics and the risk of causing microbial drug-resistance.
AB  == one of the hazards involved in the use of antibiotics in animal feeds is that it  may lead to the development of bacterial drug-resistance. an analysis of the phenomenon shows that this possibility largely depends on the size of the bacterial populations involved and on the possibility of selective multiplication of the resistant mutants that may be present. additional factors involved in the  development of resistance are the type of drug applied and the time during which  the bacteria are in contact with it.animal experiments and general practical experience show that resistance, especially in e. coli, salm. typhimurium and staph. aureus, may considerably increase as higher doses are added to the feed. therefore, the lowest effective level for growth promotion (5-20 p.p.m. of penicillin or tetracycline) is to be preferred over higher levels.as to the practice of food preservation by means of antibiotics, a dangerous situation may  arise if two factors combine: emergence of bacterial resistance in salmonella and perhaps other pathogenic bacteria in the animal as a result of the addition of a  certain antibiotic to feeds, and subsequent use of the same substance for preservation of the meat.
