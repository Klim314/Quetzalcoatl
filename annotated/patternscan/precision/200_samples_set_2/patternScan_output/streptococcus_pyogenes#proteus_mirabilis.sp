TI  == flomoxef showed excellent in vitro activity against clinically important gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens causing community- and hospital-associated infections.
AB  == the objective of this study was to better understand the in vitro activity of flomoxef against clinical pathogens. a total of 545 clinical isolates, including  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant s. aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus pyogenes, were isolated consecutively from clinical specimens from peking union medical college hospital  in 2013. mics were determined using broth microdilution method. esbl and ampc genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. flomoxef showed  excellent activity against e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis isolates, with susceptibility rate of 88.8%, 88.3%, and 97.7%, separately. moreover, flomoxef exhibited great activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers, with mic50/mic90 of 0.125/(0.5-1) mug/ml. flomoxef showed mic50/mic90  of 0.5/0.5 mug/ml against mssa, 0.125/0.25 mug/ml against s. pyogenes, and 2/16 mug/ml against s. pneumoniae. in conclusion, flomoxef is one of the cephamycins showing excellent activity against esbl-producing or esbl-nonproducing e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis and was also potent against mssa, s. pyogenes, and s. pneumoniae.

TI  == synthesis and structure of silver complexes with nicotinate-type ligands having antibacterial activities against clinically isolated antibiotic resistant pathogens.
AB  == the synthesis and low-temperature x-ray crystal structures of five new silver complexes, [ag(2)-mu-o,o'(2-aminonicotinium)(2)(no(3))(2)](n) (7), [ag(isonicotinamide)(2)-mu-o,o'(no(3))](2) (8), [ag(ethyl nicotinate)(2)](no(3))  (9), [ag(ethyl isonicotinate)(2)(no(3))] (10), and [ag(methyl isonicotinate)(2)(h(2)o)](no(3)) (11), are presented and fully characterized by spectral and elemental analysis. the antimicrobial activities of these complexes  were screened using 12 different clinical isolates belonging to four pathogenic bacteria, s. aureus, s. pyogenes, p. mirabilis, and ps. aeruginosa, all obtained  from diabetic foot ulcers. these tested bacteria were resistant for at least 10 antibiotics commonly used for treatment of diabetic foot ulcers. compounds 7 and  8 had considerable activity against ps. aeruginosa (mic values 2-8 microg/ml), compound 9 against s. aureus (mic 4-16 microg/ml) and s. pyogenes (mic 2-4 microg/ml), and also 9 and 11 against p. mirabilis (mic 1-16 microg/ml). all complexes were non-toxic for daphnia at concentrations above 512 microg/ml overnight.

TI  == proteinases of common pathogenic bacteria degrade and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37.
AB  == effectors of the innate immune system, the anti-bacterial peptides, have pivotal  roles in preventing infection at epithelial surfaces. here we show that proteinases of the significant human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis and streptococcus pyogenes, degrade the  antibacterial peptide ll-37. analysis by mass spectrometry of fragments generated by p. aeruginosa elastase in vitro revealed that the initial cleavages occurred at asn-leu and asp-phe, followed by two breaks at arg-ile, thus inactivating the  peptide. proteinases of the other pathogens also degraded ll-37 as determined by  sds-page. ex vivo, p. aeruginosa elastase induced ll-37 degradation in human wound fluid, leading to enhanced bacterial survival. the degradation was blocked  by the metalloproteinase inhibitors gm6001 and 1, 10-phenantroline (both of which inhibited p. aeruginosa elastase, p. mirabilis proteinase, and e. faecalis gelatinase), or the inhibitor e64 (which inhibited s. pyogenes cysteine proteinase). additional experiments demonstrated that dermatan sulphate and disaccharides of the structure [deltaua(2s)-galnac(4,6s)], or sucroseoctasulphate, inhibited the degradation of ll-37. the results indicate that proteolytic degradation of ll-37 is a common virulence mechanism and that molecules which block this degradation could have therapeutic potential.

TI  == [reactivity to bacterial peptidoglycans in a phagocytosis system. the range of immunological specificity of escherichia coli peptidoglycan].
AB  == the antigenic specificity of e. coli m17 peptidoglycans (pg) was studied in the test system based on the stimulation of neutrophils with pg opsonized with the whole and exhausted igg fraction of human serum. within the generic taxon, the pg under study were similar in their antigenic properties. the opsonic activity of igg exhausted with the preparations of different e. coli strains decreased by 93.2-95.8%. an essential difference of e. coli pg from similar components of other representatives of the family enterobacteriaceae was observed: in experiments with serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, proteus rettgeri the decrease of opsonic activity was 47.6-79.3%. after the removal of antibodies to pg of remote taxons (staphylococcus aureus, micrococcus  luteus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, branchamella catarrhalis) the decrease of the opsonic effect was less noticeable  (9.7-33.8%). the results are discussed from the viewpoint of the immunological peculiarity of pg at different taxonomic levels.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity and human pharmacology of cephaloglycin.
AB  == serum and urine concentrations of cephaloglycin (an orally absorbed derivative of cephalosporin c) were determined in normal volunteers and in patients. the in vitro activity of cephaloglycin was also studied. all strains of group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes) and diplococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.4 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. eighty per cent of the staphylococcus aureus  strains and about 50% of the escherichia coli and proteus mirabilis strains were  inhibited by 1.6 mug of cephaloglycin per ml. klebsiella-aerobacter species were  more resistant to cephaloglycin and 12.5 mug per ml was required to inhibit 70% of these strains. when single doses of 250, 500, or 1,000 mg of cephaloglycin were administered to fasting volunteers, a peak serum concentration of at least 0.5 mug per ml was achieved. a full breakfast did not interfere with absorption of cephaloglycin. probenecid enhanced both the peak serum concentration and the duration of antibiotic activity in the serum. serum concentrations of cephaloglycin were even higher in patients who were receiving repeated doses. the peak serum concentrations of cephaloglycin in all volunteers and patients were adequate to inhibit all strains of group a streptococci and d. pneumoniae. many of the peak serum concentrations were adequate to inhibit some strains of s. aureus, e. coli, and p. mirabilis. urine levels of cephaloglycin were high enough in all volunteers and patients to inhibit more than 90% of the e. coli and p. mirabilis strains and over 70% of the strains of klebsiella-aerobacter.
