TI  == incidence of bacteriocins produced by food-related lactic acid bacteria active towards oral pathogens.
AB  == in the present study we investigated the incidence of bacteriocins produced by 236 lactic acid bacteria (lab) food isolates against pathogenic or opportunistic  pathogenic oral bacteria. this set of lab contained several strains (>/=17%) producing bacteriocins active against food-related bacteria. interestingly only streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 was able to inhibit the growth of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus gordonii, while lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179 and lactobacillus plantarun aca-dc 269 produced bacteriocins solely against streptococcus oralis. thus, the percentage of strains that were found to produce bacteriocins against oral bacteria was ~1.3%. the rarity of bacteriocins active against oral lab pathogens produced by food-related lab was unexpected given their close phylogenetic relationship. nevertheless, when tested in inhibition assays, the potency of the bacteriocin(s) of s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 against the three oral streptococci was high. fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy combined with principal component analysis revealed that exposure of the target cells to the antimicrobial compounds caused major alterations of key cellular constituents. our findings indicate that bacteriocins produced by food-related lab against oral lab may be rare, but deserve further investigation since, when discovered, they can be effective antimicrobials.

TI  == shifts in the microbial population in relation to in situ caries progression.
AB  == the shift in microbial diversity from young to mature plaque, related to caries activity on sound and restored surfaces, was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. during a 20-week in situ study on caries progression 8 subjects wearing restored and unrestored dentin and enamel sections, biofilm was  sampled after 1 and 20 weeks (young or mature plaque). a higher microbial diversity (mature plaque) was seen in caries-active compared to caries-free subjects. rothia dentocariosa and scardovia inopinata were absent from all caries-free sites, but appeared in 50% of the caries-active sites.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179 displays probiotic potential in vitro and protects against trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced colitis and salmonella infection in murine models.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179, lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 287 and streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 were studied for their probiotic potential.  firstly, strains were screened for antimicrobial activity towards a broad range of target strains, including lactic acid bacteria, food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. l. fermentum aca-dc 179 was active against five streptococci, including the two pathogenic strains streptococcus oralis lmg 14532t and streptococcus pneumoniae lmg 14545t. s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 was active against the majority  of the strains tested, including not only lactic acid bacteria but also many food spoilage or pathogenic species. the three potential probiotic strains were found  to survive variably at ph 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts. only s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while none of the  strains was haemolytic. moreover, strains exhibited variable susceptibility towards commonly used antibiotics. l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-12, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. also elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory il-10 were observed with l. fermentum aca-dc 179. this strain consequently was found to significantly reduce colitis in a tnbs-induced colitis mouse model. furthermore, l. fermentum aca-dc 179 was successfully applied in an experimental salmonella-infection mouse model. to conclude, strain l. fermentum aca-dc 179 possesses desirable probiotic properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.
