TI  == cloning, sequencing and expression of a gene encoding a 73 kda xylanase enzyme from the rumen anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c.
AB  == the cloning, expression and nucleotide sequence of a 3 kb dna segment on pls206 containing a xylanase gene (xynb) from butyrivibrio fibrisolvens h17c was investigated. the open reading frame (orf) of 1905 bp encoded a xylanase of 635 amino acid residues (mr 73156). at least 850 bp at the 3' end of the gene could be deleted without loss of xylanase activity. the deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by purifying the enzyme and subjecting it to n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. in escherichia coli c600 (pls206) cells the xylanase was localized in the cytoplasm. its optimum ph for activity was between ph 5.4 and 6, and optimum temperature 55 degrees c. the primary structure of the xylanase showed a significant level of identity with a cellobiohydrolase/endoglucanase of  caldocellum saccharolyticum, as well as with the xylanases of the alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain c-125, b. fibrisolvens strain 49, and pseudomonas fluorescens subsp. cellulosa.

TI  == cloning, sequencing, and expression of a xylanase gene from the anaerobic ruminal bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens.
AB  == a gene coding for xylanase activity, xyna, from the anaerobic ruminal bacterium butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49 was cloned into escherichia coli jm83 by using plasmid puc19. the gene was located on a 2.3-kilobase (kb) dna insert composed of two adjacent ecori fragments of 1.65 and 0.65 kb. expression of xylanase activity required parts of both ecori segments. in e. coli, the cloned xylanase enzyme was not secreted and remained cell associated. the enzyme exhibited no arabinosidase, cellulase, alpha-glucosidase, or xylosidase activity. the isoelectric point of the cloned protein was approximately 9.8, and optimal xylanase activity was obtained at ph 5.4. the nucleotide sequence of the 1,535-base-pair ecorv-ecori segment from the b. fibrisolvens chromosome that included the xyna gene was determined. an open reading frame was found that encoded a 411-amino-acid-residue polypeptide of 46,664 daltons. a putative ribosome-binding site, promoter, and leader sequence were identified. comparison of the xyna protein sequence with that of the xyna protein from alkalophilic bacillus sp. strain c-125 revealed considerable homology, with 37% identical residues or conservative changes. the presence of the cloned xylanase gene in other strains of butyrivibrio was examined by southern hybridization. the cloned xylanase gene hybridized strongly  to chromosomal sequences in only two of five closely related strains.
