TI  - Influence of a probiotic Lactobacillus casei strain on the colonisation with potential pathogenic streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus in the nasopharyngeal space of healthy men with a low baseline NK cell activity.
AB  - The effect of a daily intake of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei Shirota  (LcS) on the colonisation of pathogens, specifically streptococci and Staphylococcus aureus, in the nose and throat of healthy human volunteers with low natural killer cell activity, was investigated in a randomised and controlled intervention study. The study consisted of a 2-week run-in phase, followed by a 4-week intervention phase. The probiotic treatment group received a fermented milk drink with LcS, while the placebo group received an equally composed milk drink without the probiotic additive. To isolate potential pathogenic streptococci and Staph. aureus, samples from the pharynx, as well as of both middle nasal meati, were taken, once after the run-in phase and once at the end of the intervention phase. Isolated bacteria were identified as either Staph. aureus and alpha- or beta-haemolytic streptococci in a polyphasic taxonomical approach based on phenotypic tests, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis genotyping, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of representative strains. Salivary secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) was used as marker of protective mucosal immunity to evaluate whether LcS treatment influenced SIgA production. No statistically significant effect could be determined for intervention with LcS on the incidence of Staph. aureus in the nasal space, Staph. aureus in the pharyngeal space or for beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae in the pharyngeal space. Thus, the intervention did not influence the nasopharyngeal colonisation with Gram-positive potential pathogens. Production of salivary SIgA as a potential means of microbiota modulation was also not affected.
TI  - Safety of a nasal vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae using heat-killed Lactobacillus casei as adjuvant.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae is a highly important respiratory pathogen that causes infections in children, elderly people and immunocompromised people around the world. Pneumococcal vaccines licensed did not reach to eradicate the pneumococcal infection. In a previous study was demonstrated the effectiveness of a nasal experimental vaccine that consisted in a pneumococcal protective protein A (PppA) co-administrated with heat-killed-Lactobacillus casei (LcM), in mice model of respiratory pneumococcal challenge. In the present work the safety of the experimental vaccine LcM+PppA and its components were evaluated through hematological, biochemical and immune parameters in a model infection with S. pneumoniae. Thus, alanine transaminase activity, creatinine levels, lactate dehydrogenase activity, C reactive protein levels, corticosterone levels in serum, total and differential leukocyte counts in blood and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and IgE in BAL, were evaluated. Experimental vaccine: LcM+PppA nasally administered does not induce harmful effects in our vaccination-infection model. Studied parameters showed LcM+PppA's safety in liver, kidney, pulmonary and systemic levels. Although studies in experimental animals do not guarantee security for the application of the vaccine on humans, they are important evidence for the planning and subsequent clinical trials in humans.
TI  - Modulation of the immuno-coagulative response in a pneumococcal infection in malnourished mice nasally treated with Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - We studied the systemic effects of the intranasal administration of Lactobacillus casei on the immuno-coagulative response in pneumoccocal infection in immunocompromised mice. Weaned mice consumed a protein-free diet (PFD) for 21 days and were therefore malnourished. Malnourished mice were fed a balanced conventional diet (BCD) for 7 days (BCD group) or a BCD for 7 days with nasal administration of viable L. casei on days 6 and 7 (BCD+LcN group). The malnourished control mice (MNC) received a PFD, whereas the well-nourished control mice (WNC) continually consumed a BCD. At the end of the treatment period, the mice were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. At different times after infection, we analysed the following parameters: global coagulation system, activation of coagulation, coagulation inhibitors, platelet count, leukocyte count and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, total proteins, albumin and acute phase proteins (APPs). The MNC group showed greater impairment in the coagulation tests and an increase in the positive APPs. These parameters were normalized by the L. casei treatment. However, the number of leukocytes, decreased by malnutrition, was improved only by the administration of L. casei. After infection, the BCD+LcN group showed similar results to those of the WNC group for most of the haemostatic parameters. The BCD+LcN group did not show significant variations in the prothrombin time or in the level of anticoagulant protein C, but showed higher levels of fibrinogen, platelets, albumin, leukocytes and MPO activity compared with the different experimental groups. The intranasal administration of L. casei was effective in modulating the pro-inflammatory aspects of coagulation without affecting coagulation itself.
TI  - Inflammation-hemostasis relationship in infected malnourished mice: modulatory effect of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431.
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The coagulation system is considered part of the defense machinery, but its excessive activation can lead to additional damage. We studied the effects of oral administration of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431--a probiotic bacterium--on the activation of coagulation and the relationship with inflammatory parameters during a respiratory infection in malnourished mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Malnourished Swiss albino mice were nourished with a balanced commercial diet (BCD) for 7 days or BCD with L. casei for the last 2 days (BCD + Lc). BCD, BCD + Lc, malnourished (MNC) and well-nourished controls (WNC) were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Blood and bronchoalveolar lavage samples were obtained at different times post-infection. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition altered most of the evaluated parameters before and after infection. The repletion diet with supplemental L. casei was the most effective in limiting coagulation activation and normalizing coagulation inhibition mechanisms. These findings will help develop further strategies to reduce the damaging effects of clotting and enhance its beneficial contribution to immune reactions.
TI  - Host immunity in the protective response to nasal immunization with a pneumococcal antigen associated to live and heat-killed Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, available pneumococcal vaccines have failed to eradicate  infections caused by S. pneumoniae. Search for effective vaccine continues and some serotype independent pneumococcal proteins are considered as candidates for the design of new vaccines, especially a mucosal vaccine, since pneumococci enter the body through mucosal surfaces. Selection of the appropriate adjuvant is important for mucosal vaccines, and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with immunostimulant properties are promissory candidates. In this work, we assessed the adjuvant effect of a probiotic strain, Lactobacillus casei (L. casei), when nasally administered with a pneumococcal antigen (pneumococcal protective protein A: PppA) for the prevention of pneumococcal infection. Adjuvanticity of both live (LcV) and heat-killed (LcM) was evaluated and humoral and cellular antigen-specific immune response was assessed in mucosal and systemic compartments. The potential mechanisms induced by nasal immunization were discussed. RESULTS: Nasal immunization of young mice with PppA+LcV and PppA+LcM induced anti-PppA IgA and IgG antibodies in mucosal and systemic compartments and levels of these specific antibodies remained high even at day 45 after the 3rd Immunization (3rd I). These results were correlated with IL-4 induction by the mixture of antigen plus LcV and LcM. Also, PppA+Lc (V and M) induced stimulation of Th1 and Th17 cells involved in the defence against pneumococci. The protection against pneumococcal respiratory challenge at day 30 after the 3rd I showed that PppA+LcV and PppA+LcM immunizations significantly reduced pathogen counts in nasal lavages while prventing their passage into lung and blood. Survival of mice immunized with the co-application of PppA plus LcV and LcM was significantly higher than in mice immunized with PppA alone and control mice when intraperitoneal challenge was performed. No significant differences between the treatments involving LcV and LcM were found. CONCLUSIONS: Live and heat-killed L. casei enhanced the antigen-specific immune response when administered nasally with a pneumococcal antigen. Considering the potential risk associated with live bacteria, the design of a nasal vaccine based on pneumococcal antigens and heat-killed L. casei emerges as a safe and effective strategy for the prevention of pneumococcal infections and opens new possibilities of application of dead LAB as adjuvants in vaccine formulations against other pathogens.
TI  - Nasal immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing the pneumococcal surface protein C primes the immune system and decreases pneumococcal nasopharyngeal colonization in mice.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae colonizes the upper respiratory tract of healthy individuals, from where it can be transmitted to the community. Occasionally, bacteria invade sterile niches, causing diseases. The pneumococcal surface protein C (PspC) is a virulence factor that is important during colonization and the systemic phases of the diseases. Here, we have evaluated the effect of nasal or sublingual immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing PspC, as well as prime-boosting protocols using recombinant PspC, on nasopharyngeal pneumococcal colonization. None of the protocols tested was able to elicit significant levels of anti-PspC antibodies before challenge. However, a significant decrease in pneumococcal recovery from the nasopharynx was observed in animals immunized through the nasal route with L. casei-PspC. Immune responses evaluated after colonization challenge in this group of mice were characterized by an increase in mucosal anti-PspC immunoglobulin A (IgA) 5 days later, a time point in which the pneumococcal loads were already low. A negative correlation between the concentrations of anti-PspC IgA and pneumococcal recovery from the nasopharynx was observed, with animals with the lowest colonization levels having higher IgA concentrations. These results show that nasal immunization with L. casei-PspC primes the immune system of mice, prompting faster immune responses that result in a decrease in pneumococcal colonization.
TI  - Enhanced immune response to pneumococcal infection in malnourished mice nasally treated with heat-killed Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - The present study analyzed whether nasal administration of viable and non-viable  Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 to immunocompromised mice was capable of increasing resistance against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Weaned mice were malnourished after consuming a PFD for 21 days. Malnourished mice were fed a BCD for 7 days or BCD for 7 days with viable or non-viable L. casei nasal treatments on day 6 and day 7 (BCD+LcV and BCD+LcN, respectively). The MNC group received PFD whereas the WNC mice consumed BCD. MNC mice showed greater lung colonization, more severe lung injuries, impaired leukocyte recruitment and reduced antibodies and cytokine production when compared with WNC mice. Administration of L. casei increased the resistance of malnourished mice to the infection. Both BCD+LcV and BCD+LcN treatments prevented the dissemination of the pathogen to the blood and induced its lung clearance. BCD+LcV or BCD+LcN groups showed improved production of TNF-alpha and activity of phagocytes in the respiratory tract, an effect that was not observed in the BCD control group. In addition, IL-4 and IL-10 were significantly increased in BCD+LcV and BCD+LcN groups, which correlated with the increase in the levels of specific respiratory IgA. The nasal treatments with L. casei were also effective at stimulating the production of specific IgG at both the systemic and the respiratory levels. The comparative study between the viable and the non-viable bacteria demonstrated that viability would be an important factor to achieve maximum protective effects. However, the results from this study suggest that heat-killed lactic acid bacteria are also effective in the immunomodulation of the systemic and respiratory immune system.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei modulates the inflammation-coagulation interaction in a pneumococcal pneumonia experimental model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We have previously demonstrated that Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 administration improved the resistance to pneumococcal infection in a mouse model. METHODS: This study examined the effects of the oral administration of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 (L. casei) on the activation of coagulation and fibrinolytic systems as well as their inhibitors during a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice. RESULTS: The alveolo-capillary membrane was damaged and the coagulation system was also activated by the infection. As a consequence, we could see fibrin(ogen) deposits in lung histological slices, increased levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TATc) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma, decrease in prothrombin activity (PT) and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time test (APTT) values. Factor VII (FVII) and factor X (FX) were decreased in plasma, whereas fibrinogen (F) and factor VIII (FVIII) were increased. The low levels of protein C (PC) in BAL and plasma proved damage on inhibitory activity. The infected animals showed reduced fibrinolytic activity, evidenced by an increase in plasminogen activation inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in BAL and plasma. The pathogen induced an increase of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6 in BAL and serum a few hours after challenge followed by a significant decrease until the end of the assayed period. IL-4 and IL-10 in BAL and serum were also augmented, especially at the end of the experiment. The animals treated with L. casei showed an improvement of alveolo-capillary membrane, lower fibrin(ogen) deposits in lung and decrease in TATc. APTT test and PT, FVII and FX activity were normalized. L. casei group showed lower F levels than control during whole experiment. In the present study no effect of L. casei on the recovery of the inhibitory activity was detected. However, L. casei was effective in reducing PAI-1 levels in BAL and in increasing anti-inflammatory ILs concentration. CONCLUSION: L. casei proved effective to regulate coagulation activation and fibrinolysis inhibition during infection, leading to a decrease in fibrin deposits in lung. This protective effect of L. casei would be mediated by the induction of higher levels of IL-4 and IL-10 which could regulate the anti-inflammatory, procoagulant and antifibrinolytic effects of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6.
TI  - Characterization of protective mucosal and systemic immune responses elicited by  pneumococcal surface protein PspA and PspC nasal vaccines against a respiratory pneumococcal challenge in mice.
AB  - Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) and PspC are virulence factors that are involved in the adhesion of Streptococcus pneumoniae to epithelial cells and/or evasion from the immune system. Here, the immune responses induced by mucosal vaccines composed of both antigens as recombinant proteins or delivered by Lactobacillus casei were evaluated. None of the PspC vaccines protected mice against an invasive challenge with pneumococcal strain ATCC 6303. On the other hand, protection was observed for immunization with vaccines composed of PspA from clade 5 (PspA5 or L. casei expressing PspA5) through the intranasal route. The protective response was distinguished by a Th1 profile with high levels of immunoglobulin G2a production, efficient complement deposition, release of proinflammatory cytokines, and infiltration of neutrophils. Intranasal immunization with PspA5 elicited the highest level of protection, characterized by increased levels of secretion of interleukin-17 and gamma interferon by lung and spleen cells, respectively, and low levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha in the respiratory tract.
TI  - Nasal immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing the Pneumococcal Surface Protein A: induction of antibodies, complement deposition and partial protection against Streptococcus pneumoniae challenge.
AB  - Strategies for the development of new vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae infections try to overcome problems such as serotype coverage and high costs, present in currently available vaccines. Formulations based on protein candidates that can induce protection in animal models have been pointed as good alternatives. Among them, the Pneumococcal Surface Protein A (PspA) plays an important role during systemic infection at least in part through the inhibition of complement deposition on the pneumococcal surface, a mechanism of evasion from the immune system. Antigen delivery systems based on live recombinant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) represents a promising strategy for mucosal vaccination, since they are generally regarded as safe bacteria able to elicit both systemic and mucosal immune responses. In this work, the N-terminal region of clade 1 PspA was constitutively expressed in Lactobacillus casei and the recombinant bacteria was tested as a mucosal vaccine in mice. Nasal immunization with L. casei-PspA 1 induced anti-PspA antibodies that were able to bind to pneumococcal strains carrying both clade 1 and clade 2 PspAs and to induce complement deposition on the surface of the bacteria. In addition, an increase in survival of immunized mice after a systemic challenge with a virulent pneumococcal strain was observed.
TI  - Purpura fulminans associated with Lactobacillus paracasei liver abscess.
AB  - Purpura fulminans is a rare but devastating haemorrhagic condition often associated with sepsis. Many different organisms have been implicated in the aetiology of purpura fulminans, most commonly Neisseria meningitidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. We report a case of purpura fulminans associated with Lactobacillus paracasei liver abscess. Purpura fulminans has not previously been associated with this organism and specific bacteriological testing was used to exclude the presence of other species.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei administration reduces lung injuries in a Streptococcus pneumoniae infection in mice.
AB  - The effect of the oral administration of Lactobacillus casei on the prevention of a Streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection in a mouse experimental model was studied, analyzing the innate and specific immune response. Adult Swiss albino mice were treated with L. casei (10(9)CFU/day) for 2, 5 and 7 d. Mice were infected intranasally with S. pneumoniae (10(6)CFU/mouse) after each treatment and the microbiological, histopathological and host responses were determined for 15 d after infection. Feeding L. casei for 2 d induced a faster clearance of S. pneumoniae, with a lower number of pneumococci in lung and a shorter period of septicemia than in the control group. L. casei administration induced activation of phagocytes as evidenced by the strong myeloperoxidase activity and the nitro blue tetrazolium assay in lung. Mice given L. casei for 2 d showed higher levels of anti-pneumococcal serum IgG and bronchoalveolar lavage IgA than the control mice. The group fed L. casei for 2 d could beneficially regulate the balance between tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 10, allowing a more effective immune response against infection and modulating the inflammatory response, with less damage to the lung.
TI  - Induction of systemic and mucosal immune response and decrease in Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization by nasal inoculation of mice with recombinant lactic acid bacteria expressing pneumococcal surface antigen A.
AB  - Mucosal epithelia constitute the first barriers to be overcome by pathogens during infection. The induction of protective IgA in this location is important for the prevention of infection and can be achieved through different mucosal immunization strategies. Lactic acid bacteria have been tested in the last few years as live vectors for the delivery of antigens at mucosal sites, with promising results. In this work, Streptococcus pneumoniae PsaA antigen was expressed in different species of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus helveticus. After nasal inoculation of C57Bl/6 mice, their ability to induce both systemic (IgG in serum) and mucosal (IgA in saliva, nasal and bronchial washes) anti-PsaA antibodies was determined. Immunization with L. lactis MG1363 induced very low levels of IgA and IgG, possibly by the low amount of PsaA expressed in this strain and its short persistence in the nasal mucosa. All three lactobacilli persisted in the nasal mucosa for 3 days and produced a similar amount of PsaA protein (150-250 ng per 10(9) CFU). However, L. plantarum NCDO1193 and L. helveticus ATCC15009 elicited the highest antibody response (IgA and IgG). Vaccination with recombinant lactobacilli but not with recombinant L. lactis led to a decrease in S. pneumoniae recovery from nasal mucosa upon a colonization challenge. Our results confirm that certain Lactobacillus strains have intrinsic properties that make them suitable candidates for mucosal vaccination experiments.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei improves resistance to pneumococcal respiratory infection in  malnourished mice.
AB  - We studied the effect of Lactobacillus casei CRL 431 used as a supplement in a repletion diet on the resistance to Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infection in malnourished mice. Weaned mice were malnourished after they consumed a protein-free diet (PFD) for 21 d. Malnourished mice were fed a balanced conventional diet (BCD) with or without supplemental L. casei for 7, 14, or 21 consecutive days, or BCD for 7 d with L. casei supplementation on d 6 and 7 (7dBCD+2dLc). The malnourished control (MNC) group was fed only the PFD, whereas well-nourished control (WNC) mice consumed the BCD ad libitum. Mice were challenged with S. pneumoniae at the end of each dietary treatment. Lung colonization and bacteremia were significantly greater in MNC than in WNC. Normalization of the immune response occurred in malnourished mice fed the BCD for 21 d. L. casei supplementation reduced the time required for a normal response from 21 to 7 d. Mice administered the 7dBCD+2dLc repletion treatment had a more effective pathogen clearance from blood and significantly lower lung damage than MNC. This treatment improved both the number of leukocytes and neutrophils in blood and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) and the bactericidal function of phagocytic cells to levels that did not differ from those of WNC. In the 7dBCD+2dLc mice, antipneumococcal IgA in BAL was higher than in WNC, whereas antipneumococcal IgG in serum and BAL did not differ. This study suggests that the addition of L. casei to the repletion diet has a beneficial effect because it accelerates the recovery of the innate immune response and improves the specific immune mechanisms against an S. pneumoniae respiratory infection in malnourished mice.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Expression of Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens, PsaA (pneumococcal surface antigen A) and PspA (pneumococcal surface protein A) by Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - A number of recent research works in lactic acid bacteria aim towards the design  of new strains that could be used as live vectors for the delivery of antigens for oral vaccination, or other therapeutic molecules. In this work, an inducible expression system based on the Lactobacillus casei lactose operon promoter was used to express three important surface antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae in this lactic acid bacterium: a virulence-related pneumococcal surface antigen (PsaA) and two variants of the virulence factor PspA (pneumococcal surface protein A). Expression of the three proteins was induced upon growth on lactose and strongly repressed by glucose. These proteins were produced intracellularly. Also, secretion to the growth medium was achieved by means of a fusion to the secreting and processing signals from the L. casei surface proteinase. Interestingly, while secreted PspA proteins were found in the culture supernatants, PsaA remained trapped in the cell wall. Expression of pneumococcal antigens in a food-grade organism opens an alternative for mucosal vaccination against this important pathogen.
TI  - Growth inhibition of oral bacteria related to denture stomatitis by anti-candidal chalcones.
AB  - In the antimicrobial therapy of denture stomatitis, it is desirable to inhibit the growth of not only the primary causative organism, Candida albicans, but also other oral bacteria closely associated with the condition. Three synthetic anti-candidal chalcones were characterized and compared for their additional activity in inhibiting these causative bacteria. Among the tested chalcones, 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone showed the highest activity for different Gram-positive bacteria. It inhibited the growth of streptococci, staphylococci and lactobacilli at 25.0-50.0 micrograms/mL which was lower than or comparable to its minimum inhibitory concentration for candida. It functioned with a bactericidal action and leaked 260 nm-absorbing substances from the streptococcal cells. The antimicrobial activity of 2,4,2'-trihydroxy-5'-methylchalcone against both primary and secondary causative agents suggests it could be useful as a potent therapeutic agent in denture stomatitis.
TI  - Plasmid integration in a wide range of bacteria mediated by the integrase of Lactobacillus delbrueckii bacteriophage mv4.
AB  - Bacteriophage mv4 is a temperate phage infecting Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. During lysogenization, the phage integrates its genome into the host chromosome at the 3' end of a tRNA(Ser) gene through a site-specific recombination process (L. Dupont et al., J. Bacteriol., 177:586-595, 1995). A nonreplicative vector (pMC1) based on the mv4 integrative elements (attP site and integrase-coding int gene) is able to integrate into the chromosome of a wide range of bacterial hosts, including Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus casei (two strains), Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Integrative recombination of pMC1 into the chromosomes of all of these species is dependent on the int gene product and occurs specifically at the pMC1 attP site. The isolation and sequencing of pMC1 integration sites from these bacteria showed that in lactobacilli, pMC1 integrated into the conserved tRNA(Ser) gene. In the other bacterial species where this tRNA gene is less or not conserved; secondary integration sites either in potential protein-coding regions or in intergenic DNA were used. A consensus sequence was deduced from the analysis of the different integration sites. The comparison of these sequences demonstrated the flexibility of the integrase for the bacterial integration site and suggested the importance of the trinucleotide CCT at the 5' end of the core in the strand exchange reaction.
TI  - Association of bacteria with the fungal fermentation of soybean tempe.
AB  - Bacteria grew to viable populations of 10(8)-10(9) cfu/g during the fermentation  of soybeans into tempe with the fungus, Rhizopus oligosporus. Bacillus pumilus and B. brevis were the predominant bacterial species, reaching populations of approximately 10(8) cfu/g during the 48 h fermentation. Species of Streptococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae also contributed to the fermentation and achieved populations of 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g.
TI  - The microbial ecology of soybean soaking for tempe production.
AB  - Soybeans soaked in tap water for 24 to 36 h at 20, 30 or 37 degrees C underwent a natural fermentation that was characterized by the growth of microorganisms to 10(8)-10(10) cfu/ml (depending on temperature) and a reduction of pH from 6.5 to 4.5. Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus dysgalactiae dominated the fermentation but, significant contributions were also made by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella ozaenae, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Citrobacter diversus and Bacillus brevis, and the yeasts Pichia burtonii, Candida didensiae and Rhodotorula rubra. Fermentation of surface-decontaminated beans in sterile water with pure cultures of these isolates showed L. casei, Strep. faecium and Staph. epidermidis to be the main species responsible for the pH reduction. Soybeans were the main source of microorganisms for the fermentation. Boiled beans did not undergo an acid fermentation.
TI  - Multiplicity of macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotic resistance determinants.
AB  - Bacteria can resist macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics enzymically by alteration of the target site or detoxification of the antibiotic. N6-dimethylation of adenine in 23 S ribosomal RNA confers resistance to M, L, and S B-type (MLSB) antibiotics. Investigation, by DNA annealing, of the relationship between the genes specifying this resistance mechanism from Streptococcus (groups A,B,D, and H, and pneumoniae), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacteroides fragilis, Lactobacillus casei, and Streptomyces erythreus indicated substantial sequence diversity among the MLSB resistance (R) determinants. A minimum of four distinct classes of MLSB R determinants could be defined: classes A and B for the Gram-positive cocci (streptococci pmeumococci and staphylococci), class C for B. licheniformis, and class D for Bact. fragilis. These data do not support the hypothesis that the R determinants were acquired recently from a single common origin and suggest an easy exchange of genetic information among the Gram-positive cocci. The genetic classes do not correlate with differences in phenotypic expression or in regulation (inducibility or constitutivity) of resistance towards MLSB antibiotics. Inactivation of the drug confers resistance to M and/or L and/or S or SA or SB antibiotics and has been detected in strains of Streptococcus, Staph. aureus, Lactobacillus, C. perfringens, Streptomyces, and recently in the Gram-negative organism Escherichia coli. We have cloned and sequenced a DNA fragment conferring high level resistance (MIC greater than 2 g/l) to erythromycin by hydrolysis of the antibiotic. The distribution of this 'new' character in enterobacteria isolated from human faeces was studied by colony hybridization using an intragenic probe. The gene for the erythromycin esterase was detected in numerous strains of E. coli belonging to various biotypes, in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter agglomerans, and in one 'coliform'. Moreover, our results indicated the existence of at least two classes of genes specifying resistance to erythromycin by inactivation of the antibiotic in enterobacteria.
TI  - Purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from Streptococcus mutans.
AB  - An inhibition factor from Streptococcus mutans strain C3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. Bacteriocin C3603 is a basic protein with a pI value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. The activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by pH over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees C for 10 min at pH 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees C for 15 min at pH 4.0. Pronase; papain, phospholipase C, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. Bacteriocin activity was greater against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and f than against certain S. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. Bacteriocin C3603 was also effective against selected strains of S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. bovis, S. faecium, S. lactis, Lactobacillus casei, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Propionibacterium acnes, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Corynebacterium parvum, and Candida albicans. The inhibition of S. mutans strains BHT and PS-14 by bacteriocin C3603 was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. When water or a diet containing bacteriocin C3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with S. mutans PS-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of some cyclic hydroxamic acids and related lactams.
AB  - Against Enterobacter aerogenes 13048, Serratia marcescens 13880, Klebsiella pneumoniae 10031, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, Escherichia coli 9723, Lactobacillus casei 7469, Lactobacillus plantarum 8014, Leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and Streptococcus faecalis 8043, the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of three cyclic hydroxamic acids, 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 0.6, 0.6, and 0.2 micrograms/ml, and those of the corresponding lactams, 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 60, 60, and 6 micrograms/ml, respectively. Under the same assay conditions the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin were both 2 micrograms/ml. In addition, the cyclic hydroxamic acids but not the lactams inhibited the growth of Candida albicans at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 micrograms/ml, at pH 7, as compared with that of amphotericin B, at 2 micrograms/ml.

TI  - Urease activity in the rumen of sheep and the isolation of ureolytic bacteria.
AB  - Urease activity in the sheep rumen varied with the diet of the sheep, but appeared to be largely or entirely present in the small bacterial fraction. Screening of over 1000 strains of rumen bacteria isolated on different media showed that urease activity was apparently confined to species of Staphylococcus, Lactobacillus casei var. casei and Klebsiella aerogenes. Consideration of the numbers in which these occurred and their activities suggested that the bacteria could not be responsible for the total rumen urease activity. By enrichment culture a ureolytic strain of Streptococcus faecium was isolated. This had a higher urease activity than the other bacteria and occurred in higher numbers in the rumen. It could live with other bacteria in the rumen of a gnotobiotic lamb in numbers, and with a urease activity, comparable with those in the normal sheep rumen. The other properties of the bacterium also suggested that it would grow and produce urease in the rumen, but was unlikely to retain its urease activity after isolation. It was concluded that this bacterium was the main source of rumen urease in roughage-fed, and probably other, sheep.
