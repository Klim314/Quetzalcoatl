TI  == [influence of bifidobacteria on antilysozyme activity of microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms].
AB  == aim: to assess influence of bifidobacteria's exometabolites on expression of antilysozyme activity of microflora and its ability to biofilm formation. materials and methods: six strains of bifidobacteria belonging to b. longum, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis as well as 42 strains of opportunistic microorganisms belonging to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, candida albicans, and rhodotorula rubra isolated  by conventional methods during assessment of intestinal microbiocenosis in humans. in order to study the influence of bifidoflora's exometabolites on associative flora, obtained filtrates were mixed with nutrient broth in 1:10 ratio with subsequent introduction of pure culture of opportunistic microorganism. nutritional broth was used instead of filtrates of bifidobacteria  for obtaining the control samples. formation of biofilms was determined on the ability of strains of microorganisms to adhere on the surface of 96-well polystyrene plate, whereas the antilysozyme activity was studied by photometric method. results: performed studies revealed multidirectional but mostly inhibiting effect of bifidobacteria's metabolites on antilysozyme activity of opportunistic microorganisms and their ability to form biofilms. changes of these characteristics was observed both in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria as  well as in yeast fungi and depended from species of bifidobacteria and associative opportunistic microflora. conclusion: obtained data open perspective  for search of control on infectious process on the basis of modification of persistence characteristics of associative pathogens and their ability to form biofilms in host's biotope.
