TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == the novel species streptococcus tigurinus and its association with oral infection.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a novel species of viridans streptococci, shown to cause severe invasive infections such as infective endocarditis, spondylodiscitis and meningitis. s. tigurinus belongs to the streptococcus mitis group and is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and streptococcus infantis. the presence of s. tigurinus in the human oral cavity has been documented, including  in patients with periodontal disease. this review addresses the available scientific knowledge on s. tigurinus and its association with closely related streptococci, and discusses its putative involvement in common oral infections. while there is as yet no strong evidence on the involvement of s. tigurinus with  oral infections, its presence in the oral cavity and its association with endocarditis warrants special attention for a link between oral and systemic infection.

TI  == isolation of streptococcus tigurinus - a novel member of streptococcus mitis group from a case of periodontitis.
AB  == streptococcus tigurinus is a new member of the streptococcus viridians group and  is closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated only by newer molecular methods like 16s rrna gene analysis. during the course of study on bacteraemia and infective endocarditis with reference to periodontitis and viridians group of streptococci, a strain of s. tigurinus isolated from subgingival plaque of a patient with periodontitis identified by 16s rrna gene analysis, which was originally identified as streptococcus pluranimalium by vitek 2. confirmation by 16s rrna gene analysis showed 99.39% similarity (1476/1485 bp) with s. tigurinus az_3a(t) (aoru01000002). to the best  of our knowledge, this is the first report of isolation of s. tigurinus from the  oral cavity of a periodontitis patient.

TI  == synbiotic in the management of infantile colic: a randomised controlled trial.
AB  == aim: infant colic is a frequent problem affecting up to 10-30% of infants in first 3 months of life. results from previous trials have shown that manipulation of gut microbiota can lead to symptomatic improvements. in a randomised clinical  trial, we aimed to determine efficacy of synbiotic in reducing average infant crying time at day 7 and day 30 after starting intervention. methods: fifty breastfed infants aged 15-120 days with infantile colic randomly assigned to receive either the synbiotic sachet containing 1 billion cfu of: lactobacillus casei, l. rhamnosus, streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, l. acidophilus, b. infantis, l. bulgaricus and fructooligosacharide (protexin healthcare, somerset, uk), or placebo daily for 30 days. parents were asked to record details of crying times in a symptoms diary. the primary outcome measure was the treatment success (reduction in the daily crying time >50%) and the secondary outcome measure was symptom resolution (reduction in the daily crying time >90%). results: the treatment success was significantly higher in synbiotic  group (82.6%) compared with placebo (35.7%) at day 7 (p < 0.005). at day30, treatment success was 87% and 46% in synbiotic and placebo group, respectively (p < 0.01). symptom resolution was also higher in synbiotic group (39%) compared with placebo (7%) at day 7 (p < 0.03) but not at day 30 (56% vs.36%, p = 0.24). we encountered no complication related to synbiotic use. conclusion: this synbiotic (a mixture of seven probiotic strains plus fos) significantly improved  colic symptoms in comparison with placebo.

TI  == the potential role of lung microbiota in lung cancer attributed to household coal burning exposures.
AB  == bacteria influence site-specific disease etiology and the host's ability to metabolize xenobiotics, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs). lung cancer in xuanwei, china has been attributed to pah-rich household air pollution  from burning coal. this study seeks to explore the role of lung microbiota in lung cancer among never smoking xuanwei women and how coal burning may influence  these associations. dna from sputum and buccal samples of never smoking lung cancer cases (n = 8, in duplicate) and controls (n = 8, in duplicate) in two xuanwei villages was extracted using a multi-step enzymatic and physical lysis, followed by a standardized clean-up. v1-v2 regions of 16s rrna genes were pcr-amplified. purified amplicons were sequenced by 454 flx titanium pyrosequencing and high-quality sequences were evaluated for diversity and taxonomic membership. bacterial diversity among cases and controls was similar in buccal samples (p = 0.46), but significantly different in sputum samples (p = 0.038). in sputum, granulicatella (6.1 vs. 2.0%; p = 0.0016), abiotrophia (1.5 vs. 0.085%; p = 0.0036), and streptococcus (40.1 vs. 19.8%; p = 0.0142) were enriched in cases compared with controls. sputum samples had on average 488.25 species-level otus in the flora of cases who used smoky coal (pah-rich) compared  with 352.5 otus among cases who used smokeless coal (pah-poor; p = 0.047). these  differences were explained by the bacilli species (streptococcus infantis and streptococcus anginosus). our small study suggests that never smoking lung cancer cases have differing sputum microbiota than controls. further, bacteria found in  sputum may be influenced by environmental exposures associated with the type of coal burned in the home.

TI  == minocycline resistance in an oral streptococcus infantis isolate is encoded by tet(s) on a novel small, low copy number plasmid.
AB  == we have determined the genetic basis of minocycline resistance in a strain of streptococcus infantis isolated from a healthy human oral cavity. we demonstrate  that tet(s), identical to tet(s) found on the enterococcal conjugative transposon tn6000, is responsible for the observed resistance. the gene is located on a small, low copy number plasmid and is flanked by is1216 elements. the tet(s) gene is capable of excising from the plasmid together with one of the is1216 elements. the plasmid contains a putative toxin/antitoxin system related to relbe. deletion of the toxin, rele, did not result in plasmid instability but did increase the fitness of the mutant compared to the wild-type strain.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from the upper respiratory tract of patients in the community.
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated the upper respiratory tract of adult and paediatric patients within the community. vgs are common commensal bacterial inhabitants of  the upper respiratory tract and valuable sentinel reporters of underlying antibiotic resistance (ar). laboratory examination of the colonising vgs species  may provide a valuable ecological description of the species isolated from the upper respiratory tract and their antibiotic susceptibility, including an estimation of the ar reservoir in this population. freshly obtained nasal and oropharyngeal swabs from 84 patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 363 isolates of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these isolates to belong to 10 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis, s. constellatus, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius,  s. sanguinis and s. vestibularis. the most frequent vgs organisms isolated was s. salivarius (282/363; 78.0%), followed by s. sanguinis (23/363; 6.3%), s. parasanguinis (21/363; 5.8%), s. mitis (18/363; 5.0%), s. anginosus (5/363; 1.4%), s. vestibularis (5/363; 1.4%), s. australis (3/363; 0.8%), s. oralis (3/363; 0.8%), s. infantis (1/363; 0.3%) and s. constellatus (1/363; 0.3%). all patients examined carried at least one vgs organism, where there were 17 combination patterns of carriage of the 10 species of vgs species isolated, where 54.2%, 37.3%, 7.2% and 1.2% of patients harboured one, two, three and four different vgs species, respectively. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by  standard disk diffusion assay testing against four classes of antibiotics, including the b-lactams [cefotaxime, cefuroxime], the tetracyclines [doxycycline], the fluoroquinolones [levofloxacin] and the macrolides [erythromycin]. overall, there was no resistance to levofloxacin and cefuroxime,  with limited resistance to cefotaxime (3.3%) and doxycycline (9.8%). antibiotic resistance was highest in erythromycin, where 40.9% of isolates were resistant. s. vestibularis was the most antibiotic resistance of all vgs species examined (s. vestibularis v s. salivarius p=0.011), followed by s. anginosis. s. salivarius was the most antibiotic susceptible vgs species examined. overall, given their infrequency in causing infection, relatively few studies to date have attempted to examine their ecology in their preferred body niche, namely the upper respiratory tract. however, knowing their prevalence is becoming increasingly important in relation to their ability to exclude significant respiratory pathogens, including streptococcus pneumoniae. in conclusion, these data indicate that vgs colonisation of the upper respiratory tract in individuals within the community is dominated mainly with relatively antibiotic susceptible s. salivarius.

TI  == probiotic effects on late-onset sepsis in very preterm infants: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == background and objective: late-onset sepsis frequently complicates prematurity, contributing to morbidity and mortality. probiotics may reduce mortality and necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in preterm infants, with unclear effect on late-onset sepsis. this study aimed to determine the effect of administering a specific combination of probiotics to very preterm infants on culture-proven late-onset sepsis. methods: a prospective multicenter, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial compared daily administration of a probiotic combination (bifidobacterium infantis, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacterium lactis, containing 1 x 10(9) total organisms) with placebo (maltodextrin) in infants born before 32 completed weeks' gestation weighing <1500 g. the primary outcome was at least 1 episode of definite late-onset sepsis. results: between october 2007 and november 2011, 1099 very preterm infants from australia and new zealand were randomized. rates of definite late-onset sepsis (16.2%), nec of bell stage 2 or more (4.4%), and mortality (5.1%) were low in controls, with high breast milk feeding rates (96.9%). no significant difference in definite late-onset sepsis or all-cause mortality was found, but this probiotic combination reduced nec of bell stage 2 or more (2.0% versus 4.4%; relative risk 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.93, p = .03; number needed to treat 43, 95% confidence interval 23 to 333). conclusions: the probiotics b infantis, s thermophilus, and b lactis significantly reduced nec of  bell stage 2 or more in very preterm infants, but not definite late-onset sepsis  or mortality. treatment with this combination of probiotics appears to be safe.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and phytochemical analysis of indigofera trita linn.
AB  == an in vitro antimicrobial activity and phytochemical analysis of various extracts of indigofera trita l. viz. petroleum ether, chloroform, acetone, ethanol and aqueous extracts were carried out. a total of 21 microorganisms (19 bacteria and  2 fungal strains) were used for antimicrobial activity by disc diffusion method and a standard procedure was used to identify the phytochemical constituents. petroleum ether extract showed moderate inhibitory activity against staphylococcus aureus (14.40 mm), s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), salmonella paratyphi a (12.80 mm), streptococcus mutans (12.20 mm), escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, s. typhi and burkholderia cepacia (12.00 mm). the chloroform extract also showed antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (14.20 mm), s. typhimurium (12.60 mm), s. paratyphi a, s. brunei and yersinia enterocolitica (12.00 mm). the acetone extract of i. trita showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. epidermidis (18.20 mm), s. typhimurium (14.60 mm), s. infantis (13.80 mm), s. aureus (13.40 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.00 mm) and enterobacter aerogenes (12.00 mm) were documented. ethanol extract showed significant antimicrobial activity against s. epidermidis (18.60 mm), s. paratyphi a (14.60 mm), y. enterocolitica (13.40 mm), s. typhi (12.40 mm), s. aureus, e. aerogenes, s. typhimurium and s. infantis (12.00 mm). aqueous extract  of i. trita considerably inhibited s. epidermidis (13.80 mm), s. paratyphi a and  y. enterocolitica (12.20 mm), e. aerogenes and haemophilus parahaemolyticus (12.00 mm). all the five extracts showed a minimal antifungal activity when compared to antibacterial activity. the result revealed that the antimicrobial properties of i. trita might be associated with the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, tannins, glycosides, saponins, phytosterols and alkaloids.

TI  == probiotics for the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonates: an 8-year retrospective cohort study.
AB  == what is known and objective: probiotic therapy has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in premature infants in several  international studies using various probiotic agents. the purpose of this study(*) is to describe our experience of using probiotic therapy in preventing nec in infants with very low birth weight (vlbw) in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) and to evaluate whether our records provide evidence of effectiveness for probiotic therapy. methods: in a retrospective cohort study, the efficacy of  probiotic therapy in preventing nec in vlbw infants was investigated via chart review. a probiotic administration protocol using a three-strain (streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and bifidobacterium bifidum) supplement was implemented in august 2007. patients admitted to the nicu from august 2003 through july 2011 were screened. primary outcomes are the morbidity and mortality of nec. the secondary outcomes were severity of nec and incidence of where infant feeds were stopped but nec was not diagnosed (nec scare). results and discussion: there was a significant increased baseline risk of nec development in the probiotics group, including younger gestational age, higher incidence of patent ductus arteriosus (pda) and use of indomethacin. the incidence of nec is similar  between the control group (2.8%) and probiotics group (2.4%) (hazard ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.42, 3.12). mortality of nec is also not statistically different. incidence of nec scare was decreased from 2.8% in control group to 1.4% in probiotics group, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.38). what is known and conclusion: our findings  suggest that probiotics are safe in nec prevention in vlbw infants. we had no cases of infection related to the strains of bacteria used in our product. with the low incidence of nec (2.8%) and nec scare (2.8%) in our cohort, we do not have enough power to detect any change in outcome, particularly as our study was  observational. however, it is hoped that our data give useful information for others on probiotic prophylactic therapy in the routine clinical management of vlbw infants.

TI  == rapid assay to assess colonization patterns following in-vivo probiotic ingestion.
AB  == background: colonization of the intestine with some microorganisms has been shown to have beneficial health effects. the association of bacteria with its human host starts soon after birth; however in infants born prematurely establishment of normal intestinal flora is interrupted with colonization with potential pathogenic organisms probiotic supplementation may therefore be beneficial to the health of preterm infants. as most probiotic organisms are difficult to culture,  confirmation of their colonization after supplementation is difficult. in this study, rapid qpcr assays for detection of presence of probiotic species in the intestine by faecal sampling is described in both preterm infant and adult participants. findings: probiotic colonization was determined using qpcr directed at amplification of organisms present in the ingested probiotic streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis and b. longum subsp. infantis. overall, differential detection of probiotic strains in faeces were found between adult and preterm infants, with 50% of infants continuing to shed at least two probiotic strains three weeks after probiotic ingestion had ceased.  conclusions: this study demonstrated rapid assessment of the preterm infant gut for colonization with probiotic strains using real-time pcr. this method would be of great importance in studies of probiotics in prevention of diseases and adverse clinical outcomes.

TI  == effect of probiotic species on irritable bowel syndrome symptoms: a bring up to date meta-analysis.
AB  == background and objectives: immune system alteration in irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients may be modulated by probiotics. we assessed the efficacy of some probiotic species in alleviating characteristic ibs symptoms. material and methods: a meta-analysis of all identified randomized controlled trials comparing probiotics with placebo in treating ibs symptoms was performed with continuous data summarized using standardized mean differences (smds) with 95% confidence intervals (95% cis), where appropriate. the random-effects model was employed in  cases of heterogeneity; otherwise, fixed-effects models were used. results: meta-analysis was performed with 10 of 24 studies identified as suitable for inclusion. probiotics improved pain scores if they contained bifidobacterium breve (smd, - 0.34; 95% ci, - 0.66; -0.02), bifidobacterium longum (smd, -0.48; 95% ci, - 0.91; -0.06), or lactobacillus acidophilus (smd, -0.31; 95% ci, -0.61;  -0.01) species. distension scores were improved by probiotics containing b. breve (smd, -0.45; 95% ci, -0.77; -0.13), bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus casei, or lactobacillus plantarum (smd, -0.53; 95% ci, -1.00; -0.06) species. all probiotic species tested improved flatulence: b. breve (smd, -0.42; 95% ci, -0.75;- 0.10), b. infantis, l. casei, l. plantarum (smd, -0.60; 95% ci, -1.07; -0.13), b. longum, l. acidophilus, lactobacillus bulgaricus, and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus (smd, -0.61; 95% ci, -1.01; -0.21). there was not a  clear positive effect of probiotics concerning the quality of life. conclusions:  some probiotics are an effective therapeutic option for ibs patients, and the effects on each ibs symptom are likely species-specific. future studies must focus on the role of probiotics in modulating intestinal microbiota and the immune system while considering individual patient symptom profiles.

TI  == effect of lactic fermentation on the total phenolic, saponin and phytic acid contents as well as anti-colon cancer cell proliferation activity of soymilk.
AB  == in an attempt to develop healthy dietary adjuncts, soymilk was fermented simultaneously with streptococcus thermophilus 14085 and bifidobacterium infantis 14603 at 37 degrees c for 24 h. it was found that lactic fermentation reduced the content of saponins and phytates, which possess antinutritional activity, and enhanced the total phenolic content as well as antitumor cell proliferation effect of soymilk against ht-29 and caco-2 cells. the original antitumor cell component, starter organisms, and antitumor cell bioactive principles formed in soymilk during fermentation, might all have contributed to the enhanced antitumor activity of fermented soymilk. the antiproliferative effect of the extracts varied with extraction solvent. extracts obtained from fermented soymilk with 80% methanol exhibited the highest suppression effect on the proliferation of ht-29 and caco-2 cells. this study further stresses the potential of developing soymilk as a healthy dietary adjunct possessing enhanced anticancer activity through the  use of lactic fermentation.

TI  == occurrence and evolution of the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species.
AB  == the distribution, genome location, and evolution of the four paralogous zinc metalloproteases, iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd, in streptococcus pneumoniae and related commensal species were studied by in silico analysis of whole genomes and by activity screening of 154 representatives of 20 species. zmpb was ubiquitous in the mitis and salivarius groups of the genus streptococcus and in the genera gemella and granulicatella, with the exception of a fragmented  gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species with a nonhuman habitat. iga1 protease activity was observed in all members of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, s. oralis, s. sanguinis, and gemella haemolysans, was variably  present in s. mitis and s. infantis, and absent in s. gordonii, s. parasanguinis, s. cristatus, s. oligofermentans, s. australis, s. peroris, and s. suis. phylogenetic analysis of 297 zmp sequences and representative housekeeping genes  provided evidence for an unprecedented selection for genetic diversification of the iga, zmpb, and zmpd genes in s. pneumoniae and evidence of very frequent intraspecies transfer of entire genes and combination of genes. presumably due to their adaptation to a commensal lifestyle, largely unaffected by adaptive mucosal immune factors, the corresponding genes in commensal streptococci have remained conserved. the widespread distribution and significant sequence diversity indicate an ancient origin of the zinc metalloproteases predating the emergence of the humanoid species. zmpb, which appears to be the ancestral gene, subsequently duplicated and successfully diversified into distinct functions, is  likely to serve an important but yet unknown housekeeping function associated with the human host. importance: the paralogous zinc metalloproteases iga1 protease, zmpb, zmpc, and zmpd have been identified as crucial for virulence of the human pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae. this study maps the presence of the  corresponding genes and enzyme activities in s. pneumoniae and in related commensal species of the genera streptococcus, gemella, and granulicatella. the distribution, genome location, and sequence diversification indicate that zmpb is the ancestral gene predating the evolution of today's humanoid species. the zmpb  protease may play an important but yet unidentified role in the association of streptococci of the mitis and salivarius groups with their human host, as it is ubiquitous in these two groups, except for a fragmented gene in streptococcus thermophilus, the only species not associated with humans. the relative sequence  diversification of the iga1 protease, zmpb, and zmpd is striking evidence of differences in selection for diversification of these surface-exposed proteins in the pathogen s. pneumoniae compared to the closely related commensal streptococci.

TI  == bacterial diversity of subgingival plaque in 6 healthy chinese individuals.
AB  == the subgingival microbial ecology is complex, and little is known regarding its bacteria species composition in healthy chinese individuals. this study aimed to  identify the subgingival microbiota from 6 healthy chinese subjects. subgingival  samples from 6 volunteers were collected, the 16s rrna gene was amplified using broad-range bacterial primers, and clone libraries were constructed. for the initial 2,439 sequences analyzed, 383 species-level operational taxonomic units (slotus) belonging to seven phyla were identified, estimated as 51% [95% confidence interval (ci) 44-55] of the slotus in this ecosystem. most (85%) of the bacterial sequences, falling into 228 types of species, corresponded to known and cultivated species. however, 146 (6%) sequences, comprising 104 phylotypes, had <97% similarity to prior database sequences. ten bacterial genera were conserved among all 6 individuals, comprising 2,000 (82%) of the 2,439 clones analyzed. ten species were noted in all of the 6 subjects, comprising 1,435 (58.8%) of the 2,439 clones. streptococcus infantis was the species most frequently cloned. furthermore, certain species which may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease were present in the 6 subjects. although the  initial subgingival plaque community of each subject was unique in terms of diversity and composition, 10 common key species were found in the 6 chinese individuals. these ten species of bacteria in the human subgingival plaque in the 6 healthy individuals may be key species which, to some extent, affect periodontal health. destruction of these key species in subgingival bacteria may  break the microbiota balance and may easily lead to over-breeding conditions resulting in pathogenic oral disease.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

AB  == we recently described the novel species streptococcus tigurinus sp. nov. belonging to the streptococcus mitis group. the type strain az_3a(t) of s. tigurinus was originally isolated from a patient with infective endocarditis. according to its phenotypic and molecular characteristics, s. tigurinus is most closely related to streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pseudopneumoniae, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis. accurate identification of s. tigurinus is facilitated by 16s rrna gene analysis. we retrospectively analyzed our 16s rrna gene molecular database, which contains sequences of all clinical samples obtained in our institute since 2003. we detected 17 16s rrna gene sequences which were assigned to s. tigurinus, including sequences from the 3 s. tigurinus strains described previously. s. tigurinus originated from normally sterile body sites, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or heart valves, of 14 patients and was initially detected by culture or broad-range 16s rrna gene pcr, followed by sequencing. the 14 patients had serious invasive infections, i.e., infective endocarditis (n = 6), spondylodiscitis (n = 3), bacteremia (n = 2), meningitis (n = 1), prosthetic joint infection (n = 1), and thoracic empyema (n = 1). to evaluate the presence of streptococcus tigurinus in the endogenous oral microbial flora, we screened saliva specimens of 31 volunteers. after selective growth, alpha-hemolytic growing colonies were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and subsequent molecular methods. s. tigurinus was not identified among 608 strains analyzed. these data indicate that s. tigurinus is not widely distributed in the oral cavity. in conclusion, s. tigurinus is a novel agent of invasive infections, particularly infective endocarditis.

TI  == double-blind, randomised clinical assay to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in preterm newborns weighing less than 1500 g in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis.
AB  == background: a randomised, double-blind clinical trial was undertaken in order to  assess the effectiveness of probiotics in the prevention of necrotising enterocolitis (nec) in newborns weighing <1500 g. methods: we studied a group of  150 patients who were randomised in two groups after parental consent was obtained, to receive either a daily feeding supplementation with a multispecies probiotic (lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacteruim infantis, streptococcus thermophillus) 1 g per day plus their regular feedings or to receive their regular feedings with nothing added (control group), over the period of january 2007 through june 2010. clinicians in care of the infants were blinded to the group assignment. results: the primary outcome was the development of nec. both groups were comparable, with no differences during hospitalisation, including the type of nutrition received. blood cultures obtained from cases that developed sepsis did not reveal lactobacillus or bifidobacteria growth. no differences were detected in terms of nec risk reduction (rr: 0.54, 95% ci 0.21 to 1.39) although  we did observe a clear trend in the reduction of nec frequency in the studied cases: 6 (8%) versus 12 (16%) in the control group. when the combined risk of nec or death was calculated as a post hoc analysis, we found a significantly lower risk (rr: 0.39, 95% ci 0.17 to 0.87) for the study group. conclusions: probiotics may offer potential benefits for premature infants and are a promising strategy in the reduction of the risk of nec in preterm newborns.

TI  == effects of probiotics and antibiotics on the intestinal homeostasis in a computer controlled model of the large intestine.
AB  == background: antibiotic associated diarrhea and clostridium difficile infection are frequent complications of broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. probiotic bacteria are used as therapeutic and preventive agents in these disorders, but the exact functional mechanisms and the mode of action are poorly understood. the effects of clindamycin and the probiotic mixture vsl#3 (containing the 8 bacterial strains streptococcus thermophilus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus) consecutively or in combination were investigated and compared to controls without therapy using a standardized human fecal microbiota in a computer-controlled in vitro model of large intestine. microbial metabolites (short chain fatty acids, lactate, branched chain fatty acids, and ammonia) and the intestinal microbiota were analyzed. results: compared to controls and combination therapy, short chain fatty acids and lactate, but also ammonia and branched chain fatty acids, were increased under probiotic therapy. the metabolic pattern under combined therapy with antibiotics and probiotics had the most beneficial and consistent effect on intestinal metabolic profiles. the intestinal microbiota showed a decrease in several indigenous bacterial groups under antibiotic therapy, there was no significant recovery of these groups when the antibiotic therapy was followed by administration of probiotics. simultaneous application of anti- and probiotics had a stabilizing effect on the intestinal microbiota with increased bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. conclusions: administration of vsl#3 parallel with the clindamycin therapy had a beneficial and stabilizing effect on the intestinal metabolic homeostasis by decreasing toxic metabolites and protecting the endogenic microbiota from destruction. probiotics could be a reasonable strategy in prevention of antibiotic associated  disturbances of the intestinal homeostasis and disorders.

TI  == aerobic oral and rectal bacteria of free-ranging steller sea lion pups and juveniles (eumetopias jubatus) in alaska.
AB  == bacteriologic cultures from oral, rectal, and lesion samples from free-ranging steller sea lion (ssl, eumetopias jubatus) pups and juveniles in alaska (2001-2005) were examined to determine frequency of infection by a specific subset of common and pathogenic aerobic bacteria. associations between isolated bacteria and age, sex, body condition, location, and sampling season were investigated. salmonella spp. isolates were further evaluated to determine spatial clustering (n=48) and to identify serovars (n=13) and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (n=11). we sampled 356 ssl pups (n=272) and juveniles (n=84), and identified 988 isolates of 13 bacterial genera of specific interest.  pasteurella spp. (43.8%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus spp. (30.6%), and mannheimia spp. (18.2%) were the most commonly isolated oral bacteria (n=499 isolates), whereas escherichia coli (47.6%), beta-hemolytic e. coli (32.4%), salmonella spp. (10.4%), and campylobacter spp. (7.8%) were the most frequently isolated rectal bacteria (n=460 isolates). salmonella was most commonly found in  pups from western stocks and in samples collected during fall/winter seasons. a significant salmonella cluster was detected at the perry island haulout. five serovars were isolated: enteritidis, infantis, newport, reading, and stanley. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis provided evidence that salmonella isolates were  most likely being maintained within the ssl population in alaska.

TI  == the proprems trial: investigating the effects of probiotics on late onset sepsis  in very preterm infants.
AB  == background: late onset sepsis is a frequent complication of prematurity associated with increased mortality and morbidity. the commensal bacteria of the  gastrointestinal tract play a key role in the development of healthy immune responses. healthy term infants acquire these commensal organisms rapidly after birth. however, colonisation in preterm infants is adversely affected by delivery mode, antibiotic treatment and the intensive care environment. altered microbiota composition may lead to increased colonisation with pathogenic bacteria, poor immune development and susceptibility to sepsis in the preterm infant.probiotics  are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer health benefits on the host. amongst numerous bacteriocidal and nutritional roles, they may also favourably modulate host immune responses in local and remote tissues. meta-analyses of probiotic supplementation in preterm infants report a reduction in mortality and necrotising enterocolitis. studies with sepsis as an outcome have reported mixed results to date.allergic diseases are increasing in incidence in "westernised" countries. there is evidence that probiotics may reduce the incidence of these diseases by altering the intestinal  microbiota to influence immune function. methods/design: this is a multi-centre,  randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled trial investigating supplementing  preterm infants born at < 32 weeks' gestation weighing < 1500 g, with a probiotic combination (bifidobacterium infantis, streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium lactis). a total of 1,100 subjects are being recruited in australia and new zealand. infants commence the allocated intervention from soon  after the start of feeds until discharge home or term corrected age. the primary  outcome is the incidence of at least one episode of definite (blood culture positive) late onset sepsis before 40 weeks corrected age or discharge home. secondary outcomes include: necrotising enterocolitis, mortality, antibiotic usage, time to establish full enteral feeds, duration of hospital stay, growth measurements at 6 and 12 months' corrected age and evidence of atopic conditions  at 12 months' corrected age. discussion: results from previous studies on the use of probiotics to prevent diseases in preterm infants are promising. however, a large clinical trial is required to address outstanding issues regarding safety and efficacy in this vulnerable population. this study will address these important issues. trial registration: australia and new zealand clinical trials register (anzctr): actrn012607000144415the product "abc dophilus probiotic powder for infants(r)", solgar, usa has its 3 probiotics strains registered with the deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen (dsmz--german collection of microorganisms and cell cultures) as bb-12 15954, b-02 96579, th-4 15957.

TI  == effect of functional yogurt ny-yp901 in improving the trait of metabolic syndrome.
AB  == background/objectives: this study was aimed to assess the beneficial effects on metabolic syndrome of functional yogurt ny-yp901 (namyang dairy product co. ltd and nutra r&bt inc., seoul, korea) supplemented with mixture of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium infantis and extra-ingredients containing bifidobacterium breve (cbg-c2), enterococcus faecalis fk-23, fibersol-2 and so on. subjects/methods: this study was designed as an 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study. treatment and control groups consumed a functional yogurt ny-yp901 (150 ml) and a placebo yogurt twice a day, respectively, for 8 weeks. body weight and body mass  index (bmi), blood pressure, lipid profiles, fasting glucose with hba1c and waist circumference were measured before and after treatment. inclusion criteria were healthy individuals between the ages 20-65 years old who submitted an informed consent. results: during the period august 2009 to december 2009, 101 healthy participants (31 males and 70 females) finished the study. treatment group were 53 individuals, and the control group were 48 individuals. in the treatment group consuming ny-yp901, statistically significant beneficial changes were observed in body weight (treatment group vs control group=-0.24+/-1.50 vs +0.64+/-1.39 kg, p<0.05), bmi (-0.10+/-0.58 vs +0.24+/-0.50 kg/m(2), p<0.05 ) and low-density lipoprotein (ldl)-cholesterol (-7.71+/-14.14 vs -0.43+/-15.32 mg/dl, p<0.05) after 8 weeks. the change in other parameters was not different between the treatment and the control groups. conclusions: the functional yogurt ny-yp901 reduced ldl-cholesterol, body weight and bmi in the subjects at a 300-ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. from these findings, regular intake of functional  yogurt ny-yp901 may be consequently related to improve metabolic syndrome.

TI  == probiotic fermented milk containing dietary fiber has additive effects in ibs with constipation compared to plain probiotic fermented milk.
AB  == background/aims: although controversial, probiotics and dietary fiber are commonly used for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). we evaluated the  effects of multistrain probiotics on the symptoms of ibs to determine whether the addition of dietary fi ber had an additive effect on constipation-predominant ibs. methods: a total of 142 participants who met the rome iii criteria were recruited and randomized into a control group or a test group. participants in the control group received multistrain probiotic fermented milk with streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium infantis; the participants in the test group received the same probiotic fermented milk mixed with dietary fi ber such as sea tangle extracts, radish extracts and glasswort extracts. the patients were treated for four weeks. results: most of the symptoms of ibs, with the exception of fl atulence, stool consistency, and frequency of defecation, signifi cantly improved in both groups. in the analysis of ibs subtypes, especially constipation-predominant ibs, the frequency and duration of defecation and straining at stool were improved more in the test group than in the control group. conclusions: dietary fiber had additive benefits for the symptoms of constipation, especially in constipation-predominant ibs.

TI  == impact of monocytic cells on recovery of uncultivable bacteria from atherosclerotic lesions.
AB  == objective: epidemiological evidence suggests that infections may contribute to atherogenesis. however, with the exception of chlamydophila pneumoniae, cultivable bacteria have not been recovered from atherosclerotic lesions. therefore, we aimed at developing an approach to recover uncultivable bacteria from atherectomy tissues. methods: we cultured homogenates from atherectomy specimens from seven nonseptic patients undergoing surgery for arterial obstruction either alone or together with thp-1 monocyte-like cells. we performed 16s rdna analysis, biochemical tests, random amplification of polymorphic dna pcr analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and immunohistofluorescence to identify the cultivated bacteria. wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to determine whether thp-1 treatment yielded a higher number of isolates than did the untreated controls. results: we recovered more bacteria from cocultures of atherectomy specimens with thp-1 cells than atherectomy specimens cultured alone. on average, tissue homogenates incubated with thp-1 cells versus control yielded 124 vs. 22 colony-forming units, a median of 140 vs. 7, respectively (p = 0.02). we recovered 872 isolates of limited number of species, including propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus infantis and the fastidious anaerobe porphyromonas gingivalis, and  confirmed its presence in tissue using double immunofluorescence imaging. qpcr demonstrated the presence of >/=3.5 x 10(3) p. gingivalis genomes per gram of atheromatous tissue. conclusions: these results indicate that viable previously uncultivable bacterial species are present within atheromas. our results suggest  revisiting the hypothesis that infections may have a causative role in atherosclerotic inflammation and have implications for research regarding novel diagnostics and treatments for cardiovascular disease.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == population structure and characterization of viridans group streptococci (vgs) including streptococcus pneumoniae isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == a study was undertaken to examine the population structure of viridans group streptococci (vgs) in the sputum of adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). freshly expectorated sputa (n=58) from 45 adult cf patients were examined by selective conventional culture on mitis-salivarius agar and yielded 190 isolates  of vgs. sequence analyses of the rpnb and 16-23s rrna its genes identified these  isolates to belong to 12 species of vgs and included s. anginosus, s. australis,  s. cristatus, s. gordonii, s. infantis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. pneumoniae, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis. the most frequently vgs organism isolated was s. salivarius (47/190; 24.7%), followed by s. mitis (36/190; 19%), s. sanguinis (25/190; 13.2%), s. oralis (20/190; 11.0%), s. pneumoniae (19/190; 10.0%), s. parasanguinis (16/190; 8.4%), s. infantis (11/190; 5.8%), s. gordonii (7/190; 3.7%), s. anginosus (4/190; 2.1%), s. cristatus (2/190; 1.1%), s. australis (1/190; 0.5%), s. mutans (1/190; 0.5%) and s. agalactiae (1/190; 0.5%). all, but four, patients harboured at least one vgs species, which ranged from one to five streptococcal species, with a mean of 2.85 species per patient. there was no clonality at the subspecies level employing eric rapd pcr. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) testing against penicillin, erythromycin and ciprofloxacin. overall, resistance to penicillin with all vgs was 73/190 (38.4%) and 167/190 (87.9%) for erythromycin. with regard to ciprofloxacin, 27/190 (14.2%) were fully resistant, whilst a further 21/190 (11.1%) showed intermediate resistance, which  equated to approximately three quarters (74.7%) of isolates being fully sensitive to this agent. in addition, as a comparator control population, we examined antibiotic susceptibility, as above, in a non-cf population comprising 12 individuals (50 vgs isolates), who were not receiving chronic antibiotics. in comparison, 8% and 38% of vgs isolates from non-cf individuals were resistant by  disk susceptibility testing to penicillin and erythromycin, respectively. none of the non-cf vgs organisms were resistant to ciprofloxacin, but 42% showed intermediate resistance.

TI  == structure and dynamics of the pan-genome of streptococcus pneumoniae and closely  related species.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the most important causes of microbial diseases in humans. the genomes of 44 diverse strains of s. pneumoniae  were analyzed and compared with strains of non-pathogenic streptococci of the mitis group. results: despite evidence of extensive recombination, the s. pneumoniae phylogenetic tree revealed six major lineages. with the exception of serotype 1, the tree correlated poorly with capsular serotype, geographical site  of isolation and disease outcome. the distribution of dispensable genes--genes present in more than one strain but not in all strains--was consistent with phylogeny, although horizontal gene transfer events attenuated this correlation in the case of ancient lineages. homologous recombination, involving short stretches of dna, was the dominant evolutionary process of the core genome of s.  pneumoniae. genetic exchange occurred both within and across the borders of the species, and s. mitis was the main reservoir of genetic diversity of s. pneumoniae. the pan-genome size of s. pneumoniae increased logarithmically with the number of strains and linearly with the number of polymorphic sites of the sampled genomes, suggesting that acquired genes accumulate proportionately to the age of clones. most genes associated with pathogenicity were shared by all s. pneumoniae strains, but were also present in s. mitis, s. oralis and s. infantis, indicating that these genes are not sufficient to determine virulence. conclusions: genetic exchange with related species sharing the same ecological niche is the main mechanism of evolution of s. pneumoniae. the open pan-genome guarantees the species a quick and economical response to diverse environments.

TI  == bacterial 16s sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  == previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also  suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. in addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in ph homeostasis. the bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16s rrna genes. lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions.  s. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated  with caries progression in the overall model. lactobacillus or s. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of selenomonas, neisseria, and streptococcus mitis. propionibacterium fma5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. an overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the streptococcus mitis-s. pneumoniae-s. infantis group, corynebacterium matruchotii, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, capnocytophaga gingivalis, eubacterium ir009,  campylobacter rectus, and lachnospiraceae sp. c1. the relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16s rrna gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and  metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.

TI  == consumption of human milk oligosaccharides by gut-related microbes.
AB  == human milk contains large amounts of complex oligosaccharides that putatively modulate the intestinal microbiota of breast-fed infants by acting as decoy binding sites for pathogens and as prebiotics for enrichment of beneficial bacteria. several bifidobacterial species have been shown to grow well on human milk oligosaccharides. however, few data exist on other bacterial species. this work examined 16 bacterial strains belonging to 10 different genera for growth on human milk oligosaccharides. for this propose, a chemically defined medium, zmb1, was used, which allows vigorous growth of a number of gut-related microorganisms  in a fashion similar to complex media. interestingly, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bacteroides fragilis , and bacteroides vulgatus strains were able to metabolize milk oligosaccharides with high efficiency, whereas enterococcus , streptococcus , veillonella , eubacterium , clostridium , and escherichia coli strains grew less well or not at all. mass spectrometry-based glycoprofiling of the oligosaccharide consumption behavior revealed a specific preference for fucosylated oligosaccharides by bi. longum subsp. infantis and ba. vulgatus. this work expands the current knowledge of human milk oligosaccharide consumption by gut microbes, revealing bacteroides as avid consumers of this substrate. these results provide insight on how human milk oligosaccharides shape the infant intestinal microbiota.

TI  == molecular characterization of macrolide resistance determinants [erm(b) and mef(a)] in streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci (vgs) isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis (cf).
AB  == objectives: although long-term use of azithromycin has shown a significant clinical improvement for patients with cystic fibrosis (cf), its long-term effect on the susceptibility of commensal flora within cf airways has not yet been examined. we therefore suggest that long-term use of azithromycin increases macrolide resistance in commensal streptococci. methods: erythromycin susceptibility in naturally colonizing viridans group streptococci (vgs) was characterized, as well as macrolide resistance gene determinants through sequence analysis, in pneumococci (n = 15) and vgs [n = 84; i.e. streptococcus salivarius  (n = 30), streptococcus mitis (n = 17), streptococcus sanguinis (n = 11), streptococcus oralis (n = 10), streptococcus parasanguinis (n = 6), streptococcus gordonii (n = 3), streptococcus infantis (n = 3), streptococcus cristatus (n = 2), streptococcus anginosus (n = 1) and streptococcus australis (n = 1)] isolated from sputum from 24 adult cf patients, who were on oral azithromycin therapy for  at least the previous 7 months. results: almost three-quarters of isolates (74; 74.7%) were resistant to erythromycin, whilst a further 15 (15.2%) had reduced susceptibility, leaving only 10 (10.1%) isolates susceptible to erythromycin. the majority (89.8%) were not susceptible to erythromycin, as demonstrated by possession of the erm(b) gene in 25/99 (25.3%), the mef(a) gene in 1/99 (1.0%), the mef(e) gene in 75/99 (75.8%) and both erm(b) and mef(e) genes simultaneously  in 11/99 (11.1%). these results indicate that genotypic resistance for macrolides is common in vgs in adult cf patients, with efflux being over three times more frequent. conclusions: long-term treatment with azithromycin in cf patients may reduce antibiotic susceptibility in commensal vgs, where these organisms may potentially act as a reservoir of macrolide resistance determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens.

TI  == probiotic use in the critically ill.
AB  == probiotics are "live microbes which when administered in adequate amounts confer  a health benefit to the host" (fao/who joint group). their potential role in bio-ecological modification of pathological internal milieu of the critically ill is under evaluation. probiotics are available as single microbial strain (e.g., bacillus clausii, lactobacillus) or as a mix of multiple strains of lactobacillus (acidophilus, sporogenes, lactis, reuteri rc-14, gg, and l. plantarum 299v), bifidobacterium (bifidum, longum, infantis), streptococcus (thermophillus, lactis, fecalis), saccharomyces boulardii etc. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are gram-positive, anaerobic, lactic acid bacteria. these are normal inhabitant of human gut and colonize the colon better than others. critical illness and its  treatment create hostile environment in the gut and alters the micro flora favoring growth of pathogens. therapy with probiotics is an effort to reduce or eliminate potential pathogens and toxins, to release nutrients, antioxidants, growth factors and coagulation factors, to stimulate gut motility and to modulate innate and adaptive immune defense mechanisms via the normalization of altered gut flora. scientific evidence shows that use of probiotics is effective in prevention and therapy of antibiotic associated diarrhea. however, available probiotics strains in currently used doses do not provide much needed early benefits, and need long-term administration to have clinically beneficial effects (viz, a reduction in rate of infection, severe sepsis, icu stay, ventilation days and mortality) in critically ill surgical and trauma patients. possibly, available strains do not adhere to intestinal mucosa early, or may require higher dose than what is used. gap exists in our knowledge regarding mechanisms of action of different probiotics, most effective strains--single or multiple, cost  effectiveness, risk-benefit potential, optimum dose, frequency and duration of treatment etc. more information is needed on safety profile of probiotics in immunocompromised state of the critically ill in view of rare reports of fungemia and sepsis and a trend toward possible increase in nosocomial infection. at present, despite theoretical potential benefits, available evidence is not conclusive to recommend probiotics for routine use in the critically ill.

TI  == evolution of streptococcus pneumoniae and its close commensal relatives.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group of streptococci which, according to 16s rrna-sequence based phylogenetic reconstruction, includes 12 species. while other species of this group are considered prototypes of commensal bacteria, s. pneumoniae is among the most frequent microbial killers worldwide. population genetic analysis of 118 strains, supported by demonstration of a distinct cell wall carbohydrate structure and competence pheromone sequence signature, shows that s. pneumoniae is one of several hundred evolutionary lineages forming a cluster separate from streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis. the remaining lineages of this distinct cluster are commensals previously collectively referred to as streptococcus mitis and each represent separate species by traditional taxonomic standard. virulence genes including the operon for capsule polysaccharide synthesis and genes encoding iga1 protease, pneumolysin, and autolysin were randomly distributed among s. mitis lineages. estimates of the evolutionary age of the lineages, the identical location of remnants of virulence genes in the genomes of commensal strains, the pattern of genome reductions, and the proportion of unique genes and their origin support the model that the entire cluster of s. pneumoniae, s. pseudopneumoniae, and s. mitis lineages evolved from pneumococcus-like bacteria presumably pathogenic to the common immediate ancestor of hominoids. during their adaptation to a commensal life style, most of the lineages gradually lost the majority of genes determining virulence and became genetically distinct due to sexual isolation in  their respective hosts.

TI  == fast detection of salmonella infantis with carbon nanotube field effect transistors.
AB  == in this paper we report a fast, sensitive and label-free biosensor for the selective determination of salmonella infantis. it is based on a field effect transistor (fet) in which a network of single-walled carbon nantotubes (swcnts) acts as the conductor channel. anti-salmonella antibodies were adsorbed onto the  swcnts and subsequently the swcnts were protected with tween 20 to prevent the non-specific binding of other bacteria or proteins. our fet devices were exposed  to increasing concentrations of s. infantis and were able to detect at least 100  cfu/ml in 1h. to evaluate the selectivity of our fet devices, streptococcus pyogenes and shigella sonnei were tested as potential competing bacteria for salmonella. at a concentration of 500 cfu/ml, neither streptococcus nor shigella  interfered with the detection of salmonella. therefore, these devices could be used as useful label-free platforms to detect s. infantis and, by using the suitable antibody, other bacteria or viruses.

TI  == population diversity and dynamics of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus infantis in the upper respiratory tracts of adults, determined  by a nonculture strategy.
AB  == we reinvestigated the clonal diversity and dynamics of streptococcus mitis and two other abundant members of the commensal microbiota of the upper respiratory tract, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus infantis, to obtain information about the origin of frequently emerging clones in this habitat. a culture-independent method was used, based on cloning and sequencing of pcr amplicons of the housekeeping gene gdh, which shows remarkable, yet species-specific, genetic polymorphism. samples were collected from all potential ecological niches in the oral cavity and pharynx of two adults on two occasions separated by 2 years. based on analysis of close to 10,000 sequences, significant diversity was observed in populations of all three species. fluctuations in the relative proportions of individual clones and species were observed over time. while a few clones dominated, the proportions of most clones were very small. the results show that the frequent turnover of s. mitis, s. oralis, and s. infantis clones observed by cultivation can be explained by fluctuations in the relative proportions of clones, most of which are below the level of detection by the traditional culture technique, possibly combined with loss and acquisition from contacts. these findings provide a platform for understanding the mechanisms that govern the balance within the complex microbiota at mucosal sites and between the microbiota and the mucosal immune system of the host.

TI  == possible mechanisms of antimutagenicity in fermented soymilk prepared with a coculture of streptococcus infantis and bifidobacterium infantis.
AB  == the possible mechanisms of antimutagenicity against 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo; a direct mutagen) and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab; an indirect mutagen) were examined in fermented soymilk prepared with a coculture of streptococcus thermophilus and bifidobacterium infantis. the antimutagenicity in  the fermented soymilk was not due to the bioantimutagenic effect of modulation of dna repair processes. the mutagenicity of dmab decreased with increased preincubation of fermented soymilk and the dmab metabolite but not with intact dmab or an s9 mixture. mutagenicity of 4-nqo was not affected by preincubation of fermented soymilk with this mutagen. mutagenicity of both 4-nqo and dmab was reduced when salmonella typhimurium ta 100 was pretreated with fermented soymilk, indicating that fermented soymilk affected the function of the bacterial cell, which might also lead to reduced mutagenicity of the tested mutagens. desmutagenic and blocking effects were the main mechanisms of antimutagenicity in the fermented soymilk against dmba. in contrast, the antimutagenic effect of the  fermented soymilk on 4-nqo was primarily due to a blocking effect.

TI  == spotlight on vsl#3 probiotic mixture in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == vsl#3 (vsl#3) is a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species that are normal components of the human gastrointestinal microflora, including four strains of lactobacilli (lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, and l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus), three strains of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, and b. infantis), and streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus. data from noncomparative trials suggest that vsl#3 has clinical potential in the treatment  of active mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and as maintenance therapy for patients with ulcerative colitis in remission. in addition, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial showed that vsl#3 in combination with low-dose balsalazide (a prodrug of mesalazine [mesalamine; 5-aminosalicylic acid]) was more effective than standard doses of basalazide or mesalazine monotherapy in the treatment of acute mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have shown vsl#3 is effective in preventing the onset  of acute pouchitis in patients with newly formed surgical pouches, and in maintaining remission following antibacterial treatment of acute pouchitis in patients with a history of refractory or recurrent pouchitis. treatment guidelines from the us and the uk include vsl#3 as a therapeutic option for the prevention of pouchitis relapse in patients with chronic pouchitis. in general, vsl#3 was well tolerated in clinical trials. large, well designed, controlled confirmatory clinical trials will further determine the place of vsl#3 in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

TI  == transformation of isoflavone phytoestrogens during the fermentation of soymilk with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in the present study, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus bcrc 14085, lactobacillus acidophilus bcrc 14079) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis bcrc 14633, b. longum b6) individually,  and in combination. the change in the content of various isoflavones (aglycones,  glucoside, acetyl- and malonyl-glucosides) and the beta-glucosidase activity in soymilk during fermentation is investigated. it is observed that fermented soymilk contains a lower total isoflavone content (81.94-86.61 microg/ml) than soymilk without fermentation (87.61 microg/ml). regardless of starter organism employed, fermentation causes a major reduction in the contents of glucoside, malonylglucoside and acetylglucoside isoflavones along with a significant increase of aglycone isoflavones content. the level of change in the content of various isoflavones and beta-glucosidase activity after fermentation varies with  the starter organism. among all the fermented soymilks tested, soymilk fermented  with s. thermophilus showed the highest beta-glucosidase activity and the greatest increase in the contents of aglycones. the percentage of daidzein, genistein and glycitein to total isoflavone content in s. thermophilus-fermented  soymilk increases from an initial 14.24%, 6.89% and 2.45%, respectively, to 36.20%, 28.80% and 12.44% after 24h of fermentation. finally, the increase of aglycones and decrease of glucoside isoflavones during fermentation coincides with the increase of beta-glucosidase activity observed in fermented soymilk.

TI  == antioxidative activities of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == to further the goal of developing a probiotic dietary adjunct using soymilk, soymilk is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus ccrc 14079 or streptococcus thermophilus ccrc 14085) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis ccrc 14633 or bifidobacterium longum b6) individually,  and in conjunction. we investigate several antioxidative activities including the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, the scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide, and the reducing activity exerted by different varieties of fermented soymilks. in addition, the effect of spray-drying and freeze-drying on changes in antioxidative activity is examined. we find that in fermented soymilk both the inhibition of ascorbate autoxidation, and the reducing activity and scavenging effect of superoxide anion radicals varied with the starters used, but nevertheless are significantly higher than those found in unfermented soymilk. in general, antioxidative activity in soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria simultaneously is significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that fermented with either individually. moreover, antioxidative activity increases as the fermentation period is extended. however, unfermented soymilk shows an h2o2-scavenging effect, while there is no scavenging effect except for the accumulation of h2o2 in fermented soymilk. finally, we find that freeze-drying causes a significantly lesser (p < 0.05) reduction in the antioxidative activity of soymilk than does spray-drying. irrespective of the drying method and the starters used for fermentation. the antioxidative activity  of fermented soymilk reduces after drying yet remains higher than that of dried unfermented soymilk.

TI  == development of bacterial and bifidobacterial communities in feces of newborn babies.
AB  == microbial 16s rdna from babies' fecal samples were amplified by pcr, and analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), cloning and sequencing. pcr-dgge profiles were used to follow in time the colonization of the intestine by bacteria. four healthy babies, one baby who received antibiotics and their parents participated to the present study to determine the extent to which administration of antibiotics can modify the bacterial colonization of neonatal human gut and verify the influence of parental factors on the formation of the fecal bacterial community. in the healthy babies, escherichia coli or bacteria belonging to clostridium spp. were the initial colonizers rapidly followed by bifidobacterium, bacteroides, clostridium, streptococcus, enterococcus and actinomyces. bifidobacterium species appeared already after five days in the breast-fed babies while there was a delay in the baby who received a formula based diet during only one day after birth. in each baby two or three bifidobacterial species including b. infantis were found. the observed variations in species were not associated with the feeding changes. the comparison of dgge profiles of the babies and their parents patterns showed bands with equal migration suggesting a vertical transmission determined by genetic and environmental factors. the brief appearance of pioneer bacteria determined as being e. coli and enterococcus spp. in the profile from the baby under antibiotic therapy, was succeeded by a small stable community consisting of ruminococcus species. no bifidobacterium sequences were detectable in this antibiotic-treated  baby in spite of a partly breast-milk diet.

TI  == mutagenicity and antimutagenic effect of soymilk fermented with lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria.
AB  == in this study, soymilk was first fermented with lactic acid bacteria (streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus) and bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum) both individually and simultaneously. mutagenicity and the suppression of fermented soymilk against the mutagenesis induced by 4-nitroquinoline-n-oxide (4-nqo), a direct-acting mutagen, and 3,2'-dimethyl-4-amino-biphenyl (dmab), an indirect-acting mutagen, on salmonella typhimurium ta 100, was then investigated. it was found that the fermented soymilk shows no mutagenic activity on sal. typhimurium ta 100. fermentation, in general, significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the antimutagenicity of soymilk. the levels of increased antimutagenicity of fermented soymilk varied with the starter organism and the type of mutagen tested. although unfermented soymilk exerted lower antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo, the fermented soymilk, generally, showed a higher antimutagenic activity against dmab than 4-nqo. among the various fermented soymilk tested, soymilk fermented with both str. themophilus and b. infantis simultaneously exhibited the highest antimutagenicity of 85.07% and 85.78%, respectively, against 4-nqo and dmab further investigation on this fermented soymilk revealed that both the antimutagenic factors formed during fermentation and the cells of the starter organisms contributed to the increased antimutagenic activity against dmab, while the former led to the increased activity against 4-nqo.

TI  == bioproduction of conjugated linoleic acid by probiotic bacteria occurs in vitro and in vivo in mice.
AB  == probiotics have been shown to reduce the incidence of colon cancer in animal models. the mechanisms responsible for this activity are poorly defined. conjugated linoleic acids (cla) are a group of isomers of linoleic acid (la) possessing anti-inflammatory and anticarcinogenic properties, which can be produced from la by certain bacterial strains. in this study, the ability of probiotic bacteria to exert anticarcinogenic effects through the production of cla was assessed. incubation of probiotic bacteria (vsl3, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. bulgaricus, l. casei, l. plantarum, bifidobacterium breve, b. infantis, b. longum, and streptococcus thermophilus) in the presence of la yielded cla production as measured by gas chromatography. conditioned medium, containing probiotic-produced cla, reduced viability and induced apoptosis of ht-29 and caco-2 cells, as assessed by mtt assay and dna laddering, respectively. western blotting demonstrated an increased expression of ppargamma in cells treated with conditioned medium compared with la alone. incubation of murine feces with la after administering vsl3 yielded 100-fold more cla than feces collected prior to vsl3 feeding. this study supports a role for supplemental probiotics as a strategy both for attenuating inflammation and for preventing colon cancer.

TI  == overestimation of streptococcus mutans prevalence by nested pcr detection of the  16s rrna gene.
AB  == this study was carried out in order to compare two pcr-based methods in the detection of streptococcus mutans. the first pcr method was based on primers for  the 16s rrna gene and the second method was based on specific primers that targeted the glucosyltransferase gene (gtfb). each pcr was performed with eight different streptococci from the viridans group, five other streptococci and 17 different non-streptococcal bacterial strains. direct use of the s. mutans 16s rrna gene-specific primers revealed that streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus infantis were also detected. after amplifying the 16s rrna gene with universal primers and subsequently performing nested pcr, the s. mutans-specific nested primers based on the 16s rrna gene detected all tested streptococci. there was no cross-reaction of the gtfb primers after direct pcr. our results indicate that direct pcr and nested pcr based on 16s rrna genes can reveal false-positive results for oral streptococci and lead to an overestimation of the prevalence of  s. mutans with regards to its role as the most prevalent causative agent of dental caries.

TI  == identification of 43 streptococcus species by pyrosequencing analysis of the rnpb gene.
AB  == pyrosequencing technology was evaluated for identification of species within the  streptococcus genus. two variable regions in the rnpb gene, which encodes the rna subunit of endonuclease p, were sequenced in two reactions. of 43 species, all could be identified to the species level except strains of the species pairs streptococcus anginosus/s. constellatus and s. infantis/s. peroris. a total of 113 blood culture isolates were identified by pyrosequencing analysis of partial  rnpb sequences. all but eight isolates could be unambiguously assigned to a specific species when the first 30 nucleotides of the two regions were compared to an rnpb database comprising 107 streptococcal strains. principal coordinate analysis of sequence variation of strains from viridans group streptococci resulted in species-specific clusters for the mitis and the salivarius groups but not for the anginosus group. the identification capacity of pyrosequencing was compared to the biochemical test systems vitek 2 and rapid id 32 strep. the concordance between pyrosequencing and vitek 2 was 75%, and for rapid id 32 strep the corresponding figure was 77%. isolates with discrepant identifications in the three methods were subjected to entire rnpb dna sequence analysis that confirmed  the identifications by pyrosequencing. in conclusion, pyrosequencing analysis of  the rnpb gene can reliably identify streptococcus species with high resolution.

TI  == oral probiotics prevent necrotizing enterocolitis in very low birth weight neonates.
AB  == objective: to test the hypothesis that normalizing the intestinal flora by administration of prophylactic probiotics would provide a natural defense, thereby reducing both the incidence and severity of necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) in preterm neonates. study design: neonates < or =1500 g birth weight were  randomized to either receive a daily feeding supplementation with a probiotic mixture (bifidobacteria infantis, streptococcus thermophilus, and bifidobacteria  bifidus; solgar, israel) of 10(9) colony forming units (cfu)/day or to not receive feed supplements. nec was graded according to bell's criteria. results: for 72 study and 73 control infants, respectively, birth weight (1152 +/- 262 g vs 1111 +/- 278 g), gestational age (30 +/- 3 weeks vs 29 +/- 4 weeks), and time  to reach full feeds (14.6 +/- 8.7 days vs 17.5 +/- 13.6 days) were not different. the incidence of nec was reduced in the study group (4% vs 16.4%; p=.03). nec was less severe in the probiotic-supplemented infants (bell's criteria 2.3 +/- 0.5 vs 1.3 +/- 0.5; p=.005). three of 15 babies who developed nec died, and all nec-related deaths occurred in control infants. conclusion: probiotic supplementation reduced both the incidence and severity of nec in our premature neonatal population.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == yogurts were prepared by using yogurt cultures combined to mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (bifidobacterium animalis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and bifidobacterium longum) and  by adding a preincubation step (1.5 h at 50 degrees c) with bifidobacteria to the conventional method of manufacture in order to produce oligosaccharides. the survival of bifidobacteria was drastically affected during storage of yogurts, except for products containing b. animalis, in which viable counts remained at >10(6) cfu/g after 28 d of storage at 4 degrees c. oligosaccharides with a degree of polymerization of 3 were produced during the preincubation step (0.31 to 0.68%), and the amount in the final products varied according to the species of bifidobacteria inoculated during the preincubation step or the concentration of bifidobacteria used as second inoculum during the fermentation process. in fact,  the higher concentration of oligosaccharides measured at the end of the fermentation process (0.72%) and the 28 d-storage period (0.67%) was obtained for yogurts containing b. infantis. however, yogurts containing b. breve showed higher beta-galactosidase activities and had lower lactose concentrations after the fermentation process and the storage period than the other yogurts. the use of a mixed cultures of bifidobacteria (b. animalis, b. infantis, or b. breve) thus allows the production of yogurts in which bifidobacteria can survive in relatively high cell numbers and contain appreciable amount of oligosaccharides.

TI  == competence without a competence pheromone in a natural isolate of streptococcus infantis.
AB  == many streptococcal species belonging to the mitis and anginosus phylogenetic groups are known to be naturally competent for genetic transformation. induction  of the competent state in these bacteria is regulated by a quorum-sensing mechanism consisting of a secreted peptide pheromone encoded by comc and a two-component regulatory system encoded by comde. here we report that a natural isolate of a mitis group streptococcus (atu-4) is competent for genetic transformation even though it has lost the gene encoding the competence pheromone. in contrast to other strains, induction of competence in atu-4 is not  regulated by cell density, since highly diluted cultures of this strain are still competent. interestingly, competence in the atu-4 strain is lost if the gene encoding the response regulator come is disrupted, demonstrating that this component of the quorum-sensing apparatus is still needed for competence development. these results indicate that mutations in comd or come have resulted  in a gain-of-function phenotype that allows competence without a competence pheromone. a highly similar strain lacking comc was isolated independently from another individual, suggesting that strains with this phenotype are able to survive in nature in competition with wild-type strains.

TI  == effects of probiotic administration upon the composition and enzymatic activity of human fecal microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea.
AB  == in a clinical trial, 10 patients suffering from irritable bowel syndrome or functional diarrhea were administered the probiotic preparation vsl-3. preliminary results indicated that administration of vsl-3 improved the clinical  picture and changed the composition and biochemistry of fecal microbiota. titer variations of intestinal bacterial groups were evaluated by culture and pcr techniques. a significant increase in lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococcus thermophilus was observed as a consequence of probiotic treatment,  while enterococci, coliforms, bacteroides and clostridium perfringens did not change significantly. the strains bifidobacterium infantis y1 and bifidobacterium breve y8, included in vsl-3, were specifically detected in feces of patients treated with the probiotic by using strain-specific pcr primers. in addition, fecal beta-galactosidase increased and urease activities decreased as a result of changes in the intestinal microbiota induced by vsl-3 administration.

TI  == reduction of oxaluria after an oral course of lactic acid bacteria at high concentration.
AB  == background: hyperoxaluria is a major risk factor for renal stones, and in most cases, it appears to be sustained by increased dietary load or increased intestinal absorption. previous studies have shown that components of the endogenous digestive microflora, in particular oxalobacter formigenes, utilize oxalate in the gut, thus limiting its absorption. we tested the hypothesis of whether oxaluria can be reduced by means of reducing intestinal absorption through feeding a mixture of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. methods: six patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis and mild hyperoxaluria (>40 mg/24 h) received daily a mixture containing 8 x 10(11) freeze-dried lactic acid  bacteria (l. acidophilus, l. plantarum, l. brevis, s. thermophilus, b. infantis)  for four weeks. the 24-hour urinary excretion of oxalate was determined at the end of the study period and then one month after ending the treatment. the ability of bacteria to degrade oxalate and grow in oxalate-containing media, and  the gene expression of ox1t, an enzyme that catalyzes the transmembrane exchange  of oxalate, also were investigated. results: the treatment resulted in a great reduction of the 24-hour excretion of oxalate in all six patients enrolled. mean  levels +/- sd were 33.5 +/- 15.9 mg/24 h at the end of the study period and 28.3  +/- 14.6 mg/24 h one month after treatment was interrupted compared with baseline values of 55.5 +/- 19.6 mg/24 h (p < 0.05). the treatment was associated with a strong reduction of the fecal excretion of oxalate in the two patients tested. two bacterial strains among those used for the treatment (l. acidophilus and s. thermophilus) proved in vitro to degrade oxalate effectively, but their growth was somewhat inhibited by oxalate. one strain (b. infantis) showed a quite good degrading activity and grew rapidly in the oxalate-containing medium. l. plantarum and l. brevis showed a modest ability to degrade oxalate even though they grew significantly in oxalate-containing medium. no strain expressed the ox1t gene. conclusions: the urinary excretion of oxalate, a major risk factor for renal stone formation and growth in patients with idiopathic calcium-oxalate urolithiasis, can be greatly reduced with treatment using a high concentration of freeze-dried lactic acid bacteria. we postulate that the biological manipulation  of the endogenous digestive microflora can be a novel approach for the prevention of urinary stone formation.

TI  == thin layer chromatographic determination of organic acids for rapid identification of bifidobacteria at genus level.
AB  == this study presents a simple and fast method for the identification of bifidobacteria using a thin layer chromatographic (tlc) analysis of the short chain fatty acids in a culture broth. when the chromatogram was sprayed with the  indicator solution (methyl red-bromophenol blue in 70% ethanol), lactic acid exhibited two red spots, and acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid all produced blue spots. succinic acid and citric acid produced yellow and dark yellow spot, respectively. in addition, these organic acids showed different r(f) values. the total time taken to analyze the organic acids in the 10 bacterial culture broths using the proposed method was approximately 50 min. the proposed tlc method was used to analyze the organic acids in culture broths of the following strains, five bifidobacterium species. (bifidobacterium longum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. bifidum, and b. adolescentis) and five other lactic acid bacteria strains (lactobacillus casei, l. bulgaricus, l. acidophilus, streptococcus thermophilus, and s. lactis). both spots of lactic acid and acetic  acid were detected on all the tlc plates from the five bifidobacterial culture broths. the five other lactic acid bacterial culture broths, however, only exhibited lactic acid spots. accordingly, the proposed tlc method would appear to be a useful tool for rapid identification of bifidobacterium spp. at the genus level.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  == the proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses.  indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. the consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. the present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified robbins device. exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of bifidobacterium infantis 420 or enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. however, suspensions of lactobacillus fermentum b54, l. rhamnosus 744 or l. lactis cremoris sk11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. suspensions of l. casei shirota and streptococcus thermophilus b significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. the reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of l. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. in conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice  prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == ingestion of yogurt containing lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium to potentiate immunoglobulin a responses to cholera toxin in mice.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria have been reported to have benefits for the prevention and treatment of some forms of diarrhea and related conditions. to determine whether  these effects might involve direct stimulation of the gastrointestinal immune response, we administered yogurt to try to enhance mucosal and systemic antibodies against an orally presented immunogen, cholera toxin. yogurts were manufactured with starter cultures containing different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria. mice were fed these yogurts for 3 wk, during which they were also orally immunized twice with 10 micrograms of cholera toxin. blood was collected on d 0 and 21, and fecal pellets were collected weekly. mice that were  immunized orally with cholera toxin responded by producing specific intestinal and serum immunoglobulin (ig)a anti-cholera toxin. antibody responses of the iga  isotype were significantly increased in mice fed yogurts made with starters containing the conventional yogurt bacteria lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus supplemented with lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium bifidum, and bifidobacterium infantis. yogurt that was manufactured with starters containing only conventional yogurt bacteria produced  less iga anti-cholera toxin than did the control group fed nonfat dry milk. although strong responses were also observed for igg anti-cholera toxin in serum, the responses did not differ among groups. thus, administration of yogurt supplemented with l. acidophilus and bifidobacterium spp. enhanced mucosal and systemic iga responses to the cholera toxin immunogen.

TI  == measurement of antibacterial activities of t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin  a, aflatoxin b1 and fumonisin b1 using microtitration tray-based turbidimetric techniques.
AB  == various mycotoxins were tested for their antibacterial activity by evaluating growth delays using a fully automated microturbidmetric method. ten different strains of the genera escherichia, streptococcus, staphylococcus, yersinia, salmonella, erysipelothrix and lactobacillus were used as test micro-organisms. t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol (don), ochratoxin a (ota), aflatoxin b1 (afb1) and fumonisin b1 (fb1) were used as representative mycotoxins. the inhibitory effect  in vitro was defined as the difference between the growth rate without mycotoxins and the growth rate in the presence of a mycotoxin. among the tested strains, streptococcus agalactiae was found to be sensitive to all the toxins, with the exception of ota. t-2 toxin and fb1 were the most effective in slowing down the growth of staphylococcus aureus. afb1 affected the growth of yersinia enterocolitica. the growth rate of escherichia coli and salmonella infantis was decreased by fb1. among the bacterial strains used in this study, only the growth of erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was inhibited by ota. thus, using appropriate tester strains it should be possible to set up a broad-range microtubidimetry assay for individual mycotoxin screening in vitro. we concluded that the microtitration technique provides a rapid, convenient and high-throughput capacity system to analyse bacteria-mycotoxin interactions.

TI  == effects of tamoxifen, melatonin, coenzyme q10, and l-carnitine supplementation on bacterial growth in the presence of mycotoxins.
AB  == the involvement of toxic oxygen intermediates in the bacteriostatic effects of mycotoxins (t-2 toxin, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin a, aflatoxin b1, and fumonisin  b1) was investigated by producing bacterial growth curves using turbidimetry assays in the presence and absence of oxygen radical-scavenging substances. the strains used in this study included escherichia coli (ft 101), streptococcus agalactiae (ft 311, ft 313, ft 315), staphylococcus aureus (ft 192), yersinia enterocolitica (ft 430), salmonella infantis (ft 431), erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae (ft 432), lactobacillus plantarum (ft234) and lactobacillus casei (ft 232). tamoxifen, melatonin, l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 were used as radical scavengers against oxygen toxicity to the strains studied. tamoxifen was the most effective in inhibiting bacterial growth when used at a high concentration, whereas melatonin and l-carnitine were less effective. a combination of l-carnitine and coenzyme q10 provided better protection against oxygen toxicity caused by the mycotoxins growth than they did individually. it was concluded that oxygen radicals are involved in the killing of bacteria and that there is endogenous formation of toxic oxygen products by mycotoxins. the objective of this study was to determine whether the antioxidants were able to counteract the  toxic effects of the mycotoxins. the data obtained indicate that bacterial growth can be inhibited especially by t-2 toxin, aflatoxin b1 and ochratoxin a and that  this effect can be partially counteracted by antioxidants such as coenzyme q10 plus l-carnitine.

TI  == growth-inhibitory effects of galla rhois-derived tannins on intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the growth-inhibitory activity of galla rhois-derived materials towards 17 intestinal bacteria was evaluated using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active components of galla rhois were characterized as the tannins methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with bacterial strain tested. in the test using 10 mg disc-1, mg and ga produced a clear inhibitory effect on harmful bacteria such as clostridium perfringens, cl. paraputrificum, eubacterium limosum, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. methyl gallate showed no growth-inhibitory activity towards bifidobacterium adolescentis or b. longum whereas the growth of b. bifidum, b. breve, b. infantis, b. animalis, b. thermophilum, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. plantarum and streptococcus faecalis was slightly affected. however, ga did not adversely affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 5 mg disc-1, mg significantly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens and cl. paraputrificum but did not affect the growth of the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. at 1 mg disc-1, mg greatly inhibited the growth of cl. perfringens alone. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of galla rhois.

AB  == this paper introduces the current status of melanoma treatment with various biologic response modifiers (brms) in japan, with an emphasis on the clinical results of interferon therapies. the authors also refer briefly to the current situation of interleukin-2 (il-2) and tumor necrosis factor (tnf) in japan. many  brms have been used in treatment of melanoma, e.g., ifn, il-2, tnfs, bcg, my-1 (dna extracted from bcg), wpg (cws of bifidobacterium infantis, atcc 15697), ok-432 (picibanil, streptococcus pyogenes preparation), bestatin, and forphenicinol. some of these have completed clinical trials, while others are still undergoing clinical testing. among ifn-alpha, beta, and gamma, intralesional administration of natural ifn-beta was found to be more effective than ifn-alpha for metastatic skin melanoma, the survival time of patients being  prolonged by the administration of ifn-beta. ifn-gamma appeared to have lower efficacy than ifn-alpha and beta. the frequency of brm application to melanoma treatment will increase. the authors foresee that combinations with radio- and/or other chemotherapy will be more common than the single use of a brm, especially in the case of ifn.
