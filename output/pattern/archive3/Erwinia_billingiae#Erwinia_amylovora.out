growth inhibition of erwinia amylovora and related erwinia species by neutralized shortchain fatty acids.
short-chain fatty acids (scfas) are used to preserve food and could be a tool for control of fire blight caused by erwinia amylovora on apple, pear and related rosaceous plants. neutralized acids were added to buffered growth media at 0.5-75 mm and tested at phs ranging from 6.8 to 5.5. particularly at low ph, scfas with a chain length exceeding that of acetic acid such as propionic acid were effective growth inhibitors of e. amylovora possibly due to uptake of free acid and its intracellular accumulation. we also observed high inhibition with monochloroacetic acid. an e. billingiae strain was as sensitive to the acids as e. amylovora or e. tasmaniensis. fire blight symptoms on pear slices were reduced when the slices were pretreated with neutralized propionic acid. propionic acid is well water soluble and could be applied in orchards as a control agent for fire blight.
hypersensitive response and acyl-homoserine lactone production of the fire blight antagonists erwinia tasmaniensis and erwinia billingiae.
fire blight caused by the gram-negative bacterium erwinia amylovora can be controlled by antagonistic microorganisms. we characterized epiphytic bacteria isolated from healthy apple and pear trees in australia, named erwinia tasmaniensis, and the epiphytic bacterium erwinia billingiae from england for physiological properties, interaction with plants and interference with growth of e. amylovora. they reduced symptom formation by the fire blight pathogen on immature pears and the colonization of apple flowers. in contrast to e. billingiae, e. tasmaniensis strains induced a hypersensitive response in tobacco leaves and synthesized levan in the presence of sucrose. with consensus primers deduced from lsc as well as hrpl, hrcc and hrcr of the hrp region of e. amylovora and of related bacteria, these genes were successfully amplified from e. tasmaniensis dna and alignment of the encoded proteins to other erwinia species supported a role for environmental fitness of the epiphytic bacterium. unlike e. tasmaniensis, the epiphytic bacterium e. billingiae produced an acyl-homoserine lactone for bacterial cell-to-cell communication. their competition with the growth of e. amylovora may be involved in controlling fire blight.
