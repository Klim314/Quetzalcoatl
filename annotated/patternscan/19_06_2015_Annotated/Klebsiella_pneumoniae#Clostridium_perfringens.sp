TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria grow within candida albicans biofilms and induce biofilm formation in suspension cultures.
AB  == the human microbiome contains diverse microorganisms, which share and compete for the same environmental niches. a major microbial growth form in the human body is the biofilm state, where tightly packed bacterial, archaeal, and fungal cells must cooperate and/or compete for resources in order to survive. we examined mixed biofilms composed of the major fungal species of the gut microbiome, candida albicans, and each of five prevalent bacterial gastrointestinal inhabitants: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis. we observed that biofilms formed by c. albicans provide a hypoxic microenvironment that supports the growth of two anaerobic bacteria, even when cultured in ambient oxic conditions that are normally toxic to the bacteria. we also found that coculture with bacteria in biofilms induces massive gene expression changes in c. albicans, including upregulation of wor1, which encodes a transcription regulator that controls a phenotypic switch in c. albicans, from the "white" cell type to the "opaque" cell type. finally, we observed that in suspension cultures, c. perfringens induces aggregation of c. albicans into "mini-biofilms," which allow c. perfringens cells to survive in a normally toxic environment. this work indicates that bacteria and c. albicans interactions modulate the local chemistry of their environment in multiple ways to create niches favorable to their growth and survival.

TI  == effects of melatonin on oxidative stress, and resistance to bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections: a review.
AB  == melatonin, a hormone secreted by the pineal gland, works directly and indirectly  as a free radical scavenger. its other physiological or pharmacological activities could be dependent or independent of receptors located in different cells, organs, and tissues. in addition to its role in promoting sleep and circadian rhythms regulation, it has important immunomodulatory, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects suggesting that this indole must be considered as a therapeutic alternative against infections. the aim of this review is to describe the effects of melatonin on oxidative stress and the resistance to bacterial (klebsiella pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, mycobacterium tuberculosis, and clostridium perfringens), viral (venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis virus and respiratory syncytial virus), and parasitic (plasmodium spp., entamoeba histolytica, trypanosoma cruzi, toxoplasma gondii, and opisthorchis viverrini) infections.

TI  == gas-forming liver abscess associated with rapid hemolysis in a diabetic patient.
AB  == we experienced a case of liver abscess due to clostridium perfringens (cp) complicated with massive hemolysis and rapid death in an adequately controlled type 2 diabetic patient. the patient died 6 h after his first visit to the hospital. cp was later detected in a blood culture. we searched for case reports  of cp septicemia and found 124 cases. fifty patients survived, and 74 died. of the 30 patients with liver abscess, only 3 cases survived following treatment with emergency surgical drainage. for the early detection of cp infection, detection of gram-positive rods in the blood or drainage fluid is important. spherocytes and ghost cells indicate intravascular hemolysis. the prognosis is very poor once massive hemolysis occurs. the major causative organisms of gas-forming liver abscess in diabetic patients are klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) and escherichia coli (e. coli). although cp is relatively rare, the survival rate is very poor compared with those of k. pneumoniae and e. coli. therefore, for every case that presents with a gas-forming liver abscess, the possibility of cp should be considered, and immediate aspiration of the abscess and gram staining are important.

TI  == ceftazidime-avibactam: a novel cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination.
AB  == avibactam (formerly nxl104, ave1330a) is a synthetic non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the activities of ambler class a and c beta-lactamases and some ambler class d enzymes. this review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry,  mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. although not a beta-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to beta-lactamases. very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. the addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of beta-lactamase enzyme(s). against pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold mic reduction). limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, prevotella spp. and porphyromonas spp.). the pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration  of ceftazidime. the maximum plasma drug concentration (c(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (auc) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. the mean volume of distribution and half-life of  22 l (~0.3 l/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative isolates. the safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has  been reported in three phase i pharmacokinetic studies and two phase ii clinical  studies. ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.in conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus ss-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli. the  exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl), klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs) and/or ampc ss-lactamases. in addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections. finally, the increased activity of ceftazidime-avibactam versus p. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented p. aeruginosa infections.

TI  == postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of cote d'ivoire.
AB  == the distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in cote d'ivoire, and their roles in the food  poisoning were evaluated. microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella, bacillus spores, fungi and clostridium perfringens. the results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5)  to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged,  respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) and 1.3  +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) cfu g(-1). bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, citrobacter freundi, enterobacter amnigenus, citrobacter youngae, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter agglomerans and klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and rhizopus spp., mucor spp., thamnidium spp., fusarium spp., moniliella spp. the fungi. escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens and salmonella spp. were not found. the occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in cote d'ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. significance and impact of study: this study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct haccp system during the production. attieke is especially a well-known product in west africa; hence, it  is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.

TI  == phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  == the volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the croatian endemic plant centaurea ragusina l. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. the chemical compositions, determined by gc and gc-ms, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. nonterpene hydrocarbons were  also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution  assays. they were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/ml. the volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with mic values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/ml against the gram-positive bacteria bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the gram-negative bacteria cronobacter sakazakii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (mic  = 32-128 microg/ml).

TI  == bacteriological and clinical evaluation of twelve cases of post-surgical sepsis of odontogenic tumours at a referral centre.
AB  == objective: to determine the bacterial aetiology of sepsis occurring following surgery of odontogenic tumours and assess the effect of prompt and proper antibiotic usage. design: a prospective study. setting: a tertiary referral centre in lagos, nigeria. subjects: twelve patients with odontogenic tumours that developed sepsis postoperatively. eight of the patients were referred from private hospitals, the remaining were in-patients who sought for alternative medical attention following interruption of health care services at the referral  centre. intervention: adequate review of patient's medical history, bacteriological investigations and antibiotic therapy. main outcome measures: bacteriological and clinical cure following antibiotic therapy based on susceptibility test results. results: two categories of patients were identified; those who completed the course of antibiotics prescribed post-surgery and patients who failed to conform to antibiotic prescription. sepsis developed in the non-compliance group much earlier than in the group that complied (p<0.001).  infections were polybacterial with aerobes accounting for 77.4% (alpha-haemolytic streptococci 29.0%, streptococcus pyogenes 16.1%, staphylococcus aureus 16.1%, diphtheroids 9.7%, klebsiella pneumoniae 6.5%) and anaerobes 22.6% (porphyromonas gingivalis 9.7%, peptostreptococcus spp. 6.5%, prevotella melaninogenica 3.2%, clostridium perfringens 3.2%). mixed aerobic and anaerobic aetiology occurred more in osteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma. clostridium perfringens was isolated from  a case of osteosarcoma with necrotic tissues. the anaerobic bacteria were 100% sensitive to metronidazole, ciprofloxacin and augmentin, 65-85% sensitivity to ampicloxacillin, amoxicillin and erythromycin. over 92% of the streptococci were  sensitive to the beta-lactams contrast low susceptibility with s. aureus and k. pneumoniae. conclusion: interruption of healthcare service was the sole factor identified in the development of sepsis as the patients could not be monitored to ensure compliance to prescription.

TI  == clostridium perfringens enterotoxin in antibiotic-associated diarrhea.
AB  == clostridium perfringens type a is associated with 5-20% cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad) even though clostridium difficile is implicated in the most severe cases. fecal specimens from one hundred hospitalized patients, who developed diarrhea regardless of antibiotic intake and who were negative for c. difficile toxin assay, were investigated for c. perfringens enterotoxin (cpe). simultaneously, cultures were set up for other possible aetiological factors. ten healthy controls were also similarly investigated. cpe was positive in 2/100 (2%) of the patients and the samples were also positive for the organism in culture. other organisms isolated were non-toxigenic c. difficile (4%), staphylococci (6%), candida (18%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (1%). stool samples from healthy controls grew mixed growth of no significance and cpe was negative in all of them. detection of cpe is not part of routine laboratory investigation due to resource implication. criteria for initiating investigations have to be therefore established by understanding the true burden of c. perfringens-associated aad by further research.

TI  == antibiotic-associated diarrhea: candidate organisms other than clostridium difficile.
AB  == background/aims: the direct toxic effects of antibiotics on the intestine can alter digestive functions and cause pathogenic bacterial overgrowth leading to antibiotic-associated diarrhea (aad). clostridium difficile (c. difficile) is widely known to be responsible for 10 approximately 20% of aad cases. however, klebsiella oxytoca, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and candida species might also contribute to aad. methods: we prospectively analyzed the organisms in stool and colon tissue cultures with a c. difficile toxin a assay in patients with aad between may and december 2005. in addition, we performed the c. difficile toxin a assays using an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay technique. patients were enrolled who had diarrhea with more than three stools per day for at least 2 days after the initiation of antibiotic treatment for up to 6 approximately 8 weeks after antibiotic discontinuation. results: among 38 patients (mean age 59 +/- 18 years, m:f =18:20), the organism isolation rates were 28.9% (11/38) for stool culture, 18.4% (7/38) for colon tissue cultures and  13.2% (5/38) for the c. difficile toxin a assay. the overall rate of identification of organisms was 50.0% (19/38). of the five patients that had a positive result by the c. difficile toxin a assay, two had no organism isolated by the stool or colon tissue culture. the organisms isolated from the stool cultures were c difficile (4), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae) (3), candida species (3), and staphylococcus aureus (1). c. difficile (4) and k. pneumoniae (3) were isolated from the colon tissue culture. conclusions: for c. difficile negative aad patients, k. pneumoniae, candida species and staphylococcus aureus were found to be potential causative organisms.

TI  == [epidemiology and treatment of acute prostatitis after prostatic biopsy].
AB  == objective: acute prostatitis is the main complication of prostatic biopsies (pb)  and sometimes requires hospitalisation and appropriate antibiotic therapy. this study evaluated the pathogens responsible and proposes a statistically adapted empirical antibiotic therapy. patients and methods: this retrospective (from 2000 to 2006) two-centre study included 17 patients hospitalised for acute prostatitis after pb in a series of 1,216 biopsies. bacteriological documentation was based on urine cultures, blood cultures, identification of bacteria and antibiotic susceptibility testing. results: all patients received prophylactic antibiotics with a single dose of systemic fluoroquinolone at least 1 h before pb. bacterial  identification was possible in fourteen cases: e. coli (nine cases), proteus mirabilis (one case), klebsiella pneumoniae (one case), enterococcus faecalis (one case), staphylococcus spp (one case), clostridium perfringens (one case). only urine culture was positive in 6 cases (35%), only blood culture was positive in 3 cases (17%), and urine cultures and blood cultures were positive and concordant in 5 cases (29%). a high rate of resistance of e. coli to fluoroquinolones was observed in 88% of cases and to cotrimoxazole in 77% of cases. however, the strain was susceptible to second and third generation cephalosporins (2gc and 3gc) and amikacin in 100% of cases. prostatitis was associated with epididymo-orchitis (3 cases), acute urinary retention (4 cases) and infective endocarditis (1 case). conclusions: identification of the micro-organism responsible for acute prostatitis after biopsy requires a combination of blood cultures and urine cultures. empirical antibiotic therapy is based on the use of 2gc or 3gc, alone or in combination with amikacin depending on the severity of the clinical features.

TI  == prevention of transfusion of platelet components contaminated with low levels of  bacteria: a comparison of bacteria culture and pathogen inactivation methods.
AB  == background: this study compared the efficacy of bacterial detection with inactivation for reducing the risk associated with transfusion of platelet (plt)  components contaminated with low levels of bacteria. study design and methods: twenty-one double-dose plts were spiked with seven species of bacteria at three levels (0.003-0.03, 0.03-0.3, 0.3-3 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml). after split, each plt unit contained 1 to 10, 10 to 100, and 100 to 1000 cfus. one unit was photochemically treated (pct; 150 micromol/l amotosalen and 3 j/cm(2) ultraviolet a). the other unit was untreated. all units were stored and sampled on days 1, 2, and 5 of storage for aerobic and anaerobic culture in the bact/alert system (biomerieux). plts were classified as sterile when no bacterial growth was detected after 120 hours of culture. results: in all pct plts, no bacteria were detected throughout 5 days of storage regardless of species, level of contamination, and sampling time. in untreated plts, staphylococcus aureus was consistently detected by culturing. growth of 1 to 10 cfus per unit staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 to 100 cfus per unit of klebsiella pneumoniae, and  1 to 1000 cfus per unit propionibacterium acnes was delayed and only detectable after 5, 2, and 5 days of storage, respectively. low levels of streptococcus agalactiae (1-10 cfus/unit), escherichia coli (1-100 cfus/unit), and clostridium  perfringens (1-100 cfus/unit) were not detected during 5 days of storage, although bacterial outgrowth was detected at higher levels of contamination. conclusions: for the seven bacterial species examined, contaminated plts may be released for transfusion on test-negative-to-date status. in contrast, bacterial  inactivation by pct could reduce the risk associated with transfusion of plts contaminated with low levels of these bacteria.

TI  == application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  == bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were  tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater  and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == evidence for clostridial implication in necrotizing enterocolitis through bacterial fermentation in a gnotobiotic quail model.
AB  == despite extensive research, the pathogenesis of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis (nec) remains elusive. the aim of our work was to investigate the role of bacterial strains involved in nec in gnotobiotic quails as experimental model. six groups of germ-free quails that were fed a lactose diet were associated with klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, c.  paraputrificum, or c. butyricum (two strains). implantation level, incidence of cecal lesions, production of short-chain fatty acids, and histologic lesions of the cecal wall were investigated. whatever the strain, the implantation level was high (10(9) ufc/g). neither k. pneumoniae nor c. difficile induced any cecal lesions. in contrast, the four other clostridial strains led to cecal nec-like lesions with a variable occurrence: four of 12 quails for c. perfringens, eight of 12 quails for c. paraputrificum, and the same highest value, nine of 12 quails and eight of 10 quails for both c. butyricum strains. gross aspects of the lesions may be linked to the short-chain fatty acid profiles and/or concentrations: thickening of the cecal wall (c. butyricum and c. perfringens) with high proportion of butyric acid, hemorrhages (c. paraputrificum) with high proportion of iso-butyric acid, and presence of other iso-acids. in addition, c.  butyricum was characterized by pneumatosis, linked to a high gas production. microscopic aspects confirmed the presence of edemas and intramucosa hemorrhages. clostridia species, whose role is controversial, seem to be strongly implicated in nec through excessive production of butyric acid as a result of colonic lactose fermentation. these results call for anaerobe detection in feces of infants who have nec.

TI  == evaluation of bact/alert plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  == background: in certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (plt)-rich plasma  plts can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. one prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single  unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [cfus]/ml) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 cfus/ml). this study evaluated the bact/alert (biomerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. study design and methods: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcescens, streptococcus viridans, and propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single plt units (target, 10 and 100 cfus/ml; mean recovered, 5 and 92 cfus/ml) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 ml was plated (10 sets). results: all cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 cfus per ml. with b. cereus (< or =2 cfus/ml), all bottles were reactive. with k. pneumoniae and s. viridans (< or =3 cfus/ml), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. with s. marcescens (< 2 cfus/ml), only 7  of the 10 sets were reactive. with c. perfringens (0.2 cfus/ml), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. conclusions: this study evaluates the use of the bact/alert system for detection of bacteria in plt pools. overall, the bact/alert detected all contaminated pooled plts when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 cfus per ml with 10 different species of bacteria. low recovered concentrations (< or =2 cfus/ml) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

AB  == a test was performed to evaluate the microbial and chemical purification capacity of nine portable, small-scale water purification filter devices with production capacity less than 100 l/h. the devices were tested for simultaneous removal capacity of bacteria (cultured escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae), enteric protozoans (formalin-stored cryptosporidium parvum oocysts), viral markers (f-rna bacteriophages) and microcystins produced by toxic cyanobacterial cultures. in general, the devices tested were able to remove bacterial contaminants by 3.6-6.9 log10 units from raw water. those devices based only on filtration through pores  0.2-0.4 microm or larger failed in viral and chemical purification. only one device, based on reverse osmosis, was capable of removing f-rna phages at concentrations under the detection limit and microcystins by 2.5 log10. the present study emphasised the need for evaluation tests of water purification devices from the public safety and haccp (hazard analysis and critical control point) points of view. simultaneous testing for various pathogenic/indicator microbes and microcystins was shown to be a useful and practical way to obtain essential data on actual purification capacity of commercial small-scale drinking-water filters.

TI  == [search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
AB  == for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a  complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.

TI  == duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  == background: recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. results: it is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. furthermore, the gc3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. conclusions: the results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. the importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.

TI  == comparative genomic analysis of dha regulon and related genes for anaerobic glycerol metabolism in bacteria.
AB  == the dihydroxyacetone (dha) regulon of bacteria encodes genes for the anaerobic metabolism of glycerol. in this work, genomic data are used to analyze and compare the dha regulon and related genes in different organisms in silico with respect to gene organization, sequence similarity, and possible functions. database searches showed that among the organisms, the genomes of which have been sequenced so far, only two, i.e., klebsiella pneumoniae mgh 78578 and clostridium perfringens contain a complete dha regulon bearing all known enzymes. the components and their organization in the dha regulon of these two organisms differ considerably from each other and also from the previously partially sequenced dha regulons in citrobacter freundii, clostridium pasteurianum, and clostridium butyricum. unlike all of the other organisms, genes for the oxidative and reductive pathways of anaerobic glycerol metabolism in c. perfringens are located in two separate organization units on the chromosome. comparisons of deduced protein sequences of genes with similar functions showed that the dha regulon components in k. pneumoniae and c. freundii have high similarities (80-95%) but lower similarities to those of the clostridium species (30-80%). interestingly, the protein sequence similarities among the dha genes of the clostridium species are in many cases even lower than those between the clostridium species and k. pneumoniae or c. freundii, suggesting two different types of dha regulon in the clostridium species studied. the in silico reconstruction and comparison of dha regulons revealed several new genes in the microorganisms studied. in particular, a novel dha kinase that is phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent is identified and experimentally confirmed for k. pneumoniae in addition to the known atp-dependent dha kinase. this finding gives  new insights into the regulation of glycerol metabolism in k. pneumoniae and explains some hitherto not well understood experimental observations.

TI  == ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  == ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (pbp) 2 and 3. ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with mic90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella spp., serratia spp.,  proteus spp., clostridium perfringens, fusobacterium spp. peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic streptococcus spp. ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short pae of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the gram-positive strains but no pae against gram-negative strains. in an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to  ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. in comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. the protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria with the exception of pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. for pathogens with a mic of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated t > mic will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a mic of 1 mg/l 31%. for anaerobic bacteria with mic values between 1-2 mg/l, the t > mic may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. however, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  == specificity of antibodies to bacterial dna in the sera of healthy human subjects  and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
AB  == objective: to elucidate the epitope structure to dna by identifying antigenic determinants on bacterial dna bound by anti-dna antibodies from normal human subjects (nhs) and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). methods: sera from nhs and patients with sle were tested by elisa for the presence of antibodies to single stranded dna from calf thymus, micrococcus lysodeikticus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium perfringens, and klebsiella pneumoniae. to assess binding to conserved and nonconserved determinants, sera were absorbed  on dna-cellulose affinity columns bearing each of the bacterial dna and then tested for binding to the other dna antigens. results: absorption of sle sera with any of the bacterial dna caused a loss of binding to all other bacterial dna as well as calf thymus dna. in contrast, absorption of nhs sera with bacterial dna caused a loss of binding to the dna on the affinity column with much less effect on binding to the other dna antigens. conclusion: these results indicate a marked difference in the specificity of antibodies to bacterial dna in nhs and patients with sle. the binding of sle anti-dna to predominantly conserved determinants suggests that a shift in patterns of anti-dna specificity may be associated with the autoimmune state.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: importance of its stability when used in agar dilution systems.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of meropenem was tested against 426 clinical isolates  representing a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic species. the in vitro activity of meropenem was compared with that of iminpenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and tobramycin against aerobic isolates, and also compared with that of imipenem, metronidazole, cefoxitin, clindamycin and piperacillin against the anaerobic isolates. meropenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) against gram negative aerobes, anaerobes, gram positive anaerobes and most of the gram positive aerobes. the mic90 of meropenem against the enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 0.125 mg/l. meropenem was very active against extended spectrum beta lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae, most acinetobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, clostridium difficile (mic90 of 1.0 mg/l), clostridium perfringens and other clostridium species. even though imipenem exhibited better  activity against the coagulase negative staphylococci, meropenem still had mic's  which were less than the break point (8.0 mg/l). the stability of meropenem in agar was determined indirectly by plotting the geometric mean mic of control strains over a period of two weeks. mean mic of six control strains for meropenem was 0.05 mg/l and remained constant over 10 days, whereas the mean mic of imipenem rose to 0.24 mg/l after two days and to 3.4 mg/l after 10 days. meropenem was therefore far more stable in agar than imipenem. this has implications for laboratories using agar dilution as it requires less frequent plate preparation and decreased labour costs.

TI  == growth inhibition of clostridium difficile by intestinal flora of infant faeces in continuous flow culture.
AB  == growth of clostridium difficile was inhibited more strongly in continuous flow (cf) culture with c. difficile-negative faeces of infants than with c. difficile-positive faeces. culture of faecal flora of infants yielded a greater variety of bacterial species in c. difficile-negative than in c. difficile-positive faeces. in the mixed cf culture of c. difficile with enterococcus avium, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium lentum, c. ramosum, c. perfringens and either escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from c. difficile-negative faeces, inhibition of growth of c. difficile was demonstrated  when the ph of the culture medium was decreased. amino-acid analysis of cf cultures showed considerable utilisation of aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine. a marked increase in concentrations of citrulline and ornithine was found in the culture that inhibited growth of c. difficile. the addition of citrulline and ornithine into a gifu anaerobic medium (gam) broth produced no inhibition of growth of c. difficile. the addition of the mixture of  the depleted amino acids (aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine) to the culture filtrate or adjustment of the ph of the culture filtrate induced considerable growth of c. difficile. these results suggest that  the inhibition of growth of c. difficile may be due to consumption of amino acids by intestinal flora, and not to the presence of inhibitors produced by the intestinal flora.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

AB  == reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni/coli, shigella and salmonella. intestinal infections with klebsiella pneumoniae, clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, cryptosporidium, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia saginata and schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis.  detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. a large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. it is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. the detection of serum antibodies  to y. enterocolitica, y. pseudotuberculosis, c. jejuni/coli, and schistosoma may  suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.

AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

AB  == morphological changes in clostridial isolates after animal passage with other flora in mixed infections were studied by utilizing a subcutaneous abscess model  in mice. we used 26 isolates of 7 clostridial species, and one isolate each of bacteroides fragilis and klebsiella pneumoniae. abscesses were induced by all 7 clostridium perfringens and 3 clostridium butyricum isolates and by some of the other isolates. a thick granular wall prior to animal inoculation was shown only  in c. perfringens, c. butyricum, and c. difficile. this structure was observed in other clostridia only following their animal passage alone or when co-inoculated  with k. pneumoniae or b. fragilis.

TI  == the antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  == to test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a proteus sp., an erysipelothrix sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila and klebsiella pneumoniae. tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal  doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma  concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. the intracutaneous injection of fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to  this effect. the in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low mic; a low mic was sometimes associated with little action and a high mic with moderate action. sixteen organisms were tested. the iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of  e. rhusiopathiae. in only one case, with a strain of proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. on the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and c. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-c streptococcus and one strain each of k. pneumoniae, e. rhusiopathiae and a. hydrophila. it is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate  excess of readily available fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement  of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs  against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs  against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141  was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the  six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.

TI  == the significance of anaerobic bacteria in biliary tract infection after hepatic portoenterostomy for biliary atresia.
AB  == aspiration of the biliary atrium was performed in six children who developed cholangitis after hepatic portoenterostomy (kasai procedure). all aspirates were  cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. aerobic bacteria were recovered in all six specimens and anaerobic organisms were recovered in three. the predominant aerobic organisms were klebsiella pneumoniae (four isolates), enterococcus (three isolates, and escherichia coli (two isolates). the anaerobes  recovered were bacteroides fragilis (two) and clostridium perfringens (one). these findings demonstrate the recovery of anaerobic as well as aerobic organisms in cholangitis after hepatic portoenterostomy.

TI  == cefamandole-erythromycin-heparin peritoneal irrigation: an adjunct to the surgical treatment of diffuse bacterial peritonitis.
AB  == the enthusiasm for the use of peritoneal irrigation has waxed and waned since its introduction by dr. pierce in 1905. the purpose of this study was to devise a relatively low-cost irrigant that could be used for continuous intraperitoneal lavage, with the intent of decreasing abscess formation following surgical treatment for generalized bacterial peritonitis. a solution of 1 l of normal saline containing 50 mg erythromycin, 50 mg cefamandole, 500 u heparin, and 5 meq kcl was proven in in vitro studies to be bactericidal to peptococcus anaerobius and clostridium perfringens, and bacteriostatic to klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus faecalis, and bacteroides fragilis. in a prospective study 50 patients underwent peritoneal lavage with 36  l over 2 days. no lavage patients developed intraabdominal abscesses. in a control group of 44 patients seven patients (15.9%) developed postoperative abscesses.

TI  == histamine-producing bacteria in decomposing skipjack tuna (katsuwonus pelamis).
AB  == spoilage in skipjack tuna (katsuwonus pelamis) was studied under controlled conditions by incubating whole, fresh fish in seawater at 38 degrees c, the optimum temperature for histamine formation. bacterial isolates were obtained from the loin tissue of a decomposing tuna containing 134 mg of histamine per 100 g and a total anaerobic count of 3.5 x 10(5)/g after incubation for 24 h. over 92% of the 134 isolates obtained were facultatively or obligately anaerobic bacteria. eighteen isolates produced histamine in culture media containing histidine, and these were identified as clostridium perfringens, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and vibrio alginolyticus. histidine decarboxylase activity of several isolates was measured in a tuna broth medium and with resting cells suspended in a buffered histidine solution.

TI  == polymicrobial septicemia associated with rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and acute renal failure.
AB  == myoglobinuria and renal failure resulting from bacterial infection have only rarely been reported. to our knowledge, we describe the first reported case of polymicrobial septicemia resulting in rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric renal failure. renal failure secondary to myoglobinuria has an excellent prognosis; in  our patient, recovery was complete. the frequency of rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and renal failure in septicemia is unknown and can only be determined by an increased awareness of this potential complication of septicemia.

TI  == bacteriology of the human biliary tract and the duodenum.
AB  == using the modern anaerobic transport media and meticulous culture techniques, 74  patients undergoing biliary tract surgery were studied. the biliary system was found to be sterile in 58 patients (78%). fifteen patients had 35 isolates of aerobic and facultative bacteria. the most common ones were klebsiella, enterococcus, and escherichia coli. the only anaerobe isolated was clostridium perfringens. eight of 17 patients (47%) with acute cholecystitis and five of 49 patients (10%) with chronic cholecystitis, harbored bacteria in the biliary system. this study suggests that anaerobes are rare in the human biliary system;  therefore, if antibiotic therapy is considered, aerobic coverage should suffice.

TI  == effect of klebsiella pneumoniae enterotoxin on intestinal transport in the rat.
AB  == the effects on intestinal transport of either a semipurified preparation of enterotoxin elaborated by klebsiella pneumoniae or similaryly prepared control material were tested by marker perfusion studies in the small intestine of rats.  at a concentration of 2 mg/ml, the enterotoxin produced net secretion of water, na, and cl in both jejunal and ileal segments; hco3 transport was not affected. net secretion was evident within 30 min after intorduction of the toxin and was maximal after 90 min. the addition of 56 mm glucose to the enterotoxin-containing perfusion fluid resulted in reversal of water and na transport to net absorption  in both intestinal segments. the enterotoxin also produced a significant depression of xylose absorption in both the jejunum and ileum but did not affect  the absorption of either glucose or l-leucine. intestinal structure was not altered after perfusion of the toxin but insillation of approximately one-quarter of the total perfusion dose into a ligated jejunal loop for 18 h produced fluid secretion and structural abnormalities. these observations confirm the fact that  other species of coliform bacteria in addition to tescherichia coli are capable of elaborating an enterotoxin. such species commonly contaminate the small intestine of persons with tropical sprue and it is suggested that chronic exposure of the intestinal mucosa to the enterotoxin elaborated by these bacteria may be a factor in the pathogenesis of intestinal abnormalities in thid disorder.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
