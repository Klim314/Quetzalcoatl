TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

TI  == opposite effect of supernatants from selected periopathogens and oral lactobacilli cultures on atp levels in human gingival fibroblasts.
AB  == studies were performed on the effects of supernatants obtained from bacterial cultures, including cultures of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and lactobacillus acidophilus strains on atp levels in human gingival fibroblasts (hgf-1) and on their viability. atp levels were evaluated using luminescence test and cell viability was estimated using a fluorescence test. in control cultures mean levels of atp in hgf-1 amounted to 4.90+/-0.32 mln rlu. supernatants of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans cultures were found to significantly reduce atp production  in hgf-1 (mean levels of atp amounted to 3.41+/-0.33 and 3.55+/-0.3 mln rlu respectively), which was not accompanied by an increased proportion of dead fibroblasts. supernatants of p. intermedia induced no significant alterations in  atp level in hgf-1. in turn, supernatants of l. acidophilus h2o2 (+) and h2o2 (-) cultures significantly increased atp levels in hgf-1 (the mean levels amounted to 5.94+/-0.31 mln rlu and 5.88+/-0.28 mln rlu respectively). the results indicate that extracellular products of p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans most probably represent mitochondria-targeted peptides, which reduce synthesis of atp  in hgf-1. in turn, extracellular products of l. acidophilus seem to represent exopolysaccharides (eps) with pro-oxidant activity, which stimulate synthesis of  atp in hgf-1.

TI  == the protective effect of recombinant foma-expressing lactobacillus acidophilus against periodontal infection.
AB  == a number of studies have shown that the outer membrane protein foma found in fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrates great potential as an immune target for combating periodontitis. lactobacillus acidophilus is a useful antigen delivery vehicle for mucosal immunisation, and previous studies by our group have shown that l. acidophilus acts as a protective factor in periodontal health. in this study, making use of the immunogenicity of foma and the probiotic properties of l. acidophilus, we constructed a recombinant form of l. acidophilus expressing the foma protein and detected the foma-specific igg in the serum and siga in the  saliva of mice through oral administration with the recombinant strains. when serum containing foma-specific antibodies was incubated with the f. nucleatum in  vitro, the number of porphyromonas gingivalis cells that coaggregated with the f. nucleatum cells was significantly reduced. furthermore, a mouse gum abscess model was successfully generated, and the range of gingival abscesses in the immune mice was relatively limited compared with the control group. the level of il-1beta in the serum and local gum tissues of the immune mice was consistently lower than in the control group. our findings indicated that oral administration  of the recombinant l. acidophilus reduced the risk of periodontal infection with  p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis and lactobacillus acidophilus on secretion of  il1b, il6, and il8 by gingival epithelial cells.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis alters cytokine expression in gingival epithelial cells, stimulating inflammatory responses that may lead to periodontal disease. this study explored the effect of lactobacillus acidophilus on the specific expressions of the interleukins (ils) il1b, il6, and il8 induced by the pathogen. human gingival epithelial cells were co-cultured with p. gingivalis, l. acidophilus, or l. acidophilus + p. gingivalis; the control group consisted of the cells alone. protein and gene expression levels of the ils were detected using elisa and qrt-pcr, respectively. the supernatant from the p. gingivalis group held significantly higher protein and mrna levels of il1b, il6, and il8, compared to the control group. in the mixed bacterial group (l. acidophilus + p.  gingivalis), the levels of all three ils decreased with increasing concentrations of l. acidophilus and were significantly different from the p. gingivalis group.  this suggests that in gingival cells, l. acidophilus offsets the p. gingivalis-induced secretion of these ils in a dose-dependent manner.

TI  == effects of oral administration of lactobacillus acidophilus l-92 on the symptoms  and serum markers of atopic dermatitis in children.
AB  == background: few studies have investigated the complementary effects of long-term  oral administration of lactobacillus acidophilus on traditional medical therapy in the treatment of patients with atopic dermatitis (ad). methods: the atopic dermatitis area and severity index was used to evaluate ad severity. symptom severity was assessed using the symptom score. the effect of medical therapy was  evaluated by adding the medication score, calculated as the sum of each product of the amount of steroid ointment used for therapy and its designated strength graded on a 4-point scale, to the symptom score. the complementary effect of long-term oral administration of l. acidophilus strain l-92 (l-92) as a probiotic or biogenic strain in patients with ad was evaluated using the symptom-medication score, which was calculated as the sum of the symptom score and medication score. both a preliminary casuistic study and a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study were performed to evaluate the effects of l-92 on the symptoms of ad in children. results: orally administered l-92 significantly ameliorated the symptoms of ad in japanese children. l-92 also affected the serum concentrations of thymus and activation-regulated chemokine in a time-dependent manner. conclusions: the results of the preliminary trial and the double-blinded, placebo-controlled study revealed a complementary effect of oral l-92 on the standard medical therapy (topical application of a steroid ointment) in patients with ad that was mediated, at least in part, by alterations in the th1/th2 balance.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == probiotic administration alters the gut flora and attenuates colitis in mice administered dextran sodium sulfate.
AB  == background: probiotics are used in the therapy of inflammatory bowel disease. this study aimed to determine whether prior administration of probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria would prevent disease and change gut flora in an  animal model of colitis. methods: swiss albino mice received a probiotic mixture  (four lactobacillus and four bifidobacterium species) or medium (control) for a week prior to induction of colitis by oral 4% dextran sodium sulfate (dss) for seven days. appropriate non-colitis controls were used. histological damage was assessed (n = 5 per group), as was expression of mrna for tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, interferon (ifn)-gamma, transforming growth factor (tgf)-beta1 and socs-1 in the colonic mucosa (n = 6 per group). secretion of tnf-alpha was measured in distal colon organ culture (n = 5-6 per group). levels of bacteroides, bifidobacterium, and lactobacillus acidophilus in feces were quantified by real time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting 16s rdna. results: compared to untreated dss colitis, probiotic treatment significantly reduced weight loss (p < 0.05), shifted histological damage to lesser grades of severity (p < 0.001), reduced mrna expression of tnf-alpha and tgf-beta1 (p < 0.05), and down-regulated production of tnf-alpha from distal colon explants (p < 0.05). colitis induced a significant reduction in the relative proportions of bifidobacterium, bacteroides and lactobacillus acidophilus group bacteria in feces, and these levels were significantly increased in probiotic-treated mice compared to dss mice (p < 0.001). conclusion: prior administration of probiotic bacteria reduced mucosal inflammation and damage in dss-induced colitis. dss colitis was associated with significant changes in the fecal anaerobic bacterial  flora and these changes were modulated by administration of probiotic bacteria.

TI  == strong antibacterial effect of miswak against oral microorganisms associated with periodontitis and caries.
AB  == background: the chewing stick (miswak) is used for oral hygiene in many parts of  the world. in addition to the mechanical removal of plaque, an antibacterial effect has been postulated; however, tests of miswak extract from salvadora persica (arak) disclosed only low to moderate antibacterial effects. this may be  attributable to the extraction process. our aim was to test in vitro the antibacterial effect of miswak pieces, without extraction, on bacteria implicated in the etiology of periodontitis and caries. methods: miswak pieces were standardized by size and weight (0.07 and 0.14 g) and tested against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, and, as a reference, haemophilus influenzae. the miswak pieces were tested in two ways: embedded in the agar plate or suspended above the agar plate. results: the inhibitory effect was most pronounced on p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and h. influenzae, less on s. mutans, and least on l. acidophilus. suspended miswak had comparable or stronger effects than miswak embedded in agar. the 0.14-g suspended miswak exhibited significantly greater inhibition on a. actinomycetemcomitans and h. influenzae than the 0.14-g miswak embedded in agar (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively). conclusions: miswak embedded in agar or suspended above the agar plate had strong antibacterial effects against all bacteria tested. the antibacterial effect of suspended miswak pieces  suggests the presence of volatile active antibacterial compounds.

TI  == lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of lactobacillus rhamnosus r11 and lactobacillus acidophilus r52 in the human digestive tract and their effects  on the microbiota homeostasis. we designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. a 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed  by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)l. rhamnosus r11 and 1 x 10(8)l. acidophilus r52, and a 12-day wash-out period. the  2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. at the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of l. rhamnosus r11 were detected in faecal samples from all  volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (cfu) equivalents/g of stool. l. acidophilus r52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool. dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and  generally lower levels. no significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) cfu equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the clostridium coccoides, bifidobacterium sp., bacteroides sp. and clostridium leptum groups, respectively.

TI  == supra-gingival microbiota in sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiota of noncaries associated supra-gingival plaque (sgp) microbiology in sjogren's syndrome (ss). stimulated whole saliva (sws) and full-mouth sgp on intact tooth surfaces were collected from 26 primary (p) ss, 27 secondary (s) ss, and 29 control subjects for selective culture of lactobacilli, mutans streptococci, and aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative rods (agnr). predominant cultivable anaerobes from sgp of 11 randomly selected subjects from each group were investigated. clinical and sialometric data were also collected. ss sufferers had significantly lower sws flow rate and higher mean dmft (decayed, missing, filled  teeth), while pss subjects also had lower sws ph and fewer standing teeth. lactobacillus acidophilus levels in sws (p = 0.012) and sgp (p < 0.0001) were significantly elevated in pss sufferers compared with sss individuals and controls. agnr isolation was uncommon. ss sufferers had significantly lower proportion of gram-negative species (p = 0.047). non-oral species were isolated in greater proportions from pss sgp (p = 0.007). subjects with pss harbored increased levels of l. acidophilus and non-oral species, while ss sufferers generally had lower proportions of gram-negative species. the microbial composition of noncaries associated sgp indicates a potential source of increased caries risk in ss.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrate and nitrite on six common oral pathogens in vitro.
AB  == background: salivary nitrate is positively correlated with plasma nitrate and its level is 9 times the plasma level after nitrate loading. nitrate in saliva is known to be reduced to nitrite by oral bacteria. nitrate and nitrite levels in saliva are 3 - 5 times those in serum in physiological conditions respectively in our previous study. the biological functions of high salivary nitrate and nitrite are still not well understood. the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate  the antimicrobial effects of nitrate and nitrite on main oral pathogens under acidic conditions. methods: six common oral pathogens including streptococcus mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646, porphyromonas gingivalis  atcc 33277, capnocytophaga gingivalis atcc 33624, fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953, and candida albicans atcc 10231 were cultured in liquid medium. sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to the medium to final concentrations of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 10 mmol/l. all of the microorganisms were incubated for 24 to 48 hours. the optical densities (od) of cell suspensions were determined and the cultures were transferred to solid nutrient broth medium to observe the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal/fungicidal concentration for the six tested pathogens. results: nitrite at concentrations of 0.5 to 10 mmol/l  had an inhibitory effect on all tested organisms at low ph values. the antimicrobial effect of nitrite increased with the acidity of the medium. streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 was highly sensitive to nitrite at low ph values. lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4646 and candida albicans atcc 10231 were relatively resistant to acidified nitrite. nitrate at the given concentrations and under acidic conditions had no inhibitory effect on the growth of any of the  tested pathogens. conclusion: nitrite, at a concentration equal to that in human  saliva, is both cytocidal and cytostatic to six principal oral pathogens in vitro, whereas nitrate at a similar concentration has no antimicrobial effect on  these organisms.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == enumeration of subgingival species on primary isolation plates using colony lifts.
AB  == this study evaluated the feasibility of using a colony lift method and dna probes to enumerate bacterial species cultured on primary isolation plates. fourteen digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal dna probes representing 12 subgingival species were validated by hybridization with colony lifts prepared from 249 reference strains of 51 species grown on trypticase soy agar plates supplemented  with 5% sheep blood. colonies of reference strains were lifted onto nytran filters from plates and treated to lyse cells, remove cellular proteins, denature and fix microbial dna to the filters. positive reactions were detected with an anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and revealed by bromo-chloro-indolyl phosphate and nitroblue tetrazolium. cross-reactions were not observed for 13/14 probes, but 2 strains of streptococcus mitis reacted with  the probe to streptococcus sanguis ii. subgingival plaque samples were taken by means of a sterile curette from mesiobuccal surfaces of teeth present in each of  26 subjects with differing periodontal disease states. samples were dispersed, diluted, plated and incubated anaerobically for 7 d at 35 degrees c. colonies were lifted as described above. filters were cut into sections and hybridized with the 14 digoxigenin-labeled dna probes. the probes were used to enumerate the test species and the total number of isolates was determined in 711 plaque samples. the colony lift method and dna probes provided a sensitive, economical and quantitative method for enumerating cultivable microbial species in subgingival plaque samples. in addition, the amplification provided by growing the organisms on agar plates facilitated determination of numbers of organisms in small plaque samples, such as those from healthy sites.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == effect of infection with eimeria tenella upon the cecal bacterial population in monoflora chickens.
AB  == monoflora chickens were established at 2 days of age by an oral inoculation with  one of six species of bacteria (lactobacillus acidophilus, bifidobacterium thermophilum, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, or streptococcus faecalis) and were infected with eimeria tenella (5 x 10(4) oocysts per bird) 2 days later. there were two experimental groups for each bacterium: birds infected with bacteria alone and birds infected with a combination of bacteria and e. tenella. seven days after e. tenella infection, counts of b. thermophilum in the cecal contents were significantly lower for e. tenella-infected birds than for those infected by b. thermophilum alone, whereas  10 days after e. tenella infection, counts were higher for e. tennella-infected birds. the population of l. acidophilus in the cecal contents of the e. tenella-infected chickens 10 days after inoculation was significantly greater than that in uninfected chickens. no significant differences were observed between the numbers of b. vulgatus, c. perfringens, and s. faecalis in cecal contents of groups with and without e. tenella infections.
