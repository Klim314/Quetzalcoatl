TI  == [retrospective analysis of fusobacterium associated infections; experience at aomori prefectural hospital with 108 cases from 1995 to 1999].
AB  == we experienced 108 cases of fusobacterium associated infections, including otolaryngeal, oral, pleuropulmonary, intraabdominal, skin and soft tissue infections, at aomori prefectural hospital during the 5 year-period from 1995 to  1999. a total of 433 organisms, included 113 fusobacterium spp. (80 fusobacterium nucleatum, 18 fusobaterium necrophorum, 5 fusobacterium varium, 4 fusobacterium mortiferum, 6 fusobacterium spp.), were recovered with an average of 4.0 organisms per case of the 108 cases, 68% were mixed aerobic and anaerobic and yielded 185 anaerobic bacteria (2.5 per case) and 137 aerobic bacteria (1.9 per case) with an average of 4.4 per case. the remaining 32% were purely anaerobic and yielded 111 organisms with an average of 3.2 per case, prevotella spp., bacteroides fragilis group, streptococcus milleri group, enterobacteriaceae, peptostreptococcus spp. staphylococcus spp. were most frequently coisolated with  fusobacterium spp.

TI  == subgingival microflora associated with nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to examine the composition of subgingival plaque of 140 periodontal lesions in 35 patients with cardiovascular disorders who were administered nifedipine and manifested nifedipine-induced gingival overgrowth (go). age was inversely associated with the go. plaque index and bleeding index showed a significant association with go, while nifedipine dosage and duration of nifedipine therapy were not found to be significant predictors of go. the gingival inflammation as expressed in the logistic regression model by the interaction term color x tone was found to be significantly associated with the go. statistically significant differences between the groups of comparable probing depth and different degrees of go were detected for propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, bacteroides gracilis, fusobacterium mortiferum, fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium and selenomonas sputigena in deep and enlarged lesions. significantly more frequently isolated were the bacterial species eubacterium alactolyticum, campylobacter concisus, c. gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, f. mortiferum, f. nucleatum, and f. varium from the more enlarged lesions (go >3).
