TI  == aci-1 from acidaminococcus fermentans: characterization of the first beta-lactamase in anaerobic cocci.
AB  == acidaminococcus fermentans belongs to the group of strictly anaerobic gram-negative cocci. all previously described acidaminococcus strains are susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. an a. fermentans strain (ryc-mr95) resistant to penicillin and expanded-spectrum cephalosporin (amoxicillin and cefotaxime mics, 64 microgram/ml) was isolated from a human perianal abscess. a fragment encoding a beta-lactamase from genomic dna was cloned in escherichia coli k-12 strain hb101, and the recombinant strain expressed resistance to amoxicillin (mic, 1,024 microgram/ml) and cefotaxime (mic, 4 microgram/ml). clavulanic acid decreased the mics to 8 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively. analysis of the nucleotide sequence revealed a new class a beta-lactamase, aci-1. in accordance with its biochemical properties, we propose to assign aci-1 to functional group 2be. the aci-1 enzyme (estimated pi 4.3) had <50% amino acid identity with any other class a beta-lactamases, the closest being rob-1 from haemophilus influenzae (44%). aci-1 was closer to class a beta-lactamases from some gram-positive organisms (41 to 44% amino acid identity with bacillus beta-lactamases) than to most class a enzymes from gram-negative organisms (tem-1, 24.6%). the aci1 gene had a g+c content of 42.1%, in contrast with 56% g+c content for genomic dna from a. fermentans, thus suggesting that aci1 may have been obtained by horizontal gene transfer.
