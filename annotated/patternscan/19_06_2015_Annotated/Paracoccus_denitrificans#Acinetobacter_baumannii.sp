TI  == molecular determinants for substrate selectivity of omega-transaminases.
AB  == omega-transaminase (omega-ta) is an industrially important enzyme for production  of chiral amines. about 20 (s)-specific omega-tas known to date show remarkably similar substrate selectivity characterized by stringent steric constraint precluding entry of a substituent larger than an ethyl group in the small binding pocket (s) and dual recognition of an aromatic substituent as well as a carboxylate group in the large pocket (l). the strictly defined substrate selectivity of the available omega-tas remains a limiting factor in the production of structurally diverse chiral amines. in this work, we cloned, purified, and characterized three new omega-tas from ochrobactrum anthropi, acinetobacter baumannii, and acetobacter pasteurianus that were identified by a blastp search using the previously studied omega-ta from paracoccus denitrificans. all the new omega-tas exhibited similar substrate specificity, which led us to explore whether the molecular determinants for the substrate specificity are conserved among the omega-tas. to this end, key active site residues were identified by docking simulation using the x-ray structure of the omega-ta from pseudomonas putida. we found that the dual recognition in the l pocket is ascribed to tyr23, phe88*, and tyr152 for hydrophobic interaction and arg414 for recognition of a carboxylate group. in addition, the docking simulation indicates that trp60 and ile262 form the s pocket where the substituent size up to an ethyl group turns out to be sterically allowed. the six key residues were found to be essentially conserved among nine omega-ta sequences, underlying the molecular basis for the high similarity in the substrate selectivity.
