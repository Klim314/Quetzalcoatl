TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == efficient production of 1,3-propanediol from glycerol upon constitutive expression of the 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase gene in engineered klebsiella pneumoniae with elimination of by-product formation.
AB  == in the present study, we developed an efficient method of 1,3-propanediol (1,3-pd) production from glycerol by genetic engineering of klebsiella pneumoniae ak mutant strains. the proposed approach eliminated by-product formation and iptg induction resulted in maximal production of 1,3-pd. a series of recombinant strains was designed to constitutively express the dhab and/or dhat genes, using  the bacteriophage t5 p(de20) promoter and the rho-independent transcription termination signal of the rahnella aquatilis levansucrase gene. among these strains, ak/pcont expressing dhat alone gave the highest yield of 1,3-pd. fed-batch fermentation resulted in efficient production of 1,3-pd from either pure or crude glycerol, without by-product formation.

TI  == expression of genes from rahnella aquatilis that are necessary for mineral phosphate solubilization in escherichia coli.
AB  == rahnella aquatilis is a gram-negative bacterium that can fix atmospheric nitrogen and also has the ability to solubilize mineral phosphate. we have cloned the genes that confer the mineral phosphate solubilizing (mps) trait from this organism by mobilizing a cosmid library of r. aquatilis into escherichia coli hb101. a 7.0-kb ecori fragment from a cosmid, when transferred into e. coli strains hb101 and dh5 alpha, conferred the ability to solubilize hydroxyapatite and the production of gluconic acid to e. coli. the relative amounts of soluble phosphate and gluconic acid produced by the cloned 7.0-kb ecori fragment in e. coli were significantly higher than those of r. aquatilis. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two complete open reading frames (orf1 and orf2) and a partial  orf, orf1 and orf2 encoded proteins of molecular mass 10 kda and 44 kda. the 44-kda protein showed extensive sequence similarity to pqqe of erwinia herbicola, klebsiella pneumoniae and a. acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the 10-kda protein revealed strong similarity to the pqqd of k. pneumoniae and a. calcoaceticus.

TI  == a major outer membrane protein of rahnella aquatilis functions as a porin and root adhesin.
AB  == a 38-kda major outer membrane protein (omp) was isolated from the nitrogen-fixing enterobacterium rahnella aquatilis cf3. this protein exists as a stable trimer in the presence of 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate at temperatures below 60 degrees c. single channel experiments showed that this major omp of r. aquatilis cf3 is able to form pores in the planar lipid membrane. two oligonucleotides encoding the n-terminal portion of the 38-kda omp and c-terminal portion of ompc were used to  amplify the 38-kda gene by pcr. the deduced amino acid sequence showed a strong homology with escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, and serratia marcescens ompc sequences, except loops l6 and l7, which are postulated  to be cell surface exposed. on the basis of the ompf-phoe three-dimensional structure, it seems likely that this 38-kda organizes three 16-strand beta-barrel subunits. the relationship between the structure and the double functionality of  this protein as porin and as a root adhesin is discussed.
