TI  == potential of novel dextran oligosaccharides as prebiotics for obesity management  through in vitro experimentation.
AB  == the energy-salvaging capacity of the gut microbiota from dietary ingredients has  been proposed as a contributing factor for the development of obesity. this knowledge generated interest in the use of non-digestible dietary ingredients such as prebiotics to manipulate host energy homeostasis. in the present study, the in vitro response of obese human faecal microbiota to novel oligosaccharides  was investigated. dextrans of various molecular weights and degrees of branching  were fermented with the faecal microbiota of healthy obese adults in ph-controlled batch cultures. changes in bacterial populations were monitored using fluorescent in situ hybridisation and scfa concentrations were analysed by  hplc. the rate of gas production and total volume of gas produced were also determined. in general, the novel dextrans and inulin increased the counts of bifidobacteria. some of the dextrans were able to alter the composition of the obese human microbiota by increasing the counts of bacteroides-prevotella and decreasing those of faecalibacterium prausnitzii and ruminococcus bromii/r. flavefaciens. considerable increases in scfa concentrations were observed in response to all substrates. gas production rates were similar during the fermentation of all dextrans, but significantly lower than those during the fermentation of inulin. lower total gas production and shorter time to attain maximal gas production were observed during the fermentation of the linear 1 kda  dextran than during the fermentation of the other dextrans. the efficacy of bifidobacteria to ferment dextrans relied on the molecular weight and not on the  degree of branching. in conclusion, there are no differences in the profiles between the obese and lean human faecal fermentations of dextrans.

TI  == molecular diversity of bacteria in yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) from nujiang  region, china.
AB  == the rumen content of four yunnan yellow cattle (bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16s rrna gene sequence analysis. a total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 otu (operational taxonomy unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. similarity analysis revealed that yunnan yellow cattle had 12 sequences (10 otu) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succiniclasticum ruminis, ruminococcus bromii, clostridium proteoclasticum, ruminococcus flavefaciens, pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total otu). the further 12 sequences (9 otu) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, schwartzia succinivorans, prevotella ruminicola, eubacterium ruminantium, ruminococcus albus, and clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of  the total otu). the remaining 105 sequences (90 otu) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total otu). according to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low g+c subdivision (accounting for  72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively) and cfb subdivision (cytophaga-flexibacter-bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and otu, respectively). among the examined clones, rare bacteria jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.

TI  == the species composition of the human intestinal microbiota differs between particle-associated and liquid phase communities.
AB  == many of the substrates available as energy sources for microorganisms in the human colon, including dietary plant fibre and secreted mucin, are insoluble. it  seems likely that such insoluble substrates support a specialized microbiota, and in order to test this hypothesis, faecal samples from four healthy subjects were  fractionated into insoluble (washed particulate) and liquid fractions. analysis of 1252 pcr-amplified 16s rrna sequences revealed a significantly lower percentage of bacteroidetes (p = 0.021) and a significantly higher percentage of  firmicutes (p = 0.029) among bacterial sequences amplified from particle-associated (mean 76.8% firmicutes, 18.5% bacteroidetes) compared with liquid phase (mean 65.8% firmicutes, 28.5% bacteroidetes). within the firmicutes, the most significant association with solid particles was found for relatives of  ruminococcus-related clostridial cluster iv species that include ruminococcus flavefaciens and r. bromii, which together accounted for 12.2% of particle-associated, but only 3.3% of liquid phase, sequences. these findings were strongly supported by microscopy, using group-specific fish probes able to detect these species. this work suggests that the primary colonizers of insoluble substrates found in the gut are restricted to certain specialized groups of bacteria. the abundance of such primary degraders may often be underestimated because of the difficulty in recovering these bacteria and their nucleic acids from the insoluble substrate.

TI  == effects of alternative dietary substrates on competition between human colonic bacteria in an anaerobic fermentor system.
AB  == duplicate anaerobic fermentor systems were used to examine changes in a community of human fecal bacteria supplied with different carbohydrate energy sources. a panel of group-specific fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting 16s rrna sequences revealed that the fermentors supported growth of a greater proportion of bacteroides and a lower proportion of gram-positive anaerobes related to faecalibacterium prausnitzii, ruminococcus flavefaciens-ruminococcus bromii, eubacterium rectale-clostridium coccoides, and eubacterium cylindroides than the proportions in the starting fecal inoculum. nevertheless, certain substrates, such as dahlia inulin, caused a pronounced increase in the number of  bacteria related to r. flavefaciens-r. bromii and e. cylindroides. the ability of three strictly anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria to compete with the complete human fecal flora was tested in the same experiment by using selective plating to enumerate the introduced strains. the roseburia-related strain a2-183(f) was able to grow on all substrates despite the fact that it was unable to utilize complex  carbohydrates in pure culture, and it was assumed that this organism survived by  cross-feeding. in contrast, roseburia intestinalis l1-82(r) and eubacterium sp. strain a2-194(r) survived less well despite the fact that they were able to utilize polysaccharides in pure culture, except that a2-194(r) was stimulated 100-fold by inulin. these results suggest that many low-g+c-content gram-positive obligate anaerobes may be selected against during in vitro incubation, although several groups were stimulated by inulin. thus, considerable caution is necessary when workers attempt to predict the in vivo effects of probiotics and prebiotics  from their effects in vitro.

TI  == pcr detection of ruminococcus spp. in human and animal faecal samples.
AB  == polymerase chain reaction (pcr) procedures for ruminococcus spp. were developed and used for the detection of ruminococcus spp. in human and animal faeces. the pcr specificity was established for ruminococcus albus, r. bromii, r. obeum, r. callidus and r. flavefaciens. the pcr sensitivity ranged from 4 to 100 cells of the pure cultures, depending on the species. ruminococcus albus, r. bromii, r. obeum and r. callidus were detected in human faeces. r. bromii, r. albus and r. obeum were also detected in animal faeces. r. flavefaciens was not detected in most of the samples tested, except for a weak positive in monkey faecal specimens. the pcr appears to be a specific and efficient method for the detection of ruminococcus spp. in faecal specimens.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis by 16s ribosomal dna sequence comparison reveals two unrelated groups of species within the genus ruminococcus.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of the genus ruminococcus based on 16s rdna sequence data showed the genus to be phylogenetically heterogenous. ruminococcus species fall within the radiation of the bacillus/clostridium subphylum of the gram-positive line of descent. two distinct and unrelated clusters are recovered. one group contains r. flavefaciens, r. albus, r. bromii, and r. callidus. the second group  constitutes r. gnavus, r. hansenii, r. lactaris, r. obeum, r. productus and r. torques which together with some clostridium species may constitute a new genus.
