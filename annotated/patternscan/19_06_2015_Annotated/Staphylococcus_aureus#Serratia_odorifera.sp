TI  == pattern of pathogens from surgical wound infections in a nigerian hospital and their antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.
AB  == background: in surgical patients, infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality. a prospective study to find the pattern of microorganisms responsible for post operative wound infections and their antibiotic susceptibility profile was therefore conducted. setting and methods: surgical wards in obafemi awolowo university teaching hospital complex, ile-ife, nigeria.  isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility screening of organisms were done employing standard microbiological techniques. results: bacterial pathogens were isolated from all the specimens while the yeast candida species (spp) was isolated from 12.4%. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent organism isolated accounting for 23 (18.3%) of a total of 126 isolates. other organisms were pseudomonas aeruginosa and bacillus spp 11.1% each; escherichia coli 10.3%; candida spp 8.7%; coagulase negative staphylococci 8.7%; pseudomonas  spp 6.3%; serratia odorifera 4.7%; bacteroides 4.0%; enterococcus spp 3.2%; the remaining isolates were other enterobacteria. sensitivity of the bacterial isolates to antibiotics varied. in general, resistance to the beta-lactam antibiotics was above 98%, whilst more than 70% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin, fusidic acid and tobramycin. conclusions: the infections were polymicrobic and multidrug resistant. the quinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, should be used as frontline drugs in the management of surgical wound  infections at the hospital.

TI  == short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of citrus sinensis.
AB  == antibacterial effect of citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcesnces,  shigella flexneri, enterobacter amnigenus, salmonella typhimurium and serratia odorifera. methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. in vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. it was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of e. coli and k. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of c. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of s. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). the potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. the order of antioxidant activity through abts.+ and dpph free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. it was also found that chloroform/methanol (5:5) and butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. these findings reveal the potential use of c. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.

TI  == ultrasound-guided diagnosis of occult mandibular osteomyelitis.
AB  == background: skin and soft-tissue infections (sstis) are common disease presentations to the emergency department (ed), with the majority of the infections attributed to community-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus. rapid and accurate identification of potentially serious sstis is critical. clinician-performed ultrasonography (cpus) is increasingly common in the ed, and assists in rapid and accurate identification of a variety of disease  processes. case report: a 21-year-old female presented to the ed with chin swelling and "boils." although her visual examination was benign, cpus of her facial swelling quickly established a more concerning disease process, which was  eventually confirmed by aspiration and bone biopsy to be mandibular osteomyelitis. the causative organism, serratia odorifera, is rarely associated with infections, and we are aware of no previously reported cases of osteomyelitis due to this species. why should an emergency physician be aware of  this?: in this case of mandibular osteomyelitis, cpus rapidly and accurately identified abnormal bony cortex of the mandible and an associated fluid collection. cpus of an otherwise benign presentation of a facial infection led to a maxillofacial computed tomography scan, aspiration and biopsy, and then elective debridement of the bone infection. emergency physicians should be aware  of the utility of cpus and the need to carefully investigate sstis presenting to  the ed.

TI  == monitoring and identification of bacteria associated with safety concerns in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a portuguese traditional cheese from raw cow's milk.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the hygienic quality of raw milk used in the  manufacture of sao jorge, a protected denomination of origin portuguese semihard  cheese, as well as to ascertain the sanitary conditions prevailing during its processing. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae and micrococcaceae were accordingly obtained, pertaining to 21 independent batches (including samples of  raw milk, curd, and cheeses after 1, 3, and 4 months of ripening), from 7 dairy farms. standard plate counts (log cfu per milliliter or per gram) ranged from 6.1 to 8.6 in raw milk, whereas they ranged from 7.0 to 8.0 in 4-month-old cheeses. viable counts of enterobacteriaceae ranged between 5.9 and 7.0 in raw milk and between 0.0 and 1.3 in 4-month-old cheeses. species identified within this family encompassed klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sakazakii, and escherichia coli; klebsiella ornithinolytica, klebsiella terrigena, and serratia odorifera were detected only in raw milk. no salmonella whatsoever could be detected in any of the samples. viable counts of micrococcaceae ranged between 4.7 and 5.9 and between 1.3 and 3.3 in raw milk and 4-month-old cheeses, respectively. species identified within this family encompassed staphylococcus sciuri, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus (which was found mainly in ripened cheeses), and staphylococcus aureus (which was not detected in 4-month-old cheeses). accompanying physicochemical analyses included determination of moisture, salt, and ph. statistical analyses revealed a negative correlation between salt content and viable numbers of enterobacteriaceae in cheese, whereas in the case of micrococcaceae, a more negative correlation was found between viable numbers and  moisture content than between viable numbers and ph. the results of our study indicate, in general, poor milk handling conditions in all farms, given that the  indicators total mesophile and enterobacteriaceae counts were high, between 100-  and 1,000-fold those enforced by international standards pertaining to the matrices in question. however, by the time of regular consumption (i.e., after 4  months of ripening), sao jorge cheeses exhibit low levels of contamination by enterobacteriaceae and s. aureus, as well as absence of salmonella.

TI  == aerobic and microaerophilic bacteria isolated from psoroptes cuniculi.
AB  == the bacterial flora of psoroptes cuniculi removed from nine naturally infested rabbits was investigated. mites were collected in sterile glass tubes; half of the mites were surface sterilised, the others were not. all mites were crushed using sterile glass pestles, placed in buffered peptone broth, smeared on to several culture media, by glass rods, and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours, aerobically and/or in 5% co2. representative colonies were removed and streaked on to several selective media. different colour changes of the selective media used, macro and microscopic morphology, ability to grow aerobically, gram staining, and several biochemical tests evaluated with api test strips, were used for bacterial identification. staphylococcus aureus, serratia marcescens and s. odorifera were the bacteria isolated from surface sterilised mites.

TI  == gadolinium-based mr contrast media: potential for growth of microbial contaminants when single vials are used for multiple patients.
AB  == objective: to assess potential risk if single-dose vials of gadolinium-based contrast media are used for multiple patients. the use of multidose vials can pose a significant risk if contaminants are accidentally introduced into the vials and proliferate. therefore, we tested the ability of gadolinium-based contrast to support the growth of a variety of microbial pathogens. materials and methods: we collected the unused portions of 15 single-use vials of gadolinium-based contrast media. the residual contrast material was refrigerated  after use and checked for sterility prior to inoculation with a selection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast. contrast material was incubated at room temperature and at 4 degrees c, and quantitative cultures were  performed at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hr and at 7 days. results: no microbial growth occurred from cultures of the used contrast solutions prior to inoculation. none  of the organisms tested in our study proliferated in the contrast material. all test organisms persisted at least 48 hr after inoculation at both temperatures. at 7 days, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, and corynebacterium  jeikeium were recovered in significant quantities. colony counts of serratia odorifera rapidly decreased at room temperature but persisted beyond 7 days at 4  degrees c. conclusion: the risk of contaminating vials of contrast agents punctured aseptically is small. our study demonstrates a lack of proliferation of organisms in the two gadolinium-based compounds tested, suggesting that these solutions could be used for more than one procedure.
