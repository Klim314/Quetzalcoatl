TI  == evaluation of a hydrophobic gel adhering to the gingiva in comparison with a standard water-soluble 1% chlorhexidine gel after scaling and root planing in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis. a randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic activity of a hydrophobic chlorhexidine-based gingiva-adhering gel containing herbal ingredients, compared with a commercially available 1% chlorhexidine water-soluble gel, during non-surgical therapy of moderate chronic periodontitis. methods: a total of 34 subjects participated in this 6-month blinded randomized parallel controlled trial (isrctn35210084). after scaling and root planing (srp), test group received the gel, by rubbing on the gingiva, once every second day, for 14 days. the control group received the control gel twice daily. clinical parameters considered were the approximal plaque index, simplified oral hygiene index, modified gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level (primary outcome), assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months, together with the frequency of detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola (t.d.), tannerella forsythia (t.f.), and activity of neutrophil elastase and myeloperoxidase (secondary outcomes). results: at 3 and 6 months, all clinical parameters improved significantly, without significant intergroup differences, except ohi-s, which improved at 3 months (p < 0.05). microbiological data resulted in no significant intergroup differences at baseline and 6 months. at 3 months, significant differences for p.g., t.f. and t.d. were noted. a significant reduction of neutrophil elastase after 3 and 6 months was observed (p < 0.005), without significant intergroup differences. for  myeloperoxidase, significant reductions were noted in both groups (p < 0.005 and  p < 0.05), but no significant intergroup differences. the tested product seemed to have an increased efficacy, due to longer persistence on the gingiva, with reduced application frequency. conclusions: both products had a relatively similar influence on the clinical, microbiological and enzymatic outcomes at 3 and 6 months after srp.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == periodontitis associated with plasminogen deficiency: a case report.
AB  == background: plasminogen deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease, which is associated with aggressive periodontitis and gingival enlargement. previously  described treatments of plasminogen deficiency associated periodontitis have shown limited success. this is the first case report indicating a successful therapy approach consisting of a non-surgical supra- and subgingival debridement  in combination with an adjunctive systemic antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal regimen over an observation period of 4 years. case presentation: the intraoral examination of a 17-year-old turkish female with severe plasminogen deficiency revealed generalized increased pocket probing depths ranging from 6 to 9 mm, bleeding on probing over 30%, generalized tooth mobility, and gingival hyperplasia. alveolar bone loss ranged from 30% to 50%. clinical attachment loss corresponded to pocket probing depths. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and eikenella corrodens have been detected by realtime polymerase chain reaction. periodontal treatment consisted of full mouth disinfection and adjunctive systemic administration of amoxicillin (500 mg tid) and metronidazole (400 mg tid). a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen every three month in terms of supra- and subgingival debridement was rendered. the reported therapy has significantly improved periodontal health and arrested disease progression. intraoral examination at the end of the observation period 3.5 years after non-surgical periodontal therapy showed generalized decreased pocket probing depths ranging from 1 to 6 mm, bleeding on probing lower 30%, and  tooth mobility class i and ii. furthermore, microbiological analysis shows the absence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola after therapy. conclusion: adjunctive antibiotic treatment may alter the oral microbiome and thus, the inflammatory response of periodontal disease associated to plasminogen deficiency and diminishes the risk of pseudomembrane formation and progressive attachment loss. this case report indicates that patients with plasminogen deficiency may benefit from non-surgical periodontal treatment in combination with an adjunctive antibiotic therapy and a strict supportive periodontal therapy regimen.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == recovery of putative periodontal pathogens from curette sampling at different depths of periodontal lesions: an in vivo cross-sectional clinical study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the depth of curette sample collection from periodontal lesions on the recovery of putative periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). methods: twenty-two periodontal pockets 6 to 8 mm deep with bleeding on probing at a single-rooted tooth were sampled, yielding 66 separate samples. curette samples were obtained at three different levels of the periodontal lesion (orifice, shallow--2 mm into the pocket; or base of lesion), and processed using pcr to identify 10 periodontal pathogens. the chi-square procedure was used to determine whether probe depth affected the distribution of bacterial counts observed. a repeated measures analysis of variance tested the hypotheses related to level of  probe and microorganism on mean rank of bacterial counts. results: the effect of  probe level on mean bacterial counts depends on the type of microorganism. likewise, the effect of microorganism type on mean bacterial counts significantly depends on probe level, where sampling from 2 mm into the periodontal pocket was  found to yield significantly higher results than sampling from the orifice. overall mean counts of pathogenic microorganisms were found to differ significantly across the three probe depths. the microorganisms differed in their observed levels over all three probe levels. further analysis found several significant differences that characterize the nature of the interaction between probe level and microorganism type. conclusion: there is significant difference in the amount of putative periodontal pathogens at varying depths of the pocket when sampled with a periodontal curette.

TI  == short-term effect of removal of fixed orthodontic appliances on gingival health and subgingival microbiota: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of this prospective longitudinal study was to assess  and compare the microbiological and clinical parameters of patients wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance, as opposed to 10 days after the bracket had been removed following treatment. materials and methods. in total, 122 patients participated in this study; 61 of the subjects were assessed at baseline (wearing a fixed orthodontic appliance: t1) and 10 days after bracket removal (t2). the other 61 individuals had never worn an orthodontic appliance before and these subjects served as controls (ct). subgingival plaque samples were assessed for bleeding on probing (gbi) and plaque index (vpi). pcr of 16s rdna, followed by reverse species-specific hybridization for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were performed. a descriptive analysis was conducted; chi-squared, student's matched and unmatched t-tests, the point biserial correlation coefficient and the mcnemar test were used to test for differences between groups (p < 0.05). results. the gbi and vpi clinical parameters showed statistical differences (p < 0.05) between t1-t2, t1-ct and t2-ct. the prevalence of t. denticola had significantly decreased (p = 0.039) 10 days after appliance removal. at t2, a significant positive correlation was found between gbi and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.01) and between clinical parameters and p. intermedia. in patients without a fixed orthodontic appliance (t2 and ct), there  was a significant positive correlation between t. forsythia and vpi. conclusion.  local factors associated with the wearing of a fixed orthodontic appliance influence changes in subgingival plaque that leads to more inflammation and bleeding.

TI  == microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  == nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. the aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. all the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (control). all the interventions had a duration of 30 days. the dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. the supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). the total genome counts  from the control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). after 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and porphyromonas gingivalis. other major periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella nigrescens, and parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels.  the toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts  in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbial leakage at the implant/abutment connection due to implant insertion maneuvers: cross-sectional study 5 years post loading in healthy patients.
AB  == abstract the aim of this study was to test if stress on the prosthetic connection during insertion maneuvers can induce micro-warping at the implant-connection. from sept 2011 to july 20134, patients with implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were selected from all those that had received dental implant therapy in the past and coming to routine check-up or spontaneous visits during the study period. patients having implants loaded at least 5 years that were placed with two different insertion implant mounters - mp (conventional) and me (mountless) - were recruited. samples were obtained from inside the connection and the abutment surface (cias) using absorbent sterile paper tips. qrt-pcr was performed for total bacterial counts and loads of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), peptostreptococcus micros (pm), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), campylobacter rectus (cr), eikenella corrodens (ec), and candida albicans (ca). the anova test  was used to test for differences. nine patients (20 implants, mp group) and 5 patients (10 implants, me group) were included. regarding the red complex, tf was seen in 80% and 30% of mp and me implants respectively (p<0.001). significant differences were also found in microbial load. for td, proportions were 45% vs. 10% (p=0.022) with no significant differences at load levels. regarding the orange complex, higher prevalence values were found in mp implants, although differences were non-significant. microbial load levels for orange complex bacteria were higher for mp than me, being these differences statistically significant for fn (4.94 vs 3.09; p=0.001). finally, ec was only detected in the  mp group, and ca and aa were not found in either group. within its limitation (small sample size, retrospective analysis, indirect measurement method), the present study suggest that aa mounter not impacting on the prosthetic connection  should be used to reduce microbial contamination of implants.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

TI  == oral bacterial dna findings in pericardial fluid.
AB  == background: we recently reported that large amounts of oral bacterial dna can be  found in thrombus aspirates of myocardial infarction patients. some case reports  describe bacterial findings in pericardial fluid, mostly done with conventional culturing and a few with pcr; in purulent pericarditis, nevertheless, bacterial pcr has not been used as a diagnostic method before. objective: to find out whether bacterial dna can be measured in the pericardial fluid and if it correlates with pathologic-anatomic findings linked to cardiovascular diseases. methods: twenty-two pericardial aspirates were collected aseptically prior to forensic autopsy at tampere university hospital during 2009-2010. of the autopsies, 10 (45.5%) were free of coronary artery disease (cad), 7 (31.8%) had mild and 5 (22.7%) had severe cad. bacterial dna amounts were determined using real-time quantitative pcr with specific primers and probes for all bacterial strains associated with endodontic disease (streptococcus mitis group, streptococcus anginosus group, staphylococcus aureus/staphylococcus epidermidis,  prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra) and periodontal disease (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatus, and dialister pneumosintes). results: of 22 cases, 14 (63.6%) were positive for endodontic and 8 (36.4%) for periodontal-disease-associated bacteria. only one case was positive for bacterial culturing. there was a statistically significant association between the relative amount of bacterial dna in the pericardial fluid and the severity of cad (p=0.035). conclusions: oral bacterial dna was detectable in pericardial fluid and an association between the severity of cad and the total amount of bacterial  dna in pericardial fluid was found, suggesting that this kind of measurement might be useful for clinical purposes.

TI  == periodontal and peri-implant microbiota in patients with healthy and inflamed periodontal and peri-implant tissues.
AB  == objective: to compare the prevalence and levels of six bacterial pathogens within the subgingival/submucosal microbiota at teeth versus implants with various clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty-two chinese were included. four subgingival/submucosal sites were selected for microbiological sampling within each subject, that is, (1) healthy peri-implant tissues; (2) peri-implantitis [ppd >/= 5 mm, presence of bleeding on probing (bop) and confirmed radiographic bone loss]; (3) healthy gingiva; and (4) periodontitis (ppd >/=4 mm). subgingival/submucosal plaque was sampled using paper points. quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-pcr) was used to quantify six pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), treponema denticola (t.d.), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), and staphylococcus aureus (s.a.). counts were log10-transformed. results: the most commonly detected species were s. a. and f.  n., while a. a. and. p. i. had the lowest detection frequency. the detection frequencies of diseased tooth or implant sites for each of the six target species were either equal to or higher than the respective frequencies at the corresponding healthy sites. there were no statistically significant differences  for any of the species or clinical sites (p > 0.05, cochran's q test). no statistically significant differences in the bacterial loads were found among the four clinical sites; with the exception of f. nucleatum. this was more abundant in periodontitis sites (p = 0.023, friedman's 2-way anova). both periodontal and  peri-implant sites, irrespective of their health status, were revealed to harbor  s. aureus cells. the log10-transformed loads of s. aureus were approximately 3.5  within each of the clinical sites (p = 0.232). this was the highest of the six species analyzed. conclusions: within the same subjects, putative periodontal pathogens were common to both periodontal and peri-implant sites irrespective of  health status. the prevalence and levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were significantly associated with periodontitis, but not with peri-implantitis. a. actinomycetemcomitans was associated with both disease conditions, periodontitis  and peri-implantitis, but not with either gingival or mucosal health.

TI  == association between maternal periodontitis and preterm and/or low birth weight infants in normal pregnancies.
AB  == abstract objective: to relate the periodontal condition with the presence of periodontal bacteria in pregnant that had babies with preterm delivery or/and low weight at birth (ptlbw). methods: we recruited 134 pregnant women without systemic diseases attending at the gynaecology and obstetrics room, from maternal provincial hospital, cordoba, argentine. pregnant were grouped according to the international classification for a system of periodontal disease. a sample from periodontal pocket was extracted to identify porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf) prevotella intermedia (pi) and agreggatibacter actinomycemcomitans (aa). results: we identified 7 (5%) cases of children born underweight or preterm of mothers diagnosed with gingivitis, 6 (4%) in mild periodontitis and 4 (3%) in moderate periodontitis. we estimated that when pi and/or aa were not detected in the periodontal pockets of mothers, the infants had more than 129% chance of having normal birth weights (or 3.47 for pi and or and 2.29 for aa). the average age of the mothers who has ptlbw was 21 +/- 3.5. the age showed an association with ptlbw (p < 0.0008). conclusions: the  presences of periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets from pregnant with different periodontal status would associate with ptlbw infants when the mothers  are young, and the normal term and normal birth weight infant are associated with the absence of periodonto bacteria like pi and aa.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

AB  == background and objective: short chain fatty acids (scfas) play important roles in periodontal diseases. however, the concentrations of scfas in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with aggressive periodontitis are not known. the aim of this intervention study was to investigate the influences of non-surgical periodontal  therapy on levels of scfas in the gingival crevicular fluid of patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (g-agp), and analyze the concentrations of scfas in sites with or without the detected putative periodontal pathogens. material and methods: eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected on filter paper strips from patients with g-agp (n = 20; mean age  24.5 years), before and at 2 wk, 2, 4 and 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal treatment. eighty gingival crevicular fluid samples (four per subject) were collected from periodontally healthy controls (n = 20; mean age 26.2 years). concentrations of formic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and isovaleric acid from the supernatant of gingival crevicular fluid samples were measured by high performance capillary electrophoresis. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and fusobacterium nucleatum from the precipitate of the same pretreatment samples of gingival crevicular fluids were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification. results: the clinical parameters of patients with g-agp during the 6 mo after non-surgical periodontal  treatment were improved remarkably. the formic acid concentration increased significantly after treatment; the level of formic acid was lower in the p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with the negative sites. the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid reduced significantly after treatment and reached the lowest level at 2 wk post-treatment, although showed a tendency to increase after 2 mo post-treatment, and the three scfa levels were significantly higher in p. gingivalis-, t. denticola-, p. intermedia- or f. nucleatum-positive sites compared with those in the negative sites. conclusion: non-surgical periodontal treatment resulted in a significant decrease of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid levels and increase of formic acid level in gingival crevicular fluids in patients with g-agp, accompanied by improvement in clinical parameters. a marked lower level of formic acid, as well as higher levels of acetic acid, propionic acid and butyric acid in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with g-agp was consistent with periodontal pathogen infection.

TI  == general immune status and oral microbiology in patients with different forms of periodontitis and healthy control subjects.
AB  == objective: immunological processes in the etiopathogenesis of periodontitis, especially the aggressive form, are not well understood. this study examined clinical as well as systemic immunological and local microbiological features in  healthy controls and patients with different forms of periodontitis. materials and methods: 14 healthy subjects, 15 patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis, and 11 patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited. periodontal examination was performed and peripheral blood was collected from each patient. lymphocyte populations as well as the release of cytokines by t-helper cells were determined by flow cytometry and enzyme linked immunosorbent  spot assay. subgingival plaque samples were taken from each individual and immediately cultivated for microbiological examination. results: when stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) with lipopolysaccharide, a higher il-1beta release was found in patients with moderate chronic periodontitis compared to the other groups (p<0.01). numbers of b-cells, naive and transitional b-cells, memory b-cells, and switched memory b-cells were within the reference range for all groups, but patients with chronic periodontitis showed the highest  percentage of memory b-cells without class switch (p = 0.01). the subgingival plaque differed quantitatively as well as qualitatively with a higher number of gram-negative anaerobic species in periodontitis patients. prevotella denticola was found more often in patients with aggressive periodontitis (p<0.001) but did  not show an association to any of the systemic immunological findings. porphyromonas gingivalis, which was only found in patients with moderate chronic  periodontitis, seems to be associated with an activation of the systemic immune response. conclusion: differences between aggressive periodontitis and moderate chronic periodontitis are evident, which raises the question of an inadequate balance between systemic immune response and bacterial infection in aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction as a prospect for the early diagnosis and prediction of periodontal diseases in adolescents.
AB  == aim: this study was to determine the markers representative of pathogenic periodontal microflora [prevotella intermedia (p.i), tannerella forsythia (t.f) [bacteroides forsythus], treponema denticola (t.d), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g)] in the dental plaque of adolescents with various degrees of severity of periodontium inflammation. methods: forty-patients aged 15-16 years of age were examined using pma, cpi and  green-vermillion indices (muller 2001). the hygiene status of each patient was also determined using durr dental's vista proof intraoral camera (germany). the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed using a biometra thermocycler to detect dna of pathogenic periodontal bacteria in dental plaque. results: all marker microorganisms (p.i. + t.f. + t.d. + a.a. + p.g.) were identified in patients diagnosed with periodontitis in dental plaque. a direct correlation between the level of oral hygiene and the severity of the pathological process in it was determined. it was found that the increase in the severity of the disease  was accompanied by increased pathogenic periodontal microflora in dental plaque.  conclusion: identification of periodontal pathogens in dental plaque by pcr greatly enhances the early diagnosis of cronic cattaral gingivitis (ccg) risk factors in adolescents, and allows for detailed analysis of the relation between  each factor and severity of the process. this method may be used for the diagnosis of periodontal diseases, prediction of their future course, and reasonable choice of antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in human carotid atherothrombosis as a potential trigger for neutrophil activation.
AB  == objective: epidemiological, biological and clinical links between periodontal and cardiovascular diseases are now well established. several human studies have detected bacterial dna corresponding to periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular samples. intraplaque hemorrhage has been associated with a higher risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, potentially mediated by neutrophil activation. in this study, we hypothesized that plaque composition may be related to periodontal pathogens. methods: carotid culprit plaque samples were collected from 157 patients. macroscopic characterization was performed at the time of collection: presence of blood, lipid core, calcification and fibrosis. markers of neutrophil  activation released by carotid samples were quantified (myeloperoxidase or mpo, cell-free dna and dna-mpo complexes). pcr analysis using specific primers for porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcommitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia was used to detect dna  from periodontal pathogens in carotid tissues. in addition, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lps) and immunoglobulins g against t. forsythia were quantified in atherosclerotic carotid conditioned medium. results: intraplaque hemorrhage was present in 73/157 carotid samples and was associated with neutrophil activation, reflected by the release of mpo, cell-free dna and mpo-dna complexes. lps levels were also linked to intraplaque hemorrhage but not with the neutrophil activation markers. seventy-three percent of the carotid samples were  positive for periodontal bacterial dna. furthermore, hemoglobin levels were associated with the detection of t. forsythia and neutrophil activation/inflammation markers. conclusion: this study suggests a potential role of periodontal microorganisms, especially t. forsythia, in neutrophil activation  within hemorrhagic atherosclerotic carotid plaques.

TI  == age-dependent changes in porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella species/phylotypes in healthy gingiva and inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites.
AB  == objectives: early colonisation of oral surfaces by periodontal pathogens presents a significant risk factor for subsequent development of destructive disease affecting tissues that support the dentition. the aims of the present study were  to establish the age-dependent relationship between sub-gingival profiles of 22 prevotella species/phylotypes in children, adolescents and adults from an isolated aboriginal community and, further, to use this information to identify prevotella species that could serve as microbial risk indicators. materials and methods: dna isolated from sub-gingival plaque samples (three healthy sites and three inflamed/diseased sites) from adults, adolescents and children was screened for porphyromonas gingivalis load and 22 prevotella species/phylotypes by species-specific pcr. results: a noticeable feature in adolescents was the marked increase in colonisation by p. gingivalis across all test sites. the mean number  of prevotella species/phylotypes colonising inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites  increased with age. progressive partitioning of selected prevotella species/phylotypes to healthy or inflamed/diseased sites was evident. prevalence  of prevotella intermedia, prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 and prevotella oris increased significantly with age in diseased sites. similarly, significant age-dependent increase in colonisation of healthy as well as inflamed/diseased sub-gingival sites was apparent for prevotella oralis, prevotella multiformis, prevotella denticola, prevotella strain p4p_53 and prevotella oral clone br014. conclusion: early colonisation of children by p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and prevotella oral clone p4pb_24 provides indication of risk for subsequent development of periodontal disease. clinical relevance: in the present study, the complexity of prevotella species within gingival sites is explored as a basis for evaluating contribution of prevotella species to disease.

TI  == periodontopathogens and human beta-defensin-2 expression in gingival crevicular fluid from patients with periodontal disease in guangxi, china.
AB  == background and objective: periodontal diseases are often induced by periodontopathogens, which are always exposed to certain innate immune factors in gingival crevicular fluid, including human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2). this study aims to investigate the relationship among periodontopathogens, clinical parameters and hbd-2 expression. material and methods: thirty-two healthy controls, 42 patients with chronic gingivitis and 95 patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited in guangxi, china. bleeding index, probing depth and clinical attachment level were measured for all teeth including mesiobuccal, buccal, disobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual, disolingual six sites of all patient.  gingival crevicular fluid samples were collected from the study sites. the prevalence and copy numbers (cn) of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia and total bacteria in gingival crevicular fluid were quantified by real-time pcr. the hbd-2 concentration in gingival crevicular fluid was measured  by elisa. results: both the prevalence and the cn of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and t. forsythia were higher in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls and patients with chronic gingivitis; however, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of p. intermedia among the three study groups, and the highest cn was found in patients with chronic gingivitis, rather than in patients with chronic periodontitis. the loads of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. denticola and total bacteria were positively  related to probing depth, bleeding index and clinical attachment level. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid was higher in patients with chronic gingivitis and in patients with chronic periodontitis than in healthy controls. in addition, the hbd-2 concentration was positively related to the cn of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and total bacteria, as well as to bleeding index and probing depth. conclusion: the prevalence, composition and cn of periodontopathogens were closely related to the severity of periodontal disease,  and the red complex was related to the severity of clinical symptoms of periodontal diseases. the concentration of hbd-2 in gingival crevicular fluid from periodontal disease sites was higher than that in gingival crevicular fluid  from healthy sites, which suggests that hbd-2 expression might be up-regulated by periodontopathogens.

TI  == bioinformatic investigation of the cost management strategies of five oral microbes.
AB  == some amino acids are more energetically costly to synthesize de novo, therefore many microbes have evolved to regulate the metabolic expenditure of the cell and  reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. several oral bacterial species take up amino acids and peptides obtained from proteolysis of host proteins and hence do not rely only on de novo synthesis. the aim of this study was to investigate if five oral bacterial species implement cost management strategies to reduce the energy burden of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. since the relative de novo amino acid synthesis costs are proportional to the masses of the amino acids, the energy costs of producing proteins were assessed by calculating the mean amino acid mass for each protein. for porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia and  streptococcus sanguinis, the outer membrane/extracellular proteins are made up of a much larger percentage of lower average mass amino acids whereas cytoplasmic proteins are made up of a larger proportion of higher average mass amino acid residues. these results are consistent with the five oral bacterial species employing energy-saving mechanisms in the production of extracellular unrecyclable proteins. interestingly, the p. gingivalis and s. sanguinis genomes  exhibited significantly lower predicted mean amino acid masses compared with those of the genomes of the other three species, suggesting that this may provide them with an energy advantage with respect to protein biosynthetic cost.

TI  == rare case of generalised aggressive periodontitis in the primary dentition.
AB  == background: generalised aggressive periodontitis (ap) in the prepubescent age is  an exceptionally rare disease in the primary dentition of otherwise healthy children. characteristics of ap are gingival inflammation, deep periodontal pockets, bone loss, tooth mobility and even tooth loss. the most common way of treating this disease is the extraction of all the involved primary teeth. case report: a 4-year-old girl presented with signs of severe gingival inflammation. clinical examination revealed deep pockets, increased tooth mobility and bone loss. microbiological testing revealed the presence of a typical periopathogenic  flora consisting of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and the typical members of the red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola). the patient underwent tooth extraction of all primary teeth except the primary canines, followed by thorough root debridement and treatment with systemic antibiotics (amoxicillin plus metronidazole). follow-up: regular clinical and microbiological examinations over 4 years showed no signs of recurrence of a periodontitis, even in the erupted permanent teeth. conclusion: early diagnosis and consequent early treatment of aggressive periodontitis can stop the disease and therefore avoid the development of a periodontal disease in  the permanent dentition. a close collaboration between specialists of different disciplines is required for a favourable outcome.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

AB  == aim: to assess the presence of periodontal and opportunistic organisms in patients with peri-implantitis. material and methods: thirty-three partially edentulous subjects (22 women, 11 men), aged 32-90 years, who had one or more implants with peri-implantitis were included. peri-implantitis was defined as: (i) the presence of bleeding on probing and/or suppuration and (ii) radiographic  images showed marginal bone loss >1.8 mm after 1 year in function. criteria for inclusion were: (i) partially edentulous patients having at least one implant diagnosed with peri-implantitis; (ii) no antibiotic therapy for 6 months prior to clinical examination. following this definition, a total of 48 implants were diagnosed with peri-implantitis. subgingival bacterial samples were obtained with sterile paper points from infected implants and selected teeth of each individual. periodontopathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola) were detected by multiplex pcr targeting 16s rdna. samples were placed in reduced transport medium and cultured for opportunistic pathogens  (staphylococcus aureus, enteric bacteria, pseudomonas and yeasts). results: twenty-two patients yielded positive results for p. gingivalis, 25 for t. forsythia, eight for p. intermedia and 13 for t. denticola. none of the patients  yielded a positive result for a. actinomycetemcomitans. non-periodontal species were found in five patients (15% of total). p. aeruginosa was found in four (12%) patients, and c. albicans (3%) and s. aureus in one patient (3%) each. in two cases of peri-implantitis, none of the periodontal or opportunistic microorganisms studied were detected in either implant or tooth samples. when results of the periodontopathic bacteria from the implant and tooth samples of the same patient were compared, 18 patients (54%) showed the same results for both samples and 15 (45%) patients different results. conclusions: the implant surface may be colonized with pathogens different from periodontal bacteria. opportunistic pathogens such as p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and c. albicans may be associated with implant failure.

TI  == microbiological assessment of the implant-abutment interface in different connections: cross-sectional study after 5 years of functional loading.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the bacterial microflora present inside the implant connection and in the peri-implant sulcus fluid of healthy implants, and to analyze the relationships between these harboring sites for four different implant systems after at least 5 years of functional loading. materials and methods: a cross-sectional study was performed involving 40 patients treated with metal-ceramic cemented bridges supported by at least two healthy implants functionally loaded for 5 years. four different implant-abutment connections were studied: external hexagon (control group), double internal hexagon (test group 1), internal hexagon with external collar (test group 2), and conical connection  (test group 3). samples for microbiological analysis were obtained from three types of sites: peri-implant sulci, connections' inside and abutments surface and, as control, gingival sulci of neighboring teeth. quantitative real-time pcr  was carried out for total bacterial count and for 10 microorganisms: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, and candida albicans. the response variables were percentage of positive sites and absolute bacterial load. the relations of the response variables with the type of connection and of sampling site were assessed using generalized estimating equations. results: regarding the analysis of positivity to bacteria in the peri-implant sulcus no significant differences were observed. analyzing the connection's inside, none of the connection designs had the capacity to prevent microbiological leakage through the implant/abutment microgap. test group 3 presented the lowest mean values for red complex bacteria and control group the highest, although differences were non-significant. statistical significance was  only reached for treponema denticola in the bacterial load analysis inside the connection. test groups 1 and 2 yielded lower values for orange complex bacteria  but only for peptostreptococos micros the differences resulted significant. test  groups 2 and 3 had significantly lower total bacterial counts in the peri-implant sulcus and inside the connection. conclusions: outcomes suggested that all the analyzed connections resulted contaminated after 5 years of functional loading. however, the connection design might influence bacterial activity levels qualitatively and quantitatively, especially inside the implant connection.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes identify distinct periodontitis phenotypes.
AB  == the currently recognized principal forms of periodontitis-chronic and aggressive-lack an unequivocal, pathobiology-based foundation. we explored whether gingival tissue transcriptomes can serve as the basis for an alternative  classification of periodontitis. we used cross-sectional whole-genome gene expression data from 241 gingival tissue biopsies obtained from sites with periodontal pathology in 120 systemically healthy nonsmokers with periodontitis,  with available data on clinical periodontal status, subgingival microbial profiles, and serum igg antibodies to periodontal microbiota. adjusted model-based clustering of transcriptomic data using finite mixtures generated two distinct clusters of patients that did not align with the current classification  of chronic and aggressive periodontitis. differential expression profiles primarily related to cell proliferation in cluster 1 and to lymphocyte activation and unfolded protein responses in cluster 2. patients in the two clusters did not differ with respect to age but presented with distinct phenotypes (statistically  significantly different whole-mouth clinical measures of extent/severity, subgingival microbial burden by several species, and selected serum antibody responses). patients in cluster 2 showed more extensive/severe disease and were more often male. the findings suggest that distinct gene expression signatures in pathologic gingival tissues translate into phenotypic differences and can provide a basis for a novel classification.

TI  == peri-implant response and microflora in organ transplant patients 1 year after prosthetic loading: a prospective controlled study.
AB  == background: a recent study conducted in humans demonstrated for the first time that bone loss in the immediate period after implant insertion before loading did not significantly differ in organ transplant recipients with respect to normal subjects. purpose: the purpose of this study is to evaluate bone and periodontal  response and peri-implant microflora in a group of organ-transplanted patients 1  year after prosthetic loading. materials and methods: the study population included 13 consecutive organ-transplanted (11 hearts, two livers) patients and 13 normal (healthy) control subjects who received 29 and 28 submerged dental implants, respectively. crestal bone level, peri-implant probing depth (pipd), and bleeding on probing were evaluated at prosthetic loading and after 1 year. samples for microbiological testing were taken from the subgingival microbiota of each implant 1 year after loading and analyzed with polymerase chain reaction. all samples were examined for the presence of five microorganisms: treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannarella forsythensis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: a mean bone loss of 0.17 +/- 0.10 and 0.20 +/- 0.10 mm at 1 year was observed in the group of transplant recipients and in controls, respectively (n.s.). similar results were  obtained considering pipd changes at 1 year (respectively 0.06 +/- 0.71 mm in transplants vs 0.11 +/- 0.74 mm in controls). detection frequencies of pathogens  were not statistically different between normal and transplanted patients. conclusions: the present pilot study seems to indicate that bone and periodontal  response and microbiological status around submerged dental implants in immunocompromised organ-transplanted patients do not differ 1 year after loading  from those observed in control patients and that this particular population of patients may be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == subgingival periodontal pathogens associated with chronic periodontitis in yemenis.
AB  == background: subgingival microbial profile associated with periodontitis has been  reported to significantly differ by geographical location. the purpose of this study was to assess the association between a panel of putative periodontal bacterial pathogens and chronic periodontitis among yemenis. methods: subgingival dna samples were obtained from diseased and healthy sites of 20 non-smoking, moderate to severe chronic periodontitis subjects. absolute counts (bacterial dna copies per sample) and relative counts (% total bacteria) of seven periopathogenic species/genera representative of the red and orange complexes were determined using taqman q-pcr assays. results: the q-pcr assays showed excellent linearity (r2 > 0.99) and a sensitivity of 100 copies/sample. the detection rate was 100% for all tested species/genera except for p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans that were detected at 97.5% and 67.5%, respectively. the median log absolute counts were in the range of 2.41-6.53 copies per sample while median relative counts were in the range of 0.001-0.77%, both being highest for fusobacteria and lowest for a. actinomycetemcomitans. significant interspecies correlations were observed. adjusting for multiple comparisons (p</=0.0063), only t. forsythia, t. denticola and p. micra maintained significant association with periodontal destruction. the latter species, however, showed the strongest association and was found in higher proportions at the periodontitis sites across all subjects (3.39 median fold increase). no significant differences were observed for p. gingivalis. conclusions: p. micra rather than p. gingivalis  appears as a keystone pathogen in this yemeni sample. however, these findings need to be validated in a larger-scale study before they can be claimed to represent ethnic variations in pathogens' association with periodontitis.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in the genital tract: are they related to adverse pregnancy  outcome?
AB  == one of the most important factors implicated in preterm birth (ptb) is acute genitourinary tract infection. the bacteria causing chronic periodontal inflammation include gram-negative rods and anaerobes similar to those found in women with bacterial vaginosis. the aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between oral and vaginal microflora and preterm low  birth weight. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect both the presence and level of six periodontitis-related species: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp(fn), and prevotella intermedia (pi) for both oral samples of subgingival plaque and cervical samples, obtained from 80 patients, during gynaecological examinations. the more representative oral pathogen (less than 60 percent) species in oral samples of preterm and term group were tf, td, and fn. 24.4 percent of pregnant women presented periodontal pathogens in vaginal swab; the most representative species  with a percentage over 0.1 percent of total bacteria in genital tract of preterm  group were tf, td, and piwith a positive correlation (less than 0.5). the presence of the bacterium t. denticolain the vagina, regardless of the amount, adversely affects preterm delivery.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == [relationships of five periodontal pathogens causing subgingival plaque in patients with chronic periodontitis under different periodontal conditions].
AB  == objective: this study aimed to assess the relationship between the distributions  of haemophilus aggregatibacter (h. aggregatibacter ), porphyromonas gingivalis (p. gingivalis ), prevotella intermedia (p. intermedia), tannerella forsythensis  (t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola (t. denticola) in subgingival plaque and different periodontal conditions of chronic periodontitis. methods: twenty patients (80 sites) with chronic periodontitis and ten healthy subjects (20 sites) were included. the study sites were distributed into different groups according to the differences in their pocket probing depths (pd). the groups were described as follows: group a, pd< or = 4 mm; group b, 4 mm < pd < or = 6 mm; group c, pd>6 mm. semi-quantification of the subgingival microorganism samples was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and reverse hybridization assay.  results: the prevalence rates and quantities of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t.  forsythensis, and t. denticola were significantly higher in groups b and c than in the healthy group. higher prevalence rates and quantities of p. gingivalis were detected in group a than in the healthy group. the quantities of t. forsythensis and t. denticola were also significantly higher in group c than in group b. however, the prevalence rates and quantities ofh. aggregatibacter showed no significant difference among the groups. conclusion: the prevalence rates and  levels ofp. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola possibly increased as the depths of the periodontal pockets increased. the quantity ofp. gingivalis was correlated with the early stage of chronic periodontitis. the quantities of t. forsythensis and t. denticola were associated with local development of moderate or severe chronic periodontitis.

TI  == smoking-related cotinine levels and host responses in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == microbial analysis of subgingival plaque samples compared to that of whole saliva in patients with periodontitis.
AB  == background: the detection of special bacterial species in patients with periodontitis is considered to be useful for clinical diagnosis and treatment. the collection of subgingival plaque samples is the common way for the determination of periodontopathic bacteria. however, recently, salivary analysis  has been discussed as an advantageous future diagnostic method for periodontitis  because it offers simple quantitative sampling and the possibility to assess various bacteria. the aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the results of different bacterial species in saliva and subgingival plaque samples from individuals with aggressive periodontitis (agp) and chronic periodontitis (cp). methods: whole saliva and subgingival plaque samples from the deepest pocket of each quadrant were collected from 43 patients with cp and 33 patients with agp. twenty different bacterial species from both samplings were determined by the 16s ribosomal rna-based polymerase chain reaction with microarray technique. results: all bacterial species were detected in salivary and subgingival plaque samples. for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, as well as actinomyces viscosus, campylobacter rectus/showae, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, eubacterium nodatum, and campylobacter gracilis, a significant positive correlation between salivary and subgingival plaque samples was detected in patients with both types  of periodontitis. there were no significant differences in bacteria in salivary and subgingival plaque samples between agp and cp. conclusion: salivary analysis  might be discussed as a potential alternative to subgingival plaque sampling for  microbiologic analysis in both agp and cp.

TI  == clinical evaluation of salivary periodontal pathogen levels by real-time polymerase chain reaction in patients before dental implant treatment.
AB  == objective: periodontal pathogens in dental plaque are the main causative agents of periodontitis and peri-implantitis. detection of the presence of such periodontal pathogens early would serve as a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether the periodontal pathogen levels in saliva were correlated with the periodontal status of patients receiving implant treatment. materials and methods: a total of 291 patients visiting tokyo dental college chiba hospital were divided into four groups: a no-periodontitis (np) group, a mild-periodontitis (mip) group, a moderate-periodontitis (mop) group, and a severe-periodontitis (sp) group. the levels of the following five periodontal pathogens in saliva were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: the levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were significantly higher in mop group than in np  group (p < 0.05). the levels of all periodontal pathogens tested except a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in sp group than in np group (p < 0.05). conclusion: the detection levels of the periodontal pathogens targeted in  saliva samples were correlated with the periodontal status. this suggests that using saliva to screen for periodontopathic bacteria offers an easier-to-use clinical tool than the paper point method in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis and peri-implantitis.

AB  == oral lichen planus (olp) is a chronic inflammatory disease that is frequently detected in oral tissues. the aim of our study was to identify the prevalence of  the detection of periodontopathogenic microorganisms (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola in olp patients and to compare with  this prevalence of periodontopathogenic microorganisms in healthy non-olp patients. our study included 27 (18 chronic periodontitis (olpp) and 9 gingivitis (olpg)) patients diagnosed with olp along with 26 (13 chronic periodontitis (hp)  and 13 gingivitis (hg)) healthy non-olp patients. the multiplex polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization method (micro-ident) was used for identifying periodontopathogenic microorganisms present in subgingival plaque samples. the percentages of detection for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples taken from olp patients (olpg and olpp) were 18.5%, 85.1%, 81.4%, 88.8% and 74%, respectively. meanwhile, in the non-olp patients (hg and hp), these values were 7.6%, 50%, 46.1%, 73% and 57.7%, respectively. thus, comparing the non-olp groups with the olp groups, the periodontopathogens' percentages of detection in the olp groups were higher than those in the non-olp groups. according to our study results, olp patients have higher levels of infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia and t. denticola than non-olp patients. we argue that the high percentages in patients with olp may help identify the importance of periodontopathogenic microorganisms  in the progress of periodontal diseases of olp.

TI  == periodontopathogen and epstein-barr virus-associated periapical periodontitis may be the source of retrograde infectious peri-implantitis.
AB  == background: herpesviral-bacterial synergism may play a role in periodontitis and  peri-implantitis etiopathogenesis. periapical periodontitis (pp) lesions can predict future apical peri-implantitis complications. purpose: this pilot study aimed to substantiate herpesviral-bacterial coinfection in symptomatic (sp) and asymptomatic (ap) pp and assess associations with periodontopathogen salivary contamination in patients receiving implants. materials and methods: polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification was performed on pp granulation tissue  (gt) from 33 sp and ap patients and compared with unstimulated whole saliva. quantitative pcr evaluated epstein-barr virus (ebv) and cytomegalovirus copy counts. results: sp gt had higher proportions of periodontopathogens. symptomatic patients were 3.7 times more likely to be infected with ebv than ap (p = .07; 95% ci: 0.8-16.2). sp were 2.9, 2.1, 3.6, and 1.6 times more likely to be infected with treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the odds ratio of ebv infecting pp lesions was two times higher in those positive for the virus  in saliva. saliva tannerella forsythia-positive patients were 15 times more likely to present this pathogen in pp lesions (p = .038). saliva ebv-positive individuals were 7 and 3.5 times more likely to yield gt contamination with t. forsythia and t. denticola, respectively. ebv copy counts were significantly higher in sp (p < .01). conclusions: a causal association between ebv, specific bacterial anaerobic infection, and symptomatic pp is likely. ebv high prevalence  underscores the viral etiological importance. salivary ebv contamination is likely to be associated with viral and bacterial gt infection. saliva pcr analysis can be a good predictor of gt specific infection and help establish antimicrobial therapy. if confirmed by prospective longitudinal clinical trials,  antiviral therapy could possibly benefit sp and nonresponsive to treatment individuals and help prevent potential peri-implant infectious complications.

TI  == detection of eight periodontal microorganisms and distribution of porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotypes in chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the microbiologic feature of aggressive periodontitis (agp) in chinese patients has not yet been determined. this study aims to investigate the  prevalence of eight periodontal microorganisms and the distribution of the porphyromonas gingivalis fima genotype in a cohort of chinese patients with agp.  methods: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 81 patients with agp (25 with incisor-first molar type and 56 with generalized type  [gagp]) and 34 periodontally healthy controls. eight periodontal microorganisms,  including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: the prevalence of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola, c. rectus, p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with agp was significantly higher than that in healthy controls. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with gagp was relatively low (30.4%) compared with other pathogens. results of logistic regression analysis showed that younger patients were more likely to harbor a. actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio = 2.85). type ii was the most prevalent fima genotype of p. gingivalis in patients with agp. conclusions: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, t. denticola, c. rectus, p. intermedia, and f. nucleatum were the predominant periodontal pathogens of patients with gagp in china. type ii of fima was the most prevalent genotype of p. gingivalis in patients with agp. the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in patients with gagp was relatively low.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens in amniotic fluid and the role of periodontal disease in pre-term birth and low birth weight.
AB  == background: pre-term birth and/or low birth weight (ptlbw) is a serious problem in developing countries. the absence of known risk factors in approximately 50% of ptlbw cases has resulted in a continued search for other causes. the aim of this study was to examine the effect of periodontitis on pregnancy outcomes. methods: samples were taken from 50 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis. polymerase chain reaction was performed on amniotic fluid samples obtained during amniocentesis and on subgingival plaque samples to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia,  campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens. plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth and clinical attachment level were evaluated.  medical records were obtained after birth. results: social and demographic variables were similar among the gingivitis (g), localized periodontitis (lp) and generalized periodontitis (gp) groups. four subjects gave birth to ptlbw neonates. campylobacter rectus, t. forsythia, p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum were detected in the amniotic fluid and subgingival plaque samples of three patients who gave birth to ptlbw neonates. the amniotic fluid sample from the fourth patient was not positive for any of the tested pathogens. conclusion: these findings suggest that the transmission of some periodontal pathogens from the oral cavity of the mother may cause adverse pregnancy outcomes. the results contribute to an understanding of the association between periodontal disease and ptlbw, but further studies are required to better clarify the possible relationship.

TI  == altered phenotype and function of dendritic cells in individuals with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of periodontal bacterial lysates on maturation and function of mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (m-mddcs) derived from individuals with chronic periodontitis (cp) or healthy periodontal tissue (hp). design: m-mddcs derived from peripheral blood monocytes, cultured for 7 days in presence of interleukin (il)-4 and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (gm-csf), were stimulated with lysates of streptococcus sanguinis, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, or treponema denticola on day 4, and were then phenotyped. il-10, il-12 and ifn-gamma concentration in the supernatant of cultures were measured. results: expression of hla-dr was lower in bacterial-unstimulated mature m-mddc from cp compared to hp (p=0.04), while expression of cd1a and cd123 were higher in cp. the expression pattern of hla-dr, cd11c, cd123, and cd1a did not change on bacterial stimulation, regardless of the bacteria. stimulation with p. intermedia upregulated cd80 and cd86 in cp cells (p</=0.05). production of il-12p70 by bacterial-unstimulated m-mddcs was 5.8-fold greater in cp compared to hp. bacterial stimulation further increased il-12p70 production while decreasing il-10. significantly more ifn-gamma was produced in co-cultures of cp m-mddcs than with hp m-mddcs when cells were stimulated with p. intermedia (p=0.009). conclusions: bacterial-unstimulated m-mddc from cp exhibited a more immature phenotype but a cytokine profile biased towards proinflammatory response; this pattern was maintained/exacerbated after bacterial stimulation. p. intermedia upregulated co-stimulatory molecules and ifn-gamma expression in cp m-mddc. these events might contribute to periodontitis pathogenesis.

TI  == an investigation of the presence of specific anaerobic species in necrotic primary teeth.
AB  == different microbial identification methods have shown that the microbial community profiles in endodontic infections are diverse and assorted. the aim of  this study was to evaluate the frequency of selected endodontic pathogens in the  pulp chambers (pcs) and root canals (rcs) of infected primary teeth using pcr methods. paired pc and rc samples were collected from 15 subjects and analyzed by pcr for the presence of filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella tannerae, tanerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and treponema socranskii. the frequency of each species was  determined in the pc and rc of each case. the species most frequently detected in pcs were p. nigrescens (86.7%), p. gingivalis (73.3%), and f. alocis (73.3%). of  the pc samples, 13.3% contained p. micra and t. denticola, and 6.7% contained t.  forsythia. the species most frequently detected in rcs were p. gingivalis (100%)  and p. nigrescens (93.3%). p. tannerae, p. micra, and t. denticola were found in  40% of the rc samples; t. forsythia was found in 26.7% of the rc samples. the "red complex", which comprises p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia, was not found in the pc of any tooth but was found in 30% of the rc samples. the detection of p. nigrescens in the pc was statistically associated with the presence of p. nigrescens in the rc (p = 0.04). the results suggest high heterogeneity among the samples, even among those from the same subject.

TI  == detection of oral bacterial dna in synovial fluid.
AB  == objectives: as periodontal bacteria might be involved in the aetiology of rheumatic diseases, we analysed synovial fluid obtained from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra) and controls for the presence of dna of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. methods: in all, 42 patients suffering from ra (mean age 53.8 +/- 16.7 years, 40.4% females) and 114 controls  with no rheumatic diseases (mean age 56.1 +/- 15.2 years, 52.4% females) were included. dna from synovial fluid was isolated by qiaamp kit (qiagen, hilden, germany). polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) specific for the 16s rrna genes of the above specified bacteria were developed. subgingival bacterial colonization was analysed using micro-ident((r)) test (hain-diagnostik, nehren, germany). results: in patients with ra dna of p. gingivalis was detected in synovial fluid  more often than in controls (15.7% versus 3.5%, p = 0.045). more patients than controls harboured dna from p. gingivalis in both, oral plaque and synovial fluid (11.9% versus. 0.9%, p = 0.030). among the patients group the number of missing teeth was correlated with the number of joints with movement restrictions caused  by ra. conclusions: dna of periodontopathogens can be found in synovial fluid and oral bacteria may play a role in the pathogenesis of arthritis.

TI  == clinical and microbiologic effects of lingual cervical coverage by removable partial dentures.
AB  == purpose: the effect of gingival coverage by removable partial dentures (rpds) on  bacterial accumulation has not been sufficiently established. the aim of this study was to evaluate the periodontal and microbiologic reactions to mandibular major connectors. it was hypothesized that the use of a lingual plate increases the risk of periodontal disease. materials and methods: fourteen subjects (mean age: 69.0 years) received oral hygiene instructions and ultrasonic debridement prior to examination. each subject received an experimental rpd incorporating either a lingual bar or lingual plate for the first 8 weeks and was then switched to the other option for the next 8 weeks. clinical parameters (plaque index, gingival index, probing depth, and tooth mobility) were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the periodontal pocket in the test site to measure the colonization of periodontal pathogens after the use of each denture.  results: the mean probing depth was significantly greater after use of the lingual plate compared to the lingual bar (p < .05), whereas the type of connector did not affect the levels of any of the microbial species. all subjects that exhibited at least one bacterial species showed smaller numbers of microorganisms at the second examination than at the first. conclusions: the lingual cervical coverage did not precipitate the accumulation of anaerobic microorganisms, although it could potentially induce gingival inflammation. the results suggest that a lingual plate can be used as safely as a lingual bar if oral and denture hygiene are carefully monitored.

TI  == periodontal conditions during the pregnancy associated with periodontal pathogens.
AB  == aim: to describe the bacterial associations in the periodontal pockets of pregnant women and to correlate the presence of prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (t. forsythia), treponema denticola (t. denticola), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromona gingivalis (p. gingivalis) with periodontal parameters of severity. methods: the analysis was performed with 150  pregnant women. the examination consisted of an evaluation of bleeding, suppuration, probing depths, clinical attachment levels, hypermobility scores, the silness and loe plaque index, and the loe and the silness gingival index. each periodontal pathogen was identified by polymerase chain reaction. results: a statistically-significant association was observed (p < 0.01) between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, and between  t. forsythia and t. denticola. age was observed to be a risk factor in the development of moderate periodontitis (odds ratio [or] = 4.92, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.1-21.3, p = 0.0328). age was significantly associated with increased pocket depth and plaque index (or = 6.36, 95% ci = 1.8-22.2, p = 0.0037). in pregnant women, the presence of p. gingivalis was found to increase the risk of developing a clinical attachment level >/= 5 mm. conclusion: a high prevalence of p. gingivalis in pregnant women, especially in combination with t.  forsythia and t. denticola, was associated with an increased risk of developing moderate periodontitis, and that association was more marked in pregnant women aged 30 years or older.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == [clinical importance and diagnosis of halitosis].
AB  == the origin of halitosis comes from the latin word "halitus" meaning 'breath, exhaled air', and in the hungarian terminology it means bad and smelly breath. the human body emits a number of volatile molecules, which have a peculiar odour. their presence is influenced by several factors, such as genetic, nutritional and psychological factors. since bad breath belongs to taboo subjects, halitosis can  often lead to social isolation. to determine the incidence of halitosis, an exact diagnosis is needed which sometimes predestinates the possible treatment as well. investigators estimate the incidence about 50% in the whole population. the male/female ratio is the same and the incidence is growing with age. the diagnosis can be genuine halitosis, pseudo halitosis and halitophobia. we can divide the genuine type into physiological and pathophysiological subtypes. the cause of the halitosis usually can be found in the oral cavity. the volatile sulfur compounds (vsc) produced by some of the oral bacteria are responsible for  its development. only 10% of the causes are extraoral, mostly inflammation of airways or gastrointestinal disorders. the judgment of halitosis is based on three objective methods: the organoleptic, the sulphide monitoring and the gas cromatography methods. since the origin of the halitosis is mainly the oral cavity, dentists should treat them. beyond the dental treatments the enhancement  of the oral hygiene, the continuous motivation and monitoring are also very important, such as the use of tongue cleansing and special anti-malodour rinses.

TI  == optimization of quantitative polymerase chain reactions for detection and quantification of eight periodontal bacterial pathogens.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to optimize quantitative (real-time) polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays for 8 major periodontal pathogens, i.e. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tanerella forsythia and  treponema denticola, and of the caries pathogen streptococcus mutans. results: eighteen different primer pairs were analyzed in silico regarding specificity (using blast analysis) and the presence of secondary structures at primer binding sites (using mfold). the most specific and efficiently binding primer pairs, according to these analyses, were selected for qpcr-analysis to determine amplification efficiency, limit of quantification and intra-run reproducibility.  for the selected primer pairs, one for each species, the specificity was confirmed by assessing amplification of dna extracts from isolates of closely related species. for these primer pairs, the intercycler portability was evaluated on 3 different thermal cyclers (the applied biosystems 7300, the bio-rad iq5 and the roche light cycler 480). for all assays on the different cyclers, a good correlation of the standard series was obtained (i.e. r2 >/= 0.98), but quantification limits varied among cyclers. the overall best quantification limit was obtained by using a 2 mul sample in a final volume of 10 mul on the light cycler 480. conclusions: in conclusion, the proposed assays allow to quantify the bacterial loads of s. mutans, 6 periodontal pathogenic species and the genus fusobacterium.this can be of use in assessing periodontal risk, determination of the optimal periodontal therapy and evaluation of this treatment.

AB  == background: expression patterns of human beta-defensin-2 (hbd-2) mrna or hbd-2 protein concentration and periodontal diseases have been a focus of scientific research. this study compares the salivary levels of hbd-2 protein concentration  of healthy patients and patients with gingivitis and chronic periodontitis (cp) and correlates these levels with the presence of periodontopathogens. methods: a  total of 89 patients were enrolled in this study: 31 periodontally healthy, 27 with gingivitis, and 31 with cp. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and  clinical attachment level were measured. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated qualitatively by conventional polymerase chain reaction. hbd-2 quantification in  saliva was performed using an immune enzymatic assay. frequency of periodontopathogens and hbd-2 protein concentration was assessed. association between hbd-2 protein concentration (>/=100 pg/ml) and the simultaneous presence  of one to two, three to four, or five to six periodontopathogens was tested. results: although periodontally healthy individuals and patients with gingivitis  showed similar hbd-2 levels, the cp group displayed an increased level of hbd-2.  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and t. denticola were more prevalent  in cp; however, their mere presence was not related to the increased levels of hbd-2 (pearson correlation and multinomial logistic regression model). conclusions: salivary hbd-2 protein concentration was higher in patients with cp  compared with healthy individuals or patients with gingivitis. these different protein concentrations were not related to the frequency of periodontopathogens.  clinical inflammatory profile had a higher impact on salivary hbd-2 levels than bacteria.

AB  == numerous publications have reported the presence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in peripheral and central vascular lesions. however, it is unclear how this bacterial translocation occurs. the objective of this study was to investigate whether periodontopathic bacteria are translocated to lymph nodes proximal to the oral cavity. obtaining lymph node samples is not ethically feasible unless they are excised as part of the surgical management of patients with cancer. this study analyzed formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded lymph nodes, histologically negative for cancer cell invasion, that were excised from 66 patients with histories of head and neck cancer. real-time pcr was performed to amplify the 16s ribosomal dna fragments from porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. the relationship between bacterial detection and cancer severity, gender, and the use of anti-cancer therapy was examined by fisher's exact test. p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and p. intermedia were present in 17%, 8%, and 8% of the samples of submandibular and submental lymph nodes, respectively. there were  no significant relationships between bacterial detection and the cancer disease status, patient gender or use of anticancer therapy. according to these data, it  appears that the translocation of periodontopathic bacteria may occur via lymphatic drainage, irrespective of the cancer disease status, gender or anticancer therapy.

TI  == cleavage of igg1 in gingival crevicular fluid is associated with the presence of  porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == background and objectives: immunoglobulin (ig) g1 plays an important role in the  adaptive immune response. kgp, a lysine-specific cysteine protease from porphyromonas gingivalis, specifically hydrolyses igg1 heavy chains. the purpose  of this study was to examine whether cleavage of igg1 occurs in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in vivo, and whether there is any association with the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathogens. material and  methods: gcf was obtained from nine patients with aggressive periodontitis, nine  with chronic periodontitis and five periodontally healthy individuals. the bacterial loads of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and tannerella  forsythia were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the presence  and cleavage of igg1 and igg2 were determined using western blotting. kgp levels  were measured by elisa. results: cleaved igg1 was identified in the gcf from 67%  of patients with aggressive periodontitis and in 44% of patients with chronic periodontitis. by contrast, no cleaved igg1 was detectable in healthy controls. no degradation of igg2 was detected in any of the samples, regardless of health status. porphyromonas gingivalis was found in high numbers in all samples in which cleavage of igg1 was detected (p < 0.001 compared with samples with no igg  cleavage). furthermore, high numbers of tannerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia were also present in these samples. the level of kgp in the gcf correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis (r = 0.425, p < 0.01). the presence of kgp (range 0.07-10.98 ng/ml) was associated with proteolytic fragments of igg1 (p < 0.001). however, cleaved igg1 was also detected in samples with no detectable kgp. conclusion: in patients with periodontitis, cleavage of igg1 occurs in vivo and may suppress antibody-dependent antibacterial activity in subgingival biofilms especially those colonized by porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == prediction of periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque of periodontal healthy subjects by measurement of volatile sulfur compounds in mouth air.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether measurements of volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are useful to predict colonization of periodontopathic bacteria. for this purpose, we assessed the relationships among  distributions of 4 species of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and dental plaque, oral conditions including vsc concentration in mouth air, and smoking habit of periodontal healthy young subjects. methods: the subjects were 108 young adults (mean age, 23.5+/-2.56 years) without clinical periodontal pockets. information regarding smoking habit was obtained by interview. after vsc concentration in mouth, air was measured with a portable sulfide monitor (halimeter((r))), non-stimulated saliva flow and dental caries status were assessed, and tongue coating and dental plaque samples were collected from the subjects. the tongue coating samples were weighed to determine the amount. the colonization of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in both tongue coating and plaque samples was investigated using species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays. results: significant relationships were observed between the colonization of periodontopathic bacteria in tongue coating and plaque samples, especially that of p. gingivalis. vsc concentration showed the most significant association with  colonization of p. gingivalis in both tongue coating and dental plaque. logistic  regression analysis demonstrated that the adjusted partial correlation coefficient [exp(b)] values for vsc concentration with the colonization of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola in dental plaque were 135, 35.4 and 10.4, respectively. in addition, smoking habit was also shown to be a significant variable in regression models [exp(b)=6.19, 8.92 and 2.53, respectively]. therefore, receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to predict the colonization of periodontal bacteria in dental plaque in the subjects divided by smoking habit. based on our results, we found cut-off values that indicated likelihood ratios (lr) within the efficient range for positive findings in both groups. conclusion: the present results demonstrated that measurement of vsc concentration in mouth air is a useful method to predict the presence of colonization of some periodontopathic bacteria in dental plaque.

TI  == hyaluronic acid as an adjunct after scaling and root planing: a prospective randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: the study is designed to determine the effect on clinical variables,  subgingival bacteria, and local immune response brought about by application of hyaluronan-containing gels in early wound healing after scaling and root planing  (srp). methods: in this randomized clinical study, data from 34 individuals with  chronic periodontitis were evaluated after full-mouth srp. in the test group (n = 17), hyaluronan gels in two molecular weights were additionally applied during the first 2 weeks after srp. the control group (n = 17) was treated with srp only. probing depth (pd) and clinical attachment level (cal) were recorded at baseline and after 3 and 6 months, and subgingival plaque and sulcus fluid samples were taken for microbiologic and biochemical analysis. results: in both groups, pd and cal were significantly reduced (p <0.001). the changes in pd and the reduction of the number of pockets with pd >/=5 mm were significantly higher  in the test group after 3 (p = 0.014 and 0.021) and 6 (p = 0.046 and 0.045) months. six months after srp, the counts of treponema denticola were significantly reduced in both groups (both p = 0.043), as were those of campylobacter rectus in the test group only (p = 0.028). prevotella intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis increased in the control group. conclusion: the adjunctive application of hyaluronan may have positive effects on pd reduction and may prevent recolonization by periodontopathogens.

TI  == reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB  == objective: salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. salivary arginase activity (saa) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the saa before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. method and materials: eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients  (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. plaque and gingival indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. the presence of campylobacter rectus, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, and prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction.  salivary total protein level and saa were also established by spectrophotometry.  clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the wilcoxon, mann-withney, and kruskal-wallis tests (p < .05). for microbial data, the chi-square test was used. the pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. results: after therapy, due to a significant reduction in saa, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found  in the healthy group. interestingly, after therapy, saa followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the  reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group t forsythia, pre- > posttherapy;  periodontitis group p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). conclusion: based on the reduction of saa after therapy, in  accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters,  it was concluded that saa has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.

TI  == a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on the clinical and microbial  effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used by patients in supportive periodontal care.
AB  == aim: this 3-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study evaluated the  clinical and microbial effects of an essential oil mouth rinse used as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control by patients in supportive periodontal care. material and methods: fifty patients were randomly allocated to an essential oil group (listerine((r)) coolmint; johnson & johnson, new brunswick, nj, usa) or placebo group to rinse twice per day as an adjunct to mechanical plaque control. at baseline and after 3 months, plaque index (pi), gingivitis index (gi), probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing (bop) and clinical attachment level were registered. subgingival plaque samples were collected for the detection and quantification of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium genus and streptococcus mutans by means of real-time pcr (qpcr). patient's compliance, satisfaction and side effects were registered. results: twenty-three patients in the essential oil group (mean age:  57) and 21 in the placebo group (mean age: 55) with acceptable oral hygiene at intake (mean pi <1.5 on a scale of 5) adhered to the study protocol. gingivitis index, pi and bop significantly reduced over time (p </= 0.029); however, between group analyses revealed no significant differences. there was no significant change over time neither in detection frequency nor load for any of the microbiota. daily rinsing with an essential oil rinse was found safe and perceived beneficial by the patients. conclusion: patients in supportive periodontal care who are fairly compliant with oral hygiene may not benefit from  additional mouth rinsing using an essential oil solution.

TI  == quantification of periodontopathic bacteria in saliva using the invader assay.
AB  == when quantifying periodontopathic bacteria, it is important to use a convenient method that does not produce false negative results. the invader assay is a convenient method because it does not involve gene amplification. the purpose of  this study was to evaluate the validity of the invader assay to quantify periodontopathic bacteria. the invader technology was applied in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola). the invader assay produced a linear quantitative detection range over concentrations spanning seven exponential values, with a detection limit of 10(3.7) copies/tube and intra-day and inter-day variance of 0.1% to 4.7% and 0.1% to 3.4%, respectively, in quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria. we compared the results of the invader assay with those of real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) performed for quantifying five periodontopathic bacteria in 22 patients with periodontitis. among the invader-detectable bacterial strains of each species, significant correlations were observed in the counts of concerned bacterial species between these two methods, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.757 to 0.996. this study validated repeatability and reproducibility of the invader assay in quantifying periodontopathic bacteria and demonstrated consistent agreement between the invader assay and real-time pcr in  quantifying periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == genome-wide association study of periodontal pathogen colonization.
AB  == pathological shifts of the human microbiome are characteristic of many diseases,  including chronic periodontitis. to date, there is limited evidence on host genetic risk loci associated with periodontal pathogen colonization. we conducted a genome-wide association (gwa) study among 1,020 white participants of the atherosclerosis risk in communities study, whose periodontal diagnosis ranged from healthy to severe chronic periodontitis, and for whom "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization quantification of 8 periodontal pathogens was performed. we examined 3 traits: "high red" and "high orange" bacterial complexes, and "high" aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) colonization. genotyping was performed on the affymetrix 6.0 platform. imputation to 2.5 million markers was based on hapmap ii-ceu, and a multiple-test correction was applied (genome-wide threshold  of p < 5 x 10(-8)). we detected no genome-wide significant signals. however, 13 loci, including kcnk1, fbxo38, uhrf2, il33, runx2, trps1, camta1, and vamp3, provided suggestive evidence (p < 5 x 10(-6)) of association. all associations reported for "red" and "orange" complex microbiota, but not for aa, had the same  effect direction in a second sample of 123 african-american participants. none of these polymorphisms was associated with periodontitis diagnosis. investigations replicating these findings may lead to an improved understanding of the complex nature of host-microbiome interactions that characterizes states of health and disease.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7 +/- 7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8 +/- 8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == long-term follow-up of turned single implants placed in periodontally healthy patients after 16 to 22 years: microbiologic outcome.
AB  == background: survival rates in implant dentistry today are high, although late failures do occur for many reasons, including peri-implant infections. the primary objective of this study is to investigate microbiota around single turned implants after 16 to 22 years. secondary objectives are to compare teeth and implants and to correlate microbiologic, radiographic, and clinical parameters. methods: a total of 46 patients with single implants were invited for a clinical  examination. clinical data were collected from implants and contralateral natural teeth. radiographic bone level was measured around implants. microbiologic samples were taken from implants, contralateral teeth, and the deepest pocket per quadrant. samples were analyzed with dna-dna hybridization including 40 species.  statistical analysis was performed using wilcoxon signed-rank tests, mcnemar tests, and spearman correlation coefficients with a 0.05 significance level. results: mean follow-up was 18.5 years (range 16 to 22 years). tannerella forsythia (1.5 x 10(5)) and veillonella parvula (1.02 x 10(5)) showed the highest concentrations around implants and teeth, respectively. porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and t. forsythia were significantly more present around implants than teeth. mean counts were significantly higher around implants than teeth for parvimonas micra, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, t. forsythia, and treponema denticola. total dna count was correlated to interproximal bleeding index (r = 0.409) and interproximal probing depth (r = 0.307). no correlations were present with plaque index or radiographic bone level. conclusions: in the present study, bacterial counts around single implants in periodontally healthy patients are rather low. although pathogenic bacteria are present, some in higher numbers around implants than teeth (five of 40), the majority of implants present with healthy peri-implant tissues without progressive bone loss.

TI  == association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, red-complex periodontopathogens and gingival crevicular fluid cytokine levels with cyclosporine a-induced gingival overgrowth in renal transplant patients.
AB  == backgroud and objective: genetic factors may influence the colonization of pathogenic bacteria, therefore increasing the risk for the initiation and development of periodontal disease. the present study was carried out to investigate the association of cd14-260 polymorphisms, subgingival microbiota, and gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) cytokine levels with cyclosporine a (csa)-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant patients. material and methods: a total of 204 patients were dichotomized into two groups: 124 with go and 80 without go. the cd14-260 polymorphisms were measured using an allele-specific pcr method. the levels of periodontal pathogens were determined by real-time pcr of subgingival samples. gcf levels of il-1beta and scd14 were detected by elisa. results: the frequency of cd14-260 genotype ct + tt was found  to be similar in both groups. patients with go presented increased prevalence of  pg, td, and tf (red complex) and significantly higher levels of interleukin -1beta than those without go. patients with go carrying ct + tt genotypes were found to have higher frequencies of pg, td, and tf than those carrying the cc genotype. furthermore, in the presence of red complex, ct + tt genotypes were associated with higher interleukin -1beta levels and severe go. multiple logistic regression analysis demonstrated that the severity of go is not dependent on age, gender and pharmacological variables, being only associated with cd14-260 genotype and red complex periodontopathogens. conclusion: no association between  cd14-260 polymorphisms and the prevalence of go was revealed in renal transplant  patients administered csa. however, cd14-260 ct + tt genotypes are associated with the prevalence of red complex periodontopathogens in patients with go, and may thus play some role in the development of severe csa-induced go.

AB  == aim: to examine the influence of extracellular matrix (ecm) proteins in enhancing bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation on titanium surfaces. materials and methods: the adherence of 21 bacterial isolates to prepolished 1 cm(2) titanium samples was screened using fluorescence microscopy. three isolates that exhibited "low" (porphyromonas gingivalis r17870), "moderate" (porphyromonas gingivalis 5335), and "extensive" (prevotella denticola r9102) adherence to titanium were then examined for titanium adherence in the presence of the ecm proteins vitronectin, fibronectin, laminin, collagen type i, and collagen type iv. results: several ecm proteins had a considerable effect on increasing adherence of the bacteria to titanium compared to a control (no protein treatment). the most significant difference was seen with vitronectin for p. gingivalis 5335 (p < 0.001 at 4 h, 24-h incubation times) and p. gingivalis r17870 (p < 0.05 at 4 h, 24 h incubation times). for p. denticola r9102, vitronectin was not found to enhance adherence at 4 h, (p > 0.05), whilst collagen type i and fibronectin did  result in significantly enhanced adherence (p < 0.05, 24 h). conclusions: ecm matrix proteins promote adherence of potential periodontal pathogenic bacteria to titanium surfaces. management of diseases such as peri-implantitis should focus on limitation of this bacterial adherence to reduce/eliminate biofilms.

AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI  == oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == individual composition of human leukocyte antigens and periodontopathogens in the background of periodontitis.
AB  == background: human leukocyte antigens (hlas) are a basic precondition to induce the immune response to pathogens. therefore, this study evaluates associations among periodontitis, five key periodontopathic bacteria, and hlas to test their impact together with additional risk factors in multivariate analyses. methods: eighty-five patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) and 71 patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (cp) were compared to 88 periodontitis-free controls. hla class i and ii typing was performed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with sequence-specific primers. subgingival plaque specimens were detected by pcr with sequence-specific oligonucleotides. risk-factor analyses were performed with respect to the cofactors age, sex, smoking, and plaque level by logistic regression. results: in the total patient group (gagp + cp), the adjusted odds ratio (or) of periodontitis was decreased in cases who were carriers of hla-b*57 (or = 0.259, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.086 to 0.782), hla-dqb1*08 (or = 0.404, 95% ci = 0.187 to 0.871), or the combination hla-drb1*04;drb4*;dqb1*0302 (or = 0.407, 95% ci = 0.185 to 0.895). moreover, individuals who expressed hla-drb1*04 (or = 0.36, 95% ci = 0.148 to 0.886) or hla-drb1*04;drb4*;dqb1*0302 (or = 0.29, 95% ci = 0.092 to 0.884) had a  decreased colonization risk with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: certain hla markers were negatively associated to the manifestation  of a generalized periodontitis and/or the individual colonization of a. actinomycetemcomitans. the underlying mechanisms have to be investigated in future studies.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in dogs and their owners.
AB  == objective: presently, a large number of individuals consider their companion animals as family members and have close contact with them in daily life. the purpose of the present study was to analyze the distribution of periodontopathic  bacterial species in oral specimens taken from dogs and their owners. design: dental plaque specimens were collected from 66 dogs and 81 members of 64 families who came to an animal clinic or dog training school in okayama, japan, in 2011. bacterial dna was extracted from each specimen and pcr analyses using primers specific for 11 periodontopathic species, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas gulae, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were performed. results: p. gulae (71.2%), t. forsythia (77.3%), and c. rectus (66.7%) were frequently found in the dogs, whereas the detection rates of  those species in humans were less frequent at 16.0%, 30.9%, and 21.0%, respectively. p. gulae was identified in 13 human subjects and each of their dogs was also positive for the species. furthermore, e. corrodens and t. denticola in  specimens obtained from dogs were correlated with their presence in specimens from owners who had close contact with them. conclusions: these results suggest that several periodontopathic species could be transmitted between humans and their companion dogs, though the distribution of periodontopathic species in both is generally different.

TI  == alveolar bone loss associated with age-related macular degeneration in males.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to examine the relationship of selected systemic and oral health parameters and the salivary presence of six periodontal  pathogens to age-related macular degeneration (amd). methods: the present cross-sectional study includes data on 1,751 individuals (>/=30 years old). general health information was obtained by questionnaires and interviews, including self-reported diagnosis of amd, as well as by the general and oral health examination, including panoramic radiography and laboratory analyses. fifty-four individuals with degenerative fundus changes formed the amd group, and the other 1,697 formed the non-amd group. pearson chi(2) and analysis of variance tests were used for comparisons of categorical parameters and continuous parameters between the participant groups, respectively. a logistic regression analysis was performed to study the association of amd with alveolar bone loss and the number of teeth by controlling for age, diabetic status, systolic blood pressure, education, and smoking, and also for the carriage of salivary bacteria. results: advanced age, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes were associated with amd (p <0.001), whereas the carriage rates of the examined periodontal pathogens  were not. in the whole study population, the participants with amd had fewer teeth (p <0.001) and more alveolar bone loss (p = 0.004) compared with non-amd participants. in a logistic regression model adjusted for age, smoking, and diabetes, alveolar bone loss was associated with amd in males with an odds ratio  of 4.3 (95% confidence interval = 1.3 to 14.6, p = 0.013). conclusion: in this population-based health survey, alveolar bone loss is independently associated with amd in males.

TI  == comparative evaluation of the effects of different photoablative laser irradiation protocols on the gingiva of periodontopathic patients.
AB  == objective: we aimed at quantifying the presence of periodontopathogens in gingival biopsies from periodontitis patients treated with different photoablative lasers (diode gaas, er:yag, nd:yag, and co(2) lasers) and histologically analyzing their effects on the gingiva. background data: substantial evidence indicates that intracellular location of periodontal bacteria in the gingival epithelium may contribute to chronic periodontitis. methods: sixteen adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were subjected to conventional scaling/root planing and topical chlorhexidine, and immediately laser-irradiated on the inner and outer free gingiva. small gingival biopsies were subjected to real-time polymerase chain reaction and cytofluorescence to identify periodontopathogens; tissue damage and endothelial icam-1 expression were assessed by histological and immunofluorescence analyses. results: high dna  levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and ekenella corrodens, were detected in all samples. nd:yag and diode lasers were capable of  eradicating periodontopathogenic bacteria endowed within gingival epithelial cells outside periodontal pockets, without causing connective tissue damage and microvessel rupture. they also reduced icam-1 immunolabelling by the vascular endothelium. conversely, er:yag lasers induced marked microvessel rupture and bleeding and failed to completely and selectively ablate the infected gingival epithelium, whereas co(2) laser caused heat-induced coagulation of the lamina propria. conclusions: this study indicates that periodontopathogens can persist within cells outside the pocket epithelium, despite conventional periodontal treatment. nd:yag and diode lasers are able to eradicate intra- and extracellular bacteria from these sites, suggesting that they can be considered suitable devices to improve the clinical outcome of periodontal disease.

TI  == regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with or without systemic doxycycline. a randomized placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == aim: comparison of regenerative therapy of infrabony defects with and without administration of postsurgical systemic doxycycline (doxy). methods: in each of 61 patients one infrabony defect was treated with enamel matrix derivative (emd), emd plus filler or membrane at two centres. by random assignment patients received either 200 mg doxy per day or placebo (plac) for 7 days after surgery. prior to and 6 months after surgery probing pocket depths (ppd) and vertical attachment level (pal-v) were obtained. results: fifty-four patients (doxy: 27; plac: 27) were re-examined after 6 months and had been treated exclusively with emd. seven to 8 days after surgery 81% of defects in both groups showed complete  flap closure. in both groups significant (p < 0.001) ppd reduction (doxy: 3.87 +/- 1.44 mm; plac: 3.67 +/- 1.30 mm) and pal-v gain (doxy: 3.11 +/- 1.50 mm; plac: 3.32 +/- 1.83 mm) were observed. however, the differences failed to be statistically significant (ppd: 0.20; p = 0.588; pal-v: 0.21; p = 0.657). conclusions: two hundred milligram systemic doxy administered for 7 days after therapy of infrabony defects with emd failed to result in better ppd reduction and pal-v gain compared with plac which may be due to low power (50%) and, thus,  random chance.

TI  == treponema denticola chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp) integrates spirochaetes within oral microbial communities.
AB  == treponema denticola is found ubiquitously in the human oral cavity and is mainly  associated with bacterial communities implicated in the establishment and development of periodontal disease. the ability to become integrated within biofilm communities is crucial to the growth and survival of oral bacteria, and involves inter-bacterial coaggregation, metabolic cooperation, and synergy against host defences. in this article we show that the chymotrypsin-like proteinase (ctlp), found within a high-molecular-mass complex on the cell surface, mediates adherence of t. denticola to other potential periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and parvimonas micra. proteolytic activity per se did not appear to be required for the interactions, and expression of the major outer-sheath protein (msp) was not necessary, except for binding parv. micra. biofilms of densely packed cells and matrix, up to 40 microm in depth, were formed between t. denticola and p. gingivalis on salivary pellicle, with t. denticola cells enriched in the upper layers. expression of ctlp, but not msp, was critical for dual-species biofilm formation with p. gingivalis. t. denticola did not form dual-species biofilms with any of the other three periodontal bacterial species under various conditions. synergy between t. denticola and p. gingivalis was also shown by increased inhibition of blood clotting, which was ctlp-dependent. the results demonstrate the critical role of ctlp in interactions of t. denticola with other oral micro-organisms, leading to synergy in microbial community development and host tissue pathogenesis.

TI  == microbial profile of patients with periodontitis compared with healthy subjects.
AB  == objective: to define and compare the microbiologic profile of subgingival plaque  in german patients with periodontitis (including aggressive and advanced chronic  periodontitis) and healthy subjects and to determine significant association between isolates and clinical status. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia are major periodontal pathogens, though it is recognized that other species may also contribute to the  pathogenesis of periodontal disease. method and materials: thirty-three patients  with clinical and radiologic proof of aggressive and advanced chronic periodontitis and 20 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. clinical indices were recorded as six-point measurements on each tooth. samples of the subgingival plaque were taken with paper points from four teeth of each individual. the samples were divided into two parts. one part was immediately cultivated, while the other one was stored at -20 degrees c until analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a total of 284 anaerobic isolates (224 isolates from patients and 60 isolates from healthy controls) were identified. forty different anaerobic species were isolated, with a mean of 6.78  species per patient and 3 species per healthy control subject. significant differences in prevalence (after adjusting for multiple comparisons, p < .001) were found for prevotella intermedia and nigrescens, fusobacterium nucleatum, t forsythia, treponema denticola, and veillonella parvula. the first four species were associated with the aggressive periodontitis group and v parvula with healthy subjects. conclusion: when compared with healthy controls, the microbial  profile of subgingival plaque from periodontitis was found to contain known periodontal pathogens with a different prevalence to that described in earlier studies. p intermedia/nigrescens, f nucleatum, t forsythia, and t denticola have  been found in lower proportions and small quantities in healthy subjects.

TI  == predominant bacterial species in subgingival plaque in dogs.
AB  == background and objective: the dog has been used extensively for experimental and  microbiological studies on periodontitis and peri-implantitis without detailed knowledge about the predominant flora of the subgingival plaque. this study was designed to evaluate the predominant cultivable bacterial species in dogs and compare them phenotypically and genotypically with corresponding human species. material and methods: four subgingival samples were taken from two upper premolars in each of six labrador retrievers. the samples from each dog were processed for anaerobic culture. from the samples of each dog, the five or six predominating bacteria based on colony morphology were selected and pure cultured. each of the strains was characterized by gram stain, anaerobic/aerobic  growth and api-zym test. eighteen strains showing clear-cut phenotypic differences were further classified based on dna sequencing technology. cross-reactions of dna probes from human and dog strains were also tested against a panel of both human and dog bacterial species. results: thirty-one strains in the dogs were isolated and characterized. they represented 21 different species,  of which six belonged to the genus porphyromonas. no species was found consistently in the predominant flora of all six dogs. porphyromonas crevioricanis and fusobacterium canifelinum were the two most prevalent species in predominant flora in dogs. dna probes from human and dog species cross-reacted to some extent with related strains from humans and dogs; however, distinct exceptions were found. conclusion: the predominant cultural subgingival flora in  dogs shows great similarities with the subgingival bacteria from humans at the genus level, but distinct differences at the species level; however, a genetic relatedness could be disclosed for most strains investigated.

TI  == detection of periodontal pathogens in newborns and children with mixed dentition.
AB  == we report the age-related prevalence of red complex periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia, along with four strains of orange complex pathogens. the bacteria present in samples isolated from tongue, cheek, and subgingival sulcus in edentulous newborns and children with mixed dentition were monitored by polymerase chain reaction (pcr).  p. gingivalis was not detected in any site of any subject in the two groups tested. however, t. denticola was not only found in the 6-13 years age group, but also in edentulous newborns at a relatively high prevalence, indicating non-dentition-related colonization by t. denticola. campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, eikenella corrodens, and parvimonas micra were found in the oral cavity of most subjects belonging to the 6-13 years age group compared to newborns. this suggested a pronounced association between these colonizing bacteria and the presence of teeth. there was also a strong relation between t. denticola and t. forsythia for their prevalence in the subgingival sulcus of the 6-13 years age group (p < 0.0001), but not in the other sites tested, suggesting that the colonization of dentition-related t. forsythia may be associated with the increased prevalence of non-dentition-related t. denticola in the subgingival sulcus. overall, these results suggest that dentition is a key determinant of bacterial colonization, especially orange complex bacteria and the red complex bacterium t. forsythia.

TI  == short-term periodontal and microbiological changes following orthognathic surgery.
AB  == objective: aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of orthognathic surgery on the development of periodontal and microbiological changes. materials  and methods: fifteen consecutively treated patients with a mean age of 24.9+/-7.7 years receiving orthognathic surgery were included in the present study. plaque index (pi) and concentrations of 11 periodonto-pathogenic bacteria were recorded  one day prior to surgery (t(0)) and one week (t(1)) and six weeks (t(2)) post-surgery. in addition, a complete periodontal examination including pocket probing depth (ppd), gingival recession (gr), clinical attachment level (cal), bleeding on probing (bop) and width of keratinized gingiva (wkg) was conducted at t(0) and t(2). for statistical analysis, general linear model and paired t-test were applied. results: a significant increase of pi (t(0)-t(1), p=0.037) was followed by a significant decrease (t(1)-t(2), p=0.017). apart from eikenella corrodens (p=0.036), no significant microbiological changes were recorded. ppd significantly increased on oral sites (p=0.045) and gr especially on buccal sites (p=0.001). in the incision area the development of gr was significantly higher on the test (buccal) than on the control sites (oral). both gingival biotypes were affected by gr. conclusions: orthognathic surgery causes statistically significant changes of periodontal parameters, but these changes do not necessarily impair the aesthetic appearance of the gingival margin.

AB  == objective: to evaluate changes in subgingival microbiota before and during the leveling and alignment orthodontic stage using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. materials and methods: thirty orthodontic patients (17 females and  13 males; aged 16.7 +/- 6.5 y) were included in this study. subgingival microbial samples were taken from the disto-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper central incisors, the left lower central incisors, the mesio-buccal gingival crevice of the left upper first molars, and the left lower first molars, at four  different times: at baseline, before placement of orthodontic appliances (t1), and 1 week (t2), 3 months (t3), and 6 months after placement of orthodontic appliances (t4). dna was extracted from the samples, and the 16s rrna-based pcr detection method was used to determine the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobactor rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola, which are considered as putative periodontopathogens. results: the frequency of t forsythia, c rectus, and p nigrescens significantly increased after placement of orthodontic appliances. for the other species, the frequency tended to increase but no statistically significant difference was noted. the frequency of the change, representing microorganisms not existing at t1 but newly developing at t2, t3, and t4, was higher at the molars than at the incisors. conclusion: the placement of orthodontic appliances affects the subgingival microbial composition even during  the early period of orthodontic treatment, increasing the prevalence of periodontopathogens, especially in the molar region.

TI  == clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic factors of orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to investigate the microbiologic and immunologic factors related to orthodontic treatment-induced gingival enlargement (ge). methods: our study included 12 patients with ge undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment and 12 periodontally healthy controls. at baseline, periodontal variables, subgingival plaque samples, and gingival crevicular fluid  (gcf) samples were taken from 2 preselected sites in both the ge and the control  groups. the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella  forsythia were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. gcf interleukin (il)-1beta and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (tgf-beta1) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (invitrogen, camarillo, calif). periodontal therapy was given to the ge group, and all parameters were reassessed after 4 weeks. results: at baseline, the ge group showed higher prevalences of the 5 periodontal pathogens than did the control group (p <0.05). il-1beta and tgf-beta1 levels at the ge sites were also significantly higher than those at the control sites (p <0.05). four weeks after periodontal therapy, the ge group showed significant improvements in the clinical parameters associated with significant reductions of p gingivalis, a actinomycetemcomitans, and t denticola. the levels of il-1beta decreased significantly compared with the baseline (p <0.05), whereas there was no significant change in tgf-beta1 levels (p >0.05). conclusions: periodontal pathogens might have a relationship with the initiation  and development of orthodontic treatment-induced ge. inflammatory cytokines (il-1beta and tgf-beta1) can also be considered as contributing factors.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

TI  == gingival tissue transcriptomes in experimental gingivitis.
AB  == aims: we investigated the sequential gene expression in the gingiva during the induction and resolution of experimental gingivitis. material and methods: twenty periodontally and systemically healthy non-smoking volunteers participated in a 3-week experimental gingivitis protocol, followed by debridement and 2-week regular plaque control. we recorded clinical indices and harvested gingival tissue samples from four interproximal palatal sites in half of the participants  at baseline, day 7, day 14 and day 21 (the "induction phase"), and at day 21, day 25, day 30 and day 35 in the other half (the "resolution phase"). rna was extracted, amplified, reversed transcribed, amplified, labelled and hybridized using affymetrix human genome u133plus2.0 microarrays. paired t-tests compared gene expression changes between consecutive time points. gene ontology analyses summarized the expression patterns into biologically relevant categories. results: the median gingival index was 0 at baseline, 2 at day 21 and 1 at day 35. differential gene regulation peaked during the third week of induction and the first 4 days of resolution. leucocyte transmigration, cell adhesion and antigen processing/presentation were the top differentially regulated pathways. conclusions: transcriptomic studies enhance our understanding of the pathobiology of the reversible inflammatory gingival lesion and provide a detailed account of  the dynamic tissue responses during the induction and resolution of experimental  gingivitis.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == relationship between the beta-galactosidase activity in saliva and parameters associated with oral malodor.
AB  == volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) are produced by enzymes capable of transforming  s-amino acids to corresponding sulfides. protein degradation by periodontopathogens plays an important role in this process, and the proteolysis  of glycoproteins depends on the initial removal of the carbohydrate side chains.  in the present report, we tested the relationship between the beta-galactosidase  activity in saliva and parameters that influence oral malodor, including daily habits and oral conditions. the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria was also  examined. forty-nine saliva samples were collected from halitosis patients. patients were examined for breath odor and other associated parameters. their breath odor was assessed using an organoleptic test, a portable sulfide monitor and gas chromatography. the presence of periodontopathic bacteria in the saliva was also examined. beta-galactosidase activity was measured with the chromogenic  substrates 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside and isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside. beta-galactosidase activity was positively correlated with malodor strength (organoleptic score, portable sulfide monitor score and vsc concentrations). enzyme activity was also correlated with the degree of observable tongue coating. however, it showed no relationship with  periodontal condition, saliva flow, tooth decay, unfitted restorations or the color of any tongue coating. while there was no relationship with porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, there was a negative correlation with prevotella intermedia. these results indicate that beta-galactosidase activity plays an important role in malodor production. interestingly, the activity of this enzyme was not related to the presence of periodontopathic bacteria, which are the main malodor-producing organisms. the results obtained here may have been associated with physiologic halitosis, which is not necessarily associated with oral problems or with periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == effect of teenage smoking on the prevalence of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to investigate how teenage smoking affects the prevalence of periodontal bacteria and periodontal health with the hypothesis that smoking increases the prevalence of the bacteria. oral health of 264 adolescents (15- to 16-year-olds) was clinically examined, and their smoking history was recorded. the participants also filled in a structured questionnaire  recording their general health and health habits. pooled subgingival plaque samples were taken for polymerase chain reaction analysis of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. the prevalence of p.  intermedia (21% vs. 4%, p = 0.01) and t. forsythia and t. denticola (23% vs. 8%,  p < 0.05, for both) was higher among female smokers than among non-smokers. t. forsythia and t. denticola were more often associated with bleeding on probing (29% vs. 12%; 25% vs. 10%, respectively) and deep pockets (25% vs. 15%; 23% vs. 10%, respectively) with smokers than non-smokers. among the girls, a significant  association was found between pack-years and the prevalence of p. nigrescens (p < 0.007). in both genders, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were rare in  this study. to conclude, periodontal bacteria were associated with higher periodontal index scores among all teenage smokers. smoking girls harbored more frequently certain periodontal bacteria than non-smokers, but this was not seen in boys. hence, our study hypothesis was only partly confirmed.

TI  == prognosis of periodontitis recurrence after intensive periodontal treatment using examination of serum igg antibody titer against periodontal bacteria.
AB  == chronic periodontitis is associated with systemic diseases such as atherosclerosis. in this study, we evaluated the efficacy of serum igg antibody titer to periodontal bacteria for prognosis of periodontitis recurrence during supportive periodontal therapy (spt) phase. the 139 patients during spt phase were selected and divided to two groups as follows: "stable" and "recurrence" group at spt phase for case-control study: "high igg titer" and "normal igg titer" group before transition to spt phase for cohort study. we examined whether clinical findings or serum igg antibody titers to periodontal bacteria are risk factors for the development of periodontitis recurrence. case-control study showed that there were significant differences between the stable and recurrence  groups in age and number of teeth. the serum igg antibody titer to eikenella corrodens fdc1073, porphyromonas gingivalis su63, and campylobacter rectus atcc33238 was significantly higher in the recurrence group. next, we found, that  the recurrence ratio in the high igg titer group to gram-negative obligate anaerobe, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and c. rectus was significantly higher than that of the normal igg titer group. taken together, serum igg antibody titer test is useful in the prognosis of periodontitis recurrence during the spt phase.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (apdt) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. the dogs were randomly treated with apdt using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (srp), or with the association of treatments (srp + apdt). plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were  determined using dna-dna hybridization. gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), receptor activator of nf-kb ligand (rankl), osteoprotegerin (opg), matrix metalloproteinase (mmp-1), interleukin (il) 6, il-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 s rrna gene  were evaluated through real-time pcr. the results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for apdt and srp + apdt. after 4 weeks, a regrowth of porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00)  and treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the apdt (p = 0.00). for the cytokine pattern, the results were  similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. our results suggest that srp, apdt in a single application, and srp + apdt affects different bacterial species  and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.

TI  == effect of khat chewing on periodontal pathogens in subgingival biofilm from chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == aims: existing in vitro and in vivo data suggest that khat may have a favorable effect on periodontal microbiota. the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of khat chewing on major periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from subjects with chronic periodontitis. materials and methods: 40 subgingival plaque samples were obtained from periodontitis and healthy sites of  10 khat chewers (40 y median age) and 10 khat non-chewers (37.5 y median age) with chronic periodontitis. absolute and relative counts of 6 periodontal pathogens were determined in each sample using highly sensitive and specific taqman real-time pcr assays. data were analyzed using an ordinal regression model. results: significantly more total bacteria were detected in samples from the periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=20). treponema denticola was present at significantly higher absolute counts at the healthy as well as periodontitis sites of the khat chewers (or=3.13 and 13, respectively). however,  the khat chewers harbored significantly lower absolute counts of porphyromonas gingivalis at the healthy sites (or=0.07). furthermore, khat chewing was significantly associated with lower relative counts of porphyromonas gingivalis,  fusobacterium ssp., prevotella ssp. and parvimonas micra-like species in subgingival plaque samples from both healthy and periodontitis sites (or=0.11-0.33). only treponema denticola was found in higher relative counts at the healthy sites of the khat chewers (or=2.98). conclusions: overall, there was  a lower burden of pathogens in the khat chewers. findings from the current study  are suggestive of a potential prebiotic effect for khat on periodontal microbiota.

TI  == relationship between oral status and prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongues of elderly individuals.
AB  == colonization of periodontopathic bacteria is associated with increased risk of systemic diseases. however, few studies have investigated the relationships between oral status factors and health-related quality of life (hr-qol) and the prevalence of such bacteria in elderly individuals. this study investigated the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia in 165 community-dwelling functionally independent 85-year-old japanese individuals (93 dentate, 72 edentulous) and the  relationship to oral status, including oral malodour and hr-qol. all four of the  studied periodontopathic bacteria were found more frequently in tongue coating samples from dentate than edentulous subjects, and the prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola was significantly related to the number of teeth with a periodontal pocket depth >/=4 mm. these results suggest the existence of a stable circulation of periodontopathic bacteria between the gingival sulcus and tongue coating over time with teeth. in addition, the presence of teeth with a deep pocket and colonization of treponema denticola were positively related to the level of ch(3)sh, whilst the number of present teeth contributed positively to hr-qol, especially with regard to mental health. in conclusion, as the dentate state can  retain colonization of periodontopathic pathogens in the oral cavity, both periodontal treatment and tongue care are important for maintaining a healthy oral status in the elderly, and possibly result in avoidance of risk for tooth loss and decline in hr-qol, as well as protecting from systemic diseases.

TI  == [association between phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia and periodontopathic  bacteria in institutionalized patients with severe motor and intellectual disabilities].
AB  == the association between phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia (pigh) and five major periodontopathic bacteria was investigated by real-time pcr in 12 subjects  (30.6 +/- 7.95 years of age) with severe motor and intellectual disabilities. the subjects had not received antibiotics or periodontal therapy within three months. a healthy gingival site or a site with the lowest gingival hyperplasia score (minimum site), and a site with the maximum score of gingival hyperplasia (maximum site) on each subject were selected for investigation. the clinical parameters were measured after microbial sampling. the following results were obtained: 1. the detection rates of both treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis were 75% (9/12) at the maximum sites, and that of tannerella forsythia was 33.3% (4/12). the detection rate of prevotella intermedia was 58.3% (7/12), but no significant correlation was observed between this bacterium and the other  types of bacteria in quantitative analysis. 2. the detection rate of p. gingivalis with type ii fima was 25% (1/4) at the minimum sites, and 83.3% (5/6)  at the maximum sites. 3. the samples were divided into three groups; namely, those with no detection of p. gingivalis at either the minimum sites or the maximum sites, no detection at the minimum sites but detection at the maximum sites, and detection at both sites. in conclusion, 1) the detection rates of t. denticola and p. gingivalis were the highest at the maximum sites. in particular, the detection rate of p. gingivalis with type ii fima was high in the present study, and 2) the subgingival microflora was diverse because of the diverse severity of gingival inflammation associated with pigh.

TI  == characterization of the normal bacterial flora in peri-implant sulci of partially and completely edentulous patients.
AB  == purpose: to characterize the normal bacterial flora and evaluate the presence of  periodontopathogenic bacteria around dental implants and to correlate them with the periodontal flora or, in completely edentulous patients, the alveolar gingival flora. materials and methods: clinical and radiographic parameters were  recorded to exclude peri-implantitis in 34 partially edentulous and 19 completely edentulous patients. partially edentulous patients were subdivided into two subgroups based on the depth of the periodontal pocket: </= 4 mm (n = 19) and > 4 mm (n = 15). microbial samples were collected from peri-implant sulci, the deepest periodontal sulci, and, for completely edentulous patients, from the alveolar gingiva. predominant aerobic bacteria were determined by microbiologic culturing, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction was used to detect five periodontopathogenic bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. results: in all the examined patients, oral streptococci were the most frequent aerobic peri-implant bacteria. the frequency of four periodontopathogenic bacteria in tooth sulci (a actino?mycetemcomitans, p gingivalis, t forsythensis, t denticola) was significantly higher around natural  teeth with deeper periodontal pockets, but there was no significant difference in the frequency of the same bacteria in peri-implant sulci in the two partially edentulous subgroups. in contrast, there were no such bacteria in the peri-implant sulci or the alveolar gingiva of completely edentulous patients. conclusions: in healthy peri-implant sulci, oral streptococci constitute the predominant bacterial flora. in partially edentulous patients four periodontopathogenic bacteria were detected around implants, and none of these bacteria were found around implants in completely edentulous patients.

TI  == examination of periodontal pathogens in stenotic valve specimens and in whole blood samples in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == periodontitis may be a risk factor for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. the influence of periodontal pathogens in cardiovascular diseases needs  further investigation. therefore, the aims of this clinical study are: to test the presence of periodontal bacteria dna in aortic valves and to assess the concomitant presence of the same periodontal bacteria dna in whole blood samples  in patients affected by aortic valve stenosis and chronic periodontitis. nineteen consecutive patients (12 males and 7 females, age: 49-85 years) were enrolled in  this study after having been subjected to a complete periodontal evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of chronic periodontitis. all patients were scheduled for aortic valve replacement surgery. after clinical and microbial periodontal examination, the aortic valve tissue specimens were obtained by excision during valve replacement surgery and the patients were subjected to the whole blood sampling before the surgery. the polymerase chain reaction technology was used to detect the putative periodontal pathogens tannerella forshytia, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens and treponema  denticola. neither the 19 aortic valve specimens nor the blood samples were positive for the genoma of the selected periodontal pathogens. the selected periodontal pathogens did not colonize the aortic valve of patients affected by stenosis and bacterial genoma was not present in whole blood samples. a high blood pressure at the aortic valve may prevent the adhesion and proliferation of  bacterial colonies.

TI  == the del/del genotype of the nuclear factor-kappab -94attg polymorphism and its relation to aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: periodontitis is influenced by specific host-dependent  immune responses. periodontopathogens induce innate immune responses, amongst others, via toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), resulting in activation of the nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab). the aim of this case-control study was to evaluate links between genetic variants of these genes  and chronic/aggressive periodontitis in a multivariate model. material and methods: a total of 141 patients with periodontitis (63 with chronic periodontitis and 78 with aggressive periodontitis) and 81 controls without periodontitis were included in the study. polymorphisms in tlr2 (arg677trp, arg753gln) and in nf-kappab (-94ins/delattg) were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism and fragment length analyses, respectively. subgingival bacterial colonization was evaluated using a pcr/dna probe test (micro-ident). results: although there was no association of the tlr2 polymorphism arg753gln with periodontitis, heterozygous carriers (arg/gln) were at a higher risk for colonization with bacteria of the 'red complex' (corrected p-value = 0.042). the del/del genotype of the nf-kappab polymorphism was associated with aggressive periodontitis considering age, gender, smoking and approximal plaque index as potential confounders (odds ratio = 2.81, p = 0.035, 95% confidence interval: 1.08-7.33). del/del carriers had a higher risk for subgingival colonization with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (odds ratio = 2.36, p = 0.030, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-5.1; adjusted for age, gender, smoking and pocket depth(bacteria)). conclusions: the del/del genotype of nf-kappab was shown to be associated with the occurrence of aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == do elderly edentulous patients with a history of periodontitis harbor periodontal pathogens?
AB  == objectives: the presence of periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity may impact implant survival. therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens and parvimonas micra in a specific elderly population with a history of periodontitis who have never worn dentures. material and methods: thirty dentate subjects (mean age 61.7+/-7.05 years) and 30 edentulous subjects (mean age 65.8+/-8.05 years) were included in this cross-sectional study. microbiological samples of cheek mucosa and the dorsum of  the tongue were taken from all subjects. in addition, sulcus samples were taken from the dentate group. all samples were analysed using a bacterial dna-specific  polymerase chain reaction. results: all the pathogens studied were detected in dentate and edentulous subjects. when cheek and tongue samples were combined, c.  rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens presented with a similar prevalence in both groups, whereas the other species were more prevalent specifically in the dentate group (p<0.05). in dentate subjects, p. intermedia and t. denticola were present in higher frequencies in the cheek mucosa (26.67% and 66.67%, respectively), whereas p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were more prevalent in the tongue samples (26.67% and 56.67%, respectively). conclusions: periodontal pathogens may persist in the oral cavity of edentulous subjects who have had periodontal disease, even 1 year after the extraction of all teeth and in the absence of other hard surfaces in the mouth.

TI  == efficacy of amoxicillin and metronidazole combination for the management of generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of metronidazole-amoxicillin combination on clinical and microbiologic parameters in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. methods: twenty-eight patients were randomly included. the test group (n = 12) received amoxicillin-metronidazole combination and scaling and root planing; the control group (n = 16) received scaling and root planing alone. in addition to the clinical examinations, subgingival plaque samples were analyzed for total cultivable bacteria and the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella pallens, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) using polymerase chain reaction. results: all clinical parameters improved significantly compared to baseline (p <0.05) in both groups. there was a statistically significant reduction of pockets and clinical attachment gain in the combined group compared to the control group (p <0.05). total counts of bacteria also decreased significantly at 3 and 6 months in both groups (p <0.05). t. denticola and t. forsythia were the most prevalent bacteria throughout the study. t. denticola showed a continuous decrease over 6 months in the test group, whereas no change was seen in the control group beyond 3 months. p. gingivalis decreased significantly at 3 months (p <0.05), whereas t. forsythia was the only  pathogen decreased below detection limits by the combination therapy with a significant difference compared to the control group (p <0.05). conclusions: the  results from this study suggest that combined amoxicillin and metronidazole use as an adjunct to scaling and root planing leads to better clinical healing compared to mechanical treatment alone. the polypharmaceutical approach used results in a significant and substantial decrease in t. forsythia and prevents its recolonization for 6 months, suggesting that t. forsythia may determine the long-term stability of periodontal treatment outcomes.

TI  == the relationship between physiologic halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria of the tongue and gingival sulcus.
AB  == to determine the influence of oral status on halitosis, the relationship between  halitosis and periodontopathic bacteria present in plaque on the tongue and the subgingival sulcus was examined in 62 periodontally healthy adults. halitosis indicators used were the organoleptic score; gas chromatography results [total volatile sulfur compounds (vscs) = h(2)s + ch(3)sh + (ch(3))(2)s]; halimeter values; and the results of three clinical tests, plaque control record (plcr), plaque index (pli), and tongue coat status. significant correlations with organoleptic scores was observed for plcr, pli, tongue coat status, vsc amounts,  and halimeter values, indicating that halitosis in periodontally healthy subjects tended to originate from tongue plaque deposits. polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to detect six periodontopathic bacteria (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola) from the tongue and subgingival plaque. significant effects on the organoleptic scores, tongue coat status, total vsc, h(2)s and ch(3)sh amounts, and halimeter values were observed only for t. denticola and f. nucleatum and only in the tongue plaque, not in the subgingival plaque. thus, therapies developed to inhibit the growth of these bacteria may lead to future treatments of halitosis.

TI  == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI  == photodynamic therapy of persistent pockets in maintenance patients-a clinical study.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the short-term performance of a session of single photodynamic therapy (pdt) and of a conventional ultrasonic debridement (ust) in persistent pockets of maintenance patients. in a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind clinical study, patients with chronic periodontitis with at least two persistent pockets (>4 mm) were enrolled. they were treated either with ust (n = 29) or pdt (n = 25). clinical and microbiological examinations were performed at baseline and after 3 months. for ust, the mean probing depth was reduced from 5.3 to 4.5 mm (p = <0.001) and for pdt from 5.3 to 4.7 mm (p < 0.001) with no difference between the two treatment modalities. microbial counts were significantly reduced about 30% to 40% immediately after debridement but returned to baseline values a 3 months irrespective of treatment. pdt is not superior to conventional mechanical treatment of persistent pockets, but it may be a meaningful therapeutic alternative; the clinical effects were too minor to draw a definitive conclusion.

TI  == distribution of periodontopathic bacterial species in japanese children with developmental disabilities.
AB  == background: recent developments in molecular biological techniques have enabled rapid detection of periodontopathic bacterial species in clinical specimens. accumulated evidence suggests that detection of specific bacterial species enables identification of subjects at high risk for the onset of periodontitis. we investigated the distribution of 10 selected periodontopathic bacterial species in dental plaque specimens obtained from children with disabilities who were attending daycare centers. methods: a total of 187 children (136 boys, 51 girls) aged 1-6 years old and diagnosed with such disabilities as mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and autism, participated in the study. subgingival dental plaque specimens were collected from the buccal side of the maxillary left second primary molar after a clinical examination. bacterial dna was extracted from the specimens and pcr analyses were carried out to detect 10 selected periodontopathic species using specific primers for each. in addition, statistical analyses were performed to analyze the correlations among clinical parameters and the detected species. results: the most frequently detected species was capnocytophaga sputigena (28.3%), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (20.9%) and campylobacter rectus (18.2%). eikenella corrodens, capnocytophaga ochracea, and prevotella nigrescence were detected in approximately 10% of the specimens, whereas treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia were rarely found, and porphyromonas gingivalis was not detected in any of the subjects. the total numbers of detected species were positively correlated with the age of the subjects. there were 10 subjects with positive reactions for t. denticola and/or t. forsythia, in whom the total number of bacterial species was significantly higher as compared to the other subjects. furthermore, subjects possessing c. rectus showed significantly greater values for periodontal pocket depth, gingival index, and total number of  species. conclusion: we found that approximately one-fourth of the present subjects with disabilities who possessed at least one of t. denticola, t. forsythia, and c. rectus were at possible risk for periodontitis. follow-up examinations as well as preventive approaches should be utilized for such individuals.

TI  == an unusual autopsy case of pyogenic liver abscess caused by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == pyogenic liver abscess (pla) formation is thought to originate from the transmission of infection via three major routes including the biliary tract, portal vein and hepatic artery. however, about 50% of pla cases are considered to be cryptogenic. here we report an unusual autopsy case of pla associated with periodontopathic bacterial infection. a 59-year-old female suddenly developed cardiopulmonary arrest and died. despite macroscopic and microscopic examinations, the infectious routes and source of infection were unidentified, and the case appeared to be cryptogenic. since this patient had suffered severe periodontitis for a long period of time, we investigated the involvement of periodontal infection in pla formation by performing immunohistochemical analyses. we identified several periodontopathic bacterial species in the pla of  this patient, including fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia and porphyromonas gingivalis. thus, we demonstrate here that periodontal infection is a potential source of infection in the formation of pla.

AB  == background: one-stage full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) in combination with systemically administered azithromycin was shown to be clinically and bacteriologically effective in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. however, fm-srp requires 2 hours for completion. azithromycin has a long half-life. therefore, if srp of the full mouth is performed within 7 days while an effective concentration of azithromycin remains in the gingiva, the effects may be the same as fm-srp. the aim of this study was to compare the clinical and bacteriologic effects of fm-srp and partial-mouth scaling and root planing (pm-srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis, which was performed in three sessions within 7 days,  during the effective half-life of systemically administrated azithromycin. methods: thirty adult subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into three groups (fm-srp, pm-srp, and control). a clinical examination was conducted to record the probing depth, clinical attachment level gain, bleeding on probing, gingival index, and volume of gingival crevicular fluid; bacterial samples were obtained before treatment and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months thereafter.  quantitative and qualitative analyses were performed using the polymerase chain reaction-invader method. results: all clinical parameters showed better improvement in fm-srp and pm-srp groups compared to the control group, with no significant differences between the two test groups. periodontal bacteria were well controlled in the two test groups, but they tended to increase gradually 3 months after treatment in the control group. conclusion: pm- and fm-srp demonstrated comparable clinical and bacteriologic results.

TI  == quantification of periodontal pathogens by paper point sampling from the coronal  and apical aspect of periodontal lesions by real-time pcr.
AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

TI  == microbiological profile of untreated subjects with localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aim: the microbial profile of localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) has not yet been determined. therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the subgingival microbial composition of lagp. material and methods: one hundred and  twenty subjects with lagp (n=15), generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp, n=25), chronic periodontitis (chp, n=30) or periodontal health (ph, n=50) underwent clinical and microbiological assessment. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and analysed for their content of 38 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: red complex  and some orange complex species are the most numerous and prevalent periodontal pathogens in lagp. the proportions of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans were  elevated in shallow and intermediate pockets of lagp subjects in comparison with  those with gagp or chp, but not in deep sites. this species also showed a negative correlation with age and with the proportions of red complex pathogens.  the host-compatible actinomyces species were reduced in lagp. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans seems to be associated with the onset of lagp, and porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum and prevotella intermedia play an important role in disease progression. successful treatment of lagp would involve a reduction in these pathogens and an increase in the actinomyces species.

TI  == detection and quantification of five major periodontal pathogens by single copy gene-based real-time pcr.
AB  == periodontitis is a common chronic multibacterial infection in the tooth-supporting tissues. it has been shown that periodontitis patients carry higher number of disease-associated bacteria than healthy ones. the aim of this study was to generate a novel, single copy gene-based quantitative real-time pcr  (qpcr) assay for five major periodontal pathogens - aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia. the primer/probe sets were designed for conservative lipopolysaccharide-coding gene regions. they proved to be sensitive  and able to detect strains representing different serotypes of the target bacteria. the specificity of designed primers was tested using 49 selected bacterial species and no false positive or negative results were observed. we validated the assay with a case-control population, including 165 saliva samples, and proved the diagnostic accuracy by receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves. all quantified pathogens alone were able to distinguish significantly between the subjects with and without periodontitis, and provided areas under the roc curve larger than 0.5. the total pathogen burden comprising all five species  associated with periodontitis with an area of 0.821 (95% ci, 0.758-0.885, p50.001). our prominently sensitive and specific assay may have major importance  in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == comparison between polymerase chain reaction-based and checkerboard dna hybridization techniques for microbial assessment of subgingival plaque samples.
AB  == aim: to compare polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with subsequent reverse hybridization (micro-ident test) and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for the identification of 13 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were taken using paper points and curettes from two sites each with pocket depth <4, 4-6 and >6 mm at baseline and  3 months in 25 periodontitis subjects and two sites in 25 periodontally healthy subjects. samples were analysed for their content of 13 bacterial species using both assays. similarities for each species between techniques were determined using regression analysis. differences between health and periodontitis were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: three hundred and fifty samples  were evaluated using both techniques. regression analysis indicated that 10/13 test species showed significant positive correlations between the counts determined by checkerboard analysis and levels determined by the pcr-based test after adjusting for 13 comparisons. the highest rank correlations of 0.58, 0.49 and 0.46 were seen for treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum and eubacterium nodatum, respectively (p<0.0001). both tests could distinguish samples from healthy and periodontitis subjects. conclusion: detection patterns of 10/13 test species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis and healthy subjects were similar using the two molecular techniques.

AB  == background: our previous studies reported on the obstetric, periodontal, and microbiologic outcomes of women participating in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt) study. this article describes the systemic antibody responses to selected periodontal bacteria in the same patients. methods: serum samples, obtained from pregnant women at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation) and 29 to 32 weeks, were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and treponema denticola. results: at baseline, women who delivered live preterm infants had significantly  lower total serum levels of igg antibody to the panel of periodontal pathogens (p = 0.0018), to p. gingivalis (p = 0.0013), and to f. nucleatum (p = 0.0200) than women who delivered at term. these differences were not significant at 29 to 32 weeks. changes in igg levels between baseline and 29 to 32 weeks were not associated with preterm birth when adjusted for treatment group, clinical center, race, or age. in addition, delivery of low birth weight infants was not associated with levels of antibody at baseline or with antibody changes during pregnancy. conclusions: live preterm birth is associated with decreased levels of igg antibody to periodontal pathogens in women with periodontitis when assessed during the second trimester. changes in igg antibody during pregnancy are not associated with birth outcomes.

TI  == interleukin-2 -330 and 166 gene polymorphisms in relation to aggressive or chronic periodontitis and the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: as a pro-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-2 mediates  the activation, growth and differentiation of t and b lymphocytes and natural killer cells. promoter polymorphisms of the interleukin-2 gene have been associated with altered interleukin-2 production or identified as prognostic markers for various infectious diseases. therefore, the aim of this study was to  evaluate two polymorphisms at positions -330 t/g and 166 g/t in patients with generalized chronic periodontitis (n = 58) or generalized aggressive periodontitis (n = 73) in comparison with periodontitis-free controls (n = 69). material and methods: both interleukin-2 polymorphisms were analyzed using the polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers. distributions of single alleles, genotypes and haplotypes were calculated using the chi-square test. risk factor analyses were carried out by logistic regression with respect to established cofactors for periodontitis. the presence of subgingival bacteria in  an individual were analyzed using a molecular biological method (the micro-ident  test). results: the interleukin-2 genotype -330 tg occurred less frequently in patients with chronic periodontitis (25.9% vs. 49.3%). moreover, this genotype decreased the adjusted odds ratio for chronic periodontitis (odds ratio = 0.394), whereas the interleukin-2 genotype 166 tt and the haplotype combination interleukin-2 -330,166 tt : tt were associated with an increased adjusted odds ratio (odds ratio = 2.82 or 2.97). for the latter interleukin-2 combination, a positive association for the subgingival presence of porphyromonas gingivalis (81.3% vs. 59.5%) and bacteria of the 'red complex' (78.1% vs. 56.0%) was shown.  conclusion: the interleukin-2 genotypes -330 tg and 166 tt, as well as the combination genotype interleukin-2 tt : tt, could be putative prognostic factors  for chronic periodontitis.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal bacteria as diagnostic markers of periodontitis.
AB  == background: assessment of periodontal conditions in epidemiologic studies usually requires a clinical examination, which is resource-intensive. we investigated the ability of serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to periodontal bacteria to reflect clinical periodontal status. methods: we used checkerboard immunoblotting to assess serum igg levels to 19 species, including established/putative periodontal pathogens and non-pathogenic bacteria, in 5,747 dentate adults aged > or = 40 years who participated in the third national health and nutrition examination survey between 1988 and 1994. three earlier described alternative definitions of periodontitis were used, based on specific combinations of probing depth and attachment level values. optimized elevated titer thresholds and corresponding sensitivities and specificities were calculated for each definition. titers significantly associated with periodontitis were identified in univariable and multivariable logistic regression models. parsimonious models were subsequently developed using age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes. results: in unadjusted models, high titers to porphyromonas gingivalis were most strongly associated with periodontitis across  all definitions (odds ratio, 2.07 to 2.74; p <0.05). in parsimonious models including demographic data, smoking, and diagnosed diabetes, high p. gingivalis titers were consistently associated with periodontitis, whereas high eubacterium  nodatum titers were associated with periodontal health in two of three definitions. receiver operating characteristic curves for the parsimonious multivariable models showed that the area under the curve ranged between 0.72 and 0.78. conclusions: serum igg titers to selected periodontal species, combined with demographic and behavioral characteristics, resulted in a moderately accurate classification of periodontal status in epidemiologic studies. the external validity of these findings must be examined further.

TI  == a review of dental implants and infection.
AB  == dental implants have become increasingly common for the management of tooth loss. despite their placement in a contaminated surgical field, success rates are relatively high. this article reviews dental implants and highlights factors leading to infection and potential implant failure. a literature search identified studies analysing the microbial composition of peri-implant infections. the microflora of dental peri-implantitis resembles that found in chronic periodontitis, featuring predominantly anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, in particular porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, anaerobic gram-negative cocci such as veillonella spp. and spirochaetes including treponema denticola. the role of staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci that are typically encountered in orthopaedic infections is debatable, although they undoubtedly play a role when isolated from clinically infected sites. likewise, the aetiological involvement of coliforms and candida spp. requires further longitudinal studies. currently, there are neither standardised antibiotic prophylactic regimens for dental implant placement nor universally accepted treatment for peri-implantitis. the treatment of infected implants is difficult and usually requires removal. in the uk there is no systematic post-surgical implant surveillance programme. therefore, the development of such  a project would be advisable and provide valuable epidemiological data.

TI  == tannerella forsythia and the hla-dqb1 allele are associated with susceptibility to periodontal disease in japanese adolescents.
AB  == periodontal disease is a multiple factor disease caused by genetic factors, environmental factors, and periodontal bacteria (periodontal pathogens). the present study aimed to elucidate the risk factors for periodontal disease in japanese adolescents. subjects (11-16 years old) were classified into three groups: localized aggressive periodontitis (lap), periodontal attachment loss (pal), and periodontally healthy (ph) groups. genomic dna isolated from the buccal mucosa was used for single-nucleotide polymorphism analyses of the candidate genes (interleukin-1alpha-889; interleukin-1alpha +4845; interleukin-1beta +3954; an immunoglobulin g fc gamma receptor, fcgammariia-r/h131; and a human leukocyte antigen class ii allele, hla-dqb1) of aggressive periodontitis. subgingival plaque samples obtained from the same subjects were used for 16s rrnabased polymerase chain reaction analysis of five important periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). tannerella forsythia was detected in the deepest periodontal pockets in all subjects in the lap and pal groups. the prevalence of  an atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 of the lap group was significantly higher than that in the ph and pal groups. furthermore, all subjects who had the  atypical bamhi restriction site in hla-dqb1 had t. forsythia infection. these results suggested that t. forsythia is associated with periodontal disease in japanese adolescents and also suggested that hla-dqb1 is related to lap and is associated with t. forsythia infection.

AB  == objective: saliva may become a potential source of contamination through vertical and horizontal transmissions as well as cross-infections. this study aims to use  saliva as a screening tool to detect putative periodontal pathogens in a young population with fairly good oral hygiene. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples were obtained from 134 dental students (20.5+/-1 years, range 18-22 years). among those, 77 subjects also completed a periodontal examination including attachment loss, modified dental, gingival and plaque indices (al, mdi, gi and pi). the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. results: one or more of the test bacteria was found in 67% of the subjects. prevotella nigrescens was detected as single bacterium in 16% of the subjects followed by treponema denticola (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis (2%), aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (1%) and tannerella forsythia (1%). two or more pathogens were detected in 42% of the subjects. clinical examination revealed health with no attachment loss (al) in 84% of the students. in no al group, 38% of the students were pathogen free while this was 25% for students in localized al group (p>0.05). there was a statistically significant association between the detection of salivary periodontal pathogen in general and higher pi (p=0.018) and gi (p=0.043). conclusion: within the limits of this study, it is possible to detect all six periodontal pathogens in the saliva of dental students. although a correlation can be observed between the presence of salivary periodontal pathogen and clinical signs of inflammation such as plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding, detection of specific bacteria in saliva is not related to the presence of localized al based on the presented study population.

AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == detection of oral bacteria in cardiovascular specimens.
AB  == background/aims: oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens, are thought to be etiological factors in the development of cardiovascular diseases. to define this relationship, we analyzed the distribution of oral bacterial species in cardiovascular specimens. method: following acceptance into  the study, 203 consecutive patients were analyzed, from whom 82 aortic valve specimens, 35 mitral valve specimens, and 86 aortic aneurysmal wall specimens, of which 16 contained aneurysmal thrombus tissues, were obtained. in addition, a total of 58 dental plaque specimens were collected from the same group of patients who underwent heart valve replacement or removal of aortic aneurysms. bacterial dna was extracted from both cardiovascular tissues and dental plaque in those cases and then species-specific polymerase chain reaction assays were used  to analyze the occurrences of six oral streptococcal and six periodontal bacterial species. results: streptococcus mutans was the most frequently detected species in the cardiovascular specimens, followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. as for dental plaque specimens from patients who underwent cardiovascular operations, most of the tested periodontitis-related species as well as oral streptococci were detected at high frequencies. furthermore, the positive rate of s. mutans in cardiovascular specimens from patients whose dental plaque specimens were also positive for s. mutans was 78%, which was significantly higher than any other tested species when the same analysis was performed. conclusion: our results suggest that specific oral bacterial species,  such as s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans, are related to bacteremia and may be etiologic factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathogen microorganisms by pcr technique].
AB  == introduction: periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting tissues  of teeth and is a major cause of tooth loss in adults. the onset and progression  of periodontal disease is attributed to the presence of elevated levels of a consortium of pathogenic bacteria. gram negative bacteria, mainly strict anaerobes, play the major role. objective: the present study aimed to assess the  presence of the main types of microorganisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of periodontal disease: porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, tanerella forsythia and prevotella intermedia in different samples collected from the oral  cavity of 90 patients diagnosed with periodontitis. method: bacterial dna detection was performed in diverse biological materials, namely in dental plaque, gingival tissue and saliva, by means of multiplex pcr, a technique that allows simultaneous identification of two different bacterial genomes. results: in the dental plaque of the periodontitis patients, treponema denticola dominated. in the gingival tissue, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were the microbiota most frequently detected, whilst in saliva treponema denticola and eikenella corrodens were found with the highest percentage. conclusion: the identification of microorganisms by multiplex pcr is specific and sensitive. rapid and precise assessment of different types of periodontopathogens is extremely important for early detection of the infection and consequently for the prevention and treatment of periodontal disease. in everyday clinical practice, for routine bacterial evaluation in patients with periodontal disease, the dental plaque is the most suitable biological material, because it is the richest in periodontal bacteria.

AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that periodontal pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis persist in extracrevicular locations following scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotics, and antimicrobial rinses. methods: eighteen patients with aggressive periodontitis received a clinical examination during which samples of subgingival plaque and buccal epithelial cells were obtained. treatment consisted of full-mouth root planing, systemic antibiotics, and chlorhexidine rinses. clinical measurements and sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. quantitative polymerase chain reaction determined the number of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola in the plaque. fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal microscopy determined the extent of intracellular invasion in epithelial cells. results: clinical measurements improved significantly following treatment. all bacterial species except p. gingivalis were significantly reduced in plaque between baseline and 3 months. however, all species showed a trend to repopulate  between 3 and 6 months. this increase was statistically significant for log t. denticola counts. all species were detected intracellularly. the percentage of cells infected intracellularly was not affected by therapy. conclusions: the 6-month increasing trend in the levels of plaque bacteria suggests that subgingival recolonization was occurring. because the presence of these species within epithelial cells was not altered after treatment, it is plausible that recolonization may occur from the oral mucosa. systemic antibiotics and topical chlorhexidine did not reduce the percentage of invaded epithelial cells. these data support the hypothesis that extracrevicular reservoirs of bacteria exist, which might contribute to recurrent or refractory disease in some patients.

TI  == [relationship of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria and drug-induced gingival overgrowth].
AB  == objective: to investigate the effect of putative periodontopathogenic bacteria on the development of drug-induced gingival overgrowth (go) in renal transplant recipients. methods: a total of 57 patients undergoing cyclosporine treatment were divided into two groups according to go index: with gingival overgrowth (group a) and without gingival overgrowth (group b). demographic, pharmacologic and periodontal data were analyzed. the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was used to detect and quantify five putative periodontopathogenic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td)  and tannerella forsythia (tf) in subgingival samples. moreover, the relationship  between the bacterial amount and the severity of go was analyzed. results: group  a presented a significantly higher plaque index, sulcus bleeding index and probing depth than group b (p < 0.01). the occurrences of pg, td, and tf in the group a (96%, 82% and 89%) were significantly increased compared with those in the group b (69%, 55% and 66%, p < 0. 05), respectively. the prevalence of pg, td, and tf in the group a (79%) was markedly higher than that in the group b (38%, p < 0.01). the bacterial amount of pg, td, tf and pi were enhanced along with the severity of go. however, the bacterial amount of aa had no difference between two groups. conclusions: pg, td, and tf may have a significant relationship with the development of go.

TI  == detection of helicobacter pylori dna in the saliva of patients complaining of halitosis.
AB  == helicobacter pylori infection, which causes peptic ulcers and gastric cancer, is  considered a possible cause of halitosis. recently, the oral cavity was identified as a possible h. pylori reservoir, particularly in the presence of periodontal disease, which is a cause of halitosis. the purpose of this study was to evaluate by pcr the prevalence of oral h. pylori in the saliva of subjects complaining of halitosis. samples were obtained from 326 non-dyspeptic subjects,  comprising 251 subjects with actual malodour and 75 subjects without halitosis. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of h. pylori and periodontopathic bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and prevotella intermedia was examined by pcr. h. pylori was detected in 21 (6.4  %) of 326 samples. the methyl mercaptan concentration and periodontal parameters  including tooth mobility, periodontal pocket depth (ppd) and occult blood in the  saliva were significantly greater in the h. pylori-positive subjects. each of the periodontopathic bacteria was also detected at a significantly higher frequency in the h. pylori-positive subjects. among those patients with a ppd of > or =5 mm and a tongue coating score of < or =2, no difference was observed in oral malodour levels between the h. pylori-positive and -negative subjects. however, the presence of occult blood in the saliva and the prevalence of prevotella intermedia were significantly greater in the h. pylori-positive subjects. h. pylori was detected in 16 (15.7 %) of 102 subjects with periodontitis, suggesting that progression of periodontal pocket and inflammation may favour colonization by this species and that h. pylori infection may be indirectly associated with oral pathological halitosis following periodontitis.

TI  == granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (gcp-2/cxcl6) complements interleukin-8 in periodontal disease.
AB  == background and objective: mucosal inflammatory responses are orchestrated largely by pro-inflammatory chemokines. the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 (cxcl6) is involved in neutrophil recruitment and migration. previous studies have shown that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 is up-regulated during mucosal  inflammation (e.g. in inflammatory bowel disease), similarly to the functionally  and structurally related chemokine interleukin-8. nevertheless, unlike interleukin-8, a role of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival inflammation has not been yet demonstrated. in this study we aimed to evaluate the expression of the chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in clinically healthy vs. diseased gingival tissues and to explore possible correlations with clinical and microbiological markers of periodontitis. material and methods: gene expression in 184 'diseased' and 63 'healthy' gingival tissue specimens from 90 patients with periodontitis was analyzed using affymetrix u133plus2.0 arrays. the expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was further confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while the localization of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 in gingival tissues was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. plaque samples from the adjacent periodontal pockets were collected and evaluated for 11 species of periodontal bacteria using checkerboard dna-dna hybridizations. results: among all known chemokines, gcp-2 expression was the most up-regulated (3.8-fold, p < 1.1 x 10(-16)), in 'diseased' vs. 'healthy' tissue as compared to  a 2.6-fold increased expression of interleukin-8 mrna (p < 1.2 x 10(-15)). increased expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlated with higher  levels of 'red' and 'orange' complex pathogens and with increased probing depth,  but not with attachment loss. immunohistochemistry showed that granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 was expressed in gingival vascular endothelium. conclusion: the level of expression of granulocyte chemotactic protein 2 correlates with the  severity of periodontitis and appears to act as a hitherto unrecognized functional adjunct to interleukin-8 in diseased gingival tissues.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == rapid quantification of periodontitis-related bacteria using a novel modification of invader plus technologies.
AB  == the invader plus technology is a sensitive, rapid method for the detection and quantification of nucleic acid. while the original technology is based on the amplification by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) of the target sequence followed  by its detection using the invader technology, the current modification allows simultaneous pcr amplification and invader reaction. the pcr primers and the invader probes are designed to operate at the same temperature. this allows simpler design and faster results. this technology has been applied for the quantification of six periodontitis-related bacteria (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, toreponema denticola, tannerella forsythensis and fusobacterium nucleatum). direct comparison of this modified invader plus with real-time pcr demonstrated similar linear range. furthermore, testing of 64 volunteers showed a good correlation between both technologies with correlation factors r2 spanning between 0.827 and 0.987. we demonstrated here that the proposed improvement of the invader plus allows the detection and quantification of dna sequences using a simple design and protocol that can be implemented in clinical testing.

TI  == treatment outcomes of dental flossing in twins: molecular analysis of the interproximal microflora.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of dental flossing on the microbial composition of interproximal plaque samples in matched  twins. methods: the study was a two-treatment, examiner-masked, randomized, parallel-group, controlled study. fifty-one twin pairs between 12 and 21 years of age were randomized to a 2-week supervised and unsupervised treatment regimen consisting of tongue brushing and toothbrushing or tongue brushing and toothbrushing plus flossing. the reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay was used to assess levels (abundance) of 26 microbial species in interproximal plaque samples collected from six sites per subject. an integrative computational predictive model estimated average changes in microbial abundance patterns of selected bacterial species from baseline to 2 weeks by comparing treatment groups. results: after the 2-week study period, putative periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria were overabundant in the group that did not floss compared to the group that performed flossing. those included treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and streptococcus mutans. microbial species that are not consistent with the development of periodontal disease or dental caries were overabundant in the group that did floss compared to the non-flossing group. conclusion: in a well-matched twin cohort, tooth and tongue brushing plus flossing significantly decreased the abundance of microbial  species associated with periodontal disease and dental caries after a 2-week program.

TI  == third molars and the efficacy of mechanical debridement in reducing pathogen levels in pregnant subjects: a pilot study.
AB  == purpose: to assess the impact of mechanical debridement (scaling and root planing), without adjunctive therapy, on reducing the numbers of periodontal pathogens detected in pregnant subjects with and without visible third molars. patients and methods: sixty-seven subjects in the second trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in an institutional review board-approved study. full mouth periodontal exams of all teeth were conducted at baseline and postpartum. presence or absence of third molars was noted. subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from the mesiobuccal of all first molars at enrollment and postpartum. subjects' total counts for periodontal pathogens in biofilm samples were determined by dna-dna checkerboard hybridization. we analyzed data from a subsample of 26 subjects. all subjects in the study were treated at enrollment by mechanical debridement of all teeth, including third molars. differences between  subjects' baseline and postpartum demographic and clinical characteristics were analyzed by chi(2) and t tests by presence or absence of third molars. statistical significance for differences in pathogen levels was determined by rank analysis of covariance. significance was set at 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons. results: most of the 26 subjects were african american (61%), on medicaid (92%), and did not smoke during pregnancy (88%). the 15 subjects with visible third molars were significantly older (28.0 years [sd 6.4]  vs 23.7 years [sd 3.9]). in the 11 subjects with no third molars noted, all pathogen counts were reduced postpartum. in the 15 subjects with visible third molars, total counts for each pathogen analyzed were higher postpartum as compared with subjects with no visible third molars, and their bacterial counts were increased for 5 of the 8 pathogens, including all "red cluster" pathogens. differences between study groups were observed by the presence or absence of third molars for t. forsythia and p. nigrescens (p = .04), and for p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, total "orange cluster" bacteria, and total pathogens (p < .06). conclusion: the efficacy of mechanical debridement to lower periodontal pathogen  counts during pregnancy was limited by the presence of visible third molars and should be analyzed further in larger scale trials.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == relationship of porphyromonas gingivalis with glycemic level in patients with type 2 diabetes following periodontal treatment.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum  glycemic levels and subgingival microbial profile alteration following periodontal treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. methods: we studied 30 periodontitis patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who received full-mouth subgingival debridement by analyzing their subgingival microbial profiles using a polymerase chain reaction method at baseline and various time-points for 12 months following treatment. concurrently, probing pocket depth, bleeding on probing, and metabolic parameters, including glycated hemoglobin a1c (hba1c), blood sugar level, c-reactive proteins, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, were recorded. results: periodontal conditions were significantly improved after treatment, and the occurrence rates of periodontal bacterial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia, were also reduced. interestingly, p. gingivalis was detected more frequently in subjects with increased hba1c values after periodontal treatment than in those patients with decreased hba1c values. furthermore, p. gingivalis with type ii fimbriae was detected only in hba1c-increased subjects, while improvements in hba1c values were observed only in subjects without type ii clones. conclusions: these results suggest that glycemic level in diabetes is affected by the persistence of p. gingivalis, especially clones with type ii fimbriae, in periodontal pockets.

TI  == analysis of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid suggests importance of cathelicidin ll-37 in the innate immune response against periodontogenic bacteria.
AB  == introduction: during periodontitis, an innate immune response to bacterial challenge is primarily mediated by neutrophils. we compared neutrophilic content  and the level of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) in two clinical forms of severe periodontitis. methods: gcf was collected from 14 patients with aggressive periodontitis, 17 patients with chronic periodontitis, and nine healthy subjects. samples were analyzed for periodontopathogen load using real-time polymerase chain reactions. the amounts of myeloperoxidase and alpha-defensins (hnp1-3) were determined by enzyme-linked  immunosorbent assay, and the level of cathelicidin (hcap18/ll-37) was assayed by  western blot. results: myeloperoxidase concentration was not correlated with levels of ll-37 and hnp1-3 in samples from patients, compared to controls. the amount of hnp1-3 was twofold and fourfold higher in patients with aggressive and  chronic periodontitis, respectively. those with chronic disease had significantly elevated amounts of mature ll-37. the increased concentration of both peptides in chronic periodontitis correlated with the load of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. conclusion: the lack of a correlation between ll-37, hnp1-3, and myeloperoxidase content suggests that neutrophils are not the sole source of these bactericidal peptides in the gcf of  patients with periodontitis; and that other cells contribute to their local production. the bacterial proteases of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola might degrade hcap18/ll-37, because the 11-kda cathelicidin-derived fragment was present in gcf collected from pockets infected with these bacteria.  collectively, it appears that a local deficiency in ll-37 can be considered as a  supporting factor in the pathogenesis of severe cases of periodontitis.

TI  == differential gender effects of a reduced-calorie diet on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB  == background and objective: dietary manipulation, including caloric restriction, has been shown to impact host response capabilities significantly, particularly in association with aging. this investigation compared systemic inflammatory and  immune-response molecules in rhesus monkeys (macaca mulatta). material and methods: monkeys on continuous long-term calorie-restricted diets and a matched group of animals on a control ad libitum diet, were examined for systemic response profiles including the effects of both gender and aging. results: the results demonstrated that haptoglobin and alpha1-antiglycoprotein levels were elevated in the serum of male monkeys. serum igg responses to campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis were significantly elevated in female monkeys. while only the antibody to fusobacterium nucleatum was significantly affected by the calorie-restricted diet in female monkeys, antibody levels to prevotella intermedia, c. rectus and treponema denticola demonstrated a similar trend. conclusion: in this investigation, only certain serum antibody levels were influenced by the age of male animals, which was seemingly related to increasing clinical disease in this  gender. more generally, analytes were modulated by gender and/or diet in this oral model system of mucosal microbial challenge.

TI  == rapid and simple detection of eight major periodontal pathogens by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.

AB  == recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested the potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, currently, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of the adjunctive use of pdt in non-surgical periodontal treatment in patients receiving supportive periodontal therapy. twenty-four patients receiving regularly supportive periodontal therapy  were randomly treated with either subgingival scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or subgingival scaling and root planing alone (control). the following parameters were evaluated at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy: full mouth plaque score (fmps), full mouth bleeding score (fmbs), bleeding on probing (bop) at experimental sites, probing pocket depth (ppd), gingival recession (rec), and clinical attachment level (cal). primary outcome variables were changes in ppd and cal. microbiological evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas gingivalis (p.g.), prevotella intermedia (p.i.), tannerella forsythensis (t.f.), treponema denticola (t.d.), peptostreptococcus micros (p.m.), fusobacterium nucleatum (f.n.), campylobacter rectus (c.r.), eubacterium nodatum (e.n.), eikenella corrodens (e.c.), and capnocytophaga species (c.s.) was also performed at baseline and at 3 months and 6 months after therapy, using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. no differences in any of the investigated parameters were observed at baseline between the two groups. at 3 months and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in terms of ppd, cal and fmps. at 3 months and 6 months, a statistically significantly higher improvement of bop was found in the test group. at 3 months  after therapy, the microbiological analysis showed a statistically significant reduction of f.n. and e.n. in the test group. at 6 months, statistically significantly higher numbers of e.c. and c.s. were detected in the test group. the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of ppd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in significantly higher reduction of bleeding scores than following scaling and root planing alone.

AB  == background and objective: the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been applied for the rapid and specific detection of periodontopathic bacteria in subgingival  plaque and is potentially of clinical benefit in the diagnosis and treatment of periodontitis subjects. however, several technical points need to be modified before the conventional pcr detection system can be used by clinicians. material  and methods: to develop a pcr-based technique more applicable for clinical use than conventional pcr, we established a multiplex pcr for five putative periodontopathic (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter  actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and two nonperiodontopathic (streptococcus sanguinis and streptococcus salivarius) species of bacteria using whole-plaque suspension as templates, and detected bacteria in subgingival plaque taken from 85 subjects at the supportive periodontal therapy stage after active periodontal treatments. results: among putative periodontopathic bacteria, the detection frequency of t. denticola and p. gingivalis was elevated in parallel with higher probing pocket depth and clinical attachment loss, and had 4.2-14.1 times increasing odds of the clinical  parameters tested. detection of any of the five species of putative periodontopathic bacteria markedly increased the odds ratio of a higher probing pocket depth, clinical attachment loss and bleeding on probing. conclusion: the multiplex pcr system developed in this study enabled the detection of all the bacteria under investigation in one reaction tube in a less time- and labor-intensive manner than conventional pcr. these results support the potential clinical use of multiplex pcr for detecting periodontopathic bacteria and for evaluating therapeutic strategies and predicting the prognosis for each subject.

AB  == this study investigated whether an improvement in periodontal health resulted in  changes in the prevalence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva and tongue coatings and a reduction in volatile sulfur compounds (vscs: h(2)s and ch(3)sh) linked to oral malodour. the subjects were 35 patients who visited the breath odour clinic of kyushu dental college, japan. their mean age was 51.2+/-18.3 years (mean+/-sd). a clinical examination performed at baseline and 2 months after periodontal treatment assessed vscs in mouth air using gas chromatography,  periodontal probing depth and bleeding on probing (bop) in all subjects; saliva and tongue coatings were also collected. genomic dna was isolated from the samples, and the proportions of five periodontopathogenic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens) were investigated using quantitative real-time pcr. the subjects were classified into four groups based on the presence of a periodontal pocket of more than 4 mm (pd) and vscs above the organoleptic threshold level (vsct) as follows: -pd/-vsct group, subjects without pd or vsct;  -pd/+vsct group, those without pd but with vsct; +pd/-vsct group, those with pd but without vsct; and +pd/+vsct group, those with pd and vsct. although the mean  pd values in the +pd/-vsct and +pd/+vsct groups, bop in the +pd/+vsct group, and  h(2)s and ch(3)sh concentrations in the -pd/+vsct and +pd/+vsct groups were greater than in the other groups at baseline, we found no significant difference  among the four groups after periodontal treatment. the proportion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva was higher in the +pd/-vsct and +pd/+vsct groups than in the -pd/-vsct and -pd/+vsct groups at baseline and after treatment, but the proportions of bacteria in saliva after treatment were reduced compared to the baseline. furthermore, the differences in the proportions of the  five target bacteria in the tongue coating were not as apparent as those in saliva at baseline or after treatment. the prevalence of periodontopathogenic bacteria in saliva may reflect periodontal health status and influence vsc levels in mouth air.

TI  == microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. dna was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. a pcr assay using species-specific primers of 16s  rdna and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. moreover, pcr detected filifactor alocis in 26.7%, treponema denticola in 24.4%, and tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. t. denticola and p. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). p. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). p. endodontalis and p. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. the results of this study indicated that e. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by pcr in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == the reproducibility of curet sampling of subgingival biofilms.
AB  == background: because few studies have examined the critical issue of sampling reproducibility, the purpose of the present study was to examine the reproducibility of curet sampling of subgingival biofilms. methods: seven subgingival biofilm samples were taken successively, using a curet, from each of  80 sites and individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. one healthy site was sampled in each of 20 periodontally healthy subjects, and one sulcus/pocket of < or =3, 4 to 5, and  > or =6 mm was sampled in each of 20 subjects with chronic periodontitis. the significance of differences in counts and proportions of individual species at the seven successive samplings for each probing depth (pd) category was determined using the kruskal-wallis test. the reproducibility of species proportions at each pd category was measured using the coefficient of variation (cv), and the consistency of microbial profiles across samples was examined using the minimum similarity coefficient. results: there was no significant difference  in the mean proportions of the 40 test species in the seven successive samples in each of the four pd categories. the median cv for individual species in the same  site was 0.79 (95% confidence interval [ci]: 0.76 to 0.82) compared to 1.76 (95%  ci: 1.69 to 1.82) in samples from different sites. the within-site mean minimum similarity coefficient (+/- sem) was 51.2% +/- 2.2%, and it was 27.9% +/- 0.3% between sites. conclusion: the proportions of species remained consistent in successive curet samples, indicating that the use of curets provided a reliable and reproducible method to obtain subgingival samples.

TI  == microbiologic and immunologic characteristics of periodontal disease in hispanic  americans with type 2 diabetes.
AB  == background: the microbiology of periodontitis in type 1 diabetes has been reported, but less is known about type 2 diabetes. moreover, these data have not  linked microbial colonization, host response, and clinical presentation in type 1 or type 2 diabetes. the objectives of this study were to relate periodontal status, periodontal microorganisms, and host-response characteristics in hispanic americans with type 2 diabetes. methods: plaque and serum samples were obtained from 63 hispanic american subjects with and without type 2 diabetes. the microbiology of subgingival plaque samples was evaluated using dna checkerboard hybridization, and serum antibody to a battery of oral microorganisms was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: in general, similar pathogens were present in periodontitis sites from subjects with and without type 2 diabetes, although the periodontitis sites in diabetes showed a higher frequency of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), and campylobacter spp. serum antibody to campylobacter rectus was elevated in type 2  diabetes, whereas antibody to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were elevated in subjects with periodontitis, irrespective of diabetes status. stratification of the population based upon antibody to p. gingivalis or c. rectus suggested a linkage between elevated antibody to p. gingivalis, increased frequency of diabetes, and significantly worse periodontitis. conclusion: the increased severity of periodontal disease with type 2 diabetes may reflect an alteration of the pathogenic potential of periodontal bacteria and/or a modification of the characteristics of the host's inflammatory response that may contribute to a breakdown in the homeostasis of the periodontium.

TI  == colonization pattern of periodontal bacteria in japanese children and their mothers.
AB  == background and objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the time of  infection by anaerobic gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, and to clarify their transmission from mother to child. material and methods: seventy-eight japanese children (including 10 siblings), aged from 3 to 9 years,  and 68 mothers, were enrolled in this study. colonization by 11 periodontal bacterial species was determined using polymerase chain reaction amplification of samples of subgingival plaque obtained from the children and their mothers. results: the detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola increased in children after the age of 6 years. we found  a high consistency in colonization by p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in 9 of the 10 siblings. the average number  of bacterial species in plaque samples harboring fusobacterium nucleatum and/or fusobacterium periodonticum was significantly greater than in those without, in both children and mothers. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga ochracea, campylobacter rectus and t. denticola in children was consistent with that in the mother. conclusion: periodontal bacterial colonization in japanese children increased with age and was associated with f. nucleatum and/or periodonticum, and the bacterial flora in children was similar to that in their mothers.

TI  == high incidence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans infection in acute coronary syndrome.
AB  == recent epidemiological studies suggest that periodontitis is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease (chd). the aim of this study was to evaluate the association between periodontitis and chd, particularly acute coronary syndrome (acs), focusing on microbiological and immunological features. twenty-eight chd patients, 15 with acs and 13 with chronic chd, were included in  this study. coronary angiography, periodontal examination, and dental radiography were performed in all patients. subgingival plaque, saliva, and blood samples were analyzed for the periodontopathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia using polymerase chain reaction. specific serum antibody titers to the 5 periodontal pathogens were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. it was found that 33% of the acs patients (5/15) harbored a. actinomycetemcomitans in oral samples, whereas no a. actinomycetemcomitans (0/13) was found in the chronic chd patients (p < 0.05). furthermore, acs patients showed significantly higher serum igg titers to a. actinomycetemcomitans (p < 0.05) compared with chronic chd. more tooth loss and alveolar bone loss were noted in acs patients than in chronic chd patients, although the differences were not statistically significant. periodontal pathogens, particularly a. actinomycetemcomitans, may play a role in the development of acs.

TI  == periodontitis may increase the risk of peripheral arterial disease.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this case control study was to evaluate whether periodontitis was associated with peripheral arterial disease (pad). subjects and methods: twenty-five patients diagnosed with aorto-iliac and/or femoro-popliteal  occlusive disease and thirty-two generally healthy control subjects were enrolled in this study. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to identify porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, cytomegalovirus (cmv), chlamydia pneumoniae, and helicobacter pylori  in tissue specimens taken from the anastomotic site of distal bypasses. periodontal status was evaluated; serum igg titres against the four listed bacteria were measured. results: periodontopathic bacteria were detected in 13/25 (52%) atherosclerotic specimens. cmv or c. pneumoniae was detected in 1/25 (4%) specimens; h. pylori was not detected from any of these specimens. fontaine grade iii or iv patients showed higher detection frequency of p. gingivalis than fontaine grade ii patients (57.1% vs 22.2%, p=0.09). after adjusting for age, gender, diabetes and smoking, periodontitis increased 5-fold the risk of having pad (or 5.45). there were preliminary indications that periodontitis was associated with increased serum il-6 and tnf-alpha concentrations. conclusions: this study suggests that periodontitis may be associated with an increased risk of pad. this association could result from the increased concentration of serum inflammatory cytokines in those with periodontitis.

TI  == innate immune responses of gingival epithelial cells to nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background and objective: we have previously reported different susceptibilities  of periodontopathic and nonperiodontopathic bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and phagocytosis by neutrophils. differences between the two groups of bacteria may exist also in their ability to induce immune responses from the host. therefore, we evaluated the effects of various oral bacteria on innate immune responses by gingival epithelial cells. material and methods: hok-16b cells were  cocultured with live or lysed nonperiodontopathic (n = 3) and periodontopathic (n = 5) bacterial species. the levels of human beta defensin-1, -2 and -3, and of the cathelicidin, ll-37, were examined by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the accumulated interleukin-8 and interleukin-1 alpha were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results:  nonperiodontopathic bacteria up-regulated some antimicrobial peptides without affecting the levels of cytokines. in the periodontopathic group, the orange-complex bacteria induced antimicrobial peptides and interleukin-8 efficiently, but the red-complex bacteria often demonstrated suppressive effects. in contrast to live bacteria, bacterial lysates had no suppressive effects. in addition, some bacterial lysates demonstrated a reduced ability to induce antimicrobial peptides compared with live bacteria. conclusion: the nonperiodontopathic, the orange-complex, and the red-complex bacteria had different effects on the innate immune responses from gingival epithelial cells,  which may affect the outcome of their host-microbial interaction in gingival sulcus.

TI  == implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. after implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. periodontal pathogens such as aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples  and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.

TI  == salivary detection of periodontopathic bacteria in periodontally healthy children.
AB  == background: salivary occurrence of periodontopathic bacteria is of interest especially in children as a risk indicator for the transmission, development and  control of periodontal disease. we assessed the prevalence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola as microbial complexes  in the saliva of children with mixed dentition and healthy gingiva. materials and methods: paraffin-stimulated saliva samples were collected from 41 children (22 boys and 19 girls), aged 6-13 years old. gingival health was determined during the initial screening exam. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr analysis. results: p. nigrescens was the most frequent species (80%), followed by t. denticola (32%), a. actinomycetemcomitans (24%) and p. gingivalis (12%). p. intermedia and t. forsythia were not detected. p. nigrescens was also common species in combinations. paired and triple bacterial combinations were found in 24% and 20% of all children, respectively. there was no positive association between bacterial combinations in colonization and subject's gender (p>0.05, fisher exact test). conclusion: the salivary presence of p. nigrescens,  t. denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis but not p. intermedia and t. forsythia can occur in childhood without clinical signs of gingival disease. thus, the possible risk of bacterial transmissions through saliva and, the need to screen for periodontal pathogens should be considered before mixed dentition.

TI  == microbiologic analysis of periodontal pockets and carotid atheromatous plaques in advanced chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: in recent years, many researchers have focused their attention on the ability of periodontal pathogens to colonize atheromatous plaques. nevertheless,  a clear correlation between the detection rates of periodontopathic bacterial dna in atheromas and in subgingival plaque samples has not been established. the aim  of our study was to assess the presence of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia [formerly tannerella forsythensis]) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same patients. methods: thirty-three patients with advanced chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy were enrolled in the study. dna was extracted from subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas. universal bacteria primers for  general detection of bacteria and species-specific primers for detection of periodontal pathogens were used to amplify part of the 16s rrna gene by polymerase chain reaction. results: all subgingival plaque samples were positive  for at least one target microorganism. the prevalence of t. forsythia, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, p. intermedia, and a. actinomycetemcomitans were 69.7%, 63.6%, 54.5%, 45.4%, and 33.3%, respectively. bacterial dna was detected in 31 out of 33 endarterectomy specimens. however, none of the samples tested positive  for dna from periodontal pathogens. conclusion: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation; thus, no correlation could be drawn between periodontitis bacteria and microorganisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions.

AB  == our 10-year study of early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients includes repeated clinical observations, microbiological characteristics and analysis of genetic polymorphism of il-1a and il-1b genes. twenty patients (age 15-26 years) were divided according to the clinical status in the 4th year into a group with mean number of teeth with bleeding on probing (bp) 9.8 and mean number of teeth with periodontal pocket (pp) 2.23, and a group with mean number of teeth with bp 5.37  and no pp. significantly higher values of mean bp and pp were found among the groups during the study but a strong progression of disease was found only in 3 patients. the risk il-1a allele-2 and il-1b allele-2 genotype and bacterial presence were analyzed by dna hybridization methods. no significant differences of bacteria composition (treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) were found between the groups. a higher prevalence of composite il-1 genotype was detected in the group of eop patients with progressive disease. early finding of the disease followed by conservative therapy could positively influence the disease progression. eop treated in early  stages may, but need not, develop into the aggressive form in the presence of risk genotype il-1.

TI  == population-based study of salivary carriage of periodontal pathogens in adults.
AB  == large, general population-based data on carriage rates of periodontal pathogens hardly exist in the current literature. the objectives of the present study were  to examine the salivary detection of aggregatibacter (formerly actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola in a representative  sample of the adult population living in southern finland and to clarify which determinants are associated with the presence of these pathogens in saliva. 16s rrna-based pcr methods with species-specific primers were employed to determine the presence of the six target bacteria in stimulated saliva samples, which were  available from 1,294 subjects aged > or =30 years. the age group, gender, level of education, marital status, smoking history, number of teeth, and number of teeth with deepened pockets were included in the statistical analysis. in general, the carriage of periodontal pathogens was common, since at least one of  the examined pathogens was found in 88.2% of the subjects. in descending order, the total detection rates were 56.9%, 38.2%, 35.4%, 31.3%, 20.0%, and 13.9% for t. forsythensis, t. denticola, p. gingivalis, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, respectively. age per se was strongly associated with the carriage of p. gingivalis (p = 0.000), and the level of education with that of t. denticola (p = 0.000). there was an association between the number of teeth with deepened pockets and carriage of p. gingivalis (p = 0.000), p. intermedia (p = 0.000), t. denticola (p = 0.000), and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p = 0.004). the data suggest that distinct species have a  different carriage profile, depending on variables such as age, educational level, and periodontal status.

AB  == aim: to evaluate and compare the microbiological effects of hand instruments, er:yag-laser, sonic, and ultrasonic scalers in patients with chronic periodontitis. patient perception of each treatment was documented. material and  methods: from 72 patients, bacterial samples were collected from the deepest pocket in each quadrant (total: 288 sites). a polymerase chain reaction kit estimated the amount of aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf), and treponema denticola (td) at baseline as well as 3 and 6 months after therapy. one quadrant in each patient was randomly assigned to curettes (h-group), er:yag laser (l-group), sonic device (s-group), or ultrasonic device (u-group). results: three months post-operatively, the amounts of pg, pi,  tf, and td were significantly reduced in all groups. laser and sonic instrumentation failed to reduce aa. six months after therapy, significant differences were still detected for pg (l- and u-group), for pi and tf (s-group), and for td (l-, s- and u-group). patients rated ultrasonic treatment as more preferable than hand and laser instrumentation. conclusion: the various treatment methods resulted in a comparable reduction of the evaluated periodontal pathogens, and bacterial increase was only partially different 6 months post-operatively. ultrasonic instrumentation caused less discomfort.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial synergy in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis.
AB  == purpose of review: periodontitis is an infectious disease, but the specific mechanisms by which tooth-supportive tissues are lost remain obscure. this article proposes an infectious disease model for periodontitis in which herpesviral-bacterial interactions assume a major etiopathogenic role. recent findings: epstein-barr virus type 1, cytomegalovirus and other herpesviruses occur at a high frequency in aggressive periodontitis lesions. also, herpesvirus-infected periodontitis lesions tend to harbor elevated levels of classic periodontopathic bacteria, including porphyromonas gingivalis, dialister  pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus (aggregatibacter) actinomycetemcomitans. summary: conceivably, a herpesvirus active infection in the periodontium impairs  local defenses, thereby permitting overgrowth and increased aggressiveness of periodontopathic bacteria. in turn, periodontal pathogenic bacteria may augment the virulence of periodontal herpesviruses. it is suggested that interactions among herpesviruses and specific bacterial species constitute an important pathogenetic feature of periodontitis and maybe also of various non-oral infections.

AB  == background: the outcome of microbiological diagnostics may depend on the sampling technique. it was the aim of the present study to compare two widely used sampling techniques for subgingival bacteria using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. methods: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. in group a, samples were taken first with a paper point and then with a curet at the same site (single-rooted teeth with probing depth >5 mm) before scaling and root planing and after 10 weeks. the sampling sequence was reversed in group b. the analysis enabled the quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythensis and total bacterial counts (tbcs). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman correlation. results: higher tbc was harvested with curets than by paper points (p = 0.008). the plaque composition with regard to total target pathogens was similar for both sampling techniques. a strong positive correlation was found between curet and paper point samples for tbc and single target bacteria. conclusions: overall, there was a relatively good agreement for the results of paper point and curet sampling. thus, both techniques seem to be suitable for microbiological diagnostics.

AB  == background: the aim of this in vivo prospective study was to detect the presence  of periopathogenic bacteria in persistent periapical lesions and to compare the reliability of two different methods: anaerobic culture and the dna hybridization technique. methods: samples were obtained from 24 patients with persistent periapical lesions referred for surgical endodontic treatment. a sterile paper point was inserted into the periapical lesion for 10 seconds. the point was stored in sterile transfer tubes and analyzed by dna hybridization. tissue samples were transported in transfer medium and analyzed further using anaerobic  culture. results: at least one periodontal pathogenic bacterium was found in seven of 24 cases. bacterial species present were treponema denticola (three cases), porphyromonas gingivalis (three cases), tannerella forsythensis (four cases), prevotella intermedia (one case), and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (three cases). no particular signs or symptoms were associated with the presence of these bacterial species. anaerobic culture failed to identify any of the periopathogenic bacteria. conclusions: periodontal pathogenic bacterial dna can be detected in persistent periapical lesions. anaerobic cultures failed to detect the periodontal pathogenic bacteria in positive hybridization assays, suggesting that standard culture methods lack sensitivity or that hybridization assays are flawed with low specificity. the clinical significance of the presence of bacterial dna in persistent periapical lesions remains to be determined.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromatous plaques.
AB  == aim: in the last years the relationship between periodontitis and cardiovascular  diseases has been a subject of increasing research. the identification of periodontopathic bacteria in atheromas can contribute to our knowledge of such an association. the aim of our study was to assess the concomitant presence of 5 periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia) in periodontal pockets and in carotid atheromas recovered from the same individuals. methods: twenty-one patients with chronic periodontitis scheduled for endarterectomy for carotid stenosis were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque samples and carotid atheromas were examined using the polymerase chain reaction and reverse hybridization techniques by means of specific probes for periodontal bacteria. human beta-globin amplification was used as internal polymerase chain reaction efficiency control. results: three patients were excluded because the endarterectomy specimens were negative to dna  amplification. all subgingival plaque samples were positive for at least one target micro-organism. the prevalence of tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was 72.22%, 61.11%, 55.56%, 50%, and 33.33%, respectively.  no periodontal bacteria dna was detected in any endarterectomy specimen. conclusions: the presence of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaques was not confirmed by this investigation and, thus, no correlation between periodontitis bacteria and micro-organisms involved in the atherosclerotic lesions could be drawn.

AB  == background: periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory infectious disease that may act as a focus of infection. preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific hypertensive disorder that often leads to maternal morbidity and mortality. acute atherosis, the placental lesion of preeclampsia, shares many histopathological features with atherosclerosis. recently, chronic infection was linked to the initiation of atherosclerosis. oral pathogens have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques, where they may play a role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. the purpose of the present study was to explore the possibility that periopathogenic bacteria may translocate into the placental  tissues of women with preeclampsia. methods: samples were taken from 16 placentas obtained from cesarean sections of women with preeclampsia and from 14 age-matched healthy pregnant women. polymerase chain reaction was used to detect  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola. results: eight of the 16 (50%) placenta specimens were positive for one or more periopathogenic bacteria in the preeclampsia group, compared to only  two of the 14 samples (14.3%) from controls. bacterial counts were statistically  significantly higher in the preeclampsia group for all of the periopathogenic bacteria examined (p <or=0.0055). although all of the target periopathogenic bacteria were found in the preeclampsia group, only three (p. gingivalis, t. forsythensis, and t. denticola) were found in the control group. conclusion: the  significant presence of periopathogenic microorganisms or their products in human placentas of women with preeclampsia may suggest a possible contribution of periopathogenic bacteria to the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

TI  == the detection of eight putative periodontal pathogens in adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients: an institutional study.
AB  == purpose: periodontal disease is a commonly prevalent problem faced alike by both  the developed and third world countries but showing wide variations in prevalence and severity across different geographical areas. the purpose was to identify actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), ekinella corrodens (ec), campylobacter rectus (cr), bacteroides forsythus (bf), treponema denticola (td) and fusobacterium nucleatum  (fn) in indian adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: paper points were used to collect the sample from 28 sites in both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis (8 healthy/20 diseased sites) patients and dna analysis done. the categorical data was analysed by fishers exact test and difference in the clinical parameters was tested by mann-whitney test. results: in healthy sites of adult and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients, aa, ec, bf and aa, pg, pi, td, fn were detected respectively. however, when diseased and healthy sites were compared in  both adult periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis patients respectively, only pg( p =0.004), cr( p =0.04), fn( p =0.014) and pg( p =0.002),  cr( p =0.02), fn( p =0.008) were statistically significant. conclusion: the prevalence of the microorganisms correlate with the clinical parameters like probing depth and bleeding on probing as seen in the japanese and western periodontitis patients' population.

TI  == subgingival chlorhexidine varnish administration as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological observations.
AB  == background: recently, the clinical additive value of a highly concentrated chlorhexidine (chx) varnish, when applied subgingivally as an adjunct to scaling  and root planing, was described. the objective of the present study was to investigate the microbiological impact of a treatment strategy for chronic periodontitis based on a combination of same-day full-mouth root planing and subgingival chx varnish administration. methods: a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel trial was conducted on 33 non-smoking chronic periodontitis patients. the control group received oral hygiene instructions and  same-day full-mouth root planing. the test group received the same instructions and treatment; however, all pockets also were disinfected using a supersaturated  chx varnish. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the deepest site per  quadrant in each patient at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. pooled sample  analysis was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method for the identification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythensis (tf), treponema denticola  (td), and prevotella intermedia (pi). results: in terms of detection frequency and bacterial levels, significant, mainly temporary, reductions from baseline were found in both groups. when a comparison was made between the control and the test group, significant differences in the detection frequency of tf (p = 0.024)  and td (p = 0.024), which favored the test group, were found at 1 month. a similar phenomenon was seen for td (p = 0.031) based on bacterial levels. an important trend toward lower tf levels in the test group also was found at 1 month (p = 0.052). compared to baseline levels, microbiological benefits in the test group seemed to be maintained, at least in part, over a 6-month period. in contrast, all microbial levels had relapsed in the control group at study termination. conclusion: the microbiological results of the present study promote the subgingival administration of a highly concentrated chx varnish as an adjunct to same-day full-mouth root planing.

TI  == a comparison of implant-supported, bar- or ball-retained mandibular overdentures: a retrospective clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic study of 10 edentulous patients attending a recall visit.
AB  == purpose: clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic comparisons of the peri-implant health in edentulous volunteers wearing long-standing implant-supported ball- or  dolder bar-retained mandibular overdentures were performed. materials and methods: ten age- and gender-matched individuals (mean age, 71 years) with either ball- or bar-retained complete mandibular overdentures, scheduled for an annual implant recall examination, were investigated an average of 7 years after implant placement. plaque and gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained from the peri-implant sulcus. the groups were compared with regard to peri-implant probing depth; plaque and bleeding on probing scores; sulcular fluid flow rates; implant  stability measurements (periotest device); relative concentrations of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola assessed by polymerase chain reaction analysis; and sulcular concentrations of interleukin-1beta and prostaglandin e2, assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. results: no statistically significant differences were found for any of the examined parameters between both study groups. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, both ball attachments and dolder bars can be recommended for overdenture retention, with either one showing satisfying clinical, microbiologic, and immunologic findings in the peri-implant tissues after several years of service in healthy recall patients with good oral hygiene habits.

TI  == microbiological outcomes of quadrant versus full-mouth root planing as monitored  by real-time pcr.
AB  == objectives: to study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (fmrp and qrp) as well as long-term effects. method: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (fmrp) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant  in four sessions at intervals of one week (qrp). microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. the samples were  evaluated by real-time pcr for quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (tbc). results: treatment resulted in a tbc median log reduction of 0.75 (fmrp) and 0.72 (qrp). there were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. conclusion: the results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.

TI  == identification of the microorganisms responsible for periodontopathy by multiplex rt-pcr.
AB  == the aim of our research was to identify by bacterial genomic dna analysis the prevalence of five different species of periodontopathogenic bacteria present in  the subgingival biofilm, specifically: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), bacterioides forsytus  (bf), treponema denticola (td). for the analysis we used the systematic multiplex-pcr-microdent kit with species-specific primers. we studied a group of  48 subjects, 18 males and 30 females, from 18 to 78 years of age. the initial clinical screening enabled us to select, among the group analysed, 24 subjects with signs of active periodontopathy (group a) and 24 patients without identifiable clinical evidence of the disease used as the control group (group b). within the two experimental groups (a and b), the test was found to be positive in 75% of subjects from group a, whereas the test was found to be negative in all the subjects from group b. our research shows that the multiplex-pcr system is reliable. furthermore, the sensitivity and simplicity of  this technique, as well as the decrease in working times and the possibility of identifying non-culturable bacteria, since the presence of viable organisms is not essential, make this technique indicated for the simultaneous identification  of periodontopathogenic bacteria and might, in perspective, provide a more effective clinical alternative to the techniques of bacterial typing of the subgingival plaque.

TI  == elevated igg titers to periodontal pathogens related to buerger disease.
AB  == background: periodontal pathogens were frequently detected in the occluded arteries of buerger disease patients, hence we hypothesized that the infection from periodontal pathogens may be associated with buerger disease. methods: we investigated periodontal status using various clinical parameters and serum igg antibody levels against t. denticola, p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. intermedia in nineteen buerger disease patients and fifteen control subjects.  the results were statistically analyzed. results: the prevalence of periodontitis and the percentages of probing sites with pd> or =4 mm and cal> or =4 mm were significantly higher in the patient group (p<0.001, p=0.016, and p<0.001, respectively). patients had significantly higher serum igg titers against t. denticola, p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.002, p=0.039, and p=0.011, respectively). conclusions: this study provides evidence for possible implications of periodontitis in buerger disease.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal species in symptomatic and asymptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  == phylogenetic analysis of bacterial and archaeal 16s rrna was used to examine polymicrobial communities within infected root canals of 20 symptomatic and 14 asymptomatic patients. nucleotide sequences from approximately 750 clones amplified from each patient group with universal bacterial primers were matched to the ribosomal database project ii database. phylotypes from 37 genera representing actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, fusobacteria and proteobacteria were identified. results were compared to those obtained with species-specific primers designed to detect prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas  gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus sp., streptococcus sp., fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythensis and treponema denticola. since members of the domain archaea have been implicated in  the severity of periodontal disease, and a recent report confirms that archaea are present in endodontic infections, 16s archaeal primers were also used to detect which patients carried these prokaryotes, to determine if their presence correlated with severity of the clinical symptoms. a methanobrevibacter oralis-like species was detected in one asymptomatic and one symptomatic patient. dna from root canals of these two patients was further analysed using species-specific primers to determine bacterial cohabitants. trep. denticola was  detected in the asymptomatic but not the symptomatic patient. conversely, porph.  endodontalis was found in the symptomatic but not the asymptomatic patient. all other species except enterococci were detected with the species-specific primers  in both patients. these results confirm the presence of archaea in root canals and provide additional insights into the polymicrobial communities in endodontic  infections associated with clinical symptoms.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

TI  == denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis as a diagnostic tool in periodontal microbiology.
AB  == bacteria play an important role in the initiation and progression of periodontal  diseases and are part of a biofilm, which can contain over 100 different species. the aim of the present study was to show the potential of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) as a tool for the detection of clinically relevant species and to compare the results of detection by dgge with those by pcr and culturing.  hybridization of the bands from the dgge profiles with species-specific probes was developed to confirm the band positions in the marker obtained with reference strains. the sensitivities of dgge compared to those of cultivation for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and tannerella forsythensis were 100, 100, 88, and 100%, respectively; and the sensitivities of dgge compared to those of pcr were 100, 90, 88, and 96%, respectively. dgge as a diagnostic tool could easily be extended to other species, as shown for treponema denticola, which could be detected in 48% of the samples. three different groups of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes  could be distinguished by dgge (i.e., a group comprising serotypes a, d, e, and f; a group comprising serotype b; and a group comprising serotype c). amplicons from p. gingivalis and t. denticola migrated to the same position in the gel, and p. intermedia produced multiple bands. in the present study we show that the dgge profiles represent clinically relevant species which can be detected by hybridization with species-specific probes. with dgge, large numbers of samples can be analyzed for different species simultaneously, and dgge may be a good alternative in periodontal microbial diagnostics.

TI  == levels of matrix metalloproteinases-8 and -9 with simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cholesterol in blood.
AB  == background and objectives: to investigate the levels of matrix metalloproteinase  (mmp) -8 and -9 with the simultaneous presence of periodontal pathogens in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) as well as mmp-9 and cholesterol in blood. although bacterial pathogens are required to initiate the periodontal disease process, in some individuals the reaction to bacteria may lead to an excessive host response, resulting in a general inflammatory response. methods: mmp-9 and lipids were analyzed from the blood samples of 33 subjects with a 16-year history and oral health records of periodontal disease as well as from 31 periodontally healthy controls. information was obtained on education, body mass index, and family history of atherosclerosis. gcf was taken to determine mmp-8 and mmp-9 levels, and bacterial samples were simultaneously collected for polymerase chain  reaction assessment of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. analysis of variance, chi-squared test, and multiple logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the results. results: demographic data showed significant differences between patients and controls in  smoking (p < 0.01), body mass index (p < 0.05), family history of atherosclerotic disease (p < 0.01), and education (p < 0.01). significant differences were also observed in oral health data, in the detection of p. gingivalis (p < 0.001), p. intermedia (p < 0.01), p. nigrescens (p < 0.001), and t. forsythia (p < 0.001) and in the levels of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gcf between patients and controls. t. forsythia[odds ratio(or) 10.1; p = 0.001] and age (or 5.54; p = 0.008) appeared to be the main independent predictors for high mmp-8 in gcf. patients had significantly higher total cholesterol (p < 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.05), and triglycerides (p < = 0.01) than controls. plasma levels of mmp-9 were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p = 0.001). conclusions: specific periodontal microorganisms appeared to induce host  response, with increased release of mmp-8 and mmp-9 in gingival pockets as well as of mmp-9 in plasma, possibly triggering its up-regulation in blood.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == antibody response after single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic debridement versus quadrant-wise therapy.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to compare serum antibody responses to periodontal pathogens after single-visit full-mouth ultrasonic debridement and quadrant-wise therapy. material and methods: thirty-six subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomized into three groups: quadrant-wise debridement in four visits, one-visit full-mouth debridement with water and with povidone iodine. blood samples were collected before and immediately after treatment and 1, 3 and 6 months post-therapy. serum antibody titres and avidity to porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and thiocyanate elisa, respectively. results: igg titres to p. gingivalis significantly decreased at 1, 3 and 6 months in full-mouth debridement with water group, while significant reductions were seen only at 3 and 6 months after quadrant-wise debridement. both full-mouth groups showed significant reduction in igg titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans at 3 and 6 months. significant increases in antibody avidity to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were noted 3 months following full-mouth debridement with povidone. conclusion: both full-mouth and quadrant treatments generally resulted  in a decrease in antibody titres and increase in antibody avidity. full-mouth debridement induced an earlier reduction of igg titre to p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans, than quadrant-wise therapy.

TI  == inhibitory effects of macrocarpals on the biological activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and other periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: macrocarpals, which are phloroglucinol derivatives contained in  eucalyptus leaves, exhibit antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria including oral bacteria. this study examined effects of macrocarpals a, b, and c  on periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis. methods: macrocarpals a, b, and c were purified from a 60% ethanol-extract of eucalyptus globules leaves. to investigate antibacterial activity, representative periodontopathic bacteria were cultured in media with or without various amounts  of macrocarpals; subsequently, the optical density at 660 nm was measured. macrocarpal inhibition of p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases was assessed by spectrofluorophotometric assay and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. the effect of macrocarpals on p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was examined with  (3)h-labeled p. gingivalis. results: growth of p. gingivalis was inhibited more strongly than growth of prevotella intermedia or prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola by macrocarpals, however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum were much more resistant. macrocarpals inhibited p. gingivalis arg- and lys-specific proteinases in a dose-dependent manner. the enzyme-inhibitory effect of macrocarpals was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis in which hemoglobin degradation by p. gingivalis proteinase was inhibited by macrocarpals. p. gingivalis binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads was also strongly attenuated by macrocarpals. conclusions: macrocarpals a, b and c demonstrated antibacterial activity against periodontopathic bacteria. among tested bacteria,  p. gingivalis displayed the greatest sensitivity to macrocarpals; additionally, its trypsin-like proteinase activity and binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  beads were inhibited by macrocarpals. these results indicate that eucalyptus leaf extracts may be useful as a potent preventative of periodontal disease.

AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

TI  == langerhans' cell histiocytosis in a 5-year-old girl: evidence of periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: langerhans' cell histiocytosis (lch) is a rare disorder characterized by langerhans' cell proliferation in various organs or tissues. when periodontal  tissue is involved, clinical manifestations can vary from gingival recession and  pocket formation to severe alveolar bone loss. this case report describes periodontal pathogens found in the pockets of involved primary teeth. methods: a  5-year-old girl with lch presented with loose teeth. intraoral examination and radiographs revealed deep pockets and severe bone loss around all primary molars. bacterial samples were obtained from saliva and subgingival plaque and analyzed for the presence of five periodontopathic bacteria using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. due to severe periodontal destruction, all primary molars  were extracted, and a gingival biopsy was taken from tooth t to confirm the diagnosis of lch. results: the biopsy specimen revealed the histologic features of lch. the patient was diagnosed as having periodontitis as a manifestation of lch. pcr results of subgingival plaque from lch-affected molars indicated the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. however, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was absent from these teeth. no tested bacteria were found  in the non-affected anterior teeth. conclusions: the bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease were detected in subgingival plaque samples from this lch patient. more microbiological data are required to understand the role of these bacteria in lch-associated periodontal destruction.

TI  == local oxygen therapy for treating acute necrotizing periodontal disease in smokers.
AB  == background: the main aim of treatment for acute necrotizing periodontal disease is fast and effective reduction of anaerobic destructive microorganisms to avoid  periodontal damage. the effect of adjunctive local oxygen therapy in the treatment of necrotizing periodontal disease was examined in this study. methods: thirty patients with acute necrotizing periodontal disease were treated with the  systemic antibiotics amoxicillin, clavulanic acid, and metronidazole. in 15 out of 30 patients, adjunctive local oxygen therapy was administered. the patients were followed from the first to 10th day of treatment with clinical and bacteriological examinations. the clinical examination registered gingival bleeding, periodontal probing depth, and attachment loss; to follow up microbiological colonization of the periodontal sulcus, five representative bacteria were registered by a semiquantitative dna polymerase chain reaction test. results: in both groups of patients, colonization with prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola was initially positive. none of these three microorganisms were completely eradicated in any of the patients in the group without oxygen therapy within the first 10 days of treatment. in the group with adjunctive oxygen therapy, all patients either showed a reduction in or complete eradication of the microorganisms, resulting in more rapid clinical restitution with less periodontal destruction. conclusions: adjunctive oxygen therapy results in early eradication of pathogenic anaerobic microorganisms in cases of acute necrotizing periodontal disease. the damage to periodontal tissue is reduced.

TI  == relationship of serum advanced glycation end products with deterioration of periodontitis in type 2 diabetes patients.
AB  == background: a close relationship between diabetes and chronic periodontitis has been demonstrated. we previously found that porphyromonas gingivalis with the type ii fima gene is an infectious factor closely associated with the deterioration seen in diabetic periodontitis patients. in the present study, we examined whether other biomarkers are related to the development and deterioration of periodontitis often seen in type 2 diabetic individuals. methods: a total of 97 type 2 diabetes patients with and without periodontitis were recruited, and their periodontal and diabetic conditions were analyzed. the  ratio (%) of teeth with an attachment loss >5 mm among all teeth in each subject  was used as an index of periodontal deterioration. peripheral blood was tested for levels of glycated hemoglobin (hba1c), advanced glycation end products (ages), c-reactive protein (crp), and cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [tnf]-alpha and interleukin [il]-1beta). subgingival plaque samples were also examined for the occurrences of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella  forsythensis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia. results: serum ages were significantly associated with deterioration of periodontitis, whereas no other serum biochemical marker or bacterial occurrence showed a clear relationship with that condition. conclusion: ages may be factors associated with diabetic periodontitis and may be useful as biomarkers that reflect such deterioration.

TI  == periodontal infections and coronary heart disease: role of periodontal bacteria and importance of total pathogen burden in the coronary event and periodontal disease (corodont) study.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation from any source is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. periodontitis is a possible trigger of chronic inflammation. we investigated the possible association between periodontitis and coronary heart disease (chd), focusing on microbiological aspects. methods: a total of 789 subjects (263 patients with angiographically confirmed, stable chd and 526 population-based, age- and sex-matched controls without a history of chd) were included in the coronary event and periodontal disease (corodont) study. subgingival biofilm samples were analyzed for periodontal pathogens actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola using dna-dna hybridization. the need for periodontal treatment in each subject was assessed using the community periodontal index of treatment needs (cpitn). the main outcome measures included total periodontal pathogen burden, number of the various periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm, and periodontal treatment needs (according to the cpitn). results: in multivariable analyses, we  found a statistically significant association between the periodontal pathogen burden (log10 of the sum of all pathogens) (odds ratio [or], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.34-2.74; p<.001) or the number of a actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (log10) (or, 2.70; 95% ci, 1.79-4.07; p<.001) and the presence of chd. in addition, a statistically significant association between an  increase in mean cpitn score by 1 and the presence of chd (or, 1.67; 95% ci, 1.08-2.58; p = .02) was observed. conclusions: our findings suggest an association between periodontitis and presence of chd. periodontal pathogen burden, and particularly infection with a actinomycetemcomitans, may be of special importance.

TI  == detection of bacterial dna in atheromatous plaques by quantitative pcr.
AB  == this is the first study to analyze atheromatous plaques for the presence of bacterial dna from ten species, including periodontal species and chlamydia pneumoniae. we examined 129 samples of dna extracted from atheromas from 29 individuals for the presence of bacterial 16s rdna sequences from ten different species: porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), tannerella forsythensis, eikenella corrodens, prevotella intermedia, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, treponema denticola and c. pneumoniae. all determinations were made using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) methods employing sybr green. species from the bacteroides family were found in about 17% of the young but approximately 80% in elderly patients. almost half of the samples contained dna from a. a. and c. pneumoniae, although the proportion of the latter was minimal. s. aureus and s. epidermidis were found with the lowest frequency, 5 and 10%, respectively. s. mutans was found in approximately 20% of the samples. the proportions of each bacterial species were calculated relative to the total amount of prokaryotic dna. the data support our previous findings of an association between periodontal organisms and vascular inflammation. we conclude  that dna from oral infectious agents is commonly found in atheromas from young but especially from elderly subjects, and that the contribution of c. pneumoniae  to the inflammation may be minimal.

TI  == inhibitory effect of weissella cibaria isolates on the production of volatile sulphur compounds.
AB  == aims: the objective of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of weissella cibaria isolates on volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) production both in vitro and in vivo. material and methods: we isolated and identified three hydrogen peroxide-generating lactobacilli from children's saliva, and assessed their inhibitory effects on vsc production and fusobacterium nucleatum proliferation. clinical studies were conducted with 46 subjects in order to measure the vsc of their mouth air. results: these lactobacilli were identified as w. cibaria. these isolates inhibited the production of vsc by f. nucleatum (p<0.05). the concentration of f. nucleatum was decreased by 5-log cycles as a result of exposure to the w. cibaria strains (p<0.05), whereas the catalase-treated w. cibaria cultures exerted no evident inhibitory effects on f.  nucleatum replication. in the clinical studies, gargling with one isolate resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of h2s and ch3sh by approximately 48.2% (p<0.01) and 59.4% (p<0.05), respectively. conclusions: these results indicate that w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit vsc production under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrating that they bear the potential for development into novel probiotics for use in the oral cavity.

TI  == early colonization of non-submerged dental implants in patients with a history of advanced aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the early colonization of non-submerged implants over a 6-month period in partially edentulous patients treated for advanced aggressive periodontal disease. in 22 patients treated for advanced aggressive periodontitis and in a supportive maintenance program for a period between 12 and 240 months at implant surgery, a total of 68 non-submerged dental  implants were installed. patients had a plaque score below 20%, and less than 20% of the pockets around the teeth were bleeding on probing (bop). using dna-probes  (micro-ident), the presence and concentration of five periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythensis (tf) and treponema denticola  (td)) were determined in the five deepest pockets of the rest dentition pre-operatively and after 6 months as well as five places around each implant 10  days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. in each patient, a test to determine the genotype interleukin-1 (il-1) was performed (pst - micro-ident). after 6 months, no difference in microbial composition as compared with baseline  was found around the teeth in five patients, in 12 minute differences and in five patients important differences were observed. ten days after surgery, three patients had a complete similar bacterial composition between teeth and implants. in 14 patients, the composition was fairly similar, while large differences in composition and concentration occurred in five patients. this microbiota around the implants remained almost unchanged over a 6-month period and did not hamper the clinical and radiographic osseointegration and did not lead to peri-implantitis, mucositis or initiation of bone destruction.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein vaccine reduces the alveolar bone loss induced by multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == objectives: heat shock protein (hsp) can be utilized as a vaccine to cross-protect against multiple pathogenic species. the present study was performed to evaluate porphyromonas gingivalis heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) as a vaccine candidate to inhibit multiple bacteria-induced alveolar bone loss. material and methods: recombinant p. gingivalis hsp60 was produced and purified from p. gingivalis groel gene. rats were immunized with p. gingivalis hsp60, and  experimental alveolar bone loss was induced by infection with multiple periodontopathogenic bacteria. results: there was a very strong inverse relationship between postimmune anti-p. gingivalis hsp immunoglobulin g (igg) levels and the amount of alveolar bone loss induced by either p. gingivalis or multiple bacterial infection (p=0.007). polymerase chain reaction data indicated  that the vaccine successfully eradicated the multiple pathogenic species. conclusions: we concluded that p. gingivalis hsp60 could potentially be developed as a vaccine to inhibit periodontal disease induced by multiple pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == relationship of periodontal bacteria and porphyromonas gingivalis fima variations with phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth.
AB  == objectives: we investigated the relationship between phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth (go) and the harboring of periodontal bacteria. materials and methods: periodontal conditions and subgingival bacterial profiles were examined in 450 sites of 75 subjects. a polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect six bacterial species; porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola (td), prevotella intermedia (pi), and prevotella nigrescens (pn). genetic variations of the pg fima gene were also examined. bacterial occurrence was compared with the severity of go, and alterations in the bacterial occurrence rate and quantities were monitored following periodontal treatment. results: the occurrences of aa, td, pi, pn, and pg with type ii fima (type ii pg) were significantly associated with the severity of go. td occurrence was reduced in association with gingival improvement following ultrasonic scaling, however, no such relationship was observed with aa, pi, pn, and pg. in addition, pg and pi markedly persisted after treatment. clinical improvement of the sites, following an er:yag laser treatment, significantly associated with quantitative reduction of pg in improved sites, however, not that of pi. conclusion: type ii pg and td were each found to  have a significant relationship with the development and deterioration of go.

TI  == streptococci dominate the diverse flora within buccal cells.
AB  == previously, we reported that intracellular actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythensis were present within buccal  epithelial cells from human subjects, as lesser components of a polymicrobial flora. in this study, we further characterized that intracellular flora by using  the same double-labeling techniques to identify fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, oral campylobacter species, eikenella corrodens, treponema denticola, gemella haemolysans, granulicatella adiacens, and total streptococci within buccal epithelial cells. all those species were found within buccal cells. in every case, species recognized by green-labeled species-specific probes were accompanied by other bacteria recognized only by a red-labeled universal probe. streptococci appeared to be a major component of the polymicrobial intracellular  flora, being present at a level from one to two logs greater than the next most common species (g. adiacens). this is similar to what is observed in oral biofilms, where diverse species interact in complex communities that often are dominated by streptococci.

TI  == impact of smoking on the clinical, microbiological and immunological parameters of adult patients with periodontitis.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the current study was to assess the impact of smoking on the clinical indices, the humoral immune response and the detection frequency of  putative periodontal pathogens in patients with periodontitis cross-sectionally and following therapy. material and methods: clinical measurements, subgingival plaque samples, gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and sera were collected from 40 untreated patients with moderate-to-advanced chronic periodontitis before and after treatment over a period of 6 months. the treatment consisted of the initial therapy of scaling and root planing. smoking status was self-reported and was confirmed by cotinine enzyme inhibition assay (ceia). whole-mouth clinical measurements were recorded with a manual periodontal probe at baseline (bas) and  at 6 months (ras). selected-site analyses were performed on the deepest site in each quadrant before and after therapy and clinical indices were recorded with an electronic pressure-sensitive probe. gcf sample volume was quantified using the periotron 6000. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was utilized to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tanerella forsythensis in subgingival plaque. enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay examined the systemic antibody titres to these bacteria, and thiocyanate disassociation determined the  antibody avidity to these organisms. results: at baseline, smokers showed significantly less gingival inflammation and lower gcf volume compared with non-smokers. after treatment, a compromised clinical outcome was noted for smokers in terms of pocket depth reduction and gain in attachment levels. no significant differences in the detection of putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque existed between smokers and non-smokers. a consistent trend was noted in that smokers had lower sera immunoglobulin g antibody titres to these organisms before and after treatment (statistically significant for a. actinomycetemcomitans). this pattern was less clear when antibody avidities were  considered, revealing only small differences, if any, between the two groups of patients. conclusion: current data indicate that smokers with periodontal disease have a suppressed inflammatory response, a significantly less favourable clinical outcome and seem to have an altered host antibody response to antigenic challenge than non-smokers. in contrast, the subgingival microflora of smokers appears similar to that of non-smokers.

AB  == background/aims: the presence of selected bacteria (enterococcus faecalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, treponema denticola) in infected root canals was studied using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays, and the association of bacteria with clinical signs of endodontic disease was assessed. the null hypothesis, that no difference could be observed between clinical signs of apical periodontitis and a specific bacterial  strain, was tested. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 62 teeth in 54  patients with endodontic disease. for each tooth, clinical data including patient symptoms were collected. teeth were categorized by diagnosis as having acute apical periodontitis (aap, teeth with clinical symptoms but no periapical radiolucency, n=22), chronic apical periodontitis (cap, teeth with radiolucency but no clinical symptoms, n=15) or exacerbated apical periodontitis (eap, teeth with symptoms and radiolucency, n=25). seventy-one percent of cases were primary  endodontic infections, and 29% were recurrent ('secondary') endodontic infections (failing cases). pcr assays were used to detect the presence of the selected bacteria. results: t. denticola and e. faecalis were each detected in 15 of 62 samples (24%), p. gingivalis in 8 samples (13%), p. intermedia in 5 samples (8%), and t. forsythensis in 4 samples (7%). t. denticola was detected in 56% of teeth  with eap. e. faecalis was found in 60% of teeth with cap and in 72% of teeth with secondary infection. statistical analysis demonstrated an association of cap and  secondary endodontic infection with the presence of e. faecalis. (p<0.01). eap was associated with the presence of t. denticola (p<0.01). conclusion: t. denticola was associated with symptomatic endodontic disease in the presence of apical bone resorption. e. faecalis was associated with treatment failures. we suggest that these species may play critical roles in endodontic pathology.

TI  == prevalence of putative periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques from gingivitis lesions in korean orthodontic patients.
AB  == the objective of this study was to detect and compare the presence of periodontopathogens in the subgingival plaques of gingivitis lesions in adults who wore fixed orthodontic appliances, as opposed to adults who did not wear any  orthodontic appliances. thirty-six individuals participated in this study. nineteen of these subjects did not wear any orthodontic appliances, and these subjects comprised the control group. the other 17 individuals had been wearing fixed orthodontic appliances for at least 3 months each. after a periodontal examination, we collected subgingival plaque samples from the gingivitis lesions  of each patient. using pcr based on 16s rdna, we detected the presence of 6 putative periodontopathogenic species, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus), prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. with regard to the presence of individual periodontopathogens, we found that t. forsythia, t. denticola, and p. nigrescens were significantly more common in the  samples obtained from the orthodontic patients than in the samples obtained from  the non-orthodontic patient controls. our results indicate that the local changes associated with the wearing of fixed orthodontic appliances may affect the prevalence of periodontopathogens in subgingival dental plaques.

TI  == clinical and microbiological evaluation of the effectiveness of the nd:yap laser  for the initial treatment of adult periodontitis. a randomized controlled study.
AB  == background: enhancement of the results obtained by scaling and planing is most often sought by using antimicrobial therapies. laser beams have been shown to be  bactericidal and could possibly target pathogens more effectively and with fewer  compliance problems than antiseptic solutions. methods: thirty subjects 20-60 years old presenting periodontal pockets at least 5 mm deep in each quadrant received initial periodontal treatment. the study had a split-mouth design. the control side (srp) only received scaling and planing, and the test side (srp+laser) was treated by both srp and nd:yap (yttrium aluminum perovskite doped with neodym) laser. clinical conditions were evaluated at day 0 and day 90 using  the plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on probing, pocket probing depth, and  clinical attachment level. microbial sampling was also performed on days 0 and 90, and the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis, and treponema denticola was analysed by polymerase chain reaction in a commercial laboratory. post-operative pain or discomfort was measured by the patient using a linear visual scale. pearson's chi-squared test was used to compare bacterial presence.  results: there was no statistically significant difference concerning clinical data between test and control groups at baseline. both treatments enhanced the clinical situation compared to baseline; however, results were not significantly  different between the two groups. t. forsythensis was the organism most numerous  in both groups. though initial treatment diminished the numbers of all the pathogens it did not do so statistically significantly. differences between test  and control groups were very small and bore no significance. evaluation of the post-operative pain did not reveal any differences between the groups. conclusions: scaling and root planing was effective in reducing levels of plaque, inflammation, and bleeding upon probing. no additional advantage was achieved by  using the nd:yap laser.

TI  == tobacco smoking and periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian population.
AB  == objectives: to explore the subgingival periodontal microflora in a saudi arabian  population with a special focus on its relationship with various smoking habits.  material and methods: a total of 198 individuals in the age range 17-60 years were included in the study. 29% were water-pipe smokers, 18% cigarette smokers, 13% smokers of both water pipe and cigarettes (mixed smokers) and 40% non-smokers. for each individual, a subgingival plaque sample from the deepest site in each quadrant was obtained. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technology was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythensis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponoma denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  selenomonas noxia and streptococcus intermedius. two cut-off levels for detection were used, score 1(10(5) bacteria) and score 3 (10(6) bacteria). results: the prevalence of individuals positive for the different microorganisms at score 1 cut-off varied from 7% to 95%. at score 3 cut-off the prevalence varied from 0% to 30%. the depth of sample site was a key factor for detection. when the depth of sample site was taken into account, no statistically significant differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers with regard to occurrence of the microorganisms studied. conclusions: no major differences were observed between cigarette smokers, water-pipe smokers, and non-smokers regarding the occurrence of the periodontal microorganisms studied suggesting that this portion of the subgingival periodontal microflora is independent of tobacco smoking.

TI  == molecular analysis of human oral microbiota.
AB  == objectives: the application of molecular, mainly 16s ribosomal rna (rrna)-based approaches enables researchers to bypass the cultivation step and has proven its  usefulness in studying the microbial composition in a variety of ecosystems, including the human oral cavity. in this mini-review, we describe the impact of these culture-independent approaches on our knowledge of the ecology of the human oral cavity and provide directions for future studies that should emphasize the role of specific strains, species and groups of microbes in periodontal disease.  materials and methods: recent findings are summarized to elucidate the relationship between periodontal disease and human oral microbiota, including as-yet-to-be-cultured organisms. results: the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method was developed to detect and quantify periodontopathic bacteria, such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus) and treponema denticola. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique allowed enumeration of large numbers of species in very large numbers of samples. 16s rrna gene clone library analysis revealed the diversity of human oral microbiota  and the existence of as-yet-to-be-cultured organisms that are presumed periodontal pathogens. in addition, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis was applied for assessment of diversity of human oral microbiota. conclusion: culture-independent approaches are useful for studying the microbial ecology in the human oral cavity and should be useful in the future to elucidate the etiology of periodontal disease.

TI  == severe periodontitis in a 5-year-old girl with hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome.
AB  == the hyperimmunoglobulin e syndrome (hies) is a multisystem disorder that affects  the: (1) dentition; (2) skeleton; (3) connective tissues; and (4) immune system.  little is known about periodontal manifestations of the syndrome. the purpose of  this report was to describe a 5-year-old girl with suspected autosomal-recessive  hies syndrome who revealed profusely bleeding and painful gingiva and generalized aggressive periodontitis. a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based microbiological examination detected porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, and campylobacter rectus in the deep periodontitis lesions. the extraction of all deciduous teeth due to a poor prognosis and risk of systemic infection led to resolution of the oral inflammation. long-term follow-up is required to determine the periodontal prognosis of the erupting permanent teeth.

TI  == dna probe identification of bacteria colonizing internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface: a preliminary study.
AB  == background: currently, there is limited knowledge concerning the specific genus and species of bacteria that may colonize internal surfaces of the implant-abutment interface (iai) of two-stage dental implants. the purpose of this study was to use dna probe analysis to identify those periodontopathic bacteria that may inhabit the internal surfaces and healing abutment screw-threads of the iai of dental implants in situ. methods: following osseointegration, bacterial samples for dna probe analysis were obtained from 54  two-stage hydroxyapatite plasma spray-coated implants in 32 patients. using sterile paper points, samples were obtained from the iai of 43 implants and the screw-threads of healing abutments in the other 11 implants. dna probes were available to detect the following microbes: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola. results: all samples taken from healing abutment screw-threads were negative for all target microbes. the aggregate percentage of positive results for each target microbe for samples from internal surfaces of the iai were: 41.9%, a. actinomycetemcomitans, 60.5%, t. forsythensis; 44.2%, c rectus; 60.5%,  e. corrodens; 48.8%, f. nucleatum; 46.5%, p. gingivalis; 55.8%, p. intermedia; and 51.2%, t. denticola. in addition, no significant differences were noted between colonization of individual microbial species when comparing anterior to posterior and maxillary to mandibular implant sites. conclusions: moderate to high levels of eight different periodontopathic microbes inhabiting the internal  surfaces of the iai of 43 two-stage implants in partially edentulous patients were identified by dna probe analysis. the microbes colonized these surfaces within 25 days following the second stage surgery and placement of the healing abutment. in contrast, all samples obtained from screw-threads of 11 healing abutments were dna probe negative. these findings appear to support those of other investigations demonstrating the translocation of bacteria from residual dentition to implants.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effect of scaling and root planing in smoker and non-smoker chronic and aggressive periodontitis patients.
AB  == objectives: to compare the effects of scaling and root planing (srp) on clinical  and microbiological parameters at selected sites in smoker and non-smoker chronic and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. materials and methods: clinical parameters including probing depth (pd), relative attachment level (ral), and bleeding upon probing (bop), and subgingival plaque samples were taken from four sites in 28 chronic periodontitis (cp) and 17 generalized aggressive periodontitis (gagp) patients before and after srp. polymerase chain reaction assays were used to determine the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. results: both cp and gagp non-smokers had significantly greater reduction in pocket depth (1.0+/-1.3 mm in cp smokers versus 1.7+/-1.4 mm in non-smokers, p=0.007 and 1.3+/-1.0 in gagp smokers versus 2.4+/-1.2 mm in gagp non-smokers, p<0.001) than respective non-smokers, with a significant decrease in tannerella forsythensis in cp sites (smokers 25% increase and non-smokers 36.3% decrease, p<0.001) and prevotella intermedia at gagp sites (smokers 25% reduction versus 46.9% in non-smokers, p=0.028). conclusion: srp was effective in reducing  clinical parameters in both groups. the inferior improvement in pd following therapy for smokers may reflect the systemic effects of smoking on the host response and the healing process. the lesser reduction in microflora and greater  post-therapy prevalence of organisms may reflect the deeper pockets seen in smokers and poorer clearance of the organisms. these detrimental consequences for smokers appear consistent in both aggressive and cp.

TI  == detection of dna from periodontal pathogenic bacteria in biofilm obtained from waterlines in dental units.
AB  == direct person-to-person transmission of periodontal bacteria through saliva has recently been widely reported and dental units have been demonstrated to retract  saliva from patients under treatment and to release it into the mouths of subjects undergoing the next operation. in this study the presence of a group of  periodontal pathogenic bacteria inside waterlines in dental units was investigated using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) based methods. briefly, 18 dental units of three different manufacturers were studied. dental units were divided into two groups according to their prevalent use in routine practice. the first group consisted of nine dental units characterized by the frequent use of high-speed dental hand-pieces directly inside the mouth and in contact with patients' saliva. the second group, as a control, consisted of nine dental units  where high-speed dental hand-pieces were not in use. a one cm section of the waterline tubing connected to the high-speed hand-piece was removed from each dental unit to evaluate the presence of dna of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola. two specimens were positive for prevotella intermedia dna. all the positive results were from samples obtained from dental units categorised in the first group. these findings clearly suggest  that dental units have the potential to transmit periodontal pathogens. manufacturers should be invited to design dental units that incorporate automated devices to disinfect duwls between patients with minimal effort by dental staff.

TI  == susceptibility of some oral microorganisms to chlorhexidine and paramonochlorophenol.
AB  == since the use of antimicrobial agents is required in endodontic therapies, this study aimed at determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of chlorhexidine digluconate and paramonochlorophenol (pmc) against microorganisms commonly found in endodontic infections. both agents were tested by agar dilution tests against pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, candida albicans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola and prevotella melaninogenica. the mic of chlorhexidine ranged from 2.67 to 80.00 microg/ml, and the mic of pmc from 46.67 to 213.33 microg/ml. the highest mic value of pmc was detected for e. faecalis whereas e. coli was the most susceptible microorganism to this agent. the highest mic values of chlorhexidine  were observed for p. aeruginosa whereas e. coli and p. denticola were the most susceptible microorganisms to this agent. since the mic values observed are much  lower than the concentrations currently used in the endodontic therapy, it is suggested that both agents are effective in reducing the microbiota in the root canal.

TI  == periodontal diseases: microbiological considerations.
AB  == the location of plaque-associated gingivitis at the gingival portion of the tooth plays an essential role in its genesis. however, at times local and other host response modifying factors also have an influence. the pathogeny of periodontitis is more complex. the microorganisms that comprise subgingival plaque are capable  of acting directly on periodontal tissues or of modifying the host response, whereas the participation of the plaque per se (normal, decreased, or increased)  is as decisive as the action of the bacteria themselves in the emergence of the disease. different types of periodontitis are associated with specific microorganisms. the most periodontopathogenic are a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and t. forsythensis. periodontitis as a whole, represent the source of complications such as root caries, endoperiodontal processes and periodontal abscesses. they are associated with various illnesses such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and respiratory infections, amongst others, as well as pathological oral halitosis. the different modalities of pcr are particularly important in the microbiological diagnosis of periodontitis, although on the negative side of things, it must be pointed out that in vitro sensitivity studies cannot be performed using this technique. first line antibiotic treatment of periodontitis  includes amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid, metronidazole (associated or not with amoxicillin) and clindamycin.

TI  == herpesviruses, the missing link between gingivitis and periodontitis?
AB  == herpesviruses appear to assume a major etiopathogenic role in various types of destructive periodontal disease. human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), epstein-barr virus (ebv) and hcmv-ebv co-infection are closely associated with disease-active periodontitis in juveniles and adults, with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis in children, and with periodontal abscesses. in particular, hcmv reactivation in periodontitis lesions seems to be linked to advancing disease. hcmv infects periodontal monocytes/macrophages and t-lymphocytes, and ebv infects periodontal b-lymphocytes. herpesvirus-infected inflammatory cells generate a great variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines and may possess diminished ability to defend against bacterial challenge. herpesvirus-associated periodontal sites tend to harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including dialister pneumosintes, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, treponema denticola, campylobacter rectus and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in summary, the available data suggest that periodontitis occurs more frequently and progresses more rapidly in herpesvirus-infected than in non-infected periodontal sites. an infectious disease model based on herpesvirus-bacteria-host immune response interactions is  presented to explain how a gingivitis lesion or a stable periodontal site with increased probing depth may convert into a tissue-destroying periodontitis lesion.

TI  == intra-familial distribution of nine putative periodontopathogens in dental plaque samples analyzed by pcr.
AB  == it is of great importance to understand the distribution of periodontopathogens within family members when considering the risk of periodontitis in children. the purpose of this study was to investigate the distribution of periodontopathogens  among family members. we used the polymerase chain reaction method to test 4,8, and 7 probands with healthy gingiva, gingivitis, and periodontitis, respectively, and their 60 immediate family members. plaque samples were collected from all erupted teeth sites using a sterile toothbrush. in 161 of the 165 positive cases, if a child harbored one of the periodontopathogens then at least one of the parents was also positive for the same bacterium. the prevalence of parent-child  co-infection was 42.9% for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 21.4% for porphyromonas gingivalis, 29.2% for treponema denticola, 59.5% for tannerella forsythensis (bacteroides forsythus) and 16.7% for prevotella intermedia. our results indicate that parents could be an important source of periodontopathogens for the colonization that occurs in their children.

TI  == detection frequency of periodontitis-associated bacteria by polymerase chain reaction in subgingival and supragingival plaque of periodontitis and healthy subjects.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare the detection frequencies of 25 bacterial species in subgingival and supragingival plaque of 18 untreated periodontitis subjects and 12 periodontally healthy subjects. genomic dna was extracted from subgingival and supragingival plaque samples, and bacterial detection was performed by polymerase chain reaction of the 16s rrna genes. fourteen bacteria showed no relationship with periodontitis, and 11 of these 14 species were frequently detected (> or =50%) in subgingival plaque in both periodontitis and healthy subjects. nine bacteria such as eubacterium saphenum, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola seemed to be related to periodontitis; their  detection frequencies in subgingival plaque samples were higher in periodontitis  than in healthy subjects, but these differences were not statistically significant by multiple comparisons (0.002< or =p<0.05). two species (mogibacterium timidum and porphyromonas gingivalis) were detected significantly  more frequently in subgingival plaque of periodontitis subjects than of healthy subjects (p<0.002), with p. gingivalis being detected only in periodontitis subjects, suggesting that these two species are closely related to periodontitis. there were no significant differences in the detection frequencies of the 25 bacteria between subgingival and supragingival plaque, suggesting that the bacterial flora of supragingival plaque reflects that of subgingival plaque.

TI  == contribution of periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa analyzed with real-time pcr to oral malodor.
AB  == oral malodor is considered to originate primarily from tongue microbiota populations. however, the relationship between oral malodor and tongue microbiota remains unclear. in this study, tongue periodontal pathogens were analyzed via real-time pcr, and the association between oral malodor and tongue periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola, was examined. the subject population consisted of 29 individuals with and 10 healthy persons without oral malodor. oral malodor was assessed by organoleptic test and volatile sulfur compound (vsc) levels as measured by gas chromatography. real-time pcr was conducted for anaerobes in tongue biofilm samples employing a lightcycler system; furthermore, bacterial proportion served as a quantitative parameter. among the five anaerobes, only t. forsythia displayed higher proportions in malodor subjects than corresponding values in healthy controls. proportions of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens correlated strongly with hydrogen sulfide concentration. proportions of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens also exhibited strong correlation with methyl mercaptan concentration. the correlation coefficient between the proportion of the total of the five anaerobes and total vsc level (r = 0.88) was greater than that between bacterial proportion and organoleptic score (r = 0.29). when a linear regression analysis was performed utilizing the proportion of each of the five periodontal pathogens as an independent variable, the explanatory power of these independent variables revealed 81% for total vsc level and 16% for organoleptic score. these results suggest that these five periodontal pathogens on tongue dorsa may contribute greatly to vsc production.

TI  == selected endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals: a molecular investigation.
AB  == bacteria located at the apical portion of the root canals are conceivably in a strategic position to induce damage to the periradicular tissues and resulting inflammatory diseases. this study sought to investigate the prevalence of 11 selected putative endodontic pathogens in the apical third of infected root canals associated with periradicular lesions. the apical root portion of 23 extracted teeth with carious pulpal exposures and attached periradicular lesions  was sectioned, and the root canals were sampled for microbiological investigation. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed for the presence of 11 bacterial species using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. the results showed that pseuramibacter alactolyticus occurred in 10 cases (44%), treponema denticola in 6 (26%), fusobacterium nucleatum in 6 (26%), porphyromonas endodontalis in 4 (17%), filifactor alocis in 2 (9%), dialister pneumosintes in 1 (4%), porphyromonas gingivalis in 1 (4%), and tannerella forsythensis in 1 (4%).  no sample yielded prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, or campylobacter  rectus. of the samples examined, 17 were positive for at least 1 of the target species. occurrence of these bacterial species in the apical third of infected root canals suggests that they can be involved in causation of periradicular lesions.

AB  == objectives: the aim of the present study was to analyze the intra- and extraoral  colonization dynamics of periodontal pathogens following supra- and subgingival debridement. material and methods: thirty five patients with chronic periodontitis were enrolled in the study. supra- and subgingival plaque samples,  saliva, and swab samples from mucosa and extraoral sites were taken at baseline and 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after mechanical periodontal therapy. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), eikenella corrodens (ec), tannerella forsythensis (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), prevotella nigrescens (pn), and treponema denticola (td) were identified by pcr. results: supra- and subgingival debridement decreased the number of subgingival sites infected with the analyzed pathogens only transiently, if at all. however, the detection frequencies of tf, td, ec, pi, and pn in the supragingival region, of pg, td, and pn at the oral mucosa sites (mostly the tongue), and of all pathogens except aa in saliva increased over the 6-month observation period. td was the only pathogen recorded in notable quantities in the extraoral habitat (external ear canal). conclusion: the results indicate that supra- and subgingival debridement results in a dissemination of periodontal pathogens within the oral cavity.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of chilean patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: an association between race/ethnicity and the composition of the subgingival microbiota has been found in chronic periodontitis. a study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of the subgingival microbiota of chronic periodontitis in chileans residing in santiago. methods: twenty-six subjects (mean age 45 +/- 7 years) with chronic periodontitis, mean probing depth (pd) 2.63 +/- 0.5 mm, mean attachment level (al) 3.70 +/- 0.77 mm, and without a  history of periodontal therapy were selected. measurements of pd, al, bleeding on probing, and plaque accumulation were recorded at six sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of every tooth and evaluated for the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the microbial data of the chileans were compared with data from 115 chronic periodontitis patients from boston, massachusetts. since several clinical and demographic parameters differed between the two populations, significance of differences for  each species was determined using analysis of covariance, adjusting for age, plaque level, mean pd, gender, and smoking status. results: each of the individual test species was present in at least 25 of the 26 subjects, and 12 subjects (46.1%) harbored all 40 test species. with the exception of prevotella intermedia, all test species colonized more than 75% of sites, and 25 species colonized > or = 90% of sites including the co-colonizing species of advanced periodontal lesions, termed the red complex, composed of the three species porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), and treponema denticola as well as fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, campylobacter rectus, peptostreptococcus micros, and treponerma socranskii. sixteen of the 40 species differed significantly between chilean and  u.s. subjects. red, yellow, and other complexes were significantly higher in the  chileans, while the actinomyces were higher in the u.s. subjects. conclusions: the composition of the subgingival plaque differs among different subject populations. thus, care should be taken when extrapolating the findings of one study to different ethnic groups.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontal pathogens using real-time polymerase chain  reaction with taqman probes.
AB  == quantitative analysis, with identification of periodontopathic bacteria, is important for the diagnosis, therapeutic evaluation and risk assessment of periodontal disease. we developed a highly sensitive and specific method using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect and quantify six periodontal  bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. species-specific taqman probe/primer sets were designed according to  16s ribosomal rna gene sequences. plaque and tongue debris specimens were collected from 10 patients with advanced periodontitis and 10 periodontal healthy individuals and analyzed. all species, except for p. nigrescens, were detected in samples from diseased sites in significantly greater numbers than in those from healthy sites, whereas greater numbers of p. nigrescens were found in the controls. these results suggest that the present real-time pcr method with the designed probe/primer sets enabled sensitive detection of the six periodontal bacteria, and may also assist future microbial studies of periodontal diseases.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing. ii. microbiological findings.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that over a period of 6 months, same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) resulted in greater reductions in the detection frequency of five putative periodontal pathogens compared with quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) in chronic periodontitis patients. materials and methods: forty patients were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups. the fm-srp group received full-mouth scaling and root planing completed within the same day, while the q-srp group received quadrant root planing at 2-weekly intervals over four consecutive sessions. selected-site analyses were performed on the deepest site in each quadrant before and after therapy, at approximately 3 and 6 months from baseline (r1 and r2) and clinical indices were recorded with an electronic pressure-sensitive probe. in addition, subgingival plaque samples were collected  from these sites at baseline (bas), at reassessment 1 (r1), approximately 6 weeks after the completion of therapy and at reassessment 2 (r2), 6 months from baseline. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used to determine the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in plaque. results: both therapies resulted in significant improvements in all clinical indices both  at r1 and r2. a marked reduction in the presence of all candidate periodontal pathogens was noted after both treatment modalities, reaching statistical significance for the majority of the test organisms. these improvements were maintained over a period of 6 months. when the two treatment groups were compared, a significantly higher percentage of q-srp patients was positive for p. intermedia at r1 compared with fm-srp patients (p<0.05). in addition, a greater reduction in the patient prevalence for t. denticola was found for the fm-srp group than the q-srp group at r1 and r2 from baseline (p<0.005), but the significance of this is questionable given the skewed detection frequency of this organism at baseline between the two treatments (p<0.01). conclusion: this study  failed to confirm that same-day fm-srp resulted in greater microbiological improvements compared with q-srp at 2-weekly intervals over a 6-month period, as  determined by pcr.

TI  == quadrant root planing versus same-day full-mouth root planing.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine whether same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp) and quadrant scaling and root planing (q-srp) resulted in variations in the systemic humoral immune response dynamics (antibody titres and avidity) during active treatment and 3 and 6 months post-therapy. materials and methods: forty patients with chronic periodontitis were recruited into this study. subjects were randomised into two groups and received either scaling and root planing quadrant by quadrant at 2-weekly intervals (q-srp group) or same-day full-mouth scaling and root planing (fm-srp group). clinical measurements and serum samples were obtained at baseline and approximately 6 weeks after the last clinical intervention (r1) and 6 months after the initiation of therapy (r2). furthermore, serum samples were obtained from each patient undergoing therapy (q-srp and fm-srp) at 3 bi-weekly instances so as to determine the short-term effects of each session of scaling and root planing on the dynamics of the humoral immune response. serum antibody titre was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and antibody avidity was measured by thiocyanate dissociation against five putative periodontal pathogens: porphyromonas gingivalis; actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; prevotella intermedia; treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus. results: both therapies resulted in similar antibody titre reductions against the majority of the organisms tested and although there was a distinct trend for antibody avidity to increase following therapy, this was not found to be statistically significant, reflecting marked inter-individual variation. in addition, no evidence emerged from this study to support increased antibody titres following the active phases of both treatment approaches due to an inoculation effect. nevertheless, significant short-term increases in antibody avidity to most test bacteria were noted for both treatment strategies. conclusion: both therapies were associated with a reduction in antibody titres and an increase in the binding ability or avidity of antibodies, but there was a marked inter-subject variability and statistical significance was reached for only some of the test bacteria. no significant differences in the humoral antibody dynamics were found  between the two treatment approaches.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal bacteria in healthy children: a 2-year longitudinal study.
AB  == objectives: to examine the occurrence of specific periodontal bacteria in children and adolescents. methods: ten putative periodontal bacteria were longitudinally examined in plaque and saliva samples from 119 periodontally healthy children (2-15 years old) using a polymerase chain reaction method. results: capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were frequently found in saliva, and tended to persist in saliva for the remainder of the study, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and prevotella intermedia were rarely detected. p. nigrescens was more frequently detected in plaque and its prevalence increased with age. eikenella corrodens and campylobacter rectus were sometimes detected in both plaque and saliva, while tannerella forsythensis was occasionally detected in saliva. conclusion: a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, p. nigrescens, c. rectus, and e. corrodens are common members of the oral microbial  flora of healthy children, whereas p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. denticola appear to be transient organisms.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a japanese population.
AB  == background: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis. other periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis, although the evidence is controversial. the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria and to clarify the microbiological features of aggressive periodontitis in japanese patients. methods: subgingival plaque was collected from 50 aggressive periodontitis (agp) patients (localized 10, generalized 40). samples from 35 generalized chronic periodontitis (cp) patients and 18 healthy subjects were examined as controls. plaque samples were examined using culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method. results: the prevalence of a. actinomycetemcomitans  was relatively low in the localized (20%) and generalized (17.5%) agp patients, with no significant difference observed in detection frequencies between agp and  the control groups (cp 8.6%, healthy 0%). on the other hand, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, and treponema denticola were frequently detected in localized as well as generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. the prevalence and proportion of p. gingivalis correlated with severity of clinical attachment loss in both localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis. conclusions: t. forsythensis, c. rectus, p. gingivalis, and t. denticola were the predominant periodontopathic  bacteria of aggressive periodontitis patients in japan. although a. actinomycetem- comitans was also detected in agp patients, the prevalence of this bacterium was much lower than that of p. gingivalis.

TI  == positive and negative bacterial associations involving dialister pneumosintes in  primary endodontic infections.
AB  == dialister pneumosintes is an anaerobic gram-negative rod that has been recently implicated as a candidate endodontic pathogen. in this study, samples taken from  abscessed teeth and infected root canals associated with asymptomatic or symptomatic periradicular lesions were examined for the occurrence of bacterial associations involving d. pneumosintes. dna was extracted from the samples, and the presence of d. pneumosintes and 16 other bacterial species was determined by  means of species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction. positive and negative associations involving d. pneumosintes were investigated by computing the odds ratio of d. pneumosintes being found in a sample from endodontic infection in co-infection with one of the other target species. the association between the pairs containing d. pneumosintes and the occurrence of pain also was evaluated. d. pneumosintes was always detected in mixed infections with at least two of the  other target species. d. pneumosintes was positively associated with treponema denticola, porphyromonas endodontalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, t. pectinovorum, and t. vincentii. negative associations were observed with bacteroides forsythus, p. gingivalis, and actinomyces israelii. no pair containing d. pneumosintes was found to be significantly associated with symptomatic cases (p > 0.01). the findings of this study lend considerable support to the notion of d. pneumosintes being an important endodontic pathogen,  usually in a mixed infection. positive associations of this species with other highly prevalent species, such as t. denticola and p. endodontalis, suggest that  bacterial synergism can occur and thereby play an important role in the pathogenesis of different forms of periradicular lesions.

TI  == pcr methodology as a valuable tool for identification of endodontic pathogens.
AB  == objectives: this paper reviews the principles of polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  methodology, its application in identification of endodontic pathogens and the perspectives regarding the knowledge to be reached with the use of this highly sensitive, specific and accurate methodology as a microbial identification test.  data sources: studies published in the medical, dental and biological literature. study selection: evaluation of published epidemiological studies examining the endodontic microbiota through pcr methodology. conclusions: pcr technology has enabled the detection of bacterial species that are difficult or even impossible  to culture as well as cultivable bacterial strains showing a phenotypically divergent or convergent behaviour. moreover, pcr is more rapid, much more sensitive, and more accurate when compared with culture. its use in endodontics to investigate the microbiota associated with infected root canals has expanded the knowledge on the bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of periradicular diseases. for instance, tannerella forsythensis (formerly bacteroides forsythus), treponema denticola, other treponema species, dialister pneumosintes, and prevotella tannerae were detected in infected root canals for the first time and  in high prevalence when using pcr analysis. the diversity of endodontic microbiota has been demonstrated by studies using pcr amplification, cloning and  sequencing of the pcr products. moreover, other fastidious bacterial species, such as porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis and some eubacterium spp., have been reported in endodontic infections at a higher prevalence than those reported by culture procedures.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of hiv-positive subjects with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == many putative periodontal pathogens associated with periodontal disease in human  immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected patients also occur in non-hiv-infected individuals. this study examined the prevalence of eight periodontal pathogens in hiv-positive and hiv-negative patients with chronic periodontitis using the 16s rna polymerase chain reaction technique. the results showed a significant prevalence of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola among hiv-negative patients compared to hiv-positive patients. sixty percent of the patients in both groups were colonized by five to six species. odds ratio analysis revealed a statistically significant positive association between three of the 28 possible combinations in the hiv-positive group. they included prevotella nigrescens/campylobacter rectus, p. nigrescens/p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens/t. denticola. although the prevalence of periodontal pathogens is similar in both the groups, the combination of certain periodontal pathogens may be responsible for chronic periodontitis seen in hiv-infected adults.

TI  == accidentally induced periodontitis in primary dentition: longitudinal examinations of periodontal bacteria and clinical conditions.
AB  == periodontitis is very rare in the primary dentition although it can be accidentally induced in young children. the purpose of this study was to describe a case of periodontitis in a 4-year-old child, which was accidentally induced by  insertion of small plastic tubes into the dental cervix of the primary incisors during play, and to discuss the clinical, radiographic, and microbiological findings. removal of the plastic tubes resulted in resolution of the periodontal  condition. prevotella nigrescens and campylobacter rectus were detected in subgingival plaque samples from the affected teeth at every examination, whereas  porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, and bacteroides forsythus were never found during the two-year observation period. the clinical and microbiological results suggest that the type of periodontitis caused by such an incidence is not progressive, unlike other periodontal diseases such as prepubertal and juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == herpesviral-bacterial interactions in aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background: human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and herpesvirus co-infections occur with significantly higher frequency in actively progressing than in stable periodontitis sites of adolescents and young adults. also, periodontal presence of cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus is associated with increased occurrence of subgingival porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, dialister pneumosintes, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. aim: this article reviews the evidence linking herpesviruses to the development of aggressive periodontitis and suggests a potential mechanism for herpesviral acceleration of  the periodontal disease process. conclusions: it seems to be a reasonable supposition that the etiopathogenesis of various types of aggressive periodontitis includes the combined action of herpesviruses and specific bacterial species. new vaccines and vaccination technologies that are being developed against herpesviruses warrant testing for their ability to induce a protective immune response against destructive periodontal disease. clearly, the  importance of combined herpesviral-bacterial infections and associated host responses in the development of periodontitis needs to be studied further.

AB  == aim: the aim of this study was to investigate the presence of antigens with immunological cross-reactivity in periodontopathogenic bacteria and helicobacter  pylori, the pathogen associated with gastritis and peptic ulcers in human. materials and methods/results: among the putative periodontopathogens tested (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola), cross-reactive bands were only detected in c. rectus by sds-page/western immunoblotting analysis using a polyclonal antibody directed to  h. pylori cells. one of these cross-reactive antigens, a 64-kda band antigen, also reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed to the human heat shock protein  (hsp) 60. the n-terminal amino acid sequence of this c. rectus protein revealed a high degree of homology with corresponding regions of other hsps belonging to the hsp60 family, indicating that the 64-kda antigen was a groel protein. the nucleotide sequence of the c. rectus groel protein coded for a 547 amino acid protein with a predicted size of 57.8 kda. comparison of the alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of the groel protein of c. rectus with that of h. pylori showed a high degree of similarity throughout its length (76.8%). groel protein from c. rectus possessed the ability to stimulate production of il-6 by a confluent monolayer of human gingival epithelial cells and was cytotoxic when used at a high concentration. conclusions: this study reveals an immunological relationship between h. pylori and c. rectus, and clearly indicates that one of the shared antigens is a groel protein possessing a biological activity that might play a role in the initiation and progression of periodontal disease.

TI  == periodontopathogens in the saliva and subgingival dental plaque of a group of mothers.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the periodontal condition and the presence of putative periodontal pathogens in 30 brazilian mothers, aging 21-40 years (28.4 4.49 years), and in their children, aging 5-6 years, since mothers can be a source of pathogens and, thus, influence their children's bacteriological and clinical condition. besides assessing the plaque index (pi), gingival index (gi)  and pocket probing depth (pd), the survey analyzed four subgingival dental plaque samples from mothers and children, as well as a sample of stimulated saliva from  mothers. those samples were analyzed by means of the slot immunoblot (sib) technique, in order to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), prevotella nigrescens (pn), porphyromonas gingivalis  (pg) and treponema denticola (td). the mean values and standard deviations of the evaluated clinical variables for mothers and children were, respectively: 1.86 0.67 and 1.64 0.68 for pi, and 1.24 0.67 and 0.82 0.37, for gi. only for mothers, the total pd was 1.81 0.69 mm, and the pd of four sites was 4.03 1.40 mm. the wilcoxon test revealed significant difference (p < 0.05) between mothers and their children only as to gi. the most prevalent bacteria in mothers were, in decreasing order: aa, pn, pg and td. the children presented patterns of oral hygiene and bacterial profiles similar to those of their mothers, in spite of the fact that most of them did not present enough subgingival plaque for testing. the comparison between mothers' subgingival dental plaque and saliva samples revealed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) for all bacteria, with greater positivity and scores in the saliva, which demonstrates that it is an indicator of oral colonization and can work as a vehicle for the transmission of periodontopathogens from mothers to their children.

TI  == correlations between bacterial levels in autologous subgingival plaque and saliva of adult sudanese.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == transmission of periodontal disease-associated bacteria from teeth to osseointegrated implant regions.
AB  == purpose: the presence of periodontopathic bacteria is a risk factor for peri-implantitis. the present study examined colonization by periodontopathic bacteria and their transmission from periodontal pockets to osseointegrated implant sulcus. materials and methods: plaque samples were collected from 105 sites in the 15 patients who participated in the study. colonization by these bacteria was examined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and culture. the transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from periodontal sites of natural teeth to the implant sulcus was analyzed by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge). results: the pcr detection rates of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola were 80.0%, 53.3%, 46.7%, 60.0% and 40.0%, respectively. colonizations by p gingivalis and a actinomycetemcomitans were statistically correlated with periodontal pockets and implant sulcus regions (p < .01). the pfge patterns of the p gingivalis strains isolated from each patient were identical, but differed from those from other patients. the pfge patterns of p intermedia strains were identical in 2 out of 3 patients. discussion: these analyses indicated that there appeared to be transmission of p gingivalis and p intermedia from the periodontal pocket to the peri-implant region. conclusion: elimination of these periodontal pathogens from the patient's oral cavity before  administering dental implant treatment may inhibit colonization by these pathogens and reduce the risk of peri-implantitis.

AB  == objectives: microbiological laboratory procedures are involved in diagnosis and therapy control of progressive and refractory forms of periodontitis. in recent years techniques have been developed based on the detection of nucleic acids. the purpose of this study was to validate the commercially available micro-dent(r) test which employs probes for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus and t. denticola. methods: 122 plaque samples obtained from periodontal pockets with various depths from 33 early onset periodontitis (eop) patients and 15 periodontally healthy subjects were analysed by cultivation and the microdent(r) kit. results: both cultivation and the nucleic acid based assay showed a positive correlation of pocket depth with the frequency and quantity of periodontopathogenic species. t. denticola was found only in pockets  > 4 mm in eop patients. comparison of the two methods revealed that the microdent(r) kit identified both p. gingivalis and b. forsythus more often than did the cultivation method. conclusions: nucleic acid techniques should replace cultivation methods as gold standard in microbiological diagnosis of progressive  periodontitis. the micro-dent(r) kit can be recommended for microbiological laboratories analysing subgingival plaque samples.

AB  == objectives: to determine the effect of scaling and root planing (srp) on the interrelations of subgingival periodontopathogens and both interleukin-8 (il-8) and granulocyte elastase activity in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), and to assess their relations to the short-term treatment response in management of chronic periodontitis. material and methods: gcf and subgingival plaque were collected from 16 subjects with untreated chronic periodontitis at baseline and 4 weeks after srp. il-8 levels were determined by elisa. granulocyte elastase activity was analyzed with a specific substrate, pgluproval-pna, and the maximal  rate of elastase activity (mr-ea) was calculated. 5 dna-probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (a. a.), b. forsythus (b.f.), p.  gingivalis (p.g.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and t. denticola (t.d.), with a sensitivity = 103 cells/paper point. results: il-8 and mr-ea levels in gcf decreased significantly after srp (p < 0.001) with a corresponding reduction of total count of the species. of the sites with probing depth (pd) >/= 5.0 mm and co-infection by b.f., p.g., p.i. & t.d. at baseline, the sites without persistent co-infection of these species after srp exhibited a significant reduction of il-8 levels (p < 0.02), mr-ea levels (p < 0.02) and pd (p < 0.01). no such change was  found in the sites where such a co-infection persisted. moreover, reduction of il-8 levels in those pocket sites was accompanied by a concomitant reduction of mr-ea (p < 0.02) and pd (p < 0.01), while no significant change in mr-ea levels and pd was noted in those pocket sites that exhibited an increase of il-8 levels  after srp. at baseline, the former group of sites showed significantly higher il-8 levels than the latter group of sites (p < 0.02). conclusions: il-8-related  granulocyte elastase activity was related to the change in infection patterns of  the target periodontopathogens following scaling and root planing. varying initial il-8 levels in gcf and a corresponding shifting change of granulocyte elastase activity in gcf may characterize the different short-term treatment responses.

TI  == microbiological, immunological and genetic factors in family members with periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic disease, associated with hematological disorders.
AB  == the microflora, immunological profiles of host defence functions, and human leukocyte antigen (hla) findings are reported for a mother, son and daughter who  were diagnosed as having 'periodontitis as a manifestation of systemic diseases,  associated with hematological disorders'. examinations were made of the bacterial flora from the periodontal pocket, neutrophil chemotaxis, neutrophil phagocytosis, and the genotypes (dqb1) and serotypes (dr locus) of hla class ii antigens. phenotypic analyses of the peripheral lymphocytes were also conducted.  the subgingival microflora from the mother was dominated by gram-negative rods, especially porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum. subgingival microflora samples from the son and daughter were dominated by gram-positive cocci and gram-positive rods. through the use of polymerase chain reaction, campylobacter rectus and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in all subjects, whereas porphyromonas gingivalis, p. intermedia, and treponema denticola were not detected in any subjects. all three subjects showed a remarkable level of depressed neutrophil chemotaxis to n-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine, although their phagocyte function levels were normal, in comparison to healthy control subjects. each subject had the same genotype, hla-dqb1*0601, while the mother had hla-dr2 and hla-dr8, and the son and daughter had hla-dr2 only. in summary, the members of this family showed a similar predisposition to periodontitis with regard to certain host defence functions. it is suggested that the depressed neutrophil chemotaxis that was identified here could be a significant risk factor for periodontitis in this family.

TI  == microbiological findings and host response in patients with peri-implantitis.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to characterise microbiota and inflammatory host response around implants and teeth in patients with peri-implantitis. we included 17 partly edentulous patients with a total of 98 implants, of which 45 showed marginal bone loss of more than three fixture threads after the first year of loading. nineteen subjects with stable marginal tissue conditions served as controls. oral hygiene, gingival inflammation, and probing pocket depth were evaluated clinically at teeth and implants. microbiological and crevicular fluid  samples were collected from five categories of sites: 1) implants with peri-implantitis (pi), 2) stable implants (si) in patients with both stable and peri-implantitis implants, 3) control implants (ci) in patients with stable implants alone, 4) teeth in patients (tp) and 5) controls (tc). crevicular fluid  from teeth and implants was analysed for elastase activity, lactoferrin and il-1  beta concentrations. elastase activity was higher at pi than at ci in controls. lactoferrin concentration was higher at pi than at si in patients with peri-implantitis. higher levels of both lactoferrin and elastase activity were found at pi than at teeth in patients. the concentrations of il-1 beta were about the same in the various sites. microbiological dna-probe analysis revealed a putative periodontal microflora at teeth and implants in patients and controls. patients with peri-implantitis harboured high levels of periodontal pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. these findings indicate a site-specific inflammation rather than a patient-associated specific host response.

TI  == direct quantitative differentiation between prevotella intermedia and prevotella  nigrescens in clinical specimens.
AB  == this paper describes a quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the differential identification of prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens in clinical samples, and compares its performance with less discriminatory culture and quantitative immunofluorescence (if) assays. fluorescence-labelled oligonucleotide probes directed to specific 16s rrna sequences of p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, prevotella pallens and prevotella denticola were hybridized under stringent conditions with cultured reference strains or plaque samples from deep periodontal pockets. probe specificity was defined with strains from multiple oral prevotella species. the lower detection level of the assays was approximately 3x10(3) target cells per ml of plaque-sample suspension. p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, p. pallens and p. denticola were detected in plaques with prevalences of 69, 67, 0 and 28%, respectively. on average, 3.9 x 10(6) p. intermedia, 3.1 x 10(6) p. nigrescens and 5.6 x 10(5) p. denticola cells were counted per positive sample. all three species were found almost exclusively in dense mixed aggregates. quantitative fish data agreed satisfactorily with corresponding if data (r=0.711). both fish and if enumerations of the sum of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens markedly exceeded the c.f.u. counts of black-pigmented colonies in porphyromonas gingivalis-free cultured subgingival plaques. the results demonstrate the validity of this new assay. unlike established if, culture, pcr or checkerboard dna hybridization assays, this fish assay differentiates quantitatively between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens, provides visual accuracy control, and offers insights into the spatial distribution of the target cells within a clinical sample.

TI  == [identification of periodontopathic bacteria dna from periodontitis-involved gingival tissue using a pcr method].
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the presence of periodontopathic bacteria dna in the granulation tissue of periodontally involved gingival tissue. forty periodontitis patients were examined. subgingival plaque and saliva samples were collected from the patients before surgery. then, granulation tissue was also collected during surgery. another 20 patients, who had more than 4 mm in probing pocket depth, were also examined as a control. they received only initial treatment without periodontal surgery. plaque and saliva samples were also collected from them. seven periodontopathic bacteria, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, toreponema denticola, campylobacter rectus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens, were detected by a pcr method from these samples of all patients. as clinical parameters, probing pocket depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on probing were recorded. one year after surgery, sampling of subgingival plaque and saliva, and measurement of clinical parameters were performed on the patients. the dna of periodontopathic bacteria was detected in the granulation tissue of 29 out of 40 patients. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, t. denticola, c. rectus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and p. nigrescens were detected in 23, 11, 12, 9, 3, 2 and 1 subject(s) respectively. the sites with undetectable level of any periodontal pathogens at one year after surgery showed a clinical attachment  gain of 2.44 mm, while those that showed detectable pathogen levels had only a 0.77 mm gain. our results indicated that the removal of granulation tissue contributed to eliminating periodontal pathogens and to avoiding re-infection by  those bacteria. complete eradication of periodontopathic bacteria would be necessary for successful periodontal treatment.

TI  == clinical and microbiological studies of periodontal disease in sjogren syndrome patients.
AB  == background: little is known about the periodontal status of patients with sjogren's syndrome (ss), a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized  by xerophthalmia and xerostomia. the aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the periodontal status of ss patients, in terms of clinical and microbiological parameters, differs from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls. methods: 8 primary ss and 10 secondary ss patients were  examined in comparison with 11 control subjects. all patients were diagnosed by the european community criteria. control subjects were systemically healthy and not undergoing periodontal treatment. the comparison of clinical status was made  in terms of mean periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival index, gingival recession, probing pocket depth, probing attachment level and bleeding on probing) as well as the frequency distribution of probing pocket depth and probing attachment level measurements. microbiological assays of the subgingival  dental plaque samples were carried out by both a chairside enzyme test (periocheck) for the detection of peptidase activity (pa) and a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) analysis for 9 selected periodontal micro-organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, streptococcus oralis). results: the  occurrence, severity and extent of periodontal lesions were not significantly different between the 3 patient groups for all periodontal parameters examined. no significant differences in the sub-gingival plaque samples from control, primary or secondary ss patients for the pa test, frequency or type of periodontal micro-organisms observed. conclusion: no significant differences could be detected in either clinical or microbiological parameters of primary or  secondary ss patients compared with that of control subjects. the results of the  present study thus support the notion that the periodontal status of patients with ss do not differ from systemically healthy age- and gender-matched controls.

TI  == maternal periodontitis and prematurity. part ii: maternal infection and fetal exposure.
AB  == clinical data from the first 812 deliveries from a cohort study of pregnant mothers entitled oral conditions and pregnancy (ocap) demonstrate that both antepartum maternal periodontal disease and incidence/progression of periodontal  disease are associated with preterm birth and growth restriction after adjusting  for traditional obstetric risk factors. in the current study we present measures  of maternal periodontal infection using whole chromosomal dna probes to identify  15 periodontal organisms within maternal periodontal plaque sampled at delivery.  in addition, maternal postpartum igg antibody and fetal exposure, as indexed by fetal cord blood igm level to these 15 maternal oral pathogens, was measured by whole bacterial immunoblots. the potential role of maternal infection with specific organisms within 2 bacterial complexes most often associated with periodontitis, conventionally termed "orange" (campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia) and "red" (porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola) complexes, respectively, to prematurity was investigated by relating the presence of oral infection, maternal igg, and fetal  cord igm, comparing full-term to preterm (gestational age < 37 weeks). the prevalence of 8 periodontal pathogens was similar among term and preterm mothers  at postpartum. there was a 2.9-fold higher prevalence of igm seropositivity for one or more organisms of the orange or red complex among preterm babies, as compared to term babies (19.9% versus 6.9%, respectively, p = 0.0015, chi square). specifically, the prevalence of positive fetal igm to c. rectus was significantly higher for preterm as compared to full-term neonates (20.0% versus  6.3%, p = 0.0002, as well as p. intermedia (8.8% versus 1.1%, p = 0.0003). a lack of maternal igg antibody to organisms of the red complex was associated with an increased rate of prematurity with an odds ratio (or) = 2.2; confidence interval  (ci) 1.48 to 3.79), consistent with the concept that maternal antibody protects the fetus from exposure and resultant prematurity. the highest rate of prematurity (66.7%) was observed among those mothers without a protective red complex igg response coupled with a fetal igm response to orange complex microbes (combined or 10.3; p < 0.0001). these data support the concept that maternal periodontal infection in the absence of a protective maternal antibody response is associated with systemic dissemination of oral organisms that translocate to the fetus resulting in prematurity. the high prevalence of elevated fetal igm to  c. rectus among premature infants raises the possibility that this specific maternal oral pathogen may serve as a primary fetal infectious agent eliciting prematurity.

TI  == periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood.
AB  == background: little information is available on periodontopathic bacterial infection in childhood. we assessed the prevalence by age of 10 putative periodontopathic microorganisms in periodontally healthy children using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay. methods: plaque samples were collected from the buccal-mesial sulcus of the first molar or second primary molar in the right upper quadrant of 144 children (2 to 13 years old, 12 subjects from each year of age) who showed negligible periodontal inflammation. using species-specific primers of porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, and treponema denticola, pcr amplification was performed with bacterial genomic dna from plaque samples. results: the results indicated that c. rectus, e. corrodens, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. ochracea, and c. sputigena were found in about 50% of the plaque samples from all age groups, while b. forsythus and p. intermedia were detected less frequently, and p. gingivalis and t. denticola were not found. in contrast, the percentage of p.  nigrescens-positive subjects increased with age in primary dentition, and reached about 50% at 7 years of age and older. subject-based analyses suggested that the  number of bacterial species in the plaque samples increased gradually with age until 5 years old, and then reached a plateau after the mixed dentition period. conclusions: the colonization of many putative periodontopathic microorganisms can occur quite early in childhood without clinical signs of periodontal disease. however, colonization by p. gingivalis and t. denticola was not detected in periodontally healthy children.

TI  == antibacterial activity of fifth-generation dentin bonding systems.
AB  == past concepts that the pulp does not become infected until an actual carious exposure takes place have been challenged. the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems single bond, prime&bond nt, and excite were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, streptococcus intermedius, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella oris, prevotella bivia, prevotella denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, and clostridium  ramosum with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as a positive control. after incubation zones of inhibited bacterial growth were measured. prime&bond nt showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. lactobacillus acidophilus and streptococcus mutans were remarkably resistant to single bond, whereas ex produced no inhibitory effect on porphyromonas endodontalis, although  the adhesive produced the maximum halo inhibition to streptococcus mutans (15+/-1 mm), showing an antibacterial effect closest to chlorhexidine. the variety of results obtained in this study suggest that antibacterial properties of current dentin adhesives may depend on components that are originally incorporated to promote adhesion.

TI  == efficacy of manual and powered toothbrushes (ii). effect on microbiological parameters.
AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == humoral immune response in early-onset periodontitis: influence of smoking.
AB  == sixty-five patients with generalised early-onset periodontitis (g-eop) (age range 16-42 years, 32 smokers and 33 non-smokers) were assessed for antibody titres and avidity to a panel of five suspected periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus). thirty-four of these patients were untreated (17 smokers and 17 non-smokers), and thirty-one were in the maintenance phase of periodontal therapy (15 smokers and 16 non-smokers). previous studies have investigated the effect of smoking on igg levels in periodontitis patients in the context of the more extensive periodontal destruction seen in smokers. based on this literature our hypothesis was that smokers would have depressed serum igg levels directed against recognised periodontal pathogens compared with non-smokers. antibody titres were measured by elisa deploying fixed whole cells as coating. the igg response was detected with  biotin-anti-human igg and avidin-peroxidase; avidity was determined by elution with ammonium thiocyanate. median titres to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and t. denticola were significantly lower in maintenance patient smokers (p= 0.02, 0.02 and 0.002 respectively) but not in untreated patients. avidity to p. gingivalis was also lower in smoking maintenance patients (p = 0.003) but not in untreated patients. these findings may imply some interruption  of immune maturation in smokers following periodontal treatment.

AB  == background: this is the first known case report that used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method to help identify the oral microflora in patients with chronic neutropenia. in this study, we report clinical periodontal findings and microflora profiles of 2 children, 1 with severe congenital neutropenia (scn, kostmann type) and 1 with cyclic neutropenia (cn). methods: the scn patient had severe gingivitis, whereas the patient with cn had mild gingivitis in the gingival margins. monthly oral cleaning instruction and review were performed without subsequent periodontal therapy. oral hygiene conditions remained satisfactory and visible plaque was scarce, despite the persistence of mild gingivitis. under supervised oral hygiene, we examined the presence of periodontal pathogens from patient plaque samples. results: by a pcr-based method, prevotella nigrescens, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected in the scn patient and p. intermedia, c.  rectus, c. gingivalis, and c. sputigena in the cn patient, suggesting the existence of periodontal pathogens. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and c. ochracea were not found in  either patient. conclusions: use of 1% povidone iodine solution and local antibiotic application under supervised oral hygiene were helpful to improve gingival conditions in patients with chronic neutropenia.

AB  == a 16s rdna-directed polymerase chain reaction method was used to assess the occurrence of four black-pigmented anaerobic rods, treponema denticola, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in acute periradicular abscesses. pus was collected by aspiration from 10 cases diagnosed as acute abscesses of endodontic  origin. dna was extracted from the samples and analyzed using a polymerase chain  reaction-based identification assay. the method allowed detecting black-pigmented anaerobes in 80% of the examined abscesses. porphyromonas endodontalis was found  in 70%, t. denticola in 50%, porphyromonas gingivalis in 40%, and prevotella intermedia in 10% of the cases. p. gingivalis was always found associated with p. endodontalis. prevotella nigrescens and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not found in any pus sample. the high prevalence of p. endodontalis, t. denticola, and p. gingivalis suggests that they can play an important role in the etiology of acute periradicular abscesses.

TI  == change in subgingival microbial profiles in adult periodontitis subjects receiving either systemically-administered amoxicillin or metronidazole.
AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == relationship of cigarette smoking to the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background: the relationship of cigarette smoking to the composition of the subgingival microbiota is not clear. some studies indicated higher levels of certain species in smokers, while other studies failed to detect differences in the microbiota between subjects with different smoking histories. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the prevalence, proportions and levels of the subgingival species in adult subjects who were current, past or never smokers. method: 272 adult subjects ranging in age from 20-86 years with at least 20 teeth were recruited for study. smoking history was obtained using a questionnaire. clinical measures were taken at 6 sites per tooth at all teeth excluding third molars at a baseline visit. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth excluding third molars in each subject at baseline and assayed individually for counts of 29 subgingival species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. subjects were subset according to smoking history into never (n=124), past (n=98) and current smokers (n=50). uni-variate and multi-variate analyses were used to seek associations between smoking category and the counts, proportions and prevalence of subgingival species. results: greater differences were observed for the prevalence (% of sites colonized) of the test species in the 3 smoking groups than were observed for counts or proportions of total counts. members of the orange and red complexes including e. nodatum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, p. intermedia, p. micros, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly more  prevalent in current smokers than in the other 2 groups. the difference in prevalence between smokers and non-smokers was due to greater colonization at sites with pocket depth <4 mm. stepwise multiple linear regression analysis indicated that combinations of the prevalence of 5 microbial species and pack years accounted for 44% of the variance for mean pocket depth (p<0.000001), while the prevalence of 3 microbial taxa along with age, pack years, current smoking and gender accounted for 31% of the variance in mean attachment level (p<0.000001). the difference in prevalence between current and never smokers of all members of the red complex and 8 of 12 members of the orange complex was significantly greater in the maxilla than in the mandible. conclusions: the major difference between the subgingival microbiota in subjects with different smoking  history was in the prevalence of species rather than counts or proportions. the greater extent of colonization in smokers appeared to be due to greater colonization at pocket depths <4 mm. differences in colonization patterns between current and never smokers were greater in the maxilla than in the mandible.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of silver nitrate against periodontal pathogens.
AB  == metal ions were evaluated as potential antimicrobial agents suitable for local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis. silver nitrate, copper chloride, and zinc chloride were tested for antimicrobial activity in in vitro killing assays conducted in phosphate buffered saline with a series of oral bacteria including gram-negative periodontal pathogens and gram-positive streptococci. copper and zinc salts failed to exhibit strong and consistent activity against periodontal pathogens. in contrast, silver at a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml produced a 3 log10 reduction in colony forming units (cfu)/ml or greater against all periodontal pathogens tested including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum vincentii, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus,  eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in comparison, substantially higher concentrations of silver nitrate failed to kill oral streptococci. a silver nitrate concentration of 25 microg/ml produced log10 reductions in cfu/ml of 3.5-5 in killing assays performed in human serum against  p. gingivalis, demonstrating the ability of silver to retain activity in a biological medium similar to that encountered in vivo in the periodontal pocket.  these results identify silver nitrate, an antimicrobial that may possess advantages over traditional antibiotics, as a potential agent for controlled release local delivery in the oral cavity for the treatment of periodontitis.

AB  == background: down's syndrome (ds) patients often develop severe early-onset marginal periodontitis in early adulthood; however, there is little information available on the microbiology of ds periodontitis. methods: subgingival plaque specimens were taken from 67 ds young adults and 41 age-matched systemically healthy individuals with mental disabilities (md). the prevalence of 10 possible  periodontopathic bacterial species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella  intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens, were investigated in their subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction method. the detection of p. gingivalis fima genotypes was also performed in p. gingivalis-positive samples. results: although ds subjects generally develop an earlier and more extensive periodontal breakdown than those with md, no significant differences were observed in the bacterial profiles. the profiles of  subjects with periodontitis were significant in ds, but not in md. the prevalence of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. intermedia were significant in the ds periodontitis group, compared to ds gingivitis group. moreover, the occurrence of p. gingivalis with the type ii fima gene was significantly related to periodontitis in both ds and md, with odds ratios of 6.32 and 12.03, respectively. conclusions: these results suggest that early-onset periodontitis in ds is mainly due to the more susceptible host for the causative microbial agents including p. gingivalis with type ii fima.

TI  == smoking and subgingival microflora in periodontal disease.
AB  == aim: the present investigation was undertaken to analyze the influence of smoking on the periodontal disease associated subgingival microflora. the population included 33 smokers and 31 non-smokers in the age range 36-86 years. methods: microbial samples were obtained from 4 sites per patient. the checker-board dna-dna hybridization technology was used for detection of the bacterial species  p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, t. denticola, p. micros, c. rectus, e. corrodens, s. noxia and s. intermedius. results: using score 1 as cutoff, contrasting colonized versus non-colonized patients, 8 out of 12 species were detected in > or = 90% of both smokers and non-smokers. using score 4 as cutoff,  contrasting heavily colonized patients versus non-colonized and less heavily colonized patients, the detection rates decreased in both smokers and non-smokers. no significant differences in detection rates were observed between  smokers and non-smokers. logistic regression analysis indicated that neither smoking, probing depth nor gingival bleeding influenced the occurrence of the species analyzed. the lack of a smoking exposure dose-response further supported  the indication of a limited influence of smoking. conclusion: smoking exerts little, if any, influence on the subgingival occurrence of several of the bacteria most commonly associated with periodontal disease.

TI  == comparison of profiles of key periodontal pathogens in periodontium and endodontium.
AB  == despite the established anatomical relationship between the periodontal and pulpal tissues, bacterial migration between endodontium and periodontium is still under discussion. the objective of this study was an investigation of profiles of periodontal pathogens in pulpal and periodontal diseases affecting the same tooth by means of 16s rrna gene directed polymerase chain reaction (pcr). 31 intact teeth with both pulp and marginal infections were investigated. the diagnosis was based on clinical and radiological examination. samples were taken from the gingival sulcus or periodontal pocket, respectively, with sterile paper points before trepanation of the teeth. after trepanation sterile paper points and hedstroem files were used for taking samples from the root canal. specific pcr methods were used to detect the presence of the following pathogens: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. in addition, quantitative competitive pcr was used to determine the total bacterial count of the samples. the investigated pathogens were proven to be present in the endondontium in all disease categories. particularly in endodontic samples of "chronic apical periodontitis" and "chronic adult periodontitis" profiles of the periodontal pathogens were found. the results confirmed that periodontal pathogens often accompany endodontic infections and supported the idea that the periodontic-endodontic interrelationships should be considered as critical pathways which might contribute to refractory courses of endodontic or periodontal diseases.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole in sites with and without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis patients.
AB  == background: the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effects of systemic ornidazole (orn) in sites with or without subgingival debridement in early-onset periodontitis (eop) patients. methods: two pooled bacterial samples consisting of 4 sites each (scaled and non-scaled sites) were obtained from 30 individuals exhibiting eop. all patients received oral hygiene instruction (ohi), supragingival scaling and orn. subgingival scaling and root planing (srp) was carried out only in scaled sites. bacterial samples were taken at baseline (bl) and 1 week and 2, 6, and 12 months after systemic ornidazole administration (500 mg/bid for 7 days). one more sample was taken at scaled sites, one week after srp. results: one week following srp (scaled sites)  gram-negative facultative and anaerobic rods were significantly reduced while gram-positive facultative cocci were significantly increased. after orn administration, p. gingivalis, p. denticola, p. intermedia, b. forsythus, c. rectus, and s. sputigena were no longer detectable in either scaled or non-scaled sites. a statistically significant long-term (2, 6, and 12 months) reduction of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, b. forsythus, and c. rectus and a pronounced increase of s. milleri, s. oralis, and s. sanguis counts in both scaled and non-scaled sites were detected in comparison to baseline. a sustained  reduction of bleeding tendency and of probing depth was also observed in both scaled and non-scaled sites. conclusions: orn combined with srp effects beneficial shifts in the bacterial population associated with substantial clinical improvement, thereby indicating that orn is effective adjunct in the treatment of eop deep periodontal pockets where anaerobic bacteria are predominant.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis platelet aggregation activity: outer membrane vesicles are potent activators of murine platelets.
AB  == recent evidence has established an association between chronic periodontitis and  cardiovascular disease. periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease caused by a small group of gram-negative bacteria, of which porphyromonas gingivalis is considered an important causative agent. it has been proposed that dental plaque  bacteria and their products can disseminate into the bloodstream from the site of infection and promote thromboembolic events associated with atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. in this regard, streptococcus sanguis and p. gingivalis have been shown to induce platelet aggregation in vitro. here we report that p. gingivalis was able to induce platelet aggregation, and that oral strains of actinobaillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and trepenoma denticola failed to  aggregate platelets when tested for platelet aggregation activity under similar conditions. additionally, we show that vesicles (outer membrane evaginations that are shed into the environment by the bacteria) of p. gingivalis are potent inducers of mouse platelet aggregation in vitro. in summary, our data show that i) initial adherence of the bacterium to platelet may be facilitated by p. gingivalis fimbriae and ii) p. gingivalis vesicles possess platelet aggregation-inducing activity.

TI  == measurement of proteases in human subgingival dental plaque by fluorescence polarization.
AB  == fluorescence polarization (fp) was examined as a rapid quantitative method to assay the proteases in subgingival plaque. protease activity was measured by a decrease in fp at 0.5-min intervals over 5 min, using bodipy-alpha-casein, a protein substrate. to quantitate activity, the least absolute deviation (lad) slope for each assay was determined. protease activity increased with the quantity of plaque (r=0.416, p<0.001). of the 208 subgingival plaque samples, 87  contained detectable protease activity, with a mean of about 4 microg trypsin equivalents above a general background of 1 microg per site. the mean plaque protease activity of 89 paired samples from 15 individuals had decreased by 1.1 microg trypsin equivalents per site when measured at 8 months after tooth scaling and root planing (p<0.01). most isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and prevotella intermedia implicated in the pathogenesis of adult periodontitis exhibited high activity in the fp assay. the  assay is rapid, quantitative and requires only one-tenth of the plaque sampled using a single pass with a gracey curette at a single tooth site.

TI  == microbiological parameters associated with il-1 gene polymorphisms in periodontitis patients.
AB  == background, aims: polymorphisms in the cluster of il-1 genes have been significantly associated with the severity of adult periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to compare microbiological parameters in il-1 genotype negative and positive adult subjects with a range of periodontitis severities. method: the study included 108 subjects in good general health. clinical parameters were recorded at 6 sites/tooth excluding 3rd molars and included: plaque accumulation, gingival erythema, bleeding on probing, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment  level. subgingival plaque samples were collected from the mesiobuccal surface of  up to 28 teeth in each subject (mean 25.3) providing a total of 2736 samples. the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in each sample using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. fingerstick blood samples were collected for il-1a (+4845) and il-1b (+3954) genotyping using pcr-based methods. results: the proportion of  il-1 genotype positive subjects that exhibited mean counts of specific subgingival species above selected thresholds was significantly higher than the proportion of genotype negative subjects. prominent among species that were detected at higher levels in genotype positive subjects were members of the "red" and "orange" complexes and included: bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola,  the fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, fusobacterium periodonticum, campylobacter gracilis, campylobacter showae and streptococcus constellatus. streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus gordonii and 3 capnocytophaga species were also detected more frequently at high numbers in genotype positive subjects. significantly higher mean counts of b. forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, t. denticola, the f. nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum, campylobacter rectus, c. showae, eubacterium nodatum, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius  were detected at periodontal pockets >6 mm in subjects who were genotype positive when compared with genotype negative subjects. the increase was due to increased  numbers of cells of these species rather than a major shift in proportion. conclusion: the data suggest that genotype positive subjects more frequently had  higher levels of "red" and "orange" complex species that are known to be strongly associated with measures of periodontal inflammation.

TI  == prevalence of periodontal pathogens in localized and generalized forms of early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == the primary objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subjects with early-onset periodontitis (eop) and to evaluate the microbial differences between localized and generalized forms of this periodontal disease condition. thirty-one females and 11 males with a mean age of 30.3 (s.d. 4.0) years were examined. seventeen subjects had generalized (geop) and 25 had localized early-onset periodontitis (leop). subgingival plaque samples were assayed using pcr which provided subject prevalence data for the pathogens; bacteroides forsythus 78.6%, treponema denticola 88.1%, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans 19.0%, porphyromonas gingivalis 16.7%, prevotella intermedia 40.4%, prevotella nigrescens 61.9%, eikenella corrodens 42.3% and campylobacter rectus 92.8%. only 3 healthy sites harbored one or more of these periodontal pathogens. seven of the 8 subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans had leop. p. intermedia was present in 58.8% of geop compared with 28% of leop subjects (p=0.046). at 82.4% of geop sites p. nigrescens was present while this bacteria was detected at 52% of leop (p=0.044). p. gingivalis was isolated from 22.6% of females but no male subjects  (p=0.084). c. rectus was recovered from all female subjects compared to 72.7% of  males (p=0.014). a. actinomycetemcomitans (37.5%) and c. rectus (86.5%) were more frequently identified in non-smokers compared to 7.6% and 68.8% of smokers, respectively (p <0.05). microbial associations coincided with the clinical division of the cases into leop and geop in 83% of the subjects.

TI  == comparison of the microbiota of supra- and subgingival plaque in health and periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 22 periodontally healthy (mean age 32+/-16 years) and 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51+/-14 years). methods: a total of 2358 supra and separately subgingival plaque samples  were collected from the mesial aspect of all teeth excluding 3rd molars in each subject. samples were examined for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. mean counts (x10(5), % dna probe count and % sites colonized for each species were determined separately for supra and subgingival samples in each subject and then averaged across subjects in the 2 clinical groups. significance of differences between healthy and periodontitis subjects was determined using the mann-whitney test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: mean total dna probe counts (x10(5),  +/-sem) for healthy and periodontitis subjects in supragingival plaque were 72.1+/-11 and 132+/-17.5, respectively (p<0.01), and in subgingival plaque 22.1+/-6.6 and 100.3+/-18.4, (p<0.001). porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola could be detected in supragingival plaque samples of both healthy and periodontitis subjects. actinomyces species were the  dominant taxa in both supra- and subgingival plaque from healthy and periodontitis subjects. 4 actinomyces species accounted for 63.2%, of supragingival and 47.2% of subgingival plaque in healthy subjects and 48.% and 37.8% in periodontitis subjects respectively. increased proportions of p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and species of prevotella, fusobacterium, campylobacter and treponema were detected subgingivally in the periodontitis subjects. p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola were significantly more prevalent in both supra- and subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis subjects. conclusions: the main differences between supra and subgingival plaque as well as between health and disease were in the proportions and to some extent levels of actinomyces, "orange" and "red" complex species.

TI  == identification of periodontal disease-associated bacteria in the "plaque-free zone".
AB  == background: subgingival plaque bacteria live within a biofilm covered with glycocalyx, and little is known of the bacterial species associated with biofilm  formation at the bottom of human periodontal pockets, the so-called "plaque-free  zone"(pfz). methods: seventy-seven extracted teeth from 56 patients with severe advanced adult periodontitis were examined. porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, prevotella nigrescens, and actinomyces viscosus were examined by scanning immunoelectron microscopic techniques, using both secondary and back-scattered imaging, with rabbit antibodies specific for each bacteria. results: secondary electron images showed  that rods, filaments, and spirochete-shaped bacteria formed small aggregates in the pfz. some of the bacteria were covered with an amorphous film-like structure. by back-scattered electron imaging, positive reactions with anti-p. gingivalis were found in 8 of 13 samples examined, and film-like structures coated several cells of 6 positive samples examined. labeled cells with anti-c. rectus, anti-t.  denticola and anti-p. nigrescens were detected in 3 of 11, 5 of 10, and 1 of 8 samples examined. a. viscosus were found in 6 of 11 of the samples. a. viscosus tended to overlay the amorphous capsula and aggregate. f. nucleatum and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not detected in any samples examined. conclusions: these findings indicated that p. gingivalis, c. rectus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and a. viscosus were present in the pfz, and that some specified bacteria were possibly related to plaque-biofilm formation of subgingival plaque.

TI  == interleukin-8 and granulocyte elastase in gingival crevicular fluid in relation to periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis.
AB  == background: this study aimed to determine the relationships among interleukin (il)-8 and granulocyte elastase levels in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis. methods: gcf and subgingival plaque samples were collected from 16 patients with  untreated adult periodontitis and 10 healthy control subjects. il-8 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). granulocyte elastase was analyzed with a neutrophilic granulocyte-specific, low molecular weight and chromogenic substrate, l-pyroglutamyl-l-prolyl-l-valine-p-nitroanilide, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (mr-ea) was calculated. five dna probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), b. forsythus (b.f.), p. gingivalis (p.g.), p. intermedia (p.i.), and t. denticola (t.d.). results: lower il-8 concentrations and higher granulocyte elastase activities were found in patients than in healthy controls as well as in diseased conditions co-infected with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. as compared to healthy conditions without the target species (p <0.05). il-8 concentrations were positively correlated with mr-ea levels in the periodontitis conditions co-infected with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. (p <0.05). a wide range of il-8 concentrations was found among 15 patients when the periodontitis condition was characterized by co-infection with b.f., p.g., p.i., and t.d. mr-ea levels in the high il-8 group  of subjects were significantly higher than those in the low il-8 group of subjects (p <0.01). conclusions: the present study shows that the local host-bacteria interactions in untreated periodontitis are diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory responses measured by il-8-related granulocyte elastase activity in gcf. this might reflect different phases of the inflammatory response due to shifts in host-bacteria interactions and therefore be indicative of a range of periodontal disease activity levels.

TI  == "checkerboard" assessments of periodontal microbiota and serum antibody responses: a case-control study.
AB  == background: we explored the association between subgingival microbial profiles and serum igg responses to periodontal microbiota in relation to clinical periodontal status. methods: one hundred thirty-one (131) periodontitis patients  aged 29 to 74 years (mean 51.8) were age- and gender-matched with 74 periodontally intact controls (range 26 to 77, mean 49.3). smoking habits and health history were recorded and assessments of plaque, bleeding on probing, probing depth, and attachment level were performed at 6 sites per tooth on all present teeth, excluding third molars. subgingival plaque samples were obtained from each tooth in one upper and one lower quadrant (maximum 14 samples/subject;  2,440 samples total) and analyzed with respect to 19 species by means of whole genomic dna probes. serum igg antibodies against the same 19 species were assessed by an immunoassay. results: cases displayed an average of 22.7 teeth, 20.3 sites with probing depth > or =6 mm, and 18.9 sites with attachment loss > or =6 mm. corresponding figures for controls were 27.1, 0.1, and 1.0, respectively. heavy smoking was 3 times more frequent among cases than controls (32.1% versus 9.6%). higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella melaninogenica, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, eubacterium nodatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and campylobacter rectus were found in cases and higher levels of eikenella corrodens, veillonella  parvula, and actinomyces naeslundii in controls. cases displayed higher igg levels against p. gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, while controls displayed higher levels against f. nucleatum, t. denticola, e. nodatum,  and capnocytophaga ochracea. positive correlations between bacterial colonization and antibody responses were identified for 9 species in controls. in cases, however, statistically significant correlations were observed for only 3 species  out of which only one was positive (v. parvula). both bacterial levels and antibody responses declined in ages over 55 years. a logistic regression employing selected elements of bacterial colonization and antibody responses as independent variables resulted in 81.1% correct diagnosis, with sensitivity of 83.1%, specificity of 77.8%, positive predictability of 86%, and negative predictability of 73.7%. smoking did not reach statistical significance in this model. conclusion: a combined microbial colonization/antibody response profile can effectively discriminate between periodontitis patients and periodontally intact controls.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == in a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. at least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were  prevotella buccae and prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of  10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). no beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). all  the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.

TI  == microbial comparison of smoker and non-smoker adult and early-onset periodontitis patients by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == a number of bacterial species are involved in the aetiology of periodontitis and  include actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and treponema denticola. several studies have shown differences in the microflora between the various forms of periodontal disease. it is recognised that smoking is a risk factor for periodontal disease, but there are conflicting reports on whether or not smoking  has an effect on the periodontal microflora. we utilised the polymerase chain reaction to determine the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, b. forsythus and t. denticola in subgingival plaque samples in 33 adult periodontitis (ap) patients and 24 generalized early-onset periodontitis (geop) patients prior to treatment. when geop and ap patients were compared there were significant differences in the number of positive patients and sites for both a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus (p=0.0023 and 0.00001, respectively). no statistically significant differences in the prevalence of these organisms were found between smoker and non-smoker groups. these results confirm that ap and geop sites harbour varied microflora, but show that b. forsythus and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected to a significantly greater extent in this group of geop than in the ap patients investigated. our findings do not support the hypothesis that smokers have significant differences in the prevalence of periodontal pathogens from non-smokers.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in english hiv-seropositive persons.
AB  == selected periodontopathic bacteria were sought in 20 hiv-infected english patients and eight noninfected control subjects with similar periodontal status,  using highly specific dna probes. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a. a), porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were more frequently detected and were found at higher levels in hiv-infected individuals than in controls. significantly increased levels of treponema denticola but, in contrast, lower levels of eikenella corrodens were found in nonbleeding sites of hiv-infected patients compared with  controls. the results of the present investigation on english patients suggest a  periodontopathogenic role for a. a, p. gingivalis and c. rectus, and possibly p.  intermedia and are in general accord with most previously reported data from the  united states. longitudinal studies are now required to determine more precisely  the association between periodontopathic microflora, immune competence and periodontal health and disease in hiv-infected persons.

TI  == the prevalence of pathogenic periodontal microflora in healthy young adult smokers.
AB  == background: smoking is a major risk factor in periodontitis, although the mechanisms of its effects are not well understood. the overall goal of this clinical study was to determine if smoking enhances the colonization of the oral  cavity by pathogenic bacteria in a periodontitis-free population. the prevalence  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola was investigated in 25 smokers and 25 non-smokers by using dna probes. methods: the subjects were 21 to 35 years of  age with a healthy periodontium or slight gingivitis and were systemically healthy. the test group included subjects who had a minimum of a 1.5 pack-year history of smoking, while the control subjects never smoked. subgingival plaque samples were taken by paper point following the assessment of multiple clinical parameters. results: this investigation showed: 1) no statistically significant differences were noted in any clinical parameter measured between the groups; 2)  of the 8 subjects who were infected by at least 1 tested pathogen, seven were smokers (p= 0.02); 3) infected smokers had a 15.7+/-3.5 pack-year history and smoked a mean of 27+/-5 cigarettes/day versus 4.4+/-0.8 pack years and 15+/-1 cigarettes/day for the non-infected smokers (p = 0.0001 and p = 0.004); and 4) smokers were 18 times more likely to exhibit the presence of pathogens than non-smokers. conclusions: these data indicate that the prevalence of colonization of the sulcus by pathogenic bacterial species in periodontitis-free individuals is related to the quantity and duration of cigarette smoking.

TI  == herpesviruses in human periodontal disease.
AB  == recent studies have identified various herpesviruses in human periodontal disease. epstein-barr virus type 1 (ebv-1) infects periodontal b-lymphocytes and  human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) infects periodontal monocytes/ macrophages and t-lymphocytes. ebv-1, hcmv and other herpesviruses are present more frequently in periodontitis lesions and acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis-lesions than in gingivitis or periodontally healthy sites. reactivation of hcmv in periodontitis  lesions tends to be associated with progressing periodontal disease. herpesvirus-associated periodontitis lesions harbor elevated levels of periodontopathic bacteria, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteriodes forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola. it may be that active periodontal  herpesvirus infection impairs periodontal defenses, thereby permitting subgingival overgrowth of periodontopathic bacteria. alteration between latent and active herpesvirus infection in the periodontium might lead to transient local immunosuppression and explain in part the episodic progressive nature of human periodontitis. tissue tropism of herpesvirus infections might help explain  the localized pattern of tissue destruction in periodontitis. absence of herpesvirus infection or viral reactivation might explain why some individuals carry periodontopathic bacteria while still maintaining periodontal health. further studies are warranted to delineate whether the proposed herpesvirus-periodontopathic bacteria model might account for some of the pathogenic features of human periodontal disease.

AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == periodontopathic bacteria in children with down syndrome.
AB  == background: it is widely known that individuals with down syndrome (ds) often develop severe early-onset periodontal diseases. in this study, we examined the prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in ds children to determine if specific pathogens are acquired in their childhood. methods: the subjects were 60 ds children (2 to 13 years old, 5 in each age bracket) and 60 age-matched controls.  ten pathogens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, p nigrescens,  capnocytophaga ochracea, c. sputigena, campyrobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens were surveyed in subgingival plaque samples using a polymerase chain reaction. periodontal status was evaluated by probing depth, bleeding on probing, and gingival index. results: no significant difference in periodontal status was  observed between the ds and control groups, however, all of the pathogens were detected with greater frequency in the ds children. b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. nigrescens, and c. rectus were significantly prevalent throughout all age brackets of the ds children (p <0.01 or 0.05). the occurrence of p. gingivalis was also significant in the ds subjects over 5 years old. a cluster analysis of the microbial profiles of the ds subjects showed that gingivitis severity was associated with increased varieties of the harboring pathogens and the distribution of p. gingivalis. conclusions: these results suggest that various periodontopathogens can colonize in the very early childhood of ds patients and maturation of subgingival components, including p. gingivalis, plays an important role in the initiation of gingival inflammation.

TI  == granulocyte elastase activity and pge2 levels in gingival crevicular fluid in relation to the presence of subgingival periodontopathogens in subjects with untreated adult periodontitis.
AB  == this study aimed to determine the association between the levels of granulocyte elastase and prostaglandin e2 (pge2) in gce and the concomitant presence of periodontopathogens in untreated adult periodontitis (ap). gcf and subgingival plaque were sampled by paper strips and paper points respectively, from various periodontal sites in 16 ap subjects. granulocyte elastase activity in gcf was analyzed with a low molecular weight substrate specific for granulocyte elastase, pgluproval-pna, and the maximal rate of elastase activity (mr-ea, mabs/min/site)  was calculated. pge2 levels in gcf were determined by radioimmunoassay. 5 species-specific dna probes were used to detect the presence of a. actinomyceterncomitans (a.a., atcc 43718), b. forsythus (b.f, atcc 43037), p. gingivalis (p.g., atcc 33277), p. intermedia (p.i., atcc 33563), and t. denticola (t.d., atcc 35405), with a sensitivity of 10(3) cells/paper point. no a.a. was detectable from all sites sampled. the predominant combination of species detected was b.f., p.g., p.i. & t.d. and it was significantly higher at periodontitis sites (68%) than at healthy (7%) or gingivitis sites (29%) (p<0.05). overall, mr-ea values were strongly correlated with pge2 levels (r=0.655, p<0.001), especially at these periodontitis sites co-infected by b.f.,  p.g., p.i. & t.d. (r=0.722, p<0.001). the periodontitis sites co-infected by the  4 species were observable from 15 subjects. these sites were sub-grouped into 8 subjects with a high mr-ea and 7 subjects with a low mr-ea. the pge2 levels in the high mr-ea group were significantly higher than in the low mr-ea group (p<0.05). no significant differences in clinical or bacterial data were found between the two groups. while within the high mr-ea group, similar results were found between the paired periodontitis sites in each subject with highest and lowest mr-ea values. this study shows that the local host response to bacterial challenge in untreated periodontal pockets is diverse in terms of the intensity of inflammatory response measured by granulocyte elastase and pge2 levels in gce  a more thorough evaluation of the risk for active periodontal disease may involve the combined approaches to the test of the dynamic bacteria-host relations.

TI  == relationship between herpesviruses and adult periodontitis and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == background: various mammalian viruses and specific bacteria seem to play important roles in the pathogenesis of human periodontitis. this study examined the relationship between subgingival herpesviruses and periodontal disease and potential periodontopathic bacteria in 140 adults exhibiting either periodontitis or gingivitis. methods: a nested-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method determined the presence of epstein-barr virus type 1 and type 2 (ebv-1, ebv-2), human cytomegalovirus (hcmv), and herpes simplex virus (hsv) and a 16s rrna pcr detection method identified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens,  and treponema denticola. results: using a logistic analysis, ebv-1 showed significant positive association with p. gingivalis (odds ratio [or] 3.37), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia (or 4.03); p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 3.84); p. gingivalis and t. denticola (or 4.17); p. gingivalis,  b. forsythus, and t. denticola (or 4.06); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 3.29). ebv-1 also showed positive association with severe periodontitis (or 5.09), with increasing age (or 1.03), and with periodontal probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.77). hcmv was positively associated with  coinfections of p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 3.23); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t.  denticola (or 2.59); with severe periodontitis (or 4.65); and with age (or 1.03). patients with mixed viral infections revealed significant associations with p. gingivalis (or 2.27), and with coinfections of p. gingivalis and b. forsythus (or 2.06); p. gingivalis and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, and p. nigrescens (or 2.91); and p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola (or 2.70) with the clinical diagnosis of slight (or 3.73), moderate (or 3.82), or severe periodontitis (or 4.36), and with probing depth at the sample sites (or 1.39). hsv and ebv-2 showed no significant associations with any of the variables tested. conclusions: the results indicate that subgingival ebv-1, hcmv, and viral coinfections are associated with the subgingival presence of some periodontal pathogens and periodontitis. herpesviruses may exert periodontopathic potential by decreasing the host resistance against subgingival colonization and multiplication of periodontal pathogens.

TI  == local metronidazole application in maintenance patients. clinical and microbiological evaluation.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the clinical and microbiological effect of local antibiotic therapy in comparison with subgingival scaling and root planing in a randomized semi-masked study. forty-six recall patients who completed systematic periodontal therapy 6 to 24 months prior to the study were enrolled. the inclusion requirements were at least one site with probing depth > or = 5 mm in each quadrant, no scaling, and no antibiotic therapy during the last 6 months. after randomization each patient received 2 different treatments: in 2 quadrants metronidazole 25% dental gel was applied subgingivally to the pockets at day 0 and day 7; scaling and root planing was carried out in the 2 other quadrants, one at day 0 and in the remaining quadrant at day 7. subgingival microbiological samples were taken from each patient before treatment and on days 21, 91, and 175 after the treatment. the analyses were carried out by indirect immunofluorescence assay. at all treated sites probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded on days 0, 21, 91, and 175. both treatments resulted in pd reduction and cal gain. pd reduction was statistically significant (p < 0.01) for both treatment modalities after 6 months. the cal gain was not significant for either treatment. there was no statistical significance between scaling and antibiotic therapy. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia were significantly reduced after therapy; however, there were no statistically significant differences between treatments. if actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was present before therapy, it was also present after treatment in both groups. the conclusion is that, in recall patients, local application of metronidazole and scaling and root planing showed similar clinical and microbiological effects without statistically significant differences.

TI  == risk indicators for harboring periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the risk for harboring 6 putative periodontal pathogens in 4 selected periodontal pockets, in whole saliva, or in either site (i.e., orally) was determined in 52 caucasians, 49 african-americans, 48 asian-americans, and 50 hispanics living in  los angeles. 16s rrna pcr analysis assessed the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, and treponema denticola. step-wise  regression analysis determined the relationship between the occurrence of each organism and various explanatory variables (risk indicators). periodontal probing depth or disease severity was positively associated with all 6 study organisms. african-americans carried an increased risk for harboring p. gingivalis in saliva (odds ratio [or] 2.95) and orally (or 2.66), and a reduced risk for harboring t.  denticola orally (or 0.34). asian-americans showed an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 6.63) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 5.39), in saliva (or 5.74), and orally (or  5.81). hispanics demonstrated an increased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in periodontal pockets (or 12.27) and p. gingivalis in periodontal pockets (or 6.07), in saliva (or 8.72), and orally (or 7.98). age was positively associated with the prevalence of p. gingivalis in saliva (or 1.20) and orally (or 1.20), and of a. actinomycetemcomitans orally (or 1.18). the male  gender was a risk factor for harboring p. intermedia in periodontal pockets (or 2.40), in saliva (or 3.31), and orally (or 4.25), and for harboring p. nigrescens in saliva (or 2.85). the longer the subjects resided in the united states, the less likely a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected orally (or 0.82). former smokers demonstrated a decreased risk for harboring a. actinomycetemcomitans in saliva (or 0.23). current smokers displayed an increased risk for harboring t. denticola in periodontal pockets (or 4.61). the number of dental visits in the past 10 years was inversely related to the prevalence of p. intermedia orally (or 0.96). the prevalence of p. intermedia in saliva was positively associated with the length of time from the last dental visit (or 1.01). this study suggests that genetic and/or environmental factors predispose subjects to oral colonization by  putative periodontal pathogens.

TI  == early-onset periodontitis associated with down's syndrome--clinical interventional study.
AB  == individuals with down's syndrome (ds) have an increased prevalence of periodontal disease compared with otherwise normal, age-matched control groups and other mentally handicapped patients of similar age distribution. the exaggerated immune-inflammatory response of the tissues cannot be explained by poor oral hygiene alone and might be the result of an impaired cell-mediated and humoral immunity and a deficient phagocytic system. as far as the progression and severity of destruction, the oral manifestations of ds patients are consistent with the juvenile periodontitis (jp) disease pattern. the purpose of the present  study was 1) to assess the periodontal clinical and microbiological status of 10  ds patients aged 20 to 31 years (mean: 26.3 years) relative to that of 11 patients with cerebral palsy (cp) aged 23 to 53 years (mean: 36 years) without defective immunological functions, and 2) to determine the effect of supragingival plaque control and oral hygiene instruction in these patient groups. subsequent to the initial examination and a professional tooth cleaning program, clinical and microbiological parameters were monitored over a period of  12 weeks. the clinical examination included the recording of plaque index (p1), gingival index (gi), probing depth (pd), and clinical attachment level (cal). subgingival plaque samples were always obtained from the same pocket with the highest disease activity (deepest bleeding site at baseline examination) in each  subject for a morphotype analysis by dark field microscopy and for identification and quantitation of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eikenella corrodens, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, and campylobacter rectus by dna probes. the results of the baseline examinations demonstrated that ds patients and patients with cerebral palsy had inflamed gingiva associated with a high amount of plaque. the mean probing depth and percentage of sites with probing depth> 4 mm corresponded to age and poor oral hygiene in cp patients. deep pockets in ds patients demonstrated a high prevalence of periodontal disease compared with age-matched children with mental retardation and non-handicapped patients. regarding the young age of onset, the severe destruction of periodontal tissues and pathogenesis of periodontitis in ds patients are consistent with the  juvenile periodontitis disease pattern. the missing clinical benefit and alteration of the subgingival flora following supragingival plaque control in ds  patients underlined the alteration in the immunological response.

TI  == crevicular fluid level of beta-glucuronidase in relation to clinical periodontal  parameters and putative periodontal pathogens in early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == analysis of beta-glucuronidase (betag) in the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) provides an indication of neutrophil influx into the crevicular environment. the  aim of this study was to test the hypotheses that: (1) betag is significantly elevated in individuals with early-onset periodontitis (eop) and that betag activity correlates with disease severity; and (2) betag level may reflect the local bacterial challenge in the gingival crevice. the study subjects consisted of a sub-sample of individuals examined in the national survey of oral health of  united states children, which was undertaken during the 1986/87 school year. a total of 249 individuals were selected based on presence or absence of clinical attachment loss at baseline. the individuals were examined a second time 6 years  later and the clinical attachment loss was assessed, and subgingival plaque and gcf were collected. the subjects were classified into 3 types of eop and a control group. betag activity in the gcf and the levels of 7 putative micro-organisms in the pocket were assessed. the generalized eop group had the highest betag activity, followed by the localized and incidental eop groups, and  the controls, respectively. there was a significant increase in betag activity with the increase in probing depth. also, sites with bleeding on probing had a significantly higher betag activity than sites without bleeding. however, the effect of gingival inflammation on betag activity was more evident in the generalized and localized eop groups. sites harboring high levels of one or more  of the micro-organisms tended to have high betag activity. there were moderate differences between the organisms with respect to their effect on betag activity, but sites with high numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, or treponema denticola also had the highest betag activity. the present findings  suggest that betag activity in gcf from patients with eop can be of value in the  early identification of individuals at higher risk of developing eop the findings also suggest that host mechanisms leading to higher betag activity in eop represent systemic responses and are only partly related to the presence of local factors at the site-level.

TI  == subgingival microbial profile of papillon-lefevre patients assessed by dna-probes.
AB  == the prevalence of 18 selected bacterial species was assessed by means of "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridisation in a group of 12 saudi-arabian adolescents with papillon-lefevre syndrome. a total of 36 tooth sites were investigated. the  patients exhibited severe periodontal disease with deep pockets. all 12 patients  harboured the putative bacterial pathogens p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, p. micros and s. intermedius while t. denticola, b. forsythus, p. nigrescens, e. corrodens, s. noxia and c. rectus were recovered from 11 patients. p. gingivalis was recovered from 9 patients and 18 sites while corresponding figures for a. actinomycetemcomitans were 8 and 19, respectively. a number of the investigated species (b. forsythus, t. denticola, p. intermedia, c rectus) reached high levels (> or =10(6) cells) in more than 1/2 of the patients. on the other hand, bacteria such as a. actinomycetemcomitans and p. gingivalis were infrequently encountered  at high levels in these subgingival samples. in conclusion, the analysis failed to demonstrate a pls-specific profile of the subgingival infection, since the bacterial composition of the sampled sites closely resembled that characterising  deep pockets in adult periodontitis patients.

TI  == the utility of whole saliva to detect the oral presence of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == this study compared the presence of 6 periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva and subgingival plaque of 202 subjects. the test bacteria were identified using a 16s rrna-based pcr detection method. each study subject contributed a whole saliva sample and a paper point sample pooled from the deepest periodontal pocket in each quadrant of the dentition. the kappa test revealed a fair agreement between the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and treponema denticola in whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples (kappa > 0.4). the mcnemar test showed that the differences between sample types were due to a more frequent detection of the 3 organisms in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01). prevotella nigrescens also was detected more frequently in whole saliva than in periodontal pocket samples (p < 0.01; mcnemar  test). although little agreement between samples was found for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus (kappa < or = 0.4), neither whole saliva nor pocket samples showed better detection for these 2 species (p < 0.01,  mcnemar test). the results indicate that whole saliva is superior to pooled periodontal pocket samples to detect p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and t. denticola in the oral cavity. the detection of oral a. actinomycetemcomitans and b. forsythus with reasonably good accuracy may require  both whole saliva and periodontal pocket samples.

TI  == dental plaque flora of the dog with reference to fastidious and anaerobic bacteria associated with bites.
AB  == animal bite wounds are amongst the most common types of traumatic injuries in humans. the organisms isolated from these wounds generally reflect the oral flora of the biting animal, and may be fastidious in nature and difficult to identify.  this study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas and prevotella spp. in supragingival dental plaque collected from the right maxillary canine and carnassial teeth and the right mandibular canine tooth of dogs. in part one of the study, 30 dogs were used. e. corrodens was found in 62% of these dogs and 44% of individual plaque samples. a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the dogs sampled. in part two, 34 dogs were used to determine the prevalence of the black pigmented anaerobic bacilli (porphyromonas and prevotella spp.). porphyromonas gingivalis was present in 68% of these dogs and 47% of individual plaque samples. prevotella intermedia was present in 44% of the dogs and 23% of individual plaque samples. the recently described porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas salivosa, porphyromonas cangingivalis, porphyromonas cansulci, porphyromonas crevioricanis and prevotella denticola species were isolated from only 9%, 6%, 3%, 3%, 3% and 3% of dogs respectively. porphyromonas gingivicanis was not isolated from any of the animals sampled. in conclusion, black-pigmented  anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 91% of the animals sampled and therefore constitute a significant risk with respect to bite wound infections. it is also suggested that the prevalence of e. corrodens in wound infections has been underestimated in previous reports because of use of inappropriate techniques for detecting this organism.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of young adults with and without early-onset periodontitis.
AB  == this study assessed the associations between putative periodontal pathogens and early-onset periodontitis (eop) in a population of 248 subjects, 13 to 19 years of age at baseline, derived from a representative sample of u.s. young adults. the subjects were selected based on the presence or absence of attachment loss at baseline. the attachment level was assessed clinically at baseline and at a 6-year follow-up examination, and the presence of 7 bacterial species was assessed at follow-up using dna probes. the individuals were classified into generalized, localized, incidental eop, and no-periodontitis groups based on the  extent and severity of attachment loss; and classified as having rapid, moderate, slow, and no progression based on the rate of periodontal progression during the  6 preceding years. in the eop groups there were significantly higher percentages  of individuals with detectable levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola. in addition, the eop group had significantly higher levels of these 5  microorganisms compared to the no-periodontitis group. there were also higher percentages of individuals with these species and higher levels of bacteria in the group showing disease progression than the group without progression. in a descending order of importance, p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and p. intermedia were the microorganisms significantly associated with the generalized and/or rapidly progressing disease. f. nucleatum and c. rectus were also associated with eop, but to a lesser degree. in the present population actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not significantly associated with eop, though it was recovered more often from subjects with localized eop. eikenella corrodens was present equally in subjects with and without disease. the results show that several bacterial species are associated with eop, and that p. gingivalis and t.  denticola are of particular importance and may play a significant role in the more severe and progressive forms of eop.

TI  == characterization of protease activities in capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == protease activities in cell sonicates of defined bacterial strains were examined  using peptide substrates and class-specific inhibitors. capnocytophaga spp. all produced serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine/lysine, elastase- and  chymotrypsin-like enzymes with some metalloprotease characteristics. the elastase-like activity was strongest in capnocytophaga sputigena, but the others  were greatest in capnocytophaga gingivalis. the latter also had a separate arginine-specific enzyme which appeared not to be present in the other two species. porphyromonas gingivalis showed serine dipeptidyl peptidase activity and very strong arginine and lysine cysteine protease activities. prevotella spp. had inhibitor-resistant dipeptidyl peptidase activity and arginine cysteine protease  activity that was much weaker but biochemically similar to p. gingivalis. treponema denticola possessed a strong trypsin-like serine protease activity as well as very weak dipeptidyl peptidase and chymotrypsin-like activities that were sensitive to some cysteine protease reagents. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans showed a novel alanine- and lysine-specific activity, but its nature was unclear.

TI  == the relationship between gingivitis and the serum antibodies to the microbiota associated with periodontal disease in children with down's syndrome.
AB  == gingival inflammation in down's syndrome children (ds) develops earlier and is more rapid and extensive than in non-ds children. abnormalities in host response  to the oral flora have been proposed as etiological factors of this gingival inflammation. however, the relationship between gingivitis and the host response  to oral microorganisms in ds by age has not been determined. the objective of this study was to clarify this relationship. sera were obtained from 75 ds subjects (aged 2 to 18 years) and their gingival health assessed using a modified pma index (m-pma). antibody titers to porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), selenomonas sputigena (sel), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), and streptococcus mitis (mi) were determined using the micro-elisa. ds subjects under 4 years old were found to have significantly more gingival inflammation than did  normal children the same age. a significant positive correlation (r = 0.548, p <  0.0001) existed in the relationship between m-pma score and plaque score for subjects in the g1 age group (deciduous dentition). at g1, the average antibody titers to aa, mi, and fn exceeded those of the normal adult reference serum pool. in addition, igg antibody titers to pg, aa, fn, sel, and mi correlated significantly with the m-pma scores in the g1 age group. there was a correlation  between age (2 to 18 years) and these antibody titers. igg antibody titers to pg, aa, sel, and mi increased significantly with increasing m-pma score. furthermore, the igg antibody titers to pg were higher (p < 0.05) in the most extensive disease group compared to the ds no-disease group. the igg antibody titers to pg  at g3 (early puberty) were significantly higher when compared to g1 (preschool children). the igm antibody titers to aa at g3 were higher (p < 0.05) when compared to g1. this study suggests that colonization by aa and fn are closely associated with the onset of gingival inflammation in ds patients under 5 years old. colonization by pg, aa, sel, and mi in ds appears to be associated with gingivitis at puberty.

TI  == prevalence of porphyromonas and prevotella species in the dental plaque of dogs.
AB  == the prevalence and populations of porphyromonas and prevotella species were determined in three samples of dental plaque from each of 34 healthy dogs. porphyromonas gingivalis was present in 68 per cent of the dogs and 47 per cent of the plaque samples. the counts of p gingivalis increased with age (p < 0.1), the amount of plaque (p < 0.05) and the degree of gingivitis (p < 0.1). prevotella intermedia was present in 44 per cent of the dogs and 23 per cent of the plaque samples. the counts of p intermedia were correlated with the amount of plaque (p < 0.05) and the degree of gingivitis (p < 0.1). porphyromonas canoris,  p salivosa, p cangingivalis, p cansulci, p crevioricanis and prevotella denticola were isolated from only 9, 6, 3, 3, 3 and 3 per cent of the dogs, respectively. porphyromonas gingivicanis was not isolated from any of the animals sampled. there was a highly significant (p < 0.001) correlation between the amount of plaque, the extent of gingivitis and the age of the dog.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == fermentation product analysis in the identification of black-pigmented bacteria from periodontitis.

TI  == selling biotechnology in the dental medicine marketplace: the omnigene diagnostics dna probe tests for periodontal pathogens.
AB  == omnigene diagnostics, inc. has applied the principles of genetic engineering to develop species-specific dna probe tests for eight periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and treponema denticola). the test requires minimal effort on the part of the clinician: subgingival plaque samples  are collected from the patient and sent through the mail for analysis by omnigene diagnostics' fully licensed clinical reference laboratory. results are transmitted to the practitioner by phone, fax, or mail. the use of diagnostic tests for periodontal pathogens is a relatively new concept in dentistry and acceptance of the omnigene diagnostics tests by the dental marketplace has been slower than anticipated. omnigene diagnostics' challenge for the future is to persuade the dental community that monitoring periodontal pathogen levels, as well as other clinical indicators of disease, is essential to providing optimal care to the periodontitis patient.

TI  == polymerase chain reaction detection of 8 putative periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of gingivitis and advanced periodontitis lesions.
AB  == a 16s rrna-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) detection method was used to determine the prevalence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia. prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola in subgingival specimens of 50 advanced periodontitis, 50 adult gingivitis and 50 pediatric gingivitis subjects. the optimal pcr conditions were determined for each study species. agarose gel electrophoresis of pcr products from each study species revealed a single band of the predicted size. restriction enzyme digestion of amplicons confirmed the specificity of the amplification. pcr detection limits were in the range of 25-100 cells. no cross-reactivity with other oral micro-organisms or nonspecific amplification was observed. the prevalence by pcr in advanced periodontitis, adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis subjects was 30%, 14% and 14% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 86%, 18% and 8% for b. forsythus, 74%, 52% and 78% for c. rectus, 80%, 70% and 66% for e.  corrodens, 70%, 10% and 14% for p. gingivalis, 58%, 12% and 18% for p. intermedia, 52%, 20% and 22% for p. nigrescens, and 54%, 16% and 16% for t. denticola, respectively. the prevalence was higher in the advanced periodontitis  group than in both adult gingivitis and pediatric gingivitis for a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens  and t. denticola at p < 0.01, and for e. corrodens at p < 0.05. the prevalence of c. rectus was significantly higher in the advanced periodontitis group than in the adult gingivitis group at p < 0.01. matching results between pcr and culture  occurred in 28% (b. forsythus) to 71% (a. actinomycetemcomitans) of the samples;  the major discrepancy occurred in the pcr-positive/culture-negative category. matching results between pcr and dna probe methods were found in 84% of the subjects (b. forsythus) and 70% (p. gingivalis). odds ratio analysis revealed statistically significant positive associations between 17 of the 28 possible combinations (p < 0.01). this study demonstrated the utility of a 16s rrna-based  pcr detection method for identifying important subgingival microorganisms. the results indicated a strong association between the study species and periodontitis. several previously unreported symbiotic relationships were found between the 8 species tested.

TI  == evaluation of the long-term efficacy and safety of locally-applied minocycline in adult periodontitis patients.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to establish in a long-term investigation the safety as well as the clinical and microbiological efficacy of  scaling and rootplaning combined with local application of 2% minocycline hydrochloride-gel versus placebo-gel in patients with moderate to severe chronic  adult periodontitis. this was an 18 months, randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative study, in which 20 healthy patients with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis participated. at baseline, all patients received professional oral  hygiene-instruction and supra- and subgingival scaling and root planing. the minocycline-gel was applied subgingivally baseline, 2 weeks, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. microbiological evaluation was carried out using dmdx to identify the following bacteria: porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola. in addition standard microbiological techniques were used for the detection of p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, c. albicans and enterobacteriaceae. results showed a statistically significant improvement for all clinical parameters irrespective of the treatment modality. no differences were observed between test and control with regard to probing depth and attachment level. the dmdx data showed a significant reduction in both the numbers and the prevalence over the 15 months period, but no significant difference between groups. culture data showed that at baseline two-third were positive for p. gingivalis and p. intermedia. analysis over the 18 month period showed no significant difference between the two treatment modalities. c. albicans and enterobacteriaceae were detected only in small proportions at each time interval in a limited number of patients. no adverse reactions were observed during the trial period. the present patient group responded favourably to scaling and rootplaning, but did not benefit from an effect of local of minocycline. subgingival debridement in combination with oral hygiene instruction by itself has been shown to be effective. it remains to be studied whether local  application of minocycline can be effective as an adjunct to mechanical therapy in sites that respond poorly to conventional treatment.

TI  == phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation on biofilms of porphyromonas and prevotella species.
AB  == species of prevotella (pr.) and porphyromonas (po.) and other microorganisms were cultivated as biofilms on agar medium and examined for their susceptibility to argon laser irradiation (continuous mode; wavelengths, 488-514 nm; fluences, 20-200 j cm(-2)). fluences of 35 to 80 j cm(-2) inhibited biofilm growth in po. endodontalis, po. gingivalis, pr. denticola, pr. intermedia, pr. melaninogenica and pr. nigrescens. a fluence of 70 j cm(-2) did not affect biofilm growth in species of bacillus, candida, enterobacter, proteus, pseudomonas, staphylococcus  and streptococcus. the phototoxic effects of argon laser irradiation against prevotella and porphyromonas species were: (1) caused by the radiation alone; (2) modified by biofilm age; (3) dependent on the presence of atmospheric oxygen; (4) influenced by medium supplements of hemin, hemoglobin and blood; (5) greater when compared with other microbial species; (6) demonstrated without augmentation with an exogenous photosensitizer; and (7) apparently unrelated to the protoporphyrin  content of the cells. overall, these in vitro findings suggest that low doses of  argon laser radiation may be effective in the treatment and/or prevention of clinical infections caused by biofilm-associated species of prevotella or porphyromonas.

TI  == antagonistic effect of oral bacteria towards treponema denticola.
AB  == this study was designed to isolate oral bacteria exhibiting antagonism towards treponema denticola and to characterize the inhibitory activity. eleven bacterial isolates obtained from subgingival sites and identified as either staphylococcus  aureus or streptococcus mutans were found to inhibit the growth of t. denticola.  when the activity spectra of these isolates were analyzed, two additional periodontopathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) were found to be affected, whereas most gram-positive bacteria were not. strains of s. aureus produce a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (heat stable and protease  sensitive), whereas the inhibitory effect of s. mutans appears to be related to the production of lactic acid. the negative interactions reported in this paper may govern population shifts observed in subgingival sites.

TI  == proteolytic artifacts in sds-page analysis of selected periodontal pathogens.
AB  == the aim of the study was to examine whether proteolytic artifacts, which result in a loss and poor resolution of protein bands, occur during sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of cellular proteins from selected proteolytic (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens and treponema denticola) and non-proteolytic (fusobacterium nucleatum) bacteria. conditions to limit or prevent proteolysis were also investigated. bacterial cells were incubated in solubilizing buffer (sds+ beta mercaptoethanol) at room temperature for various periods of time before boiling. a control assay consisted of trichloroacetic acid-treated bacterial cells. cellular proteins were separated by electrophoresis and stained with coomassie blue. proteolysis occurred very rapidly in the case of p. gingivalis (< 30 s), whereas a longer incubation time (> 1 h) was required to observe similar effects in p. nigrescens and t. denticola. no proteolysis was observed for f. nucleatum. in all cases, heat (100  degrees c) and low ph (< 4) treatments of bacterial cells could avoid production  of proteolytic artifacts. incorporation of specific protease inhibitors before solubilization of bacteria could also prevent proteolysis. more particularly, n-alpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (tlck), iodoacetamide and diisopropylfluorophosphate (50 mm) were highly efficient for p. gingivalis, p. nigrescens and t. denticola, respectively. when outer membranes of p. gingivalis  were prepared in the presence of tlck, numerous additional protein brands, not seen in the absence of tlck, were detected. the present study suggests that specific protease inhibitors, effective in preventing proteolysis, should be identified and added during cell fractionation and protein purification procedures.

TI  == degradation of host protease inhibitors and activation of plasminogen by proteolytic enzymes from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola.
AB  == bacterial proteases may participate in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases through their action on host proteins. in the present study, the ability of selected periodontopathogens, as well as two proteases isolated from porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola, to degrade host protease inhibitors was evaluated. the activation of human plasminogen by the two bacterial proteases was also investigated. proteolytic breakdown of host protease inhibitors (alpha-1-antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, antithrombin iii, antiplasmin and cystatin c) was evaluated by sds-page. the 80 kda trypsin-like protease of p. gingivalis completely digested the six protease inhibitors under investigation, whereas the 95 kda chymotrypsin-like protease of  t. denticola was slightly less active, more particularly on alpha 2-macroglobulin and cystatin c. when whole cells from a number of oral bacterial species were tested, the most significant degradation was obtained with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and capnocytophaga spp. peptostreptococcus micros and propionibacterium acnes had only some degradative activity on selected inhibitors, whereas three bacterial species, actinobacillus  actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and fusobacterium nucleatum, had no  effect on the protease inhibitors. the 80 kda protease of p. gingivalis demonstrated strong plasminogen activation, whereas no such activity was associated with the 95 kda protease of t. denticola. this study indicates the high potential of some periodontal pathogens to destroy protease inhibitors and activate plasminogen. this may result in an uncontrolled degradation of periodontal tissues and a rapid progression of the disease.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola detection in oral plaque samples using the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == detection of putative pathogens is critical for delineating the etiology and progression of periodontitis. in the present study, we have used a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay utilizing primers specific for the lkt a gene of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, the fimbrial gene of porphyromonas gingivalis, and tdp a gene of treponema denticola in order to determine the presence of these pathogens in subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites. these gene specific primers were also used to assess the detection of different strains of bacteria in the pcr assays. primers for p. gingivalis detected p. gingivalis strain 33277, but no product was detected when primers were used with extracts from 4 species of capnocytophaga, 3 species of prevotella, 2 species of porphyromonas other than p. gingivalis, bacteroides levii, escherichia coli, 3 strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans and 3 strains of t. denticola. pcr analysis using primers for the lkt a gene of a. actinomycetemcomitans also did not result in a product with any of these bacteria with the exception of a positive result with 3 different strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans. primers selected from the tdp a gene of t. denticola did not identify any of the bacteria strains tested except t. denticola serovars a, b, and c. thus, these primers were shown to amplify gene segments that are specific to either p. gingivalis (33277), a. actinomycetemcomitans (33384, 43717  and 43718) or t. denticola (35405, 33521 and 35404). the pcr assay may be used to rapidly detect the presence of periodontal pathogens in the future.

TI  == an investigation into the use of sds-page of cell surface extracts and proteolytic activity to differentiate prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia.
AB  == by comparison of the cell surface proteins derived from the outer membrane and fibrils from 14 prevotella intermedia and 19 prevotella nigrescens strains using  sds and analysed by sds-page, it was possible to distinguish the two species. a polypeptide of approx. 21 kda distinguished p. intermedia strains, whereas two polypeptides of approx. 18 and 22 kda could be used to identify p. nigrescens strains. four other human oral black pigmented bacterial species (porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella denticola, prevotella loescheii and prevotella melaninogenica) did not have the 18-, 21- or 22-kda polypeptides shown by p. intermedia or p. nigrescens. the cell-associated proteolytic activity of eight strains of p. intermedia, 14 strains of p. nigrescens and one strain of p. gingivalis (w50) was assessed using four chromogenic substrates. the hydrolysis of the substrate gppna (indicative of dipeptidyl peptidase iv-like activity) and  saappna (elastase-like activity) by p. intermedia strains varied from 32 to 114 units and 0.5 to 12.6 units of activity respectively, where one unit was defined  as the amount of protease enzyme catalysing the formation of 1 nmol of p-nitroaniline under experimental conditions. 37.5% (3 of 8) of p. intermedia strains hydrolysed saappna (chymotrypsin-like enzyme activity) with activities of between 7 and 12 units. the hydrolysis of gppna and saaapna by p. nigrescens strains was 32-149 and 3-16 units, respectively. 57% (8 of 14) of p. nigrescens strains hydrolysed saapppna with activities ranging from 3 to 8 units. none of the p. intermedia or p. nigrescens strains examined were found to have trypsin-like enzyme activity (bapna hydrolysis). the gppna and saaapna hydrolytic activity associated with the proteases from porphyromonas gingivalis w50 was at least twice that of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens strains. the similar peptidase activities of p. intermedia and p. nigrescens against chromogenic substrates cannot be used to differentiate the species, but sds-page of cell surface protein extracts allowed unambiguous speciation between p. intermedia and p. nigrescens. this simple technique of cell surface protein analysis can be performed in most laboratories and offers a convenient way by which to differentiate the two species.

TI  == characterization of inhibitory effects of suspected periodontopathogens on osteogenesis in vitro.
AB  == by using an in vitro bone-forming culture system, the chick periosteal osteogenesis (cpo) model, the direct effects on osteogenesis of sonicated extracts derived from oral bacteria were examined. both extracts from bacterial species having strong associations with periodontal diseases (porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia, hereinafter referred to as suspected periodontopathogens) and extracts from species not correlated with periodontal disease (streptococcus sanguis, veillonella atypica, and prevotella denticola, hereinafter referred to as nonpathogenic bacteria) were tested. all bacterial cultures were grown under standard anaerobic culture conditions. sonicated bacterial extracts were prepared from the bacterial pellet. these were added in various proportions to the cpo cultures. parameters of osteogenesis, including alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium and p(i) accumulation, and collagen synthesis, were measured in 6-day-old cultures. compared with controls grown in the absence of bacterial products, osteogenesis was inhibited significantly in cultures treated with extracts derived from the suspected periodontopathogens. no osteogenic inhibition was observed in cultures treated with extracts from the nonpathogenic bacteria. these results suggest that the ability to inhibit osteogenesis in vitro may be a pathogenic property shared by a limited group of species. further characterization of the p. gingivalis extracts revealed that both proteinaceous and nonproteinaceous products, including lipopolysaccharide, were able to inhibit osteogenesis. p. gingivalis extract-mediated inhibition of osteogenesis in cpo cultures was blocked by indomethacin, implicating prostaglandins in the regulation of the bacterial effects. the bacterial extracts had either reversible or irreversible inhibitory effects on osteogenesis when added after differentiation or before/during differentiation of bone cells, respectively.

TI  == cellular source, activation and inhibition of dental plaque collagenase.
AB  == dental plaque is the major aetiological factor in periodontal diseases and contains several proteolytic enzymes. the origin of these proteinases is, however, poorly studied. this study was undertaken to characterize collagenase present in dental plaque of adult periodontitis patients. vertebrate-type rather  than bacterial-derived collagenase activity was detected in extracts of both supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts of adult periodontitis patients. dental plaque collagenase was found to exist predominantly in autoactive form. dental plaque collagenase from periodontally healthy individuals existed in latent from. latent dental plaque collagenase from periodontitis lesions could be activated by a 95 kd chymotrypsin-like proteinase from treponema denticola and human leukocyte cathepsin g but not by human plasmin. incubation of purified latent leukocyte collagenase with whole cells of fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium saburreum, prevotella buccae and porphyromonas gingivalis, however, did not result to the activation of the enzyme. doxycycline in vitro inhibited dental plaque collagenase with an ic50-value of 20 microm. dental plaque collagenase degraded more efficiently type i and ii collagens than type iii collagen. western-blot analysis with specific anti-human neutrophil collagenase-antibody revealed that both in supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts dental plaque collagenase had undergone proteolytic conversion from an 80 kd proform to a 58 kd active form which is associated with catalytic autoactivity as measured by functional collagenase assay. this reflects proteolytic activation of leukocyte collagenase in dental plaque probably by other proteases derived from potent periodontopathogenic bacteria such as t. denticola or other pmn proteases such as cathepsin g.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == earlier work has shown that gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) contains dipeptidyl peptidase (dpp) activities that resemble those in host tissue. here, further comparisons were made with enzymes from suspected periodontal pathogens. gingival tissue and gcf were collected from patients with chronic periodontitis. dpp ii and dpp iv fractions with acid and alkaline ph optima, respectively, were separated from crude tissue extracts by gel-filtration chromatography. bacterial  cell sonicates were prepared from broth cultures of reference strains. there was  moderate to strong dpp activity with capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella spp., very weak activity with treponema denticola and no detectable activity with actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fusobacterium nucleatum. banding patterns in gcf, tissue and bacterial samples were compared on substrate-impregnated overlay membranes applied to isoelectric focusing gels. in  gels washed with acid buffer, gcf had bands corresponding to tissue dpp ii. use of an alkaline washing buffer showed gcf activity which closely matched tissue dpp iv that had been pretreated with neuraminidase, an enzyme found by others in  the gingival crevice. p. gingivalis gave multiple bands and several of these had  counterparts in gcf. the apparent presence in gcf of the dpp from p. gingivalis is consistent with the association of this organism with destructive periodontitis.

TI  == characterisation of black-pigmented anaerobes isolated from diseased and healthy  periodontal sites.
AB  == prevotella intermedia has recently been re-defined and a new species, prevotella  nigrescens has been proposed. however, there is little data available on the incidence of these new species in periodontal health or disease. black-pigmented  anaerobes isolated from diseased and healthy subgingival sites were identified by serotyping, sds-page and physiological tests. in adult periodontitis subjects, 64% of active sites, 35.7% of inactive sites and 38.5% of healthy sites yielded black-pigmented anaerobes. of these, porphyromonas gingivalis was found in 11% of active and 5% of healthy sites in diseased patients, prevotella intermedia in 15.5% of active and 20.5% of healthy sites, prevotella nigrescens in 37.7% of active and 11.5% of healthy sites and prevotella denticola in 3% of active and 1% of healthy sites. in healthy subjects, 50% of sites yielded black-pigmented anaerobes. p. gingivalis was not found in healthy subjects but p. intermedia was  found in 18% and p. nigrescens in 31% of sites. sds-page proved to be a useful method for routinely differentiating p. intermedia and p. nigrescens and two sub-types of the latter species were detected on the basis of band pattern. only  one p. nigrescens sub-type was found in any given individual and one type, typified by atcc 25261, was more commonly found in deep pockets. however, overall both p. nigrescens and p. intermedia as species were just as frequently found at  healthy sites as diseased sites. thus, these species, in contrast to p. gingivalis, appear to be common commensals but they may act as opportunistic pathogens.

AB  == the phototoxicity of argon laser irradiation was studied in aqueous suspensions of porphyromonas endodontalis (american type culture collection [atcc] 35406), porphyromonas gingivalis (atcc 33277), prevotella denticola (atcc 33184) and two  strains of prevotella intermedia (atcc 15033 and 49046), all "black-pigmented bacteria," bpb, that accumulate cellular porphyrins. several of these species have been implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease. non-black-pigmented  bacteria were also studied to test the specificity of irradiation as a potential  photodynamic treatment for periodontal infections. cell suspensions were irradiated with an argon laser at fluences of 20-200 j/cm2. when cultured in hemin-supplemented media, atcc 15033 was the most sensitive to irradiation. however, a second strain of the same species (atcc 49046) was resistant. the photosensitivity of other species ranked atcc 33277 > 35406 = 33184 = 35496. when hemin was replaced in media by hemoglobin, atcc 33277 became resistant to irradiation. protoporphyrin ix content in bpb cells was shown not to be a major factor determining photosensitivity. oxygen was required during irradiation for bpb species to be affected. non-black-pigmented bacteria were much less sensitive to irradiation than bpb.

TI  == oligonucleotide probes to the 16s ribosomal rna: implications of sequence homology and secondary structure with particular reference to the oral species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens.
AB  == eight oligonucleotides based upon regions of the small subunit 16s ribosomal rna  gene sequences were analysed against a background of their position within the molecule and their two-dimensional structure to rationalise their use in recognising prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the 41 clinical isolates from both oral and respiratory sites and two reference strains were subjected to dna-dna hybridisation and multilocus enzyme electrophoresis to confirm their identity. alignment of oligonucleotide probes designated i bi-2 to  i bi-6 (for p. intermedia) and 2bi-2 (for p. nigrescens) with the 16s rrna suggested that these probes lacked specificity or were constructed from hypervariable regions. a 52-mer oligonucleotide (designated bi) reliably detected both species. because of the high degree of concordance between the 16s rrnas of  both species, it was necessary to vary the stringency of hybridisation conditions for detection of both species. thus probe i bi-i recognised p. intermedia while i bi-i detected both p. intermedia and p. nigrescens at low stringency. however, under conditions of high stringency only p. nigrescens was recognised by probe 2bi-i. these probes were highly specific and did not hybridise with dna from the  closely related p. corporis, nor other periodontal pathogens such as fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola and several pigmented species such as prevotella melaninogenica, p. denticola, p. loescheii, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, py. endodontalis, py. gingivalis, py. levii, and py. macacae.

TI  == effect of initial therapy on dynamics of immunogloblin g levels to some periodontopathic bacteria in serum and gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the igg antibody levels to specific gram-negative periodontopathic bacteria in serum of 21 adult periodontitis patients and the gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) from 42 sites with destructive lesions and 21 healthy sites were evaluated before and after initial preparation. porphyromonas gingivalis, bacteroides forsythus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, campylobacter rectus, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans in subgingival plaque samples from the patients were examined by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. subgingival plaque, gcf, and serum samples were taken at baseline and three weeks after initial preparation. for 14 patients, changes in clinical parameters due to the initial preparation were correlated with reduction of periodontopathogens and to  igg antibody levels in gcf and serum against them. p. gingivalis, t. denticola and c. rectus were found to be predominant in destructive sites. no significant differences were found in gcf igg antibody levels between destructive and healthy sites. in destructive sites, the prevalence of p. gingivalis and c. rectus was significantly correlated with elevated igg antibody against these microorganisms  in gcf. the initial preparation resulted in significant reduction of serum igg antibody levels against all microorganisms tested. no decrease in gcf igg antibody was observed, but levels to p. gingivalis and c. rectus were significantly increased (p<0.05). the assessment of gcf igg antibodies to specific periodontopathic bacteria may be of considerable value in reflecting the conditions of periodontitis.

TI  == presence of treponema denticola and porphyromonas gingivalis in children correlated with periodontal disease of their parents.
AB  == considerable evidence exists suggesting that periodontal disease is due to the overgrowth of a finite number of specific bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, and prevotella intermedia, among others. three of these organisms-p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and b. forsythus-can be easily detected in plaque samples by the hydrolysis of the synthetic trypsin substrate benzoyl-dl-arginine-naphthylamide (bana). the aim of the present study was to determine if a relationship could be found between the presence of either these organisms of periodontitis in the parent and the presence of bana-positive species in the child. thirty-four mothers or fathers and 34 children were examined for plaque scores, papillary bleeding scores, and the presence of p. gingivalis and t. denticola in four subgingival or marginal gingival plaque samples as assayed by the bana test or specific polyclonal antibodies using an elisa. children whose parents were colonized by bana-positive bacteria were 9.8 times more likely to be colonized by these bana-positive species. children whose  parents had clinical evidence of periodontitis were 12 times more likely to be colonized by these bana-positive species. these data are compatible with the hypothesis that children may acquire the bana-positive species from their parents, especially if the parent has periodontitis.

TI  == bacteriological diagnosis of periodontal disease.
AB  == dental plaque bacteria cause virtually all the forms of inflammatory periodontal  disease. periodontitis is caused by the specific periodontopathic bacteria, which induce destruction of connective tissue attachment and adjacent alveolar bone. examinations to identify the infections by porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens and treponema denticola have recently become essential in diagnosis of periodontal disease. bacterial examination permits (1) identification of the causative bacteria, (2) assessment of disease activity and (3) monitoring of the effective  of periodontal treatments. the author describes details of accurate and rapid methods for detecting periodontopathogens. transmission of periodontopathic bacteria as clarified by bacterial examination is also discussed in this review.  the pathogenic potential of specific bacteria varies among patients and periodontally healthy individuals and can be controlled by host defense mechanisms such as immune responses. the roles of immune responses against periodontopathic bacteria in balance shifts of periodontal disease processes are  therefore also discussed in this review.

TI  == effect of proteolytic enzymes on the lysis and growth of oral bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

TI  == detection of porphyromonas gingivalis in gingival exudate by a dipeptide-enhanced trypsin-like activity.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis in subgingival plaque is an important risk factor for future periodontal attachment loss in susceptible adults. the elimination of p. gingivalis is usually concomitant with a healing process. therefore, it should be valuable to have an easy chairside method to follow the effect of periodontal treatment on p. gingivalis detection as well as on its eventual reappearance during the maintenance period. we have previously reported the stimulation of amidolytic activity of p. gingivalis by the addition of glycyl-glycine to the assay buffer. in this study we determined the proportions of p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, capnocytophaga spp, campylobacter rectus, and eikenella corrodens by cultivation technique and the amidolytic activity, using n-benzoyl-l-arginine-p-nitroanilide (bapna) as substrate, in gingival exudate before and during a 3-year treatment and maintenance period. p. gingivalis was the only species yielding a high and persistent correlation to stimulated amidolytic activity (p values < or = 0.0001) on both site (r = 0.5) and subject (r = 0.8) level. testing pure cultures of suggested periodontal pathogens for effect of glycyl-glycine on amidolytic activity, we found that of p. gingivalis to be 5.9-fold increased. the amidolytic activity of treponema denticola was only slightly stimulated (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 1.2) and that of capnocytophaga slightly inhibited (ratio with/without glycyl-glycine = 0.8). the  outcome of this study has the potential to be used for the development of a simple, rapid, and inexpensive assay for a qualitative and quantitative determination of p. gingivalis in gingival crevicular fluid.

TI  == dna probe detection of periodontopathogens in advanced periodontitis.
AB  == species-specific dna probes were used to determine the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (a.a.), porphyromonas (bacteroides) gingivalis, prevotella  intermedia, treponema denticola, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, and wolinella recta in subgingival plaque from deep pockets/sites of patients with advanced periodontitis. the subjects were 20 patients with severe adult periodontitis, 13 men and 7 women (mean age 45.6 +/- 6.7 yr). for each subject, 9-10 subgingival sites with the deepest probing depths from each quadrant were sampled by the paper point method, a total of 198 sites, with mean probing depth  7.2 +/- 1.6 mm and clinical attachment level 9.5 +/- 2.7 mm. a.a. was present in  at least one site in 75% of the subjects; p. gingivalis was found in 95%; p. intermedia and w. recta were found in 90%, respectively; and t. denticola, e. corrodens, and f. nucleatum were found in all subjects. in the 198 samples, a.a.  was detected in 25.8%, p. gingivalis in 51.5%, p. intermedia in 64.1%, t. denticola in 60.6%, e. corrodens in 72.9%, f. nucleatum in 74.7%, and w. recta in 65.7%. the predominant combination was the simultaneous presence of p. intermedia, t. denticola, e. corrodens, f. nucleatum, and w. recta in 89.5% of the subjects and 46.8% of the sites. of these sites, 51.1% showed the combined presence of p. gingivalis and 28.4% that of both a.a. and p. gingivalis. none of  the seven bacteria could be detected in 14.4% of the total sites sampled. the present study indicates that severe destructive adult periodontitis is a multibacterial infection and that certain combinations of periodontopathogens seem to be important in the pathogenesis of the disease.

TI  == configural frequency analysis for exploring bacterial sets in periodontal health  and disease.
AB  == periodontal research has been concerned with identifying bacterial sets in oral health and disease. configural frequency analysis (cfa) is a taxonomical method used to test the statistical significance of patterns of elementary cell frequencies in cross-tabulated data, and may therefore be used to evaluate interactions among occurrences and non-occurrences of periodontal microorganisms. cfa patterns may exist as configural types or anti-types depending on whether observed cell frequencies are greater or less than expected frequencies, respectively, based on table marginals. cfa was applied to two published data sets. in the first, the occurrence of bacteroides (porphyromonas) gingivalis (bg) and treponema denticola (td) was studied in military subjects. analysis of individual cells of the resultant two-by-two contingency table revealed the existence of a single anti-type (td in the absence of bg) suggesting a sequential phenomenon. the second, more complex, data set was based on reported occurrence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), bg, and bacteroides (prevotella) intermedius (bi) in sites with and without progressive periodontitis. cfa based on all data identified three statistically significant configural types and two anti-types. however, a somewhat different configurational picture emerged when disease progression status was considered a stratification variable for separate  analysis. all these analyses, which were undertaken for expository purposes, assumed independence of observations. methodological procedures are suggested for cfa when observations are not independent.

TI  == tetracycline resistance in periodontal pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial agents are used in combination with debridement to eliminate putative periodontal pathogens, including porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, from diseased tissues. the  most frequently used antimicrobial agents are the tetracyclines. however, these agents are not effective in some patients. this lack of efficacy may be due to antimicrobial resistance. as many as 75% of the bacteria in the subgingival flora may be resistant to tetracycline after long-term, low-dose treatment. tetracycline resistance is mediated by the tet(m) determinant in some isolates of veillonella species and fusobacterium nucleatum, while a dna probe to the tet(q)  determinant hybridizes to isolates of prevotella denticola and p. intermedia. the mechanism of tetracycline resistance for most periodontal organisms, however, has yet to be determined. before tetracycline is used as adjunctive therapy for refractory periodontitis, the subgingival bacterial flora should be tested for susceptibility.

TI  == the effects of acacia arabica gum on the in vitro growth and protease activities  of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of acacia gum was assessed using fresh isolates and reference strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and treponema denticola. a fine aqueous suspension of gum was produced by sonication and then a soluble fraction  isolated by centrifugation and membrane filtration. these preparations were incorporated into columbia agar at doubling concentrations. growth of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia cultures on the agar was inhibited by whole gum sonicate at concentrations of 0.5-1.0% w/v. both species showed reduced susceptibility when horse blood was present in the agar. the gum soluble fraction did not inhibit growth of any bacterial culture. the effect of acacia on bacterial proteases was examined with cell sonicates from log phase broth cultures. enzyme activities were determined by fluorimetric assay with various synthetic peptide substrates. most protease activities reduced in the presence of 0.5% w/v gum sonicate, with the trypsin-like activities of p. gingivalis and p. intermedia proving most sensitive. the gum soluble fraction was nearly always less inhibitory than the sonicate. the action of acacia gum against suspected periodontal pathogens and their enzymes suggests that it may be of clinical value.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections.
AB  == necrotic dental root canal infections are polymicrobial infections dominated by anaerobic bacteria. the number of different species in one canal is usually low,  approx. 4-7 species. the species isolated most frequently belong to the genera prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and streptococcus. the frequency of isolation of black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in endodontic infections varies from 25% to > 50%. pr. intermedia is the most commonly found pigmented species, followed by pr. denticola and two porphyromonas species, p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis. several studies have shown that p. gingivalis and p. endodontalis are closely related to the presence  of acute symptoms in endodontic infections, whereas other black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes are not. however, several other species may also be involved in acute infections. moreover, porphyromonas species have occasionally been isolated from cases with no symptoms. although porphyromonas spp. are clearly related to symptoms at the beginning of therapy, they are not important for the prognosis of the treatment.

TI  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes in periodontitis.
AB  == black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobes have been associated with periodontal disease and tooth loss since they were first isolated by burdon in 1928. porphyromonas gingivalis, which is usually not isolated from children, adolescents or adults with no periodontal breakdown, has been recognized as one of the most important periodontopathogens. its presence is strongly correlated with deep periodontal pockets, which are assumed to be its main habitat. correlations have been shown also with attachment loss, clinical inflammation and serum antibody levels, indicating an aetiological role in the periodontal disease. their pathogenicity in animal models resembling periodontal disease is documented. they are frequently isolated from periodontal abscesses. the relationship between prevotella intermedia and periodontal disease is not clear.  it is frequently isolated from advanced periodontitis, often as the only black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic species; however, the prevalence in adults with no periodontal breakdown is high. it is found frequently in periodontal abscesses and in acute necrotizing and ulcerative gingivitis. serogroup i is found predominantly in deep periodontal pockets, whereas all serogroups (i-iii) are found in shallow pockets and gingivitis. no conclusive difference in pathogenicity between serogroups has been found. pr. melaninogenica, pr. denticola and pr. loescheii are frequently found in the gingival crevice in preschool children and other age groups with gingivitis, but  are seldom found in deep periodontal pockets.

AB  == activation of latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases as well as degradation of native type i collagen by supra- and subgingival dental plaque extracts, an 80-kda trypsinlike protease from porphyromas gingivalis (atcc 33277), a 95-kda chymotrypsinlike protease from treponema denticola (atcc 29522), and selected bacterial species commonly isolated in periodontitis was studied. the bacteria included were prevotella intermedia (atcc 25261), prevotella buccae (es 57), prevotella oris (atcc 33573), porphyromonas endodontalis (es 54b), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (atcc 295222), fusobacterium nucleatum (atcc 10953), mitsuokella dentalis (dsm 3688), and streptococcus mitis (atcc 15909). none of the bacteria activated latent procollagenases; however, both sub- and supragingival dental plaque extracts (neutral salt extraction) and proteases isolated from cell extracts from potentially periodontopathogenic bacteria p. gingivalis and t. denticola were found to activate latent human fibroblast-type and neutrophil interstitial procollagenases. the fibroblast-type interstitial collagenase was more efficiently activated by bacterial proteases than the neutrophil counterpart, which instead preferred nonproteolytic activation by the oxidative agent hypochlorous acid. the proteases were not able to convert collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (timp-1) complexes into active form or to change the ability of timp-1 to inhibit interstitial collagenase. none of the studied bacteria, proteases from p. gingivalis and t. denticola, or extracts of supra- and subgingival dental plaque showed any significant collagenolytic activity. however, the proteases degraded native and denatured collagen fragments after cleavage by interstitial collagenase and gelatinase. our results indicate that proteases from periodontopathogenic bacteria can act as direct proteolytic activators of human procollagenases and degrade collagen fragments. thus, in concert with host enzymes the bacterial proteases may participate in periodontal  tissue destruction.

TI  == growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, t. pectinovorum, t. socranskii, and t. vincentii in a chemically defined medium.
AB  == a chemically defined medium, omiz (oral microbiology and immunology, zurich)-w1 was developed. medium omiz-w1 supports the long-term proliferation of a wide range of oral anaerobes, including representative strains of four treponema species and porphyromonas gingivalis. high concentrations of ascorbic acid and ammonium ions proved to be important for the growth of these organisms. t. denticola cd-1 grew in the absence of polyamines and long-chain fatty acids, t. pectinovorum and t. socranskii required polyamines, whereas t. vincentii depended on both polyamines and lecithin for growth. specific requirements for purines and/or pyrimidines were detected, and these requirements could be used to distinguish haemophilus-actinobacillus group organisms. some strains of p. gingivalis grew without vitamin k, while others were not satisfied by menadione but required its precursor 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoic acid. protoporphyrin ix or hemin equally satisfied the porphyrin requirements of p. gingivalis and bacteroides forsythus, whereas ferrous sulfate was more efficiently used as a source of iron than was hemin. the cellular cohesiveness of p. gingivalis increased with high concentrations of hemin in the growth medium. prevotella intermedia, b. forsythus, and several strains of p. gingivalis were more fastidious and required a protein or serum supplement to grow in medium omiz-w1.
