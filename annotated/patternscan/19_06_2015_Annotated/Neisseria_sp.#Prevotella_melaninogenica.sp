TI  == quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  == the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (rth), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (oth). mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). the highest recovery rate of  organisms per tonsil was in patients with oth (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in rt and 5.9 per tonsil in rth. the predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), neisseria sp (16), staphylococcus aureus (14), and eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were fusobacterium sp (8), bacteroides sp (7), and prevotella melaninogenica (5). the number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). a higher concentration of s aureus and h influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (rth and oth) as compared to rt. these findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for h influenzae and s aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and  without inflammation (rth and oth). further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.
