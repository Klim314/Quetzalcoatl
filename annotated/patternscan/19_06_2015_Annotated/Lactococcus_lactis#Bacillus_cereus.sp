TI  == the length of a lantibiotic hinge region has profound influence on antimicrobial  activity and host specificity.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized (methyl)lanthionine containing peptides  which can efficiently inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria. as lantibiotics kill bacteria efficiently and resistance to them is difficult to be  obtained, they have the potential to be used in many applications, e.g., in pharmaceutical industry or food industry. nisin can inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria by binding to lipid ii and by making pores in their membrane. the c-terminal part of nisin is known to play an important role during  translocation over the membrane and forming pore complexes. however, as the thickness of bacterial membranes varies between different species and environmental conditions, this property could have an influence on the pore forming activity of nisin. to investigate this, the so-called "hinge region" of nisin (residues nmk) was engineered to vary from one to six amino acid residues and specific activity against different indicators was compared. antimicrobial activity in liquid culture assays showed that wild type nisin is most active, while truncation of the hinge region dramatically reduced the activity of the peptide. however, one or two amino acids extensions showed only slightly reduced  activity against most indicator strains. notably, some variants (+2, +1, -1, -2)  exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than nisin in agar well diffusion assays  against lactococcus lactis mg1363, listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis  ve14089, bacillus sporothermodurans ic4 and bacillus cereus 4153 at certain temperatures.

TI  == impact of lactococcus lactis spp. lactis bio adhesion on pathogenic bacillus cereus biofilm on silicone flowing system.
AB  == bacillus cereus is a food pathogen that can attach on most of the surfaces and form biofilms, which facilitate the persistence and resistance toward antimicrobials. the aims of this study were (i) to characterize the structural dynamics of b. cereus sessile growth in two nutritional environments (with or without a nutrient flow), and (ii) to evaluate the impact of bio adhesion of lactococcus lactis on b. cereus biofilm. significantly greater biofilm volume and thickness were observed under dynamic conditions than under static conditions after 48 h and b. cereus biofilm was highly organized. the variation of physico-chemical characteristics of silicone by b. cereus bio adhesion favours the adhesion of hydrophilic lc. lactis on the surface adhered by biofilm. lc. lactis was able to adhere to silicone surface and produce biofilm obviously exhibited a significant reduction of b. cereus adhered cells up to nine orders of magnitude after 48 h of contact with competitive activity for nutrient and oxygen. this study constitutes a step ahead in developing strategies to prevent microbial colonization of silicone with lactococcal protective biofilm.

TI  == novel antibacterial activity of lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis z11 isolated from zabady.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select and characterize a probiotic bacterium with distinctive antimicrobial activities. in this respect, lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis z11 (l. lactis z11) isolated from zabady (arabian yoghurt) inhibited other strains of lactic acid bacteria and some food-born pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. the  inhibitory activity of cell free supernatant (cfs) of l. lactis z11 isolated from zabady was lost by proteolytic enzymes, heat resistant. consequently, the active  substance(s) of cfs was characterized as a bacteriocin. this bacteriocin has been shown to consist of protein but has no lipidic or glucidic moieties in its active molecule. its activity was stable in the ph range 2.0 to 7.0 and was not affected by organic solvents. the l. lactis z11 bacteriocin was produced in cfs throughout the mide to the late exponential phase of growth of the producer organism and maximum bacteriocin production was obtained at initial ph 6.5 at incubation temperature of about 30 degrees c.

TI  == probing determinants of cyclopiazonic acid sensitivity of bacterial ca2+-atpases.
AB  == cyclopiazonic acid (cpa) is a specific and potent inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic reticulum ca(2+)-atpase 1a (serca1a). despite high sequence similarity to serca1a, listeria monocytogenes ca(2+)-atpase 1 (lmca1) is not inhibited by cpa.  to test whether a cpa binding site could be created while maintaining the functionality of the atpase we targeted four amino acid positions in lmca1 for mutational studies based on a multiple sequence alignment of serca-like ca(2+)-atpases and structural analysis of the cpa site. the identification of cpa-sensitive gain-of-function mutants pinpointed key determinants of the cpa binding site. the importance of these determinants was further underscored by the characterization of the cpa sensitivity of two additional bacterial ca(2+)-atpases from lactococcus lactis and bacillus cereus. the cpa sensitivity was predicted from their sequence compared with the lmca1 results, and this was experimentally confirmed. interestingly, a cluster of lactococcus bacteria applied in the production of fermented cheese display ca(2+)-atpases that are predictably cpa insensitive and may originate from their coexistence with cpa-producing penicillum and aspergillus fungi in the cheese. the differences between bacterial and mammalian binding pockets encompassing the cpa site suggest that cpa derivatives that are specific for bacteria or other pathogens can be developed.

TI  == food preservative potential of gassericin a-containing concentrate prepared from  a cheese whey culture supernatant from lactobacillus gasseri la39.
AB  == gassericin a (ga) is a circular bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39. in this study, ga-containing concentrate was prepared using a cross-flow membrane filtration device (30 kda cut-off) from the culture supernatant of lb. gasseri la39 cultivated in a cheese whey-based food-grade medium. the bacteriocin activity titer in the concentrate was 16 times as high as that of the culture supernatant and was completely maintained through each incubation at 4 degrees c  for 3 months, 37 degrees c for 2 months, 60 degrees c for 5 h, and 100 degrees c  for 30 min. the ga-containing concentrate was used with glycine powder to make custard creams, and then four representative strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria (bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans and pseudomonas fluorescens) were individually inoculated at c. 10(3) colony forming units/g in the custard creams. throughout 30 days of incubation at 30 degrees c, all of the inoculated bacteria were completely inhibited by the combination of 5% (w/w) of the ga-containing concentrate and 0.5% (w/w) glycine. this is the first highly practical application of ga to foods as a biopreservative, and the concentration method and the bacteriocin concentrate would contribute to biopreservation of several foods.

TI  == crystal structures of two transcriptional regulators from bacillus cereus define  the conserved structural features of a padr subfamily.
AB  == padr-like transcriptional regulators form a structurally-related family of proteins that control the expression of genes associated with detoxification, virulence and multi-drug resistance in bacteria. only a few members of this family have been studied by genetic, biochemical and biophysical methods, and their structure/function relationships are still largely undefined. here, we report the crystal structures of two padr-like proteins from bacillus cereus, which we named bcpadr1 and bcpadr2 (products of gene loci bc4206 and bce3449 in strains atcc 14579 and atcc 10987, respectively). bc4206, together with its neighboring gene bc4207, was previously shown to become significantly upregulated in presence of the bacteriocin as-48. dna mobility shift assays reveal that bcpadr1 binds to a 250 bp intergenic region containing the putative bc4206-bc4207 promoter sequence, while in-situ expression of bcpadr1 decreases bacteriocin tolerance, together suggesting a role for bcpadr1 as repressor of bc4206-bc4207 transcription. the function of bcpadr2 (48% identical in sequence to bcpadr1) is  unknown, but the location of its gene just upstream from genes encoding a putative antibiotic abc efflux pump, suggests a role in regulating antibiotic resistance. the bcpadr proteins are structurally similar to lmrr, a padr-like transcription regulator in lactococcus lactis that controls expression of a multidrug abc transporter via a mechanism of multidrug binding and induction. together these proteins define a subfamily of conserved, relatively small padr proteins characterized by a single c-terminal helix for dimerization. unlike lmrr, bcpadr1 and bcpadr2 lack a central pore for ligand binding, making it unclear whether the transcriptional regulatory roles of bcpadr1 and bcpadr2 involve direct ligand recognition and induction.

TI  == potential application of the nisin z preparation of lactococcus lactis w8 in preservation of milk.
AB  == aims: the aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the preparation of nisin z from lactococcus lactis w8-fermented milk in controlling the growth of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized milk. methods and results: spoilage bacteria isolated from pasteurized milk at 8 and 15 degrees c were identified as enterococcus italicus, enterococcus mundtii, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus thuringiensis, bacillus cereus, lactobacillus paracasei, acinetobacter sp., pseudomonas fluorescens and enterobacter aerogenes. these bacteria were found to  have the ability to survive pasteurization temperature. except enterobacter aerogenes, the spoilage bacteria were sensitive to the nisin z preparation of the l. lactis w8. addition of the nisin z preparation to either the skim milk or fat  milk inoculated with each of the spoilage bacteria reduced the initial counts (about 5 log cfu ml(-)(1)) to an undetectable level within 8-20 h. the nisin z preparation extended the shelf life of milk to 2 months under refrigeration. conclusions: the nisin z preparation from l. lactis w8-fermented milk was found to be effective as a backup preservative to counteract postpasteurization contamination in milk. significance and impact of the study: a rapid inhibition of spoilage bacteria in pasteurized skim and fat milk with the nisin z preparation of l. lactis w8 is more significant in comparison with the commercially available nisin (nisin a). the nisin z preparation can be used instead of commercial nisin, which is not effective in fat milk.

TI  == a flagellin-producing lactococcus strain: interactions with mucin and enteropathogens.
AB  == bacillus cereus ch is a probiotic strain used in human nutrition whose adhesion to mucin is dependent on its surface-associated flagellin. flagellins from the surface of several probiotic bacillus strains were efficiently extracted with 5 m licl and identified by peptide fingerprinting. based on the proteomic analysis, cloning of the gene coding for the flagellin of b. cereus ch was performed in the lactococcal vector pnz8110 under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter. the resulting strain, lactococcus lactis ch, produced a surface-associated flagellin  after 6 h of induction with nisin. the recombinant lactococcus strain adhered strongly to mucin-coated polystyrene plates, whilst inhibiting competitively the  adhesion of the pathogens escherichia coli lmg2092 and salmonella enterica ssp. enterica lmg15860 to the same molecule. strain ch could be used in further experimentation for the characterization of the molecular mechanism of action of  this probiotic b. cereus ch flagellin.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == effects of gassericins a and t, bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus gasseri, with glycine on custard cream preservation.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri la39 and la158 isolated from human-infant feces produce bacteriocins named gassericins a and t, respectively. both gassericins have high  heat stability (121 degrees c, 10 min), good ph tolerance (ph 2-11), and strong bactericidality against many gram-positive bacteria, especially lactic acid bacteria, and thus are expected to be effective food preservatives. a microwell plate assay against 12 strains of custard cream spoilage bacteria showed that the gassericins had broader antibacterial spectra than nisin a. although the gassericins allowed gram-negative isolates to grow, they successfully inhibited the growth of all tested bacterial strains in microwells with the addition of glycine. glycine was bacteriostatic against many strains except lactic acid bacteria. for practical use, gassericin a was efficiently produced by cultivation in a food-grade medium improved using cheese whey, nourishing proteose peptone, and surfactant yolk lecithin. the practical preservative effect of gassericin a and glycine was verified from the viability of 4 isolated strains, bacillus cereus, lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, achromobacter denitrificans, and pseudomonas fluorescens, in custard creams. custard cream containing 123 arbitrary units of gassericin a per milliliter entirely growth-inhibited the 2 gram-positive strains. in custard cream containing an insufficient amount of gassericin a (49 arbitrary units/ml), the gram-positive strains gradually grew but were completely inhibited by the addition of 0.5% (wt/wt) glycine. the 2 gram-negative strains did not multiply even in the additive-free custard cream, probably because of the unsuitable growth environment. this is the first report showing the combined effect of bacteriocin and glycine and their application for  food preservation, which may be helpful for future use in the food industry.

TI  == production of nisin z by lactococcus lactis isolated from dahi.
AB  == lactococcus lactis cm1, an isolate from homemade "dahi," a traditional fermented  milk from india, used maltose as carbon source to produce a high level of bacteriocin. the bacterial cell mass and the bacteriocin production correlated with the initial ph of the medium and were highest when the initial ph was 11.0.  the level of bacteriocin reached its peak at the late log phase with concomitant  reduction of culture ph to 4.2, regardless of the initial ph of the medium. a combination of maltose and an initial medium ph of 11 resulted in the highest bacteriocin production. the antibacterial spectrum of the bacteriocin was closely similar to that of nisin and it inhibited a number of food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the compound migrated close to the position of nisin (3.5 kda).  however, it had higher stability than nisin at a wide range of ph and temperature. pcr amplification using nisin gene-specific primers and sequencing of the amplified dna revealed the structural gene for the bacteriocin to be identical to that of nisz.

TI  == inhibitory effect of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: to determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several gram-negative  and gram-positive microorganisms against helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. methods: the in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against h. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. time-kill assay was performed with two staphylococcus spp. strains. results: anti-h. pylori activity was detected with saccharomyces cerevisiae, bacillus spp., 1 enterococcus faecium and 2 lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 h. pylori strains tested. all staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-h. pylori effect: one staphylococcus auricularis and two staphylococcus epidermidis against all h. pylori tested; staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hominis and s. auricularis against six, five and seven h. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative staphylococcus against one h. pylori strain. an inhibitory effect was detected with one escherichia coli against one h. pylori. klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella spp. and acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four h. pylori strains, and enterobacter cloacae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14  h. pylori isolates. no anti-h. pylori activity was detected with one lactobacillus spp., two lactococcus lactis, four streptococcus spp., one bacillus cereus, one e. faecium, one enterococcus faecalis, one e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella oxytoca. time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two staphylococcus spp. strains tested. conclusions: several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit h. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.

TI  == a functional homing endonuclease in the bacillus anthracis nrde group i intron.
AB  == the essential bacillus anthracis nrde gene carries a self-splicing group i intron with a putative homing endonuclease belonging to the giy-yig family. here, we show that the nrde pre-mrna is spliced and that the homing endonuclease cleaves an intronless nrde gene 5 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the intron insertion site, producing 2-nt 3' extensions. we also show that the sequence required for efficient cleavage spans at least 4 bp upstream and 31 bp downstream of the cleaved coding strand. the position of the recognition sequence in relation to the cleavage position is as expected for a giy-yig homing endonuclease. interestingly, nrde genes from several other bacillaceae were also susceptible to cleavage, with those of bacillus cereus, staphylococcus epidermidis (nrde1), b. anthracis, and bacillus thuringiensis serovar konkukian being better substrates than those of bacillus subtilis, bacillus lichenformis, and s. epidermidis (nrde2). on the other hand, nrde genes from lactococcus lactis, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, and corynebacterium ammoniagenes were not cleaved. intervening sequences (ivss) residing in protein-coding genes are often found in enzymes involved in dna metabolism, and the ribonucleotide reductase nrde gene is a frequent target for self-splicing ivss. a comparison of  nrde genes from seven gram-positive low-g+c bacteria, two bacteriophages, and nocardia farcinica showed five different insertion sites for self-splicing ivss within the coding region of the nrde gene.

TI  == culturable bacteria present in the fluid of the hooded-pitcher plant sarracenia minor based on 16s rdna gene sequence data.
AB  == the culturable microbial community within the pitcher fluid of 93 sarracenia minor carnivorous plants was examined over a 2-year study. many aspects of the plant/bacterial/insect interaction within the pitcher fluid are minimally understood because the bacterial taxa present in these pitchers have not been identified. thirteen isolates were characterized by 16s rdna sequencing and subsequent phylogenetic analysis. the proteobacteria were the most abundant taxa  and included representatives from serratia, achromobacter, and pantoea. the actinobacteria micrococcus was also abundant while bacillus, lactococcus, chryseobacterium, and rhodococcus were infrequently encountered. several isolates conformed to species identifiers (>98% rdna gene sequence similarity) including serratia marcescens (isolates found in 27.5% of pitchers), achromobacter xylosoxidans (37.6%), micrococcus luteus (40.9%), bacillus cereus (isolates found in 10.2%), bacillus thuringiensis (5.4%), lactococcus lactis (17.2%), and rhodococcus equi (2.2%). species-area curves suggest that sampling efforts were sufficient to recover a representative culturable bacterial community. the bacteria present represent a diverse community probably as a result of introduction by insect vectors, but the ecological significance remains under explored.

TI  == genotypic and phenotypic diversity of lactococcus lactis isolates from batzos, a  greek pdo raw goat milk cheese.
AB  == the genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling and pfge  were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. according  to pfge data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the l. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. there was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to pfge. clustering of strains according to rapd-pcr was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and pfge for the majority of the strains. in addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the  season of cheese production. all strains inhibited the growth of escherichia coli o157:h7. their ability to affect the growth of yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. in 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. the 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher lys- than leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher leu- than lys-aminopeptidase activity. their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. the majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. these  results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

AB  == this study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as enterococcus durans. rapd-pcr, plasmid profiling  and pfge were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. species recognition by means of rapd-pcr was in agreement with  the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. one strain was characterized as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by rapd-pcr and four strains were grouped with the enterococcus faecium reference strain. all strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority  of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. all strains exhibited  antagonistic activity against bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited enterococcus faecalis. isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. however, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk  for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.

TI  == a rapid biosensor for viable b. anthracis spores.
AB  == a simple membrane-strip-based biosensor assay has been combined with a nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (nasba) reaction for rapid (4 h) detection of a small number (ten) of viable b. anthracis spores. the biosensor is based on identification of a unique mrna sequence from one of the anthrax toxin genes, the protective antigen ( pag), encoded on the toxin plasmid, pxo1, and thus provides  high specificity toward b. anthracis. previously, the anthrax toxins activator (  atxa) mrna had been used in our laboratory for the development of a biosensor for the detection of a single b. anthracis spore within 12 h. changing the target sequence to the pag mrna provided the ability to shorten the overall assay time significantly. the vaccine strain of b. anthracis (sterne strain) was used in all experiments. a 500-microl sample containing as few as ten spores was mixed with 500 microl growth medium and incubated for 30 min for spore germination and mrna  production. thus, only spores that are viable were detected. subsequently, rna was extracted from lysed cells, selectively amplified using nasba, and rapidly identified by the biosensor. while the biosensor assay requires only 15 min assay time, the overall process takes 4 h for detection of ten viable b. anthracis spores, and is shortened significantly if more spores are present. the biosensor  is based on an oligonucleotide sandwich-hybridization assay format. it uses a membrane flow-through system with an immobilized dna probe that hybridizes with the target sequence. signal amplification is provided when the target sequence hybridizes to a second dna probe that has been coupled to liposomes encapsulating the dye sulforhodamine b. the amount of liposomes captured in the detection zone  can be read visually or quantified with a hand-held reflectometer. the biosensor  can detect as little as 1 fmol target mrna (1 nmol l(-1)). specificity analysis revealed no cross-reactivity with 11 organisms tested, among them closely related species such as b. cereus, b. megaterium, b. subtilis, b. thuringiensis, lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus plantarum, and chlostridium butyricum. also, no false positive signals were obtained from nonviable spores. we suggest that this  inexpensive biosensor is a viable option for rapid, on-site analysis providing highly specific data on the presence of viable b. anthracis spores.

TI  == attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  == candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-gc gram-positive bacteria, thermotogales and bacteroidetes/chlorobi. this allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. in particular, orthologs of ygea of escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. three new families of histidine transporters  were predicted, orthologs of yuif and yvsh of bacillus subtilis, and lysq of lactococcus lactis. in pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thra was predicted to be regulated not only  by threonine and isoleucine, as in e. coli, but also by methionine. in alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvih was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in bacillus cereus and clostridium difficile, and by histidine t-boxes in l. lactis and streptococcus mutans.

AB  == the haloacid dehalogenase (had) superfamily includes a variety of enzymes that catalyze the cleavage of substrate c-cl, p-c, and p-op bonds via nucleophilic substitution pathways. all members possess the alpha/beta core domain, and many also possess a small cap domain. the active site of the core domain is formed by  four loops (corresponding to sequence motifs 1-4), which position substrate and cofactor-binding residues as well as the catalytic groups that mediate the "core" chemistry. the cap domain is responsible for the diversification of chemistry within the family. a tight beta-turn in the helix-loop-helix motif of the cap domain contains a stringently conserved gly (within sequence motif 5), flanked by residues whose side chains contribute to the catalytic site formed at the domain-domain interface. to define the role of the conserved gly in the structure and function of the cap domain loop of the had superfamily members phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase and beta-phosphoglucomutase, the gly was mutated  to pro, val, or ala. the catalytic activity was severely reduced in each mutant.  to examine the impact of gly substitution on loop 5 conformation, the x-ray crystal structure of the gly50pro phosphonoacetaldehyde hydrolase mutant was determined. the altered backbone conformation at position 50 had a dramatic effect on the spatial disposition of the side chains of neighboring residues. lys53, the schiff base forming lysine, had rotated out of the catalytic site and  the side chain of leu52 had moved to fill its place. on the basis of these studies, it was concluded that the flexibility afforded by the conserved gly is critical to the function of loop 5 and that it is a marker by which the cap domain substrate specificity loop can be identified within the amino acid sequence of had family members.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  == annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. there are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. however, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. this study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing  the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the mics  and mbcs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. the results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, and staphylococcus aureus, with mics of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. a concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, lactococcus lactis, and paenibacillus polymyxa. the mics for listeria monocytogenes and enterococcus  durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. no activity was detected against lactobacillus plantarum, bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == isolation of nisin-producing lactococcus lactis wnc 20 strain from nham, a traditional thai fermented sausage.
AB  == a total of 14,020 lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from nham and screened for bacteriocin production. one lactococcus lactis strain wnc 20 produced a bacteriocin that not only inhibited closely related lab, but also some food-borne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. biochemical studies revealed that the bacteriocin was heat-stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees c for 15 min) and was active over a wide ph range (2-10). the bacteriocin was inactivated  by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase k but not other proteases. the antimicrobial spectrum and some characteristics of this bacteriocin were nearly identical to that of nisin. the gene encoding this bacteriocin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with nisin gene-specific primer. sequencing of this gene showed identical sequences to nisin z as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. the ability of the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis wnc 20 may be useful in improving the food safety of the fermented product.

TI  == characterization of the genetic locus responsible for the production of abp-118,  a novel bacteriocin produced by the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius  subsp. salivarius ucc118.
AB  == abp-118, a small heat-stable bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius ucc118, a strain isolated from the ileal-caecal region of the human gastrointestinal tract, was purified to homogeneity. using reverse genetics, a dna fragment specifying part of abp-118 was identified on a 10769 bp  chromosomal region. analysis of this region revealed that abp-118 was a class iib two-peptide bacteriocin composed of abp118alpha, which exhibited the antimicrobial activity, and abp118beta, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity. the gene conferring strain ucc118 immunity to the action of abp-118, abpim, was identified downstream of the abp118beta gene. located further downstream of abp118beta, several orfs were identified whose deduced proteins resembled those of proteins involved in bacteriocin regulation and secretion. heterologous expression of abp-118 was achieved in lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis and bacillus cereus. in addition, the abp118 locus encoded an  inducing peptide, abpip, which was shown to play a role in the regulation of abp-118 production. this novel bacteriocin is, to the authors' knowledge, the first to be isolated from a known human probiotic bacterium and to be characterized at the genetic level.

TI  == fish chromatophores as cytosensors in a microscale device: detection of environmental toxins and bacterial pathogens.
AB  == fish chromatophores from betta splendens are used as the cytosensor element in the development of a portable microscale device capable of detecting certain environmental toxins and bacterial pathogens by monitoring changes in pigment granule distribution. the adaptation of chromatophores to a microscale environment has required the development of enabling technologies to produce miniaturized culture chambers, to integrate microfluidics for sample delivery, to miniaturize image capture, and to design new statistical methods for image analyses. betta splendens chromatophores were selected as the cytosensor element  because of their moderate size, their toleration of close contact, and most importantly, for their responses to a broad range of chemicals and pathogenic bacteria. a miniaturized culture chamber has been designed that supports chromatophore viability for as long as 3 months, and that can be easily transported without damage to the cells. new statistical methods for image analyses have been developed that increase sensitivity and also decrease the time required for detection of significant changes in pigment granule distribution. betta chromatophores have been tested for their responses to selected pathogenic  bacteria and chemical agents. we discuss in detail the aggregation of pigment granules seen when chromatophores are incubated with bacillus cereus, a common cause of food poisoning. also described are the more subtle responses of chromatophores to a class of environmental chemical toxins, polynuclear aromatic  hydrocarbons. we show that the chromatophores are able to detect the presence of  certain polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons at concentrations lower than the environment protection agency (epa) 550.1 standards.

TI  == evaluation of a spray-dried lacticin 3147 powder for the control of listeria monocytogenes and bacillus cereus in a range of food systems.
AB  == aims: the potential of a powdered preparation of the bacteriocin, lacticin 3147,  was investigated for the inhibition of listeria monocytogenes and bacillus cereus. methods and results: a 10% solution of reconstituted demineralized whey powder was fermented with lactococcus lactis dpc3147 for the generation of a lacticin 3147 containing powdered product. a 99.9% reduction in l. monocytogenes  numbers occurred in the presence of the lacticin 3147 powder within 2 h in natural yogurt, and an 85% reduction was observed in cottage cheese within the same time frame. counts of b. cereus were reduced by 80% in soup, in the presence of 1% (w/w) lacticin 3147 powder, within 3 h. conclusions: a powdered preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective for the control of listeria and bacillus in natural yogurt, cottage cheese and soup. significance and impact of the study: the bioactive lacticin 3147 powder may find broad applications for control of gram-positive pathogens/spoilage bacteria in a range of foods.

TI  == occurrence of nisin z production in lactococcus lactis bfe 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional nigerian cheese product.
AB  == screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) from various african fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing lactococcus lactis (bfe 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. the bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related lab, but also strains of listeria monocytogenes, listeria innocua, clostridium butyricum, clostridium perfringens, bacillis cereus and staphylococcus aureus. it was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees c for 15 min) and was active  over a wide ph range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower ph range. the bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase k, but not by other proteases. growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis bfe 1500 on l. monocytogenes ws 2250 and b. cereus dsm 2301 than with the nisin a producing strain dsm 20729.  polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain bfe 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that lc. lactis bfe 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin z, as indicated by the substitution of  asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. the genetic determinants  for bacteriocin production in strain bfe 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. the ability of the bacteriocin produced by lc. lactis bfe 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the african environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.

TI  == amplification of fluorescently labelled dna within gram-positive and acid-fast bacteria.
AB  == representative organisms from a variety of gram-positive genera were subjected to varying regimes in order to optimise the intracellular amplification of dna. the  bacteria were subjected to treatments with paraformaldehyde, muramidases and mild acid hydrolysis to discover which regime made each organism permeable to the amplification reagents yet allowed retention of the fluorescein-labelled amplified products within the cell. scanning electron micrographs were used to corroborate the effectiveness of the treatments, as seen by fluorescent photomicrographs, with the damage caused to the bacterial walls. a combination of mutanolysin and lysozyme was found most effective for bacillus cereus, whereas permeabilisation of streptomyces coelicolor, lactococcus lactis and clostridium sporogenes was most effective when exposed to lysozyme only. surprisingly, direct amplification with no pre-treatment gave the brightest fluorescence in mycobacterium phlei. comparing the techniques of whole cell pcr, primed in situ labelling (prins), and cycle prins showed that under the conditions used the strongest intensity of fluorescence was obtained with in situ pcr; only l. lactis and m. phlei produced signals with cycle prins, fluorescence was not seen for any of the organisms with prins.

TI  == specific antibody-mediated detection of brochothrix thermosphacta in situ in british fresh sausage.
AB  == a rabbit polyclonal antibody-linked probe was developed which detected 76% of 800 food isolates of the spoilage bacterium brochothrix thermosphacta when cells were bound to nitrocellulose. in slide cross-reaction tests all six environmental isolates tested were stained but the type strain was not. the antibody did not cross-react with listeria grayi, l. monocytogenes, lactobacillus plantarum, lactococcus lactis, streptococcus mutans, bacillus cereus or b. subtilis. the antibody-linked probe detected br. thermosphacta in thin sections of british fresh sausage when the viable count was greater than 10(6) g-1. cells were detected mainly within 1 or 2 mm of the surface on the loose starchy material. they were not detected within muscle blocks or in the centre of the sausage. such results suggest that growth of this organism occurs close to the surface of the sausage.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  == neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, lactobacillus salivarius and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, bacillus brevis, bacillus circulans, bacillus coagulans, bacillus laterosporus, bacillus subtilis and pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. the effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3)  cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by  the agar incorporation method. neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. this study indicated  the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of  foods.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.

TI  == an investigation of dye reduction by food-borne bacteria.
AB  == the rates of reduction of seven redox dyes by 13 bacterial strains were measured  and found to vary greatly between different bacterium/dye combinations. phenazine ethosulphate and toluidine blue were the most rapidly reduced dyes by the majority of bacteria and resorufin and 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone were reduced  slowly, if at all. there was also considerable variation in the rates of reduction with any single dye/organism combination. glucose stimulated the rates  of endogenous dye reduction in about half of the organisms. for bacillus cereus,  pseudomonas fluorescens and escherichia coli, dye reduction was stimulated by a range of exogenous substrates but lactose, the primary available carbon and energy source in milk, had little effect. in lactococcus lactis, dye reduction was stimulated by sugars but not by organic acids. oxygen successfully competed with dye reduction in organisms containing respiratory chains, but with membrane  fractions, dye reduction was more rapid than oxygen consumption. all the organisms showed little cytosolic dye reduction, except l. lactis which showed substantial rates of reduction of some dyes by this fraction. with the membrane fraction of e. coli and ps. fluorescens, cyanide inhibited nadh and succinate-dependent dye reduction, antimycin a inhibited lactate and succinate and rotenone had no significant effect, but inhibition was not always observed with membrane from both organisms.

AB  == pasteurized skim milk was concentrated by uf to 2-, 4-, and 5-fold. the retentates were evaluated for microbiological quality, heat treatments to inactivate microorganisms, and lactic acid bacterial starter culture activity. aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts in raw milk decreased from an initial 1.4 x 10(6) to 3.9 x 10(2) cfu/ml after pasteurization. during uf, counts increased from 3.9 x 10(2) cfu/ml uf, counts increased from 3.9 x 10(2) cfu/ml in pasteurized milk to 1.4 x 10(3), 1.4 x 10(4), and 1.8 x 10(4) cfu/ml in 2-, 4- and 5-fold retentates, respectively. psychrotrophic bacterial counts decreased from 9.9 x 10(5) cfu/ml in raw milk to 3.7 x 10(1) cfu/ml in pasteurized milk and gradually increased to 1.0 x 10(2), 2.5 x 10(2), and 1.4 x 10(3) cfu/ml in 2-, 4-, and 5-fold retentates, respectively. thermophilic bacterial counts remained less than 10 cfu/ml in all samples. skim milk and retentates inoculated with five starter cultures at 1% failed to decrease the ph below 4.6 in (2-, 4- and 5-fold). the 4- and 5-fold retentates inoculated with lactococcus lactis spp. cremoris or lactococcus lactis spp. lactis cultures were partially coagulated with ph greater than 5.6. in general, the ph of retentates remained higher than that of skim milk. clotting of uninoculated samples was observed, and a spore-forming contaminant, tentatively characterized as bacillus cereus and capable of clotting milk at a ph greater than 6, was isolated from the clotted samples.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == inhibition of clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. four strains were isolated belonging to the species lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. the sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from  nisin. their resistance to phospholipase d indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. the inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains  of clostridium tyrobutyricum, lactobacillus helveticus, and streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, lactobacillus lactis, streptococcus thermophilus, and propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
