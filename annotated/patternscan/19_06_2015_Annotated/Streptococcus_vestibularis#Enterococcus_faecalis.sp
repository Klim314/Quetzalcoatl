TI  == an in vitro investigation of the cariogenic potential of oral streptococci.
AB  == whilst the importance of the mutans streptococci in the aetiology of dental caries is clear, a number of studies have described caries development in their absence. this investigation aimed to assess the cariogenic potential of streptococcus gordonii, strep. sanguis, strep. vestibularis and enterococcus faecalis in comparison with strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus, using a recently described in vitro model. in the presence of a 146 mm sucrose solution and powdered hydroxyapatite, each species was incubated for 5 h, after which acid anion production, calcium release and change in ph were measured. it was possible to assign each species to one of three groups, with e. faecalis, strep. gordonii, strep. sanguis exhibiting low, strep. vestibularis intermediate, and strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus high in vitro cariogenic potential. this assay could be used as a screening test to assess the potential cariogenicity of a range of bacterial species.
