TI  == the oral mucosal and salivary microbial community of behcet's syndrome and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == background: behcet's syndrome (bs) is a multisystem immune-related disease of unknown etiology. recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) is characterized by the presence of idiopathic oral ulceration without extraoral manifestation. the interplay between the oral microbial communities and the immune response could play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of both bs and ras. objective: to investigate the salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities in  bs and ras. methods: purified microbial dna isolated from saliva samples (54 bs,  25 healthy controls [hc], and 8 ras) were examined by the human oral microbe identification microarray. cultivable salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities from ulcer and non-ulcer sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis. mycobacterium spp. were detected in saliva and in ulcer and non-ulcer oral mucosal brush biopsies following culture on lowenstein-jensen slopes and mycobacterial growth indicator  tubes. results: there was increased colonization with rothia denticariosa of the  non-ulcer sites of bs and ras patients (p<0.05). ulcer sites in bs were highly colonized with streptococcus salivarius compared to those of ras (p<0.05), and with streptococcus sanguinis compared to hc (p<0.0001). oral mucosa of hc were more highly colonized with neisseria and veillonella compared to all studied groups (p<0.0001). conclusions: despite the uncertainty whether the reported differences in the oral mucosal microbial community of bs and ras are of causative or reactive nature, it is envisaged that restoring the balance of the oral microbial community of the ulcer sites may be used in the future as a new treatment modality for oral ulceration.

TI  == oropharyngeal colonization with neisseria lactamica, other nonpathogenic neisseria species and moraxella catarrhalis among young healthy children in ahvaz, iran.
AB  == background: neisseria lactamica as one of the main commensal in oropharynx during the childhood is related to the induction of a natural immunity against meningococcal meningitis. also moraxella catarrhalis in oropharynx of children is a predisposing factor for otitis media infection. objectives: the current study aimed to investigate the frequency of the n. lactamica, other nonpathogenic neisseria spp. and m. catarrhalis in the oropharynx of young healthy children in  ahvaz, iran by the two phenotypic tests and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: a total of 192 oropharyngeal swab samples of the young healthy children were studied during four months. swabs were plated onto enriched selective media and non-selective media. gram-negative and oxidase-positive diplococci were identified by several conventional biochemical tests. the pcr and sequencing were used to confirm the accuracy of laboratory diagnosis to identify  n. lactamica and m. catarrhalis. results: among 192 young healthy children with the mean age of 5.93 +/- 2.5903 years, authors identified: n. lactamica (21.9%) in the age group of one to nine years; n. mucosa (6.3%); n. sicca (7.8%); n. cinerea (1.6%); n. subflava (biovar subflava) (4.2%); n. subflava (biovar perflava) (28.1%); n. subflava (biovar flava) (7.3%) and m. catarrhalis (42.7%).  conclusions: the young healthy children screening by colonization of n. lactamica and other nonpathogenic neisseria spp. in oropharynx was the first report in ahvaz, iran. the study results demonstrated the high frequency of colonization of m. catarrhalis in the studied young healthy children other than neisseria spp.

TI  == oral microbiota shift after 12-week supplementation with lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289; a randomized control trial.
AB  == background: lactobacillus spp. potentially contribute to health by modulating bacterial biofilm formation, but their effects on the overall oral microbiota remain unclear. methods and findings: oral microbiota was characterized via 454-pyrosequencing of the 16s rdna hypervariable region v3-v4 after 12 weeks of daily lactobacillus reuteri dsm 17938 and pta 5289 consumption. forty-four adults were assigned to a test group (n = 22) that received lactobacilli lozenges (108 cfu of each strain/lozenge) or a control group that received placebo (n = 22). presence of l. reuteri was confirmed by cultivation and species specific pcr. tooth biofilm samples from 16 adults before, during, and after exposure were analyzed by pyrosequencing. a total of 1,310,292 sequences were quality filtered. after removing single reads, 257 species or phylotypes were identified at 98.5% identity in the human oral microbiome database. firmicutes, bacteroidetes, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, and actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla. streptococcus was the most common genus and the s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group comprised the dominant species. the number of observed species was unaffected by l. reuteri exposure. however, subjects who had consumed l. reuteri were clustered in a principal coordinates analysis relative to scattering at baseline, and multivariate modeling of pyrosequencing microbiota, and culture and pcr detected l. reuteri separated baseline from 12-week samples in test subjects. l. reuteri intake correlated with increased s. oralis/s. mitis/s. mitis bv2/s. infantis group and campylobacter concisus, granulicatella adiacens, bergeyella sp. hot322, neisseria subflava, and sr1 [g-1] sp. hot874 detection and reduced s. mutans, s. anginosus, n. mucosa, fusobacterium periodicum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii, and prevotella maculosa detection. this effect had disappeared 1 month after exposure was terminated. conclusions: l. reuteri consumption did not affect species richness but induced a shift in the oral microbiota composition. the biological relevance of this remains to be elucidated. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct02311218.

TI  == acetaldehyde production by major oral microbes.
AB  == objectives: to assess acetaldehyde (ach) production by bacteria constituting the  oral microbiota and the inhibitory effects of sugar alcohols on ach production. materials and methods: the predominant bacterial components of the salivary microbiota of 166 orally healthy subjects were determined by barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene. bacterial ach production from ethanol or glucose was measured using gas chromatography. in addition, inhibition by four sugars and five sugar alcohols of ach production was assayed. results: forty-one species from 16 genera were selected as predominant and prevalent bacteria based on the following criteria: identification in >/=95% of the subjects, >/=1% of mean relative abundance or >/=5% of maximum relative abundance. all neisseria species tested produced conspicuous amounts of ach from  ethanol, as did rothia mucilaginosa, streptococcus mitis and prevotella histicola exhibited the ability to produce ach. in addition, xylitol and sorbitol inhibited ach production by neisseria mucosa by more than 90%. conclusions: the oral microbiota of orally healthy subjects comprises considerable amounts of bacteria  possessing the ability to produce ach, an oral carcinogen. consumption of sugar alcohols may regulate ach production by oral microbes.

TI  == isolation and identification of symbiotic bacteria from the skin, mouth, and rectum of wild and captive tree shrews.
AB  == endosymbionts influence many aspects of their hosts' health conditions, including physiology, development, immunity, metabolism, etc. tree shrews (tupaia belangeri chinensis) have attracted increasing attention in modeling human diseases and therapeutic responses due to their close relationship with primates. to clarify the situation of symbiotic bacteria from their body surface, oral cavity, and anus, 12 wild and 12 the third generation of captive tree shrews were examined. based on morphological and cultural characteristics, physiological and biochemical tests, as well as the 16s rdna full sequence analysis, 12 bacteria strains were isolated and identified from the wild tree shrews: body surface: bacillus subtilis (detection rate 42%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (25%), staphlococcus aureus (33%), s. epidermidis (75%), micrococcus luteus (25%), kurthia gibsonii (17%); oral cavity: neisseria mucosa (58%), streptococcus pneumonia (17%); anus: enterococcus faecalis (17%), lactococus lactis (33%), escherichia coli (92%), salmonella typhosa (17%); whereas, four were indentified  from the third generation captive tree shrews: body surface: s. epidermidis (75%); oral cavity: n.mucosa (67%); anus: l. lactis (33%), e. coli (100%). these  results indicate that s. epidermidis, n. mucosa, l. lactis and e. coli were major bacteria in tree shrews, whereas, s. aureus, m. luteus, k. gibsonii, e. faecalis  and s. typhosa were species-specific flora. this study facilitates the future use of tree shrews as a standard experimental animal and improves our understanding of the relationship between endosymbionts and their hosts.

TI  == crystal structure of the vitamin b3 transporter pnuc, a full-length sweet homolog.
AB  == pnuc transporters catalyze cellular uptake of the nad+ precursor nicotinamide riboside (nr) and belong to a large superfamily that includes the sweet sugar transporters. we present a crystal structure of neisseria mucosa pnuc, which adopts a highly symmetrical fold with 3+1+3 membrane topology not previously observed in any protein. the high symmetry of pnuc with a single nr bound in the  center suggests a simple alternating-access translocation mechanism.

TI  == alcohol and tobacco consumption affects bacterial richness in oral cavity mucosa  biofilms.
AB  == background: today there are more than 2 billion alcohol users and about 1.3 billion tobacco users worldwide. the chronic and heavy use of these two substances is at the heart of numerous diseases and may wreak havoc on the human  oral microbiome. this study delves into the changes that alcohol and tobacco may  cause on biofilms of the human oral microbiome. to do so, we used swabs to sample the oral biofilm of 22 subjects; including 9 control-individuals with no or very  low consumption of alcohol and no consumption of tobacco, 7 who were chronic and  heavy users of both substances and 6 active smokers that reported no significant  alcohol consumption. dna was extracted from swabs and the v1 region of the 16s rrna gene was pcr amplified and sequenced using the ion torrent pgm platform, generating 3.7 million high quality reads. dna sequences were clustered and otus  were assigned using the arb silva database and qiime. results: we found no differences in species diversity and evenness among the groups. however, we found a significant decrease in species richness in only smokers and in smokers/drinkers when compared to controls. we found that neisseria abundance was significantly decreased in both groups when compared to controls. smokers had significant increases in prevotella and capnocytophaga and reductions in granulicatella, staphylococcus, peptostreptococcus and gemella when compared to the two other groups. controls showed higher abundance of aggregibacter, whilst smokers/drinkers had lower abundances of fusobacteria. samples from only smokers  clustered closer together than to controls and smokers/drinkers, and also had a significant reduction in inter-group dissimilarity distances, indicating a more homogenous group than controls. conclusions: our results indicate that the continued use of tobacco or alcohol plus tobacco significantly reduces bacterial  richness, which apparently leads to a reduction in inter-group variability, turning the respective biofilms into a more homogenous microenvironment in terms  of bacterial community composition, with possible consequences for human oral diseases.

TI  == influence of the periodontal status on the initial-biofilm formation on titanium  surfaces.
AB  == background: dental implants will be exposed to a complex ecosystem once they are  placed in the oral cavity. the bacterial colonization and biofilm formation on these devices will depend not only on the physicochemical surface implant properties but also on the periodontal health conditions of the patients, as these devices are exposed. purpose: the aim of this study was to correlate the subgingival microbial profile with the composition of initial biofilm formed on different microstructured titanium (ti) surfaces. materials and methods: ten periodontitis and 10 periodontally healthy subjects were included in this study.  the subjects wore a removable acrylic device with four different fixed ti surfaces for 48 hours. microbial samples of subgingival plaque and the biofilm formed on each ti surface were individually analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization technique. results: despite the roughness or hydrophilicity of the  ti surfaces, a characteristic pattern of bacterial adhesion was observed on each  of the study groups. however, significant differences in the proportion of the species that colonized the ti surfaces were found between the periodontitis and periodontally healthy groups. treponema denticola, neisseria mucosa, eikenella corrodens, and tannerella forsythia were detected in higher proportions on the ti disks placed in the periodontitis subjects, while significant higher proportions  of capnocytophaga sputigena, fusobacterium periodonticum, prevotella melaninogenica, and streptococcus mitis were detected on the ti disks placed in the periodontally healthy group. conclusions: the results obtained in this study  shows that the composition and the proportion of the species that initially colonize ti surfaces are highly influenced by the periodontal status more than the surface characteristics of the ti implant.

TI  == mycoplasma genitalium infection is associated with microscopic signs of cervical  inflammation in liquid cytology specimens.
AB  == cervicitis is a common clinical finding often attributed to sexually transmitted  infections (stis), but no etiologic agent is identified in the majority of cases. in this study, we comparatively assessed inflammation among the common infectious etiologies of cervicitis and assessed the potential value of liquid cytology specimens for predicting stis. among 473 louisiana women at low risk for acquiring stis, the prevalences of mycoplasma genitalium, chlamydia trachomatis,  neisseria gonorrhoeae, and trichomonas vaginalis in liquid-based cytology specimens were 1.5, 2.1, 0.6, and 4.4%, respectively. n. gonorrhoeae and human papillomavirus 18 (hpv18) infections were significantly more common among subjects infected with m. genitalium. using direct microscopy, we observed significant increases in leukocyte infiltrates among subjects with monoinfections with m. genitalium or c. trachomatis compared to women with no detectable stis. inflammation was highest among subjects with m. genitalium. using a threshold of  >/= 2 leukocytes per epithelial cell per high-powered field, the positive predictive values for m. genitalium, c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, and t. vaginalis were 100, 70, 67, and 20%, respectively. several novel m. genitalium genotypes were identified, all of which were predicted to be susceptible to macrolide antibiotics, suggesting that different strains may circulate among low-risk women and that macrolide resistance is substantially lower than in high-risk populations. this study highlights the capacity of m. genitalium to elicit cervical inflammation and, considering the strong epidemiologic associations between m. genitalium and human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), provides a potential mechanism for acquisition and shedding of hiv via chronic leukocyte recruitment to the cervical mucosa.

TI  == molecular and serological diversity of neisseria meningitidis carrier strains isolated from italian students aged 14 to 22 years.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is an obligate human commensal that commonly colonizes the oropharyngeal mucosa. carriage is age dependent and very common in young adults.  the relationships between carriage and invasive disease are not completely understood. in this work, we performed a longitudinal carrier study in adolescents and young adults (173 subjects). overall, 32 subjects (18.5%) had results that were positive for meningococcal carriage in at least one visit (average monthly carriage rate, 12.1%). only five subjects tested positive at all four visits. all meningococcal isolates were characterized by molecular and serological techniques. multilocus sequence typing, pora typing, and sequencing of the 4cmenb vaccine antigens were used to assess strain diversity. the majority of positive subjects were colonized by capsule null (34.4%) and capsular group b  strains (28.1%), accounting for 23.5% and 29.4% of the total number of isolates,  respectively. the fhbp and nhba genes were present in all isolates, while the nada gene was present in 5% of the isolates. the genetic variability of the 4cmenb vaccine antigens in this collection was relatively high compared with that of other disease-causing strain panels. indications about the persistence of the  carriage state were limited to the time span of the study. all strains isolated from the same subject were identical or cumulated minor changes over time. the expression levels and antigenicities of the 4cmenb vaccine antigens in each strain were analyzed by the meningococcal antigen typing system (mats), which revealed that expression can change over time in the same individual. future analysis of antigen variability and expression in carrier strains after the introduction of the menb vaccine will allow for a definition of its impact on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal carriage.

TI  == meningococcal septic shock after iud insertion, a case presentation.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a normal commensal of human mucous membranes that is no longer considered to be restricted to the nasopharynx. due to the practice of oral sex, the mucous membranes of the cervix, urethra or anus have become a potential infection site for this bacterium. inserting an intrauterine device (iud), can alter the protective barrier of the endocervical mucosa, allowing for  bacterial infection and systemic spread. we present a case report of a 40-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain, spotting and fever after inserting an iud and developed a fulminant septic shock. blood cultures and cultures from ascites showed the presence of neisseria meningitidis group y. from our knowledge, there are a few cases presented in the literature of toxic shock syndrome after iud insertion, caused by staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus group a, but this is the first case of meningococcal sepsis after iud insertion described. so, even though iuds rarely cause significant infection, physicians should consider this device as a possible source in reproductive-age women with the clinical features of sepsis.

TI  == human tonsil-derived dendritic cells are poor inducers of t cell immunity to mucosally encountered pathogens.
AB  == the mucosal immune system must initiate and regulate protective immunity, while balancing this immunity with tolerance to harmless antigens and bacterial commensals. we have explored the hypothesis that mucosal dendritic cells (dc) control the balance between regulation and immunity, by studying the responses of human tonsil-derived dc to neisseria meningitidis as a model organism. we show that tonsil dc are able to sample their antigenic environment, internalizing nm and expressing high levels of hla-dr and cd86. however, in comparison to monocyte-derived dc (modc), they respond to pathogen encounter with only low level cytokine production, largely dominated by tgfbeta. functionally, tonsil dc  also only stimulated low levels of antigen-specific t cell proliferation and cytokine production when compared to modc. we therefore propose that the default  role for dc in the nasopharynx is to maintain tolerance/ignorance of the large volume of harmless antigens and bacterial commensals encountered at the nasopharyngeal mucosa.

TI  == internalization and trafficking of nontypeable haemophilus influenzae in human respiratory epithelial cells and roles of iga1 proteases for optimal invasion and persistence.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is a leading cause of opportunistic infections of the respiratory tract in children and adults. although considered an extracellular pathogen, nthi has been observed repeatedly within and between cells of the human respiratory tract, and these observations have been correlated to symptomatic infection. these findings are intriguing in light of the knowledge that nthi persists in the respiratory tract despite antibiotic therapy and the development of bactericidal antibodies. we hypothesized that intracellular nthi avoids, escapes, or neutralizes the endolysosomal pathway and persists within human respiratory epithelial cells and that human iga1 proteases are required for optimal internalization and persistence of nthi. virtually all strains encode a human iga1 protease gene, igaa, and we previously characterized a novel human iga1 protease gene, igab, that is associated with disease-causing strains and is  homologous to the iga1 protease that is unique to pathogenic neisseria spp. here, we show that nthi invades human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro in a lipid raft-independent manner, is subsequently trafficked via the endolysosomal pathway, and is killed in lysosomes after variable durations of persistence. igaa is required for optimal invasion. igab appears to play little or no role in adherence or invasion but is required for optimal intracellular persistence of nthi. igab cleaves lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (lamp1) at phs characteristic of the plasma membrane, early endosome, late endosome, and lysosome. however, neither iga1 protease inhibits acidification of intracellular  vesicles containing nthi. nthi iga1 proteases play important but different roles  in nthi invasion and trafficking in respiratory epithelial cells.

TI  == genome sequence analyses show that neisseria oralis is the same species as 'neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis'.
AB  == phylogenies generated from whole genome sequence (wgs) data provide definitive means of bacterial isolate characterization for typing and taxonomy. the species  status of strains recently defined with conventional taxonomic approaches as representing neisseria oralis was examined by the analysis of sequences derived from wgs data, specifically: (i) 53 neisseria ribosomal protein subunit (rps) genes (ribosomal multi-locus sequence typing, rmlst); and (ii) 246 neisseria core genes (core genome mlst, cgmlst). these data were compared with phylogenies derived from 16s and 23s rrna gene sequences, demonstrating that the n. oralis strains were monophyletic with strains described previously as representing 'neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and that this group was of equivalent taxonomic status to other well-described species of the genus neisseria. phylogenetic analyses also indicated that neisseria sicca and neisseria macacae should be considered the same species as neisseria mucosa and that neisseria flavescens should be considered the same species as neisseria subflava. analyses  using rmlst showed that some strains currently defined as belonging to the genus  neisseria were more closely related to species belonging to other genera within the family; however, whole genome analysis of a more comprehensive selection of strains from within the family neisseriaceae would be necessary to confirm this.  we suggest that strains previously identified as representing 'n. mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and deposited in culture collections should be renamed n. oralis. finally, one of the strains of n. oralis was able to ferment lactose, due to the presence of beta-galactosidase and lactose permease genes, a characteristic previously thought to be unique to neisseria lactamica, which therefore cannot be thought of as diagnostic for this species; however, the rmlst and cgmlst analyses confirm that n. oralis is most closely related to n. mucosa.

AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == in vivo adaptation and persistence of neisseria meningitidis within the nasopharyngeal mucosa.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis (nme) asymptomatically colonizes the human nasopharynx, yet can initiate rapidly-progressing sepsis and meningitis in rare instances. understanding the meningococcal lifestyle within the nasopharyngeal mucosa, a phase of infection that is prerequisite for disease, has been hampered by the lack of animal models. herein, we compare mice expressing the four different human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (ceacams) that can bind the neisserial opa protein adhesins, and find that expression of human ceacam1 is necessary and sufficient to establish intranasal colonization. during  infection, in vivo selection for phase variants expressing ceacam1-specific opa proteins occurs, allowing mucosal attachment and entry into the subepithelial space. consistent with an essential role for opa proteins in this process, opa-deficient meningococci were unable to colonize the ceacam1-humanized mice. while simple opa-mediated attachment triggered an innate response regardless of meningococcal viability within the inoculum, persistence of viable opa-expressing bacteria within the ceacam1-humanized mice was required for a protective memory response to be achieved. parenteral immunization with a capsule-based conjugate vaccine led to the accumulation of protective levels of nme-specific igg within the nasal mucus, yet the sterilizing immunity afforded by natural colonization was instead conferred by nme-specific iga without detectable igg. considered together, this study establishes that the availability of ceacam1 helps define the exquisite host specificity of this human-restricted pathogen, displays a striking example of in vivo selection for the expression of desirable opa variants, and provides a novel model in which to consider meningococcal infection and immunity within the nasopharyngeal mucosa.

TI  == the composition of microbiome in larynx and the throat biodiversity between laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma patients and control population.
AB  == the throat is an ecological assemblage involved human cells and microbiota, and the colonizing bacteria are important factors in balancing this environment. however, this bacterial community profile has thus been poorly investigated. the  purpose of this study was to investigate the microbial biology of the larynx and  to analyze the throat biodiversity in laryngeal carcinoma patients compared to a  control population in a case-control study. barcoded pyrosequencing analysis of the 16s rrna gene was used. we collected tissue samples from 29 patients with laryngeal carcinoma and 31 control patients with vocal cord polyps. the findings  of high-quality sequence datasets revealed 218 genera from 13 phyla in the laryngeal mucosa. the predominant communities of phyla in the larynx were firmicutes (54%), fusobacteria (17%), bacteroidetes (15%), proteobacteria (11%),  and actinobacteria (3%). the leading genera were streptococcus (36%), fusobacterium (15%), prevotella (12%), neisseria (6%), and gemella (4%). the throat bacterial compositions were highly different between laryngeal carcinoma subjects and control population (p = 0.006). the abundance of the 26 genera was significantly different between the laryngeal cancer and control groups by metastats analysis (p<0.05). fifteen genera may be associated with laryngeal carcinoma by partial least squares discriminant analysis (p<0.001). in summary, this study revealed the microbiota profiles in laryngeal mucosa from tissue specimens. the compositions of bacteria community in throat were different between laryngeal cancer patients and controls, and probably were related with this carcinoma. the disruption of this bio-ecological niche might be a risk factor for laryngeal carcinoma.

TI  == bacterial colonization of microbial biofilms in oral squamous cell carcinoma.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of this prospective clinical study was to identify the bacterial spectra on the surface of oral squamous cell carcinomas (oscc) in comparison to oral mucosa of patients with a higher risk to emerge an oscc and a  control group to determine their susceptibility to various common antibiotics. material and methods: swabs from 90 patients, 30 patients of each group, were cultured on media for aerobes and anaerobes and tested with agar diffusion and etest. results: the predominant pathogens of the normal healthy oral mucosa were  aerobes. the ratio between aerobes and anaerobes was 2:1, balanced in risk patients and inverted in the oscc group. altogether, 1,006 isolates were cultured. the most frequent strains were 47 viridans streptococci, 30 staphylococcus species, 14 enterococcus faecalis, 36 neisseria species, 14 escherichia coli, and 23 other aerobes, 66 peptostreptococcus species, 39 fusobacterium species, and 34 prevotella species. the resistance rates in the oscc group were penicillin 40%, ampicillin 57%, doxycycline 23%, clindamycin 47%, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid 20%, but up to 100% of pathogens were susceptible to azithromycin, telithromycin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. conclusion: gram-negative anaerobes play a decisive role in the development of postoperative  infections in patients with oscc. this tumor special type of colonization does not agree with the normal flora of the oral cavity. clinical relevance: biofilms  on oscc surfaces provide an important reservoir for anaerobic bacteria. as a consequence, a proposal for an antibiotic prophylactic regime should be given.

TI  == [bacterial infection as a cause of infertility in humans].
AB  == microorganisms which are present in the human urogenital tract may be involved in the development of inflammatory changes negatively affecting the genitals in both men and women. pathological conditions due to inflammatory alterations may result in complete loss of fertility. infections of the urogenital tract are responsible for 15% of all cases of infertility in couples. negative impact on the human reproduction is mainly caused by direct damage to the genital tract mucosa by metabolic products of microorganisms or by induction of pro-inflammatory responses of the body. another mechanism is indirect impact of microorganisms on  the genital function. moreover, the effect of bacteria on spermatogenesis and semen quality is important in men. infections mainly caused by chlamydia trachomatis or neisseria gonorrhoeae represent the greatest risk in terms of permanent consequences for human reproduction. as for other sexually transmitted  disorders, such as infections caused by gardnerella vaginalis, urogenital mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas, the link between infection and infertility has been intensively researched.

AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == dual pili post-translational modifications synergize to mediate meningococcal adherence to platelet activating factor receptor on human airway cells.
AB  == pili of pathogenic neisseria are major virulence factors associated with adhesion, twitching motility, auto-aggregation, and dna transformation. pili of n. meningitidis are subject to several different post-translational modifications. among these pilin modifications, the presence of phosphorylcholine (chop) and a glycan on the pilin protein are phase-variable (subject to high frequency, reversible on/off switching of expression). in this study we report the location of two chop modifications on the c-terminus of n. meningitidis pilin. we show that the surface accessibility of chop on pili is affected by phase variable changes to the structure of the pilin-linked glycan. we identify for the first time that the platelet activating factor receptor (pafr) is a key,  early event receptor for meningococcal adherence to human bronchial epithelial cells and tissue, and that synergy between the pilin-linked glycan and chop post-translational modifications is required for pili to optimally engage pafr to mediate adherence to human airway cells.

TI  == innate recognition by neutrophil granulocytes differs between neisseria gonorrhoeae strains causing local or disseminating infections.
AB  == members of the carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (ceacam) family serve as cellular receptors for neisseria gonorrhoeae. more specifically,  neisserial colony opacity (opacea)) proteins bind to epithelial ceacams (ceacam1, cea, ceacam6) to promote bacterial colonization of the mucosa. in contrast, recognition by ceacam3, expressed by human granulocytes, results in uptake and destruction of opa(cea)-expressing bacteria. therefore, ceacam3-mediated uptake might limit the spread of gonococci. however, some strains can cause disseminating gonococcal infections (dgis), and it is currently unknown how these strains escape detection by granulocyte ceacam3. therefore, the opa gene loci from n. gonorrhoeae strain vp1, which was derived from a patient with disseminated gonococcal disease, were cloned and constitutively expressed in escherichia coli. similar to opa proteins of the nondisseminating strain ms11, the majority of opa proteins from strain vp1 bound epithelial ceacams and promoted ceacam-initiated responses by epithelial cells. in sharp contrast to the opa proteins of strain ms11, the opa proteins of strain vp1 failed to interact with the human granulocyte receptor ceacam3. accordingly, bacteria expressing vp1 opa proteins were not taken up by primary human granulocytes and did not trigger  a strong oxidative burst. analysis of opa variants from four additional clinical  dgi isolates again demonstrated a lack of ceacam3 binding. in summary, our results reveal that particular n. gonorrhoeae strains express an opa protein repertoire allowing engagement of epithelial ceacams for successful mucosal colonization, while avoiding recognition and elimination via ceacam3-mediated phagocytosis. a failure of ceacam3-mediated innate immune detection might be linked to the ability of gonococci to cause disseminated infections.

TI  == enterococcus faecalis inhibits superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1-induced  interleukin-8 from human vaginal epithelial cells through tetramic acids.
AB  == the vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus. some strains of s. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. we have observed  that a female was mono-colonized with enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. in recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. thus, we hypothesized that this strain  of e. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. e. faecalis mn1 inhibited interleukin-8 production  from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens candida  albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. we further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8  production, as well as inhibition of t cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as  these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by e. faecalis mn1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.

TI  == epithelial control of the human pdc response to extracellular bacteria.
AB  == plasmacytoid pre-dendritic cells (pdcs) are specialized in responding to nucleic  acids, and link innate with adaptive immunity. although the response of pdcs to viruses is well established, whether pdcs can respond to extracellular bacteria remains controversial. here, we demonstrate that extracellular bacteria such as neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus activate pdcs to produce ifn-alpha, tnf-alpha, il-6, and to upregulate cd86 expression. we observed that pdcs were present within tonsillar crypts and oro-nasopharyngeal epithelium, where they may contact extracellular bacteria, in  situ. tonsil epithelium-conditioned supernatants inhibited ifn-alpha, tnf-alpha,  and il-6 triggered by the direct contact of n. meningitidis or s. aureus with pdcs. however, pdc priming of naive t cells was not affected, suggesting that tonsil epithelium micro-environment limits local inflammation while preserving adaptive immunity in response to extracellular bacteria. our results reveal an important and novel function of pdcs in the initiation of the mucosal innate and  adaptive immunity to extracellular bacteria.

TI  == bacterial adhesion on the titanium and zirconia abutment surfaces.
AB  == objective: microorganisms harboring the oral cavity, mainly those related to periodontal diseases, are the most potential etiologic factor of failure in long-term implant treatment. the material used for abutment components may influence the adhesion and colonization of microbial species. the aim of this in  vivo investigation was to evaluate the biofilm formation on machined (mpt) or cast titanium (cpt) and zirconia abutments (zc). methods: six healthy subjects were enrolled in this randomized crossover clinical investigation. the study was  conducted in three phases according to abutment surface evaluated. each subject used an individual oral splint containing four disks of the same tested substrate, two located in the anterior and two in the posterior region, totalizing 12 specimens for subject. participants were asked to use the removable intraoral splint during 24 h. dna checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify 38 bacterial species colonizing formed biofilm on the abutment substrates. results: pathogens and non-pathogens species were found colonizing the three substrates surfaces. fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria mucosa, porphyromonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobios, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus parasanguinis, and tanerella forsythia were the only species with no significant differences over the tested materials (p > 0.05). all the other target species presented significant differences sought by friedman test (p < 0.0001). conclusions: there was a significant difference in the total bacterial count between the three groups. cpt presented the higher mean counts, followed by mpt and zc. cpt group also showed a higher mean incidence of species than mpt and zc. the anterior or posterior region of disks placement did not show significant differences in relation to bacterial adhesion.

TI  == involvement of three meningococcal surface-exposed proteins, the heparin-binding  protein nhba, the alpha-peptide of iga protease and the autotransporter protease  nalp, in initiation of biofilm formation.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a common and usually harmless inhabitant of the mucosa  of the human nasopharynx, which, in rare cases, can cross the epithelial barrier  and cause meningitis and sepsis. biofilm formation favours the colonization of the host and the subsequent carrier state. two different strategies of biofilm formation, either dependent or independent on extracellular dna (edna), have been described for meningococcal strains. here, we demonstrate that the autotransporter protease nalp, the expression of which is phase variable, affects edna-dependent biofilm formation in n. meningitidis. the effect of nalp was found in biofilm formation under static and flow conditions and was dependent on its protease activity. cleavage of the heparin-binding antigen nhba and the alpha-peptide of iga protease, resulting in the release of positively charged polypeptides from the cell surface, was responsible for the reduction in biofilm  formation when nalp is expressed. both nhba and the alpha-peptide of iga protease were shown to bind dna. we conclude that nhba and the alpha-peptide of iga protease are implicated in biofilm formation by binding edna and that nalp is an  important regulator of this process through the proteolysis of these surface-exposed proteins.

TI  == outer membrane biogenesis in escherichia coli, neisseria meningitidis, and helicobacter pylori: paradigm deviations in h. pylori.
AB  == the bacterial pathogen helicobacter pylori is capable of colonizing the gastric mucosa of the human stomach using a variety of factors associated with or secreted from its outer membrane (om). lipopolysaccharide (lps) and numerous om proteins have been shown to be involved in adhesion and immune stimulation/evasion. many of these factors are essential for colonization and/or  pathogenesis in a variety of animal models. despite this wide array of potential  targets present on the bacterial surface, the ability of h. pylori to vary its om profile limits the effectiveness of vaccines or therapeutics that target any single one of these components. however, it has become evident that the proteins  comprising the complexes that transport the majority of these molecules to the om are highly conserved and often essential. the field of membrane biogenesis has progressed remarkably in the last few years, and the possibility now exists for targeting the mechanisms by which beta-barrel proteins, lipoproteins, and lps are transported to the om, resulting in loss of bacterial fitness and significant altering of membrane permeability. in this review, the om transport machinery for lps, lipoproteins, and outer membrane proteins (omps) are discussed. while the principal investigations of these transport mechanisms have been conducted in escherichia coli and neisseria meningitidis, here these systems will be presented in the genetic context of epsilon proteobacteria. bioinformatic analysis reveals  that minimalist genomes, such as that of helicobacter pylori, offer insight into  the smallest number of components required for these essential pathways to function. interestingly, in the majority of epsilon proteobacteria, while the inner and om associated apparatus of lps, lipoprotein, and omp transport pathways appear to all be intact, most of the components associated with the periplasmic compartment are either missing or are almost unrecognizable when compared to their e. coli counterparts. eventual targeting of these pathways would have the net effect of severely limiting the delivery/transport of components to the om and preventing the bacterium's ability to infect its human host.

TI  == microbiome diversity in the bronchial tracts of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == culture of bacteria from bronchial secretions in respiratory patients has low sensitivity and does not allow for complete assessment of microbial diversity across different bronchial compartments. in addition, a significant number of clinical studies are based on sputum samples, and it is not known to what extent  they describe the real diversity of the mucosa. in order to identify previously unrecognized lower airway bacteria and to investigate the complexity and distribution of microbiota in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), we performed pcr amplification and pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene in patients not showing signs or symptoms of infection. four types of respiratory samples (sputum, bronchial aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, and bronchial mucosa) were taken from each individual, obtaining on average >1,000 16s rrna sequences per sample. the total number of genera per patient was >100, showing a  high diversity, with streptococcus, prevotella, moraxella, haemophilus, acinetobacter, fusobacterium, and neisseria being the most commonly identified. sputum samples showed significantly lower diversity than the other three sample types. lower-bronchial-tree samples, i.e., bronchoalveolar lavage and bronchial mucosa, showed a very similar bacterial compositions in contrast to sputum and bronchial aspirate samples. thus, sputum and bronchial aspirate samples are upper bronchial tree samples that are not representative of the lower bronchial mucosa  flora, and bronchoalveolar lavage samples showed the results closest to those for the bronchial mucosa. our data confirm that the bronchial tree is not sterile in  copd patients and support the existence a different microbiota in the upper and lower compartments.

TI  == possible variation of the human oral bacterial community after wearing removable  partial dentures by dgge.
AB  == although it is well-known that variations of the microbial community in a specific location of human body may be associated with some diseases, the developing change of the oral microbiota related to oral diseases before and after wearing the removable partial dentures (rpd) is not completely understood.  in this study, three kinds of samples (saliva, supra- and subgingival plaque, and oral mucosal surfaces) were collected from the 10-patients group at three different times: before, 1-month and 6-months after the treatment. ten healthy adults were also selected as the control group. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was applied to identify the bacterial profiles and to analyze the dynamics of the oral microbial population in the pre- and post-therapy. the anova of repeated measurement data indicated that, in the saliva and mucosal surfaces,  wearing rpds caused significant change of numbers of amplicons. as many as 607 amplicons were chosen to cut out and re-amplify by pcr. after cloning and sequencing, a total of 16 bacterial genera were identified. the health-associated genera such as streptococcus, neisseria, rothia, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, gemella, veillonella, selenomona and actinomyces tended to decrease, whereas the  disease-associated species including streptococcus mutans tended to increase. in  general, wearing rpds influenced the diversity of the bacterial species in the oral microbial ecosystem. it is noteworthy that the oral environment will be changed from the healthy status towards the disease status after the treatment.

TI  == secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor binds to neisseria gonorrhoeae outer membrane opacity protein and is bactericidal.
AB  == problem: secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi) is an innate immune peptide present on the genitourinary tract mucosa that has antimicrobial activity. in this study, we investigated the interaction of slpi with neisseria gonorrhoeae. method of study: elisa and far-western blots were used to analyze binding of slpi to gonococci. the binding site for slpi was identified by tryptic digests and mass spectrometry. antimicrobial activity of slpi for gonococci was determined using bactericidal assays. slpi protein levels in cell supernatants were measured by elisa, and slpi mrna levels were assessed by quantitative rt-pcr. results: slpi bound directly to the gonococcal opa protein and was bactericidal. epithelial cells from the reproductive tract constitutively expressed slpi at different levels. gonococcal infection of cells did not affect  slpi expression. conclusion: we conclude that slpi is bactericidal for gonococci  and is expressed by reproductive tract epithelial cells and thus is likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of gonococcal infection.

AB  == objective: to detect the genes of neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, and to study the pathogenicity of non-gonococcal  strains of neisseria and the laboratory diagnosis for the infections caused by neisseria spp. methods: using polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequencing, we amplified and sequenced 4 genes of neisseria spp. isolated from patients with male genitourinary tract infections, including 16s rrna, orfl, cppb and nspa. results: fourteen neisseria strains were identified through analysis of the 16s rrna gene, including 3 n. mucosa strains, 3 n. cinerea strains, 2 n. gonorrhoea strains, 2 n. sicca strains, 2 n. subflava strains, 1 n. lactamica strain, and 1 n. polysaccharea strain. among them, 9 showed positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-pcr detection, 1 in cppb gene reaction, 5 in orfl gene reaction, and 3 in nspa gene reaction. the consistency rate was 85.7% between the above results from our gene detection and those from the routine bacteriological methods. conclusion: the cppb gene is absent in the non-gonococcal strains of neisseria spp. that can cause male genitourinary tract  infection. most of the strains not only lack virulence-associated orfl and nspa genes, but also show positive results in gonococcal fluorescence-labeled multiplex-pcr detection, which is one of the important reasons for the misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis of gonorrhea infection. the combination of routine bacteriological methods and gene detection in laboratory examinations may help improve the accuracy rates of neisseria species identification and clinical  diagnosis of the infections caused by neisseria spp.

TI  == meningococcal outer membrane protein nhha triggers apoptosis in macrophages.
AB  == phagocytotic cells play a fundamental role in the defense against bacterial pathogens. one mechanism whereby bacteria evade phagocytosis is to produce factors that trigger apoptosis. here we identify for the first time a meningococcal protein capable of inducing macrophage apoptosis. the conserved meningococcal outer membrane protein nhha (neisseria hia/hsf homologue a, also known as hsf) mediates bacterial adhesion and interacts with extracellular matrix components heparan sulphate and laminin. meningococci lacking nhha fail to colonise nasal mucosa in a mouse model of meningococcal disease. we found that exposure of macrophages to nhha resulted in a highly increased rate of apoptosis  that proceeded through caspase activation. exposure of macrophages to nhha also led to inos induction and nitric oxide production. however, neither nitric oxide  production nor tnf-alpha signaling was found to be a prerequisite for nhha-induced apoptosis. macrophages exposed to wildtype nhha-expressing meningococci were also found to undergo apoptosis whereas nhha-deficient meningococci had a markedly decreased capacity to induce macrophage apoptosis. these data provide new insights on the role of nhha in meningococcal disease. nhha-induced macrophage apoptosis could be a mechanism whereby meningococci evade immunoregulatory and phagocytotic actions of macrophages.

TI  == microbiota in the oral subgingival biofilm is associated with obesity in adolescence.
AB  == to test the hypothesis whether microbiota in oral biofilm is linked with obesity  in adolescents we designed this cross-sectional study. obese adolescents (n = 29) with a mean age of 14.7 years and normal weight subjects (n = 58) matched by age  and gender were examined with respect to visible plaque index (vpi%) and gingival inflammation (bleeding on probing (bop%)). stimulated saliva was collected. they  answered a questionnaire concerning medical history, medication, oral hygiene habits, smoking habits, and sociodemographic background. microbiological samples  taken from the gingival crevice was analyzed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. the sum of bacterial cells in subgingival biofilm was significantly associated with obesity (p < 0.001). the link between sum of bacterial cells and obesity was not confounded by any of the studied variables (chronic disease, medication, vpi%, bop%, flow rate of whole saliva, or meal frequency). totally 23 bacterial species were present in approximately threefold  higher amounts, on average, in obese subjects compared with normal weight controls. of the proteobacteria phylum, campylobacter rectus and neisseria mucosa were present in sixfold higher amounts among obese subjects. the association between obesity and sum of bacterial cells in oral subgingival biofilm indicates  a possible link between oral microbiota and obesity in adolescents.

AB  == background and objective: the development of dental biofilms after professional plaque removal is very rapid. however, it is not clear whether most bacterial species return at similar rates in periodontally healthy and periodontitis subjects or if there are differences in bacterial recolonization between supragingival and subgingival biofilms in periodontal health and disease. material and methods: supragingival and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28 teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects immediately  after professional cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants after 1, 2, 4 and 7 d of no oral hygiene and analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage of dna probe counts were averaged within subjects at each time-point. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving-window analysis. results: succession in supragingival biofilms from subjects with periodontitis and from healthy individuals was similar. at 1 d, streptococcus mitis and neisseria mucosa showed increased proportions, followed by capnocytophaga gingivalis, eikenella corrodens, veillonella parvula and streptococcus oralis at 1-4 d. at 4-7 d, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, prevotella melaninogenica and prevotella nigrescens became elevated. subgingival plaque redevelopment was slower and very different from supragingival plaque redevelopment. increased proportions were first observed for s. mitis, followed by v. parvula and c. gingivalis and, at 7 d, by capnocytophaga sputigena and p. nigrescens. no significant increase in the proportions of periodontal pathogens was observed in any of the clinical groups or locations. conclusion: there is a defined order in bacterial species succession in early supragingival and subgingival biofilm redevelopment after professional cleaning.

AB  == infection and disease associated with neisseria gonorrhoeae, the gonococcus, continue to be a global health problem. asymptomatic and subclinical gonococcal infections occur at a high frequency in females; thus, the true incidence of n. gonorrhoeae infections are presumed to be severely underestimated. inherent to this asymptomatic/subclinical diseased state is the continued prevalence of this  organism within the general population, as well as the medical, economic, and social burden equated with the observed chronic, disease sequelae. as infections  of the lower female genital tract (i.e., the uterine cervix) commonly result in subclinical disease, it follows that the pathobiology of cervical gonorrhea would differ from that observed for other sites of infection. in this regard, the potential responses to infection that are generated by the female reproductive tract mucosa are unique in that they are governed, in part, by cyclic fluctuations in steroid hormone levels. the lower female genital tract has the further distinction of being able to functionally discriminate between resident commensal microbiota and transient pathogens. the expression of functionally active complement receptor 3 by the lower, but not the upper, female genital tract mucosa; together with data indicating that gonococcal adherence to and invasion of primary cervical epithelial cells and tissue are predominately aided  by this surface-expressed host molecule; provide one explanation for asymptomatic/subclinical gonococcal cervicitis. however, co-evolution of the gonococcus with its sole human host has endowed this organism with variable survival strategies that not only aid these bacteria in successfully evasion of immune detection and function but also enhance cervical colonization and cellular invasion. to this end, we herein summarize current knowledge pertaining to the pathobiology of gonococcal infection of the human cervix.

TI  == molecular testing of respiratory swabs aids early recognition of meningococcal disease in children.
AB  == early meningococcal disease (md) diagnosis is difficult. we assessed rapid molecular testing of respiratory specimens. we performed genotyping of respiratory swabs, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid from children with suspected disease and nasal swabs (nss) from matched controls. thirty-nine of 104 suspected cases had confirmed disease. four controls were carriers. throat swab ctra and pora testing for detection of disease gave a sensitivity of 81% (17/21), specificity of 100% (44/44), positive predictive value (ppv) of 100% (17/17), negative predictive value (npv) of 92% (44/48), and relative risk of 12. ns ctra  and pora testing gave a sensitivity of 51% (20/39), specificity of 95% (62/65), ppv of 87% (20/23), npv of 77% (62/81), and relative risk of 4. including only the 86 nss taken within 48 h of presentation, the results were sensitivity of 60% (18/30), specificity of 96% (54/56), ppv of 90% (18/20), npv of 82% (54/66), and  relative risk of 5. swab type agreement was excellent (kappa 0.80, p < 0.001). there was exact phylogenetic agreement from different specimen sites for individuals. carried genosubtypes were p1.7 and p1.21-7. prehospital rapid molecular testing of easily obtained respiratory specimens could accelerate diagnosis of md.

TI  == detection of nine microorganisms from the initial carious root lesions using a taqman-based real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using taqman pcr and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. material and methods: fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by taqman pcr. results: the quantity of the cariogenic bacteria actinomyces spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacilllus spp., rothia dentocariosa, parvimonas micra, propionibacterium acnes and neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. no significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria  except p. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. conclusion: all the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.

TI  == kinetics of immune responses to nasal challenge with meningococcal polysaccharide one year after serogroup-c glycoconjugate vaccination.
AB  == background: recipients of serogroup-c glycoconjugate meningococcal vaccine (mcc)  exhibit waning of serum bactericidal antibody (sba) titers, but the rate of decline and the speed of their immunological memory in response to new meningococcal nasopharyngeal colonization are unknown. methods: in a prospective  challenge study, we measured persistence of sba and anti-neisseria meningitidis serogroup-c (menc) immunoglobulin (ig) g and iga in adults aged 18-39, 28 days and 12 months after receiving mcc. volunteers were then challenged intranasally with 50 mug menc polysaccharide to mimic meningococcal colonization, and systemic and mucosal antibody responses were measured. results: all subjects had protective sba titers (>/=8) 28 days after mcc vaccination, but 12.3% and 20.2% had unprotective (<8) or low (<128) levels, respectively, after 12 months. following rechallenge (12 months postvaccination) and measurement of antibody responses after 4, 7, and 10 days, rises in sba titers were only observed in subjects with low (<128) or nonprotective (<8) prerechallenge sba titers. in subjects with pre rechallenge sba titers <8, the majority did not reach a protective sba titer until 7 days post-rechallenge. menc-specific igg levels rose in both serum and saliva in correlation with sba titers. no detectable rise in salivary iga was observed. conclusions: in those individuals who fail to retain protective sba 12 months after mcc, immunological memory fails to generate protective systemic and mucosal antibodies until 7 days post intranasal challenge with cognate meningococcal polysaccharide. this is likely too slow to protect from natural meningococcal infection. mcc vaccinees rely on persistence of antibody levels rather than immunological memory for sustained protection.

TI  == microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development in the absence of oral hygiene in periodontal health and disease.
AB  == aim: to monitor microbial shifts during dental biofilm re-development. materials  and methods: supra- and subgingival plaque samples were taken separately from 28  teeth in 38 healthy and 17 periodontitis subjects at baseline and immediately after tooth cleaning. samples were taken again from seven teeth in randomly selected quadrants during 1, 2, 4 and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analysed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. species counts were averaged within subjects at each time point. significant differences in the counts between healthy and periodontitis subjects were determined using the mann-whitney test. results: the total supra- and subgingival counts were significantly higher in periodontitis on entry and reached or exceeded the baseline values after day 2. supragingival counts of veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii and neisseria mucosa increased from 2 to 7 days. subgingival counts were greater  for actinomyces, green and orange complex species. significant differences between groups in supragingival counts occurred for 17 of 41 species at entry, 0  at day 7; for subgingival plaque, these values were 39/41 taxa at entry, 17/41 at day 7. conclusions: supragingival plaque re-development was similar in periodontitis and health, but subgingival species recolonization was more marked  in periodontitis.

TI  == a case of bacteremia by neisseria gonorrhoeae coincident with massive hemorrhage  of esophageal varices.
AB  == a 42-yr-old man with hepatitis b virus associated liver cirrhosis was admitted to the emergency room because of multiple seizures, a history of chills and myalgia  over the previous 2 weeks, and 3 days of melena. he was febrile with a temperature of 38.0 degrees c. there were no symptoms and signs related to the genitourinary system, skin, or joints. three sets of blood cultures were obtained and oxidase-positive, gram-negative diplococci were detected after 25.9-26.9 hr of incubation in all aerobic vials. the organism was positive for catalase and oxidase, and was identified as neisseria gonorrhoeae, using a vitek neisseria-haemophilus identification card (biomerieux vitek, inc., usa). further, 16s rrna sequencing of this isolate revealed a 99.9% homology with the published  sequence of n. gonorrhoeae strain nctc 83785 (genbank accession no. nr_026079.1). acute bleeding by variceal rupture seems to be a likely route of introduction of  n. gonorrhoeae from the mucosa into the blood. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of gonococcal bacteremia in korea.

AB  == aim: comparative study of microflora of nasal passages during acute and chronic inflammatory nasal diseases with and without chlamydia infection. materials and methods: microflora of nasal mucosa obtained from 104 patients with acute maxillary sinusitis and chronic nasal diseases (sinusitis and rhinitis) with and  without detected chlamydia infection. verification of the latter was performed by pcr and direct immunofluorescent method. microbiological isolation was performed  on blood agar using method of sectors. identification of streptococci, bacteria from enterobacteriaceae family, staphylococci, and bacteria from neisseria genus  was performed by conventional methods. results: during acute maxillary sinusitis  associated with chlamydia infection, depletion of bacterial species diversity was observed with increase of quantity of staphylococci. also, increase of number of  staphylococcal strains with pathogenic properties in patients with chlamydia carriage was observed. conclusion: it could be suggested that chlamydia, pathogenic, and opportunistic bacteria are antagonists, which compete for ecologic niche and substrate in host organism. decrease of number of staphylococci is a response on invasion and multiplication of chlamydia on mucosa of nasal passages.

TI  == olfactory nerve--a novel invasion route of neisseria meningitidis to reach the meninges.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a human-specific pathogen with capacity to cause septic shock and meningitis. it has been hypothesized that invasion of the central nervous system (cns) is a complication of a bacteremic condition. in this study,  we aimed to characterize the invasion route of n. meningitidis to the cns. using  an intranasally challenged mouse disease model, we found that twenty percent of the mice developed lethal meningitis even though no bacteria could be detected in blood. upon bacterial infection, epithelial lesions and redistribution of intracellular junction protein n-cadherin were observed at the nasal epithelial mucosa, especially at the olfactory epithelium, which is functionally and anatomically connected to the cns. bacteria were detected in the submucosa of the olfactory epithelium, along olfactory nerves in the cribriform plate, at the olfactory bulb and subsequently at the meninges and subarachnoid space. furthermore, our data suggest that a threshold level of bacteremia is required for the development of meningococcal sepsis. taken together, n. meningitidis is able to pass directly from nasopharynx to meninges through the olfactory nerve system. this study enhances our understanding how n. meningitidis invades the meninges. the nasal olfactory nerve system may be a novel target for disease prevention that can improve outcome and survival.

TI  == neisseria lactamica attenuates tlr-1/2-induced cytokine responses in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells using ppar-gamma.
AB  == the upper respiratory tract commensal neisseria lactamica (nlac) induces protective humoral immunity against pathogenic nmen serogroup b (nmen), but whether it also affords anti-inflammatory mucosal protection, as reported for several gut commensals, has not been investigated. here we demonstrate for the first time that nlac weakly induces inflammatory responses compared with nmen in  the nasopharyngeal epithelial cell line, detroit 562, and that nlac achieves this by attenuation of secretory cytokine (tnf-alpha and il-6) and to a lesser extent  chemokine (il-8 and rantes) responses. culture of detroit cells with nlac inhibited the induction of cytokine-chemokine mrna by nmen, reduced nmen-induced  nf-kappabeta activity and increased constitutive ppar-gamma protein expression. pretreatment of detroit cells with a ppar-gamma antagonist abrogated the attenuation of inflammatory il-6 by nlac, as did heat-killing of the organisms and preventing their invasion with cytochalasin d. inflammatory responses from detroit cells were readily attenuated by nlac following stimulation with pathogenic nmen but more specifically following stimulation with the tlr-1/2 agonist pam3cys and pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-1beta, tnf-alpha) but not lta  or lps. these results indicate that nlac plays an important role in suppressing pathogen-induced inflammation in the nasopharyngeal mucosa, mediated through tlr-1/2 stimulation, by activating ppar-gamma and inhibiting nf-kappabeta activity.

TI  == microbiota of deciduous endodontic infections analysed by mda and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the microbiota of endodontic infections in deciduous teeth by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization after uniform amplification of dna in samples  by multiple displacement amplification (mda). methodology: forty samples from the root canal system of deciduous teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis with or without radiographically detectable periradicular/interradicular bone resorption were collected and 32 were analysed, with three individuals contributing two samples;  these were mda-amplified and analysed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization for levels of 83 bacterial taxa. two outcome measures were used: the percentage of teeth colonized by each species and the mean proportion of each bacterial taxon present across all samples. results: the mean amount of dna in the samples prior  to amplification was 5.2 (+/-4.7) ng and 6.1 (+/-2.3) mug after mda. the mean number of species detected per sample was 19 (+/-4) (range: 3-66) to the nearest  whole number. the most prevalent taxa were prevotella intermedia (96.9%), neisseria mucosa (65.6%), prevotella nigrescens (56.2%) and tannerella forsythia  (56.2%). aggregatibacter (haemophilus) aphrophilus and helicobacter pylori were not detected. p. intermedia (10%), prevotella tannerae (7%) and prevotella nigrescens (4.3%) presented the highest mean proportions of the target species averaged across the positive samples. conclusion: root canals of infected deciduous teeth had a diverse bacterial population. prevotella sp. were commonly  found with p. intermedia, prevotella tannerae and prevotella nigrescens amongst the most prominent species detected.

TI  == real-time impedance analysis of host cell response to meningococcal infection.
AB  == measuring cell proliferation and cell death during bacterial infection involves performing end-point assays that represent the response at a single time point. a new technology from roche applied science and acea biosciences allows continuous  monitoring of cells in real-time using specialized cell culture microplates containing micro-electrodes. the xcelligence system enables continuous measurement and quantification of cell adhesion, proliferation, spreading, cell death and detachment, thus creating a picture of cell function during bacterial infection. furthermore, lag and log phases can be determined to estimate optimal  times to infect cells. in this study we used this system to provide valuable insights into cell function in response to several virulence factors of the meningitis causing pathogen neisseria meningitidis, including the lipopolysaccharide (lps), the polysaccharide capsule and the outer membrane protein opc. we observed that prolonged time of infection with pathogenic neisseria strains led to morphological changes including cell rounding and loss of cell-cell contact, thus resulting in changed electrical impedance as monitored in real-time. furthermore, cell function in response to 14 strains of apathogenic neisseria spp. (n. lactamica and n. mucosa) was analyzed. in contrast, infection  with apathogenic n. lactamica isolates did not change electrical impedance monitored for 48 h. together our data show that this system can be used as a rapid monitoring tool for cellular function in response to bacterial infection and combines high data acquisition rates with ease of handling.

TI  == toll-like receptor 2 induces mucosal homing receptor expression and iga production by human b cells.
AB  == there is a need for developing vaccines that elicit mucosal immunity. although oral or nasal vaccination methods would be ideal, current strategies have yielded mixed success. toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) ligands are effective adjuvants and are currently used in the haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. induction of humoral immunity in the mucosa is critical for effective vaccination; thus, we sought to determine the effects of tlr2 ligands on human mucosal b cell differentiation. we demonstrate that tlr2 ligands induce ccr9 and ccr10 expression by circulating b cells and increased chemotaxis to cognate chemokines  ccl25 and ccl28 suggesting that tlr2 induces b cell homing to the gastrointestinal tract. tlr2 stimulation of b cells also induced j chain and iga  production demonstrating the induction of mucosal-like antibody secreting cells.  these observations suggest that vaccines containing tlr2-ligands as adjuvants could induce mucosal b cell immunity even when delivered in a non-mucosal manner.

TI  == human airway epithelial cell responses to neisseria lactamica and purified porin  via toll-like receptor 2-dependent signaling.
AB  == the human airway epithelium is constantly exposed to microbial products from colonizing organisms. regulation of toll-like receptor (tlr) expression and specific interactions with bacterial ligands is thought to mitigate exacerbation  of inflammatory processes induced by the commensal flora in these cells. the genus neisseria comprises pathogenic and commensal organisms that colonize the human nasopharynx. neisseria lactamica is not associated with disease, but n. meningitidis occasionally invades the host, causing meningococcal disease and septicemia. upon colonization of the airway epithelium, specific host cell receptors interact with numerous neisseria components, including the porb porin,  at the immediate bacterial-host cell interface. this major outer membrane protein is expressed by all neisseria strains, regardless of pathogenicity, but its amino acid sequence varies among strains, particularly in the surface-exposed regions.  the interaction of neisseria porb with tlr2 is essential for driving tlr2/tlr1-dependent cellular responses and is thought to occur via the porin's surface-exposed loop regions. our studies show that n. lactamica porb is a tlr2 ligand but its binding specificity for tlr2 is different from that of meningococcal porb. furthermore, n. lactamica porb is a poor inducer of proinflammatory mediators and of tlr2 expression in human airway epithelial cells. these effects are reproduced by whole n. lactamica organisms. since the responsiveness of human airway epithelial cells to colonizing bacteria is in part regulated via tlr2 expression and signaling, commensal organisms such as n. lactamica would benefit from expressing a product that induces low tlr2-dependent local inflammation, likely delaying or avoiding clearance by the host.

TI  == amplification of minute amounts of oral bacterial dna for real-time quantitative  pcr analysis.
AB  == background: high-throughput technologies for typing caries or health-associated bacterial populations including pcr, dna microarrays and next-generation sequencing techniques require significant amounts of bacterial dna. in clinical settings, the amount of sampled dna is often limited and amplification is therefore essential. protocols should be able to reproducibly amplify sequences in order to maintain initial sequence ratios and should not bias the representation of particular dna sequence types. methods: a linear amplification  protocol using dna polymerase i was modified to permit the amplification and subsequent analysis of small amounts of bacterial dna. the protocol was tested on human oral bacterial biofilms from different sources, including carious dentine and plaque, and compared to amplification by degenerate pcr of 16s rdna sequences. real-time quantitative pcr of 24 bacterial species was used as a readout system to test amplified dna against unamplified dna. results: the amplification protocol reliably yielded 5-10 mug dna from as little as 12.5 ng of template dna. correlation coefficients between real-time quantitative pcr results from amplified and unamplified dna were between 0.78 and 0.98. conclusion: the optimized protocol consistently produced amplification products from minute amounts of bacterial dna from caries and plaque; the amplification products are suitable for downstream genetic analyses.

TI  == the bacterial microbiota in the oral mucosa of rural amerindians.
AB  == the oral microbiota plays an important role in buccal health and in diseases such as periodontitis and meningitis. the study of the human oral bacteria has so far  focused on subjects from western societies, while little is known about subjects  from isolated communities. this work determined the composition of the oral mucosa microbiota from six amazon amerindians, and tested a sample preservation alternative to freezing. paired oral swabs were taken from six adults of guahibo  ethnicity living in the community of platanillal, amazonas state, venezuela. replicate swabs were preserved in liquid nitrogen and in aware messenger fluid (calypte). buccal dna was extracted, and the v2 region of the 16s rrna gene was amplified and pyrosequenced. a total of 17 214 oral bacterial sequences were obtained from the six subjects; these were binned into 1034 otus from 10 phyla, 30 families and 51 genera. the oral mucosa was highly dominated by four phyla: firmicutes (mostly the genera streptococcus and veillonella), proteobacteria (mostly neisseria), bacterioidetes (prevotella) and actinobacteria (micrococcineae). although the microbiota were similar at the phylum level, the amerindians shared only 62 % of the families and 23 % of the genera with non-amerindians from previous studies, and had a lower richness of genera (51 vs  177 reported in non-amerindians). the amerindians carried unidentified members of the phyla bacteroidetes, firmicutes and proteobacteria and their microbiota included soil bacteria gp1 (acidobacteriaceae) and xylanibacter (prevotellaceae), and the rare genus phocoenobacter (pasteurellaceae). preserving buccal swabs in the aware messenger oral fluid collection device substantially altered the bacterial composition in comparison to freezing, and therefore this method cannot be used to preserve samples for the study of microbial communities.

TI  == human-restricted bacterial pathogens block shedding of epithelial cells by stimulating integrin activation.
AB  == colonization of mucosal surfaces is the key initial step in most bacterial infections. one mechanism protecting the mucosa is the rapid shedding of epithelial cells, also termed exfoliation, but it is unclear how pathogens counteract this process. we found that carcinoembryonic antigen (cea)-binding bacteria colonized the urogenital tract of cea transgenic mice, but not of wild-type mice, by suppressing exfoliation of mucosal cells. cea binding triggered de novo expression of the transforming growth factor receptor cd105, changing focal adhesion composition and activating beta1 integrins. this manipulation of integrin inside-out signaling promotes efficient mucosal colonization and represents a potential target to prevent or cure bacterial infections.

AB  == isolated gonococcal tenosynovitis is rare, and is part of disseminated gonococcal infection. it is due to blood-borne contamination of the flexor tendon sheath. one to 3% of gonococcal mucosal infections develop disseminated infections. tenosynovitis is present in two-thirds of cases, sometimes in association with arthritis and skin rash. we report a case of a 26-year-old man with isolated gonococcal tenosynovitis of the thumb, with no other medical history, occurring 15 days after unprotected sex. except local inflammatory signs of the thumb extending to the wrist, and a biological inflammatory syndrome, the patient had no arthritis, skin or mucosa symptoms. immediate surgical drainage was performed  under antibiotic cover with 3rd generation cephalosporin. all bacteriological samples were negative, except for one blood culture positive for neisseria gonorrhoeae. thus, in case of an asymptomatic patient with suspected gonococcal infection through a mucus portal, a precise examination, including geographical and sexual history, and a review of screening are recommended. although the pathophysiology of gonococcal tenosynovitis is still obscure, the best prevention remains that of sexually transmitted diseases.

TI  == suppression of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication in macrophages by  commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating toll-like receptor 4.
AB  == protection from primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1) infection has not yet been accomplished by vaccines inducing hiv-1-specific acquired immunity.  nevertheless, it has been reported that a small subgroup of women remain resistant to hiv-1 infection under natural conditions. if similar conditions can  be induced in uninfected individuals, it will contribute the first line of protection against hiv-1 infection, and also improve the effects of anti-hiv-1 vaccines. we reasoned that innate immunity may be involved in the resistance to hiv-1 infection, and investigated the effects of various toll-like receptor (tlr) ligands and commensal bacteria on hiv-1 replication in macrophages, one of the initial targets of hiv-1 infection and also the main mediators of innate immunity. we established the hiv-1 reporter monocytic cell line, thp-1/nl4-3luc,  which could be differentiated into macrophage-like cells in vitro. in these cells, stimulation of tlr3 and tlr4 by their ligands suppressed hiv-1 expression  partly through type i interferon (ifn). among the commensal bacteria tested, escherichia coli, veillonella parvula and neisseria mucosa suppressed hiv-1 expression, whereas lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella melaninogenica, p. bivia and mycobacterium smegmatis enhanced it. the bacteria with suppressive effects preferentially stimulated tlr4, whereas the ones with enhancing effects stimulated tlr2. neutralizing antibodies against tlr4 and ifn-alpha/beta receptor abrogated bacterially mediated hiv-1 suppression. suppressive effects of e. coli, v. parvula and n. mucosa on hiv-1 replication were reproducible in primary monocyte-derived macrophages following acute hiv-1 infection. these findings suggest that certain commensal bacteria preferentially stimulating tlr4 potentially produce local environments resistant to hiv-1 infection.

TI  == neisseria lactamica selectively induces mitogenic proliferation of the naive b cell pool via cell surface ig.
AB  == neisseria lactamica is a commensal bacteria that colonizes the human upper respiratory tract mucosa during early childhood. in contrast to the closely related opportunistic pathogen neisseria meningitidis, there is an absence of adaptive cell-mediated immunity to n. lactamica during the peak age of carriage.  instead, outer membrane vesicles derived from n. lactamica mediate a b cell-dependent proliferative response in mucosal mononuclear cells that is associated with the production of polyclonal igm. we demonstrate in this study that this is a mitogenic human b cell response that occurs independently of t cell help and any other accessory cell population. the ability to drive b cell proliferation is a highly conserved property and is present in n. lactamica strains derived from diverse clonal complexes. cfse staining of purified human tonsillar b cells demonstrated that naive igd(+) and cd27(-) b cells are selectively induced to proliferate by outer membrane vesicles, including the innate cd5(+) subset. neither purified lipooligosaccharide nor porb from n. lactamica is likely to be responsible for this activity. prior treatment of b cells with pronase to remove cell-surface ig or treatment with bcr-specific abs abrogated the proliferative response to n. lactamica outer membrane vesicles, suggesting that this mitogenic response is dependent upon the bcr.

TI  == transcellular passage of neisseria meningitidis across a polarized respiratory epithelium.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of sepsis and meningitis but is also a common commensal, present in the nasopharynx of between 8 and 20% of healthy individuals. during carriage, the bacterium is found on the surface of the nasopharyngeal epithelium and in deeper tissues, while to develop disease the meningococcus must spread across the respiratory epithelium and enter the systemic circulation. therefore, investigating the pathways by which n. meningitidis crosses the epithelial barrier is relevant for understanding carriage and disease but has been hindered by the lack of appropriate models. here, we have established a physiologically relevant model of the upper respiratory epithelial cell barrier to investigate the mechanisms responsible for traversal of n. meningitidis. calu-3 human respiratory epithelial cells were grown on permeable cell culture membranes to form polarized monolayers of cells joined by tight junctions. we show that the meningococcus crosses the epithelial  cell barrier by a transcellular route; traversal of the layer did not disrupt its integrity, and bacteria were detected within the cells of the monolayer. we demonstrate that successful traversal of the epithelial cell barrier by n. meningitidis requires expression of its type 4 pili (tfp) and capsule and is dependent on the host cell microtubule network. the calu-3 model should be suitable for dissecting the pathogenesis of infections caused by other respiratory pathogens, as well as the meningococcus.

AB  == the authors present data on the occurrence, density, and species composition of microorganisms isolated from pharyngeal mucosa of 40 healthy subjects and 55 patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx. the total density of microbial populations in control subjects was estimated at 2,672+/-614 cfu/ml compared with 17,510+/-1,983 cfu/ml in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx unrelated to malignant neoplastic growth and 19,375+/-2,103 cfu/ml in patients who had experienced surgical intervention for the treatment of malignancy. a total of 312 microbial strains were isolated and identified. coccal bacteria were the predominant group (streptococci-74 strains, neisseria-72, staphylococci-62, micrococci-12). collectively, they comprised 70.5% of all isolated strains representing autochthonous microflora. corynebacteria, moraxellas, and enterobacteria (transitory forms) were rare. the occurrence of neisseria, staphylococci and fungi (genus candida) in patients with cicatrical stenosis of the larynx was significantly higher than in the healthy subjects. moreover, the patients developed dysbacteriosis with the predominance of n. flavescens, s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. alpha-haemoliticus, and candida sp. it is concluded that elucidation of the microbial landscape in patients with cicatrical stenosis  of the larynx is of importance for planning prevention and management of pyoseptic complications in the course of surgical treatment.

TI  == ceacam1 recognition by bacterial pathogens is species-specific.
AB  == background: carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (ceacam1),  an immunoglobulin (ig)-related glycoprotein, serves as cellular receptor for a variety of gram-negative bacterial pathogens associated with the human mucosa. in particular, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae possess well-characterized ceacam1-binding adhesins. ceacam1 is typically involved in cell-cell attachment, epithelial differentiation, neovascularisation and regulation of t-cell proliferation, and is one of the few ceacam family members with homologues in different mammalian lineages. however, it is unknown whether bacterial adhesins of human pathogens can recognize ceacam1 orthologues from other mammals. results: sequence comparisons of the amino-terminal ig-variable-like domain of ceacam1 reveal that  the highest sequence divergence between human, murine, canine and bovine orthologues is found in the beta-strands comprising the bacteria-binding cc'fg-face of the ig-fold. using gfp-tagged, soluble amino-terminal domains of ceacam1, we demonstrate that bacterial pathogens selectively associate with human, but not other mammalian ceacam1 orthologues. whereas full-length human ceacam1 can mediate internalization of neisseria gonorrhoeae in transfected cells, murine ceacam1 fails to support bacterial internalization, demonstrating that the sequence divergence of ceacam1 orthologues has functional consequences with regard to bacterial recognition and cellular invasion. conclusions: our results establish the selective interaction of several human-restricted bacterial pathogens with human ceacam1 and suggest that co-evolution of microbial adhesins  with their corresponding receptors on mammalian cells contributes to the limited  host range of these highly adapted infectious agents.

TI  == the prevalence of some bacterial markers in female patients undergoing an initial infertility evaluation in north-east romania.
AB  == scope: genital infections represent one of the most important causes of infertility, affecting: fallopian tubes, endometrial mucosa, sperm parameters. the aim of this study is to evaluate the involvement of four sexually transmitted infections (std) in the achievement of infertility and to establish the prevalence of each infectious agent in our patients. methods: we analyzed the presence of chlamydia trachomatis (ct) antigen, ureaplasma urealyticum (uu), mycoplasma hominis (mh) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (ng) in the endocervical secretions and chlamydia trachomatis antibodies iga, igg, igm in the serum of 125 infertile women as well as in 30 pregnant women in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy, as a control group. results. in infertile women, the prevalence rate of the four bacterial markers was: ct antigen 1/125 (0.80%), ct igg antibodies 19/125 (15.20%), mh 6/125 (4.80%), uu 51/125 (40.80%) and ng 1/125 (0.8%). from the control group, none was positive for ct antigen, but 1/30 (3.33% of patients) was positive for ct iga while the prevalence rate for mh and uu were 16.66% and 43.33% respectively. conclusions: we couldn't prove any association between genital mh/uu and infertility as the prevalence was higher in the control group than in the cases, but the correlation of the ct infection with the infertility was clearly shown. however, it is necessary to perform routine tests to screen for ct, ng, uu and mh among infertile patients. the positivity for ct igg is a marker better correlated with fallopian tube obstruction than the ct antigen.

TI  == clinical and microbiological findings at sites treated with orthodontic fixed appliances in adolescents.
AB  == introduction: fixed orthodontic appliances can alter the subgingival microbiota.  our aim was to compare the subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters in adolescent subjects at sites of teeth treated with orthodontic bands with margins at (obm) or below the gingival margin (obsm), or with brackets (obr). methods: microbial samples were collected from 33 subjects (ages, 12-18 years) in treatment more than 6 months. the microbiota was assessed by the dna-dna checkerboard hybridization method. results: bacterial samples were taken from 83  obr,103 obsm, and 54 obm sites. probing pocket depths differed by orthodontic type (p <0.001) with mean values of 2.9 mm (sd, 0.6) at obsm sites, 2.5 mm (sd, 0.6) at obm sites, and 2.3 mm (sd, 0.5) at obr sites. only actinomyces israelii (p <0.001) and actinomyces naeslundii (p <0.001) had higher levels at obr sites,  whereas neisseria mucosa had higher levels at sites treated with obsm or obm (p <0.001). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was found in 25% of sites independent of the appliance. conclusions: different types of orthodontic appliances cause minor differences in the subgingival microbiota (a israelii and  a naeslundii) and higher levels at sites treated with orthodontic brackets. more  sites with bleeding on probing and deeper pockets were found around orthodontic bands.

TI  == a novel phase variation mechanism in the meningococcus driven by a ligand-responsive repressor and differential spacing of distal promoter elements.
AB  == phase variable expression, mediated by high frequency reversible changes in the length of simple sequence repeats, facilitates adaptation of bacterial populations to changing environments and is frequently important in bacterial virulence. here we elucidate a novel phase variable mechanism for nada, an adhesin and invasin of neisseria meningitidis. the nadr repressor protein binds to operators flanking the phase variable tract and contributes to the differential expression levels of phase variant promoters with different numbers  of repeats likely due to different spacing between operators. we show that ihf binds between these operators, and may permit looping of the promoter, allowing interaction of nadr at operators located distally or overlapping the promoter. the 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a metabolite of aromatic amino acid catabolism that is secreted in saliva, induces nada expression by inhibiting the dna binding activity of the repressor. when induced, only minor differences are evident between nadr-independent transcription levels of promoter phase variants and are  likely due to differential rna polymerase contacts leading to altered promoter activity. our results suggest that nada expression is under both stochastic and tight environmental-sensing regulatory control, both mediated by the nadr repressor, and may be induced during colonization of the oropharynx where it plays a major role in the successful adhesion and invasion of the mucosa. hence,  simple sequence repeats in promoter regions may be a strategy used by host-adapted bacterial pathogens to randomly switch between expression states that may nonetheless still be induced by appropriate niche-specific signals.

TI  == a hypothetical explanatory model for meningococcal meningitis in the african meningitis belt.
AB  == despite much progress in surveillance and biological research, no explanation exists to date for the epidemic pattern of meningitis in the african meningitis belt, which is required to mathematically model the impact of vaccine strategies  or to predict epidemics. this paper presents a hypothetical explanatory model for epidemic meningococcal meningitis. four incidence patterns are defined as model states, including endemic incidence during the rainy season, ubiquitous hyperendemicity during the dry season, occasional localized epidemics, and-at the regional level-regular epidemic waves spanning over communities or years. while the transition from endemic to hyperendemic situation in a community is caused by an increase in risk of meningitis given colonization by a virulent meningococcus  (due to damage of the pharyngeal mucosa by dry climate), the transition from hyperendemic to epidemic situation involves increased pharyngeal colonization and transmission (possibly caused by viral respiratory infection epidemics). the described mechanisms are sufficient to explain the 10- to 100-fold incidence increase that both transitions usually imply. epidemic waves occur if new meningococcal strains which escape pre-existing immunity, enter the population. future research should include the impact of viral co-infection on bacterial colonization and invasion.

TI  == effect of various rinsing protocols after use of amine fluoride/stannous fluoride toothpaste on the bacterial composition of dental plaque.
AB  == this clinical study evaluated the effect of different oral hygiene protocols on the bacterial composition of dental plaque. after a 2-week period of using fluoride-free toothpaste, 30 participants followed three 1-week experimental protocols, each followed by 2-week fluoride-free washout periods in a randomized  crossover examiner-blind controlled trial. the 1-week experimental protocols comprised the use of amf/snf(2) toothpaste twice daily, after which participants  either (1) rinsed with tap water, (2) did not rinse but only spat out the toothpaste, or (3) rinsed with an amf/snf(2) mouthwash. in the fluoride-free washout periods, the participants brushed their teeth with fluoride-free toothpaste without further instructions. six hours after the last brushing (+/- rinsing) of each period, buccal plaque samples in the upper molar region were taken. the microbiota composition of the plaque samples was analyzed by checkerboard dna:dna hybridization. a statistically significant reduction was found in the total amount of dna of the 39 major plaque species measured, and in  the proportions of some acid-producing bacterial strains after the period having  used the amf/snf(2) toothpaste + amf/snf(2) mouthrinsing. the results indicate that using the amf/snf(2) toothpaste and rinse combination could result in plaque of lower cariogenicity.

TI  == defining the healthy "core microbiome" of oral microbial communities.
AB  == background: most studies examining the commensal human oral microbiome are focused on disease or are limited in methodology. in order to diagnose and treat  diseases at an early and reversible stage an in-depth definition of health is indispensible. the aim of this study therefore was to define the healthy oral microbiome using recent advances in sequencing technology (454 pyrosequencing). results: we sampled and sequenced microbiomes from several intraoral niches (dental surfaces, cheek, hard palate, tongue and saliva) in three healthy individuals. within an individual oral cavity, we found over 3600 unique sequences, over 500 different otus or "species-level" phylotypes (sequences that  clustered at 3% genetic difference) and 88 - 104 higher taxa (genus or more inclusive taxon). the predominant taxa belonged to firmicutes (genus streptococcus, family veillonellaceae, genus granulicatella), proteobacteria (genus neisseria, haemophilus), actinobacteria (genus corynebacterium, rothia, actinomyces), bacteroidetes (genus prevotella, capnocytophaga, porphyromonas) and fusobacteria (genus fusobacterium).each individual sample harboured on average 266 "species-level" phylotypes (sd 67; range 123 - 326) with cheek samples being  the least diverse and the dental samples from approximal surfaces showing the highest diversity. principal component analysis discriminated the profiles of the samples originating from shedding surfaces (mucosa of tongue, cheek and palate) from the samples that were obtained from solid surfaces (teeth).there was a large overlap in the higher taxa, "species-level" phylotypes and unique sequences among the three microbiomes: 84% of the higher taxa, 75% of the otus and 65% of the unique sequences were present in at least two of the three microbiomes. the three individuals shared 1660 of 6315 unique sequences. these 1660 sequences (the "core microbiome") contributed 66% of the reads. the overlapping otus contributed to 94% of the reads, while nearly all reads (99.8%) belonged to the shared higher taxa. conclusions: we obtained the first insight into the diversity and uniqueness of individual oral microbiomes at a resolution of next-generation sequencing. we showed that a major proportion of bacterial sequences of unrelated healthy individuals is identical, supporting the concept of a core microbiome at  health.

TI  == booster vaccinations: can immunologic memory outpace disease pathogenesis?
AB  == almost all current vaccines work by the induction of antibodies in serum or on the mucosa to block adherence of pathogens to epithelial cells or interfere with  microbial invasion of the bloodstream. however, antibody levels usually decline after vaccination to undetectable amounts if further vaccination does not occur.  persistence of vaccine-induced antibodies usually goes well beyond the time when  they should have decayed to undetectable levels because of ongoing "natural" boosting or other immunologic mechanisms. the production of memory b and t cells  is of clear importance, but the likelihood that a memory response will be fast enough in the absence of a protective circulating antibody level likely depends on the pace of pathogenesis of a specific organism. this concept is discussed with regard to haemophilus influenzae type b, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis; hepatitis a and b; diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis; polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella; rotavirus; and human papilloma virus. with infectious diseases for which the pace of pathogenesis is less rapid, some individuals will contract infection before the memory response is fully activated and implemented. with infectious diseases for which the pace of pathogenesis is slow, immune memory should be sufficient to prevent disease.

TI  == biochemical and genomic analysis of the denitrification pathway within the genus  neisseria.
AB  == since neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis are obligate human pathogens, a comparison with commensal species of the same genus could reveal differences important in pathogenesis. the recent completion of commensal neisseria genome draft assemblies allowed us to perform a comparison of the genes involved in the catalysis, assembly and regulation of the denitrification pathway, which has been implicated in the virulence of several bacteria. all species contained a highly conserved nitric oxide reductase (norb) and a nitrite  reductase (ania or nirk) that was highly conserved in the catalytic but divergent in the n-terminal lipid modification and c-terminal glycosylation domains. only neisseria mucosa contained a nitrate reductase (nar), and only neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea, neisseria subflava, neisseria flavescens and neisseria sicca contained a nitrous oxide reductase (nos) complex. the regulators of the denitrification genes, fnr, narqp and nsrr, were highly conserved, except  for the gaf domain of narq. biochemical examination of laboratory strains revealed that all of the neisserial species tested except n. mucosa had a two- to fourfold lower nitrite reductase activity than n. gonorrhoeae, while n. meningitidis and most of the commensal neisseria species had a two- to fourfold higher nitric oxide (no) reductase activity. for n. meningitidis and most of the  commensal neisseria, there was a greater than fourfold reduction in the no steady-state level in the presence of nitrite as compared with n. gonorrhoeae. all of the species tested generated an no steady-state level in the presence of an no donor that was similar to that of n. gonorrhoeae. the greatest difference between the neisseria species was the lack of a functional nos system in the pathogenic species n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis.

TI  == proximal small intestinal microbiota and identification of rod-shaped bacteria associated with childhood celiac disease.
AB  == objectives: alterations in the composition of the microbiota in the intestine may promote development of celiac disease (cd). using scanning electron microscopy (sem) we previously demonstrated that rod-shaped bacteria were present on the epithelium of proximal small intestine in children with cd but not in controls. in this study we characterize the microbiota of proximal small intestine in children with cd and controls and identify cd-associated rod-shaped bacteria. methods: proximal small intestine biopsies from 45 children with cd and 18 clinical controls were studied. bacteria were identified by 16s rdna sequencing in dna extracted from biopsies washed with buffer containing dithiothreitol to enrich bacteria adhering to the epithelial lining, by culture-based methods and by sem and transmission electron microscopy. results: the normal, mucosa-associated microbiota of proximal small intestine was limited. it was dominated by the genera streptococcus and neisseria, and also contained veillonella, gemella, actinomyces, rothia, and haemophilus. the proximal small intestine microbiota in biopsies from cd patients collected during 2004-2007 differed only marginally from that of controls, and only one biopsy (4%) had rod-shaped bacteria by sem (sem+). in nine frozen sem+ cd biopsies from the previous study, microbiotas were significantly enriched in clostridium, prevotella, and actinomyces compared with sem- biopsies. bacteria of all three genera were isolated from children born during the swedish cd epidemic. new clostridium and prevotella species and actinomyces graevenitzii were tentatively  identified. conclusions: rod-shaped bacteria, probably of the indicated species,  constituted a significant fraction of the proximal small intestine microbiota in  children born during the swedish cd epidemic and may have been an important risk  factor for cd contributing to the fourfold increase in disease incidence in children below 2 years of age during that time.

AB  == objective: to explore the influence of non-gonococcal neisseria on the diagnosis  and treatment of male genitourinary infection. methods: the samples of urethral exudates, prostatic secretions or/and semen were collected from 8 cases of male patients with acute urethritis or chronic prostatitis, then inoculated into gonococcal agar medium, blood agar medium, sabouraud agar medium and mycoplasma agar medium, respectively. neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasmae, fungi and other bacteria were isolated, chlamydiae examined by gemenez staining, and the gram-negative diplococci from the samples identified by oxidase test, biochemical examination and drug sensitivity test. the pcr products of the cryptic plasmid pjd1 gene of the isolated strains were amplified for the identification of neisseria gonorrhoeae. based on the results of drug sensitivity tests, intravenous or oral antibiotics were selected for treatment. results: eight strains of gram-negative diplococci were isolated in this study, 3 identified as  n. mucosa, 4 as n. cinerea and the other 1 as n. lactamica. the pcr identification test of the cryptic plasmid pjd1 gene showed the same positive results in all the strains as in n. gonorrhoeae. the non-gonococcal neisseria isolated from the male genital tract secretions exhibited a multidrug resistance, especially to quinolones and fosfomycin. all the symptoms disappeared and no pathogens were detected in the patients after a 7-day treatment with cephalosporins or/and minocycline. conclusion: some neisseria species normally parasitizing the upper respiratory tract can also cause male genitourinary infections, such as gonorrhea-like urethritis and chronic prostatitis. neisseria  gonorrhea could be clinically and etiologically misdiagnosed through such conventional methods as morphological examination, oxidase test and pcr identification test of cryptic plasmid and other nonspecific genes. intravenous and/or oral antibiotic medication based on the results of drug sensitivity tests  can cure acute urethritis and chronic prostatitis induced by non-gonococcal neisseria in males. drug resistance of non-gonococcal neisseria directly affects  the success of treatment.

TI  == meningococcal carriage and disease--population biology and evolution.
AB  == meningococcal disease occurs worldwide with incidence rates varying from 1 to 1000 cases per 100,000. the causative organism, neisseria meningitidis, is an obligate commensal of humans, which normally colonizes the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract without causing invasive disease, a phenomenon known as carriage. studies using molecular methods have demonstrated the extensive genetic diversity of meningocococci isolated from carriers, in contrast to a limited number of genetic types, known as the hyperinvasive lineages, associated with invasive disease. population and evolutionary models that invoke positive selection can be used to resolve the apparent paradox of virulent lineages persisting during the global spread of a non-clonal and normally commensal bacterium. the application of insights gained from studies of meningococcal population biology and evolution is important in understanding the spread of disease, as well as in vaccine development and implementation, especially with regard to the challenge of producing comprehensive vaccines based on sub-capsular antigens and measuring their effectiveness.

TI  == absence of mucosal immunity in the human upper respiratory tract to the commensal bacteria neisseria lactamica but not pathogenic neisseria meningitidis during the peak age of nasopharyngeal carriage.
AB  == the normal flora that colonizes the mucosal epithelia has evolved diverse strategies to evade, modulate, or suppress the immune system and avoid clearance. neisseria lactamica and neisseria meningitidis are closely related obligate inhabitants of the human upper respiratory tract. n. lactamica is a commensal but n. meningitidis is an opportunistic pathogen that occasionally causes invasive disease such as meningitis and septicemia. we demonstrate that unlike n. meningitidis, n. lactamica does not prime the development of mucosal t or b cell  memory during the peak period of colonization. this cannot be explained by the induction of peripheral tolerance or regulatory cd4(+)cd25(+) t cell activity. instead, n. lactamica mediates a b cell-dependent mitogenic proliferative response that is absent to n. meningitidis. this mitogenic response is associated with the production of t cell-independent polyclonal igm that we propose functions by shielding colonizing n. lactamica from the adaptive immune system, maintaining immunological ignorance in the host. we conclude that, in contrast to n. meningitidis, n. lactamica maintains a commensal relationship with the host in the absence of an adaptive immune response. this may prolong the period of susceptibility to colonization by both pathogenic and nonpathogenic neisseria species.

TI  == biofilm formation on human airway epithelia by encapsulated neisseria meningitidis serogroup b.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is the etiologic agent of meningococcal meningitis. we compared 48-h biofilm formation by n. meningitidis serogroup b strains nmb, mc58, c311 and isogenic mutants defective in capsule formation on sv-40 transformed human bronchial epithelial (hbe) cells in a flow cell. we demonstrated that strains nmb and nmb siaa-d were defective in biofilm formation over glass, and there was a partial rescue of biofilm growth for strain nmb on collagen-coated coverslips at 48 h. we demonstrated all three serogroup b strains form biofilms of statistically equivalent average height on hbe cells as their isogenic capsular mutants. strain nmb also formed a biofilm of statistically equivalent biomass as the nmb siaa-d mutant on hbe cells at 6 and 48 h. these biofilms are significantly larger than biofilms formed over glass or collagen. verification that strain nmb expressed capsule in biofilms on hbe cells was demonstrated by staining with 2.2.b, a monoclonal antibody with specificity for the serogroup b capsule. elisa analysis demonstrated that strains mc58 and c311 also produced capsules during biofilm growth. these findings suggest that encapsulated meningococci can form biofilms on epithelial cells suggesting that biofilm formation may play a role in nasopharyngeal colonization.

TI  == microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  == background: the bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (olp) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. methods: bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed olp from the stomatology service, department of oral surgery and stomatology, school of dental medicine, university of bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. samples were taken from olp lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. the control population did not have olp and  was recruited from the student clinic. all samples were processed with the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. results: significantly higher bacterial counts of bacteroides ureolyticus (p = 0.001), dialister species (sp.) (p = 0.006), staphylococcus haemolyticus (p = 0.007), and streptococcus agalactiae (p = 0.006) were found in  samples taken from olp lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of olp. significantly higher bacterial counts were found for capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus crispatus, mobiluncus curtisii, neisseria mucosa, prevotella bivia, prevotella intermedia, and s. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with olp compared to sites in control subjects (p  <0.001). conclusions: microbiologic differences were found between sites with olp and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of olp. specifically, higher counts of  staphylococci and s. agalactiae were found in olp lesions.

TI  == ceacam1 inhibits toll-like receptor 2-triggered antibacterial responses of human  pulmonary epithelial cells.
AB  == although moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria meningitidis are important human pathogens, they often colonize the human respiratory tract without causing overt  clinical symptoms. both pathogens express structurally unrelated proteins that share the ability to stimulate the adhesion molecule ceacam1 expressed on human cells. here we demonstrate that the interaction of ceacam1 with ubiquitous surface protein a1 expressed on m. catarrhalis or with opacity-associated proteins on n. meningitidis resulted in reduced toll-like receptor 2-initiated transcription factor nf-kappab-dependent inflammatory responses of primary pulmonary epithelial cells. these inhibitory effects were mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif of ceacam1  and by recruitment of the phosphatase shp-1, which negatively regulated toll-like receptor 2-dependent activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-oh kinase-akt kinase pathway. our results identify a ceacam1-dependent immune-evasion strategy.

TI  == meningococcal outer membrane protein nhha is essential for colonization and disease by preventing phagocytosis and complement attack.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of meningitis and septicemia worldwide, with a rapid onset of disease and a high morbidity and mortality. nhha is a meningococcal outer membrane protein included in the family of trimeric autotransporter adhesins. the protein binds to the extracellular matrix proteins  heparan sulfate and laminin and facilitates attachment to host epithelial cells.  in this study, we show that nhha is essential for bacterial colonization of the nasopharyngeal mucosa in a murine model of meningococcal disease. successful colonization depends on bacterial attachment but also to the capacity to overcome innate host immune responses. we found that nhha protected bacteria from phagocytosis, which is important for the mucosal survival of bacteria. in addition, nhha mediated extensive serum resistance that increased bacterial survival in blood and promoted lethal sepsis. the presence of nhha protected bacteria from complement-mediated killing by preventing the deposition of the membrane attack complex. taken together, the results of this work reveal that nhha inhibits phagocytosis and protects bacteria against complement-mediated killing, which enhances both nasal colonization and the development of sepsis in  vivo.

TI  == periodontal status of patients with dentin dysplasia type i: report of three cases within a family.
AB  == background: dentin dysplasia type i (ddi) is a rare hereditary disturbance of dentin formation. it is characterized by clinically normal-appearing crowns; obliteration of pulp chambers; and short, blunted and malformed roots that are commonly associated with periodontal attachment loss (pal). in this context, we report three cases within a family with similar clinical and radiographic features of ddi but with differing microbiologic and periodontal conditions. methods: a 42-year-old white female and her two daughters (25 and 10 years of age) presented with a diagnosis of ddi. probing depth (pd), clinical attachment level (cal), visible plaque, and bleeding on probing (bop) were recorded. subgingival biofilm samples were randomly collected and analyzed by checkerboard  dna-dna hybridization. results: the mother presented 34.9% of sites with pd > or  =4 mm, 41.3% of sites with cal > or =4 mm, and 57% of sites with bop; both daughters presented no sites with pd or cal >3 mm and <10% of sites with bop. microbiologic analysis detected gemella morbillorum, neisseria mucosa, and staphylococcus aureus in > or =50% of the mother's samples. the daughters showed  high levels (>10(4) bacterial cells) of some periodontopathic bacteria, including members of the red (porphyromonas gingivalis) and orange (fusobacterium periodonticum and f. nucleatum polymorphum) complexes and beneficial species of the yellow (streptococcus gordonii) and purple (veillonella parvula) complexes. the mother presented high mean levels only for four tested species (n. mucosa, prevotella melaninogenica, treponema denticola, and v. parvula). conclusion: a combination of radiographs, microbiologic analysis, and preventive professional monitoring care is important to avoid pal and to provide oral health in patients  with ddi.

TI  == intranasal immunization of mice with recombinant streptococcus gordonii expressing nada of neisseria meningitidis induces systemic bactericidal antibodies and local iga.
AB  == nada and nhha, two surface proteins of serogroup b neisseria meningitidis identified as candidate vaccine antigens, were expressed on the surface of the human oral commensal bacterium streptococcus gordonii. recombinant strains were used to immunize balb/c mice by the intranasal route and the local and systemic immune response was assessed. mice were inoculated with recombinant bacteria administered alone or with ltr72, a partially inactivated mutant of escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, as a mucosal adjuvant. intranasal immunization with live bacteria expressing nada induced a significant serum antibody response, with a prevalence of the igg2a subclass, bactericidal activity in the sera of 71% of animals, and a nada-specific iga response in nasal and bronchoalveolar lavages. a formalin-inactivated recombinant strain of s. gordonii expressing nada was also administered intranasally, inducing a systemic and mucosal humoral response comparable to that of live bacteria. the administration of recombinant bacteria with the mucosal adjuvant ltr72 stimulated a stronger systemic antibody response, protective in 85% of sera, while did not increase the local iga response. recombinant s. gordonii expressing nhha induced a systemic but not mucosal antibody response. these data support the role of nada as vaccine candidate against serogroup b meningococci, and the use of s. gordonii as vector for intranasal vaccination.

TI  == immunogenetic correlates of neisseria gonorrhoeae infection in adolescents.
AB  == background: understanding host factors modulating immunity to neisseria gonorrhoeae infection may benefit work on vaccine development. methods: we analyzed longitudinal data collected from 485 male and female adolescents to determine genetic correlates of genital gonorrhea. cytokine data from 388 females were analyzed to assess immunologic markers of gonorrhea and their relationship to genetic correlates. results: the t-g haplotype defining interleukin-2 (il-2) gene promoter and intron 1 polymorphisms (-330t and -166g) was more frequently found in individuals who had gonorrhea (relative odds = 3.2, p = 0.01). among 3 endocervical cytokines measured, il-10 and il-12 concentrations were higher and il-2 lower when gonorrhea was detected. the decrease in endocervical il-2 after gonorrhea acquisition was mostly restricted to subjects with the il2 t-g haplotype, which may reflect involvement of a pathogen-specific and genetically mediated mechanism for differential il-2 responses at genital mucosa. in addition, 2 human leukocyte antigen variants (cw*04 and dqb1*05) were also independently associated with gonorrhea (adjusted relative odds = 1.9 and 0.5, respectively; p <0.05 for both). conclusions: confirmation of immunogenetic correlates of gonorrhea in larger cohorts may be useful in guiding further research on both innate and adaptive immune responses to n. gonorrhoeae.

TI  == a microbiological profile of symptomatic teeth with primary endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections associated with symptomatic teeth. samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 symptomatic (n = 30) or asymptomatic (n = 30) single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in symptomatic cases were fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, veillonella parvula, treponema socranskii, enterococcus faecalis, and campylobacter gracilis  and in asymptomatic cases were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, e. faecalis, eubacterium saburreum, and neisseria mucosa. total bacterial counts and counts of tannerella forsythia were significant higher in symptomatic cases (p < 0.05), whereas levels of propionibacterium acnes were reduced in this group of teeth. the data of the present investigation suggested an association between higher total bacterial counts and levels of t. forsythia and the presence of pain.

TI  == distribution of transferrin binding protein b gene (tbpb) variants among neisseria species.
AB  == background: transferrin binding protein b (tbpb), an outer membrane lipoprotein,  is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. two tbpb families have been documented in neisseria meningitidis: an isotype i tbpb gene of 1.8 kb  and an isotype ii tbpb gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated st-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including st-8, st-18, st-32, st-41/44 as well as n. gonorrhoeae isolates. the origin of the isotype i tbpb gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic neisseria and the st-11 clonal complex n. meningitidis isolate fam18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype i tbpb gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic neisseria and st-11 meningococci. as a  result, the diversity of the tbpb gene was investigated in a defined collection of neisseria species. results: two families of isotype i tbpb were identified: family a containing conserved genes belonging to st-11 meningococci, n. polysaccharea and n. lactamica isolates and family b including more diverse isotype i tbpb genes from n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. subflava as well as n. cinerea, n. flavescens and n. polysaccharea isolates. three isotype ii tbpb families were identified with: family c containing diverse tbpb genes belonging to n. polysaccharea, n. lactamica, n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis isolates, family d including another subset of isotype ii tbpb genes from n. lactamica isolates and family e solely composed of n. gonorrhoeae tbpb genes. conclusion: this study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the st-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic neisseria with the origin of the isotype  i tbpb gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between  these two populations.

TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae-induced human defensins 5 and 6 increase hiv infectivity: role in enhanced transmission.
AB  == sexually transmitted infections (stis) increase the likelihood of hiv transmission. defensins are part of the innate mucosal immune response to stis and therefore we investigated their role in hiv infection. we found that human defensins 5 and 6 (hd5 and hd6) promoted hiv infection, and this effect was primarily during viral entry. enhancement was seen with primary viral isolates in primary cd4(+) t cells and the effect was more pronounced with r5 virus compared  with x4 virus. hd5 and hd6 promoted hiv reporter viruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus and murine leukemia virus envelopes, indicating that defensin-mediated enhancement was not dependent on cd4 and coreceptors. enhancement of hiv by hd5 and hd6 was influenced by the structure of the peptides, as loss of the intramolecular cysteine bonds was associated with loss of the hiv-enhancing effect. pro-hd5, the precursor and intracellular form of hd5, also exhibited hiv-enhancing effect. using a cervicovaginal tissue culture system, we found that expression of hd5 and hd6 was induced in response to neisseria gonorrhoeae (gc, for gonococcus) infection and that conditioned medium  from gc-exposed cervicovaginal epithelial cells with elevated levels of hd5 also  enhanced hiv infection. introduction of small interfering rnas for hd5 or hd6 abolished the hiv-enhancing effect mediated by gc. thus, the induction of these defensins in the mucosa in the setting of gc infection could facilitate hiv infection. furthermore, this study demonstrates the complexity of defensins as innate immune mediators in hiv transmission and warrants further investigation of the mechanism by which defensins modulate hiv infection.

TI  == ulcus vulvae acutum in a 13-year-old girl after influenza a infection.
AB  == a 13-year-old otherwise healthy premenarchal girl presented with acute onset of painful vulvar ulcerations. one day before developing vulvar ulcerations, she experienced flu-like symptoms, including a low-grade fever, cough, sore throat, and myalgia. results of a throat swab were positive for influenza a infection (polymerase chain reaction [pcr] assay), and the patient was treated with oseltamivir. the patient's constitutional symptoms improved slightly, but within  2 days after her initial presentation, she returned to her primary care provider  and described 24 hours of dysuria and vulvar swelling. she had a history of herpes labialis (cold sores) and rare episodes of minor oral aphthae (canker sores) that occurred less than twice a year. the patient denied a history of sexual activity, sexual abuse, or physical trauma. physical examination showed ulceration and swelling of the labia minora, and the patient received an empiric  dose of acyclovir (200 mg 4 times daily) for presumed autoinoculated herpes simplex virus (hsv) infection. an ulcer swab was performed, and urinalysis revealed no evidence of infection. two days later, the patient presented to the emergency department with increasing vulvar pain and vaginal discharge. the previous ulcer swab findings were negative for hsv (pcr assay), and consequently, acyclovir was discontinued after 1 day of therapy. she received topical viscous lidocaine and an empiric dose of oral fluconazole. the lidocaine provided temporary symptomatic relief. results of dna amplification studies were negative  for chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. a potassium hydroxide preparation was negative for fungi, and an ulcer swab for bacterial culture revealed usual flora. of note, the pcr assay for epstein-barr virus was not performed on ulcer cells. the patient was referred to the department of dermatology, and results of a physical examination showed copious white mucoid discharge and a 2-cm ulceration of the left labia minora (figure, panel a). two smaller pinpoint ulcerations and swelling of the left labia minora were also noted. the lesions were clinically indistinguishable from the genital aphthous ulcers of patients with complex aphthosis (recurrent, severe aphthous ulcers on oral or genital mucosa). a diagnosis of ulcus vulvae acutum was made, and treatment was started with clobetasol 0.05% ointment (4 times daily) and lidocaine gel as needed. four days later, the patient reported marked symptomatic improvement. physical examination showed near resolution of the large vulvar ulceration (figure, panel b). the patient tapered use of clobetasol ointment over the next several days until the ulcerations healed completely. two months after her initial episode, the patient again had 3 small vulvar erosions after symptoms that included low-grade fever, malaise, and vomiting. she did not receive oseltamivir for this illness; clobetasol ointment was applied 4 times daily, and  the vulvar erosions ameliorated within a few days. her constitutional symptoms resolved without treatment. the patient has not experienced any further episodes  of vulvar ulcerations in the 18 months after the most recent treatment.

TI  == a pneumococcal merr-like regulator and s-nitrosoglutathione reductase are required for systemic virulence.
AB  == a transcriptional regulator, nmlr(sp), has been identified in streptococcus pneumoniae that is required for defense against nitric oxide (no) stress. the nmlr(sp) gene is cotranscribed with adhc, which encodes an alcohol dehydrogenase  that is able to reduce s-nitrosoglutathione (gsno) with nadh as reductant. nmlr(sp) and adhc mutants exhibited a reduced level of nadh-gsno oxidoreductase activity and were more susceptible to killing by no than were wild-type cells. comparison of the virulence of wild-type and mutant strains by use of a mouse model system showed that nmlr(sp) and adhc do not play a key role in the adherence of pneumococci to the nasopharynx in vivo. an intraperitoneal challenge experiment revealed that both nmlr(sp) and adhc were required for survival in blood. these data identify novel components of a no defense system in pneumococci that are required for systemic infection.

TI  == improved accuracy in terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism phylogenetic analysis using a novel internal size standard definition.
AB  == background: terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis is commonly used to analyze microbial communities, including oral microflora. however, accurate identification of terminal restriction fragment (t-rf) origins  is prevented by unpredictable errors in sizing, thus necessitating the clone library analysis. to minimize sizing errors, we proposed optimizing the size definition of internal standards. methods: genescan-1000 rox was regenerated as an internal standard by redefining the fragment sizes in terms of molecular weight (mw) based on their mobility relative to 6-carboxyfluorescein (fam) -labeled restriction fragments derived from the 16s recombinant rna gene of porphyromonas gingivalis. using the new size definition, the average sizing error among eight oral bacteria from six phyla was estimated and compared with that of  the conventional method. microbial communities isolated from saliva were analyzed using the new mw size definition. bacterial species were assigned to peaks using  trfma, a web-based tool for t-rflp analysis, and compared with those identified in a clone library analysis. results: using the new size definition, the average  sizing error for 40 t-rfs was drastically reduced from 2.42 to 0.62 bases, and large sizing errors (more than two bases) were eliminated. more than 90% of the total bacterial clones detected by the clone library analysis were assigned by t-rflp. conclusion: the size definition of the newly constructed internal standards reduced fragment sizing errors and allowed for accurate assignment of bacteria to peaks by the t-rflp analysis. this provided a more effective means for studying microbial communities, including the oral microflora.

AB  == hiv is generally sexually acquired across the genital or rectal mucosa after exposure to the genital secretions of an hiv-infected partner. most exposures to  hiv do not result in infection, likely due to protection afforded by an intact mucosal epithelium, as well as by innate and adaptive mucosal immune factors present in the genital tract. another important mucosal determinant of transmission may be the number and activation status of potential hiv target cells, including ccr5/cd4+ t cells and dc-sign+ dendritic cells. the simultaneous presence of other genital infections, including classical sexually transmitted infections (stis), can enhance hiv susceptibility either by breaching the epithelial barrier, recruiting hiv target cells to the genital tract, or by generating a pro-inflammatory local immune milieu. in hiv-infected individuals, genital co-infections increase hiv levels in the genital secretions, thereby increasing secondary sexual transmission. co-infections that act as important hiv cofactors include human cytomegalovirus (cmv), herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv2), neisseria gonorrhoeae and many others. strategies focused on genital co-infections, such as vaccines, microbicides and suppressive therapy, are feasible in the short term and have the potential to curb the pandemic.

TI  == lessons from meningococcal carriage studies.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis, an obligate commensal of humans, normally colonizes the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract without affecting the host, a phenomenon known as carriage. in europe, as much as 35% of young adults are carriers at a given time. recent studies using molecular methods for clone identification have  demonstrated the extensive genetic diversity of the strains isolated from carriers, in comparison with a limited number of hypervirulent strains associated with invasive disease. published studies and new data generated through the framework of the eu-mennet clearly indicated significant differences in pathogenicity between meningococcal clones and in the distribution of multilocus  sequence types among isolates from asymptomatic carriers among european countries; simultaneous carriage of more than one meningococcal strain in the throat is rare, but occasionally occurs; and the commensal association of particular clones with a host is a long-term relationship, often lasting several  months. further investigations of the carrier state are warranted to improve our  understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of meningococcal disease, as well as to support the introduction and to measure the impact of mass vaccination.

TI  == regulation of th-1 t cell-dominated immunity to neisseria meningitidis within the human mucosa.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is commonly carried asymptomatically in the upper respiratory tract and only occasionally invades the bloodstream and meninges to cause disease. naturally acquired immunity appears protective but the nature of the cellular immune response within the mucosa is uncertain. we show that following in vitro stimulation with n. meningitidis serogroup b (menb) antigens,  approximately 66% of the dividing mucosal cd4(+)cd45ro(+) memory population express the th1-associated il18-r while the remainder express crth2, a th2-associated marker. the pro-inflammatory bias of this anti-menb response is not evident in blood, demonstrating compartmentalization at the induction site; and occurs in the presence or absence of lipopolysacharide indicating that these  responses are already fully committed. depletion of cd25(+) cells reveals suppression of the effector cd4(+) t cell response restricted to the mucosa and most marked in children (i.e. those at greatest risk of disease). mucosal t-regulatory cell (treg) activity is partially overcome by blocking the human glucocorticoid-induced tnf receptor (gitr) and is not seen following stimulation  with antigens from another mucosal pathogen, influenza virus. pro-inflammatory, antimeningococcal t cell responses may limit invasive disease at the mucosa but treg induction while reducing immunopathological damage, may also restrict the effectiveness of the protective response, particularly in children.

TI  == pharyngeal gonorrhea in female sex workers: response to a single 2-g dose of azithromycin.
AB  == objectives: a sharp increase in the incidence of gonorrhea has been observed in tel aviv, israel, since 1999. almost one half of interviewed patients admitted contracting the infection from a sex worker. in two thirds of the cases, oral sex (fellatio) was the most probable route of acquiring the disease. in the current study, we assessed the prevalence of pharyngeal gonorrhea among sex workers in tel aviv and evaluated the efficacy of a single 2-g dose of azithromycin in eradicating the infection. methods: throat specimens were obtained for gonococcal culture from 301 female sex workers practicing in brothels. a questionnaire covering demographic and sexual behavior information was administered to all participants, and a single 2-g dose was administered orally under supervision. women with positive cultures were reexamined a week later for eradication of neisseria gonorrhoeae. results: n gonorrhoeae was isolated from 27 women (9%). the median age of women with pharyngeal gonorrhea was 23 years (range, 18-32 years); 85% were born in former soviet union (mostly russia, ukraine, moldavia).  regular condom use in vaginal sex was reported by 88% of the participants, whereas only 60% reported always using condoms in oral sex. all isolates were susceptible to azithromycin (mic < or = 0.5 microg/ml). gonococci were eradicated in 20/21 individuals (95%). conclusion: a high carriage rate of gonococci in the  throat and a low rate of condom use in oral sex were documented among sex workers in tel aviv. a single 2 g dose of azithromycin was very effective in eradicating  gonococci from the throat.

TI  == variations in gene organization and dna uptake signal sequence in the folp region between commensal and pathogenic neisseria species.
AB  == background: horizontal gene transfer is an important source of genetic variation  among neisseria species and has contributed to the spread of resistance to penicillin and sulfonamide drugs in the pathogen neisseria meningitidis. sulfonamide resistance in neisseria meningitidis is mediated by altered chromosomal folp genes. at least some folp alleles conferring resistance have been horizontally acquired from other species, presumably from commensal neisseriae. in this work, the dna sequence surrounding folp in commensal neisseria species was determined and compared to corresponding regions in pathogenic neisseriae, in order to elucidate the potential for inter-species dna  transfer within this region. results: the upstream region of folp displayed differences in gene order between species, including an insertion of a complete correia element in neisseria lactamica and an inversion of a larger genomic segment in neisseria sicca, neisseria subflava and neisseria mucosa. the latter species also had dna uptake signal sequences (dus) in this region that were one base different from the dus in pathogenic neisseriae. another interesting finding was evidence of a horizontal transfer event from neisseria lactamica or neisseria cinerea that introduced a novel folp allele to the meningococcal population. conclusion: genetic recombination events immediately upstream of folp and horizontal transfer have resulted in sequence differences in the folp region between the neisseria species. this variability could be a consequence of the selective pressure on this region exerted by the use of sulfonamide drugs.

TI  == induction of protective serum meningococcal bactericidal and diphtheria-neutralizing antibodies and mucosal immunoglobulin a in volunteers by  nasal insufflations of the neisseria meningitidis serogroup c polysaccharide-crm197 conjugate vaccine mixed with chitosan.
AB  == thirty-six healthy volunteers received either a single intramuscular injection of neisseria meningitidis serogroup c polysaccharide (mcp)-crm197 conjugate vaccine  in alum or two nasal insufflations 28 days apart of the same vaccine powder, without alum, mixed with chitosan. nasal immunization was well tolerated, with fewer symptoms reported than after intramuscular injection. the geometric mean concentrations of mcp-specific immunoglobulin g (igg) after one nasal immunization were 3.25 microg/ml in naive subjects and 14.4 microg/ml in subjects previously immunized parenterally, compared with 4.30 microg/ml in naive subjects immunized intramuscularly. the geometric mean titer of serum bactericidal antibody (sba) rose 24-fold after two nasal immunizations in naive subjects and was comparable to parenteral immunization (1,080 versus 1,625). all subjects achieved sba titers associated with protection after two nasal immunizations: even those with titers of <8 at entry. a single nasal immunization boosted the sba titer to > or =128 in 96% of previously immunized subjects, and two immunizations achieved this level in 92% of naive subjects. mcp-specific igg levels were approximately 70% igg2 and approximately 20% igg1 after nasal or intramuscular immunization. increases in crm197-specific igg and diphtheria toxin-neutralizing activity were observed after nasal or intramuscular immunization, with balanced igg1/igg2 and higher igg4. significant mcp-specific secretory iga was detected in nasal wash only after nasal immunization and predominantly on the immunized side. simple nasal insufflation of existing mcp-crm197 conjugate vaccines in chitosan offers an inexpensive but effective needle-free prime and boost against serogroup c n. meningitidis and diphtheria.

TI  == cultivable oral microbiota of domestic dogs.
AB  == bacteria were isolated from the dental plaques of nine dogs and a sample of pooled saliva from five other dogs and were then identified by comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing. among 339 isolates, 84 different phylotypes belonging to 37 genera were identified. approximately half of the phylotypes were identified to the species level, and 28% of these were considered members of the indigenous oral microbiota of humans. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the remaining 44 phylotypes were not represented in genbank, and most of these phylotypes were tentatively identified as candidate new species. the genera most frequently isolated from saliva were actinomyces (26%), streptococcus (18%), and granulicatella (17%). the genera most frequently isolated from plaque were porphyromonas (20%), actinomyces (12%), and neisseria (10%). a comparison of the  dna sequences from this study with sequences of the human microbiota available in genbank showed that, on average, canine and human microbiotas differed by almost  7% in the 16s rrna gene. in conclusion, this study has shown that the cultivable  oral microbiotas of dogs and humans show significant differences.

TI  == peritonitis due to neisseria mucosa in an adolescent receiving peritoneal dialysis.
AB  == neisseria mucosa is part of the normal nasopharyngeal flora and rarely pathogenic in humans. reports of serious infections associated with this pathogen are very unusual. a 17-year-old boy with end-stage renal disease due to iga nephropathy presented with acute, spontaneous, symptomatic peritoneal dialysis-associated peritonitis without reported break in sterility or pd catheter exit site infection. beta-lactamase-negative n. mucosa was isolated from the dialysate effluent. intraperitoneal antibiotic treatment with cephalothin/gentamicin for 5  days and subsequent ceftriaxone led to complete resolution of the infection. this case demonstrates that "non-pathogenic" neisseria species can cause clinically severe peritonitis with high intraperitoneal neutrophil counts, elevated c-reactive protein levels in the peritoneal effluent (in the presented case, 27,600/mul and 3.6 mg/l, respectively) and impaired peritoneal membrane transport function. to our knowledge, this is the first case of n. mucosa peritonitis complicating chronic peritoneal dialysis in an adolescent patient.

TI  == ceacam engagement by human pathogens enhances cell adhesion and counteracts bacteria-induced detachment of epithelial cells.
AB  == exfoliation, which is the detachment of infected epithelial cells, is an innate defense mechanism to prevent bacterial colonization. indeed, infection with neisseria gonorrhoeae induced epithelial detachment from an extracellular matrix  (ecm) substrate in vitro. surprisingly, variants of n. gonorrhoeae that bind to human carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (ceacams) failed to induce detachment and, instead, promoted enhanced host cell adhesion to the ecm. microarray analysis revealed that ceacam engagement by several human pathogens triggers expression of cd105. blockage of cd105 expression by antisense oligonucleotides abolished infection-induced cell adhesion. the expression of full-length cd105 promoted cell adhesion to the ecm and was sufficient to prevent infection-induced detachment. the cd105-mediated increase in cell adhesion was dependent on the presence and function of integrin beta1. cd105 expression did not elevate cellular integrin levels but caused a dramatic increase in the ecm-binding capacity of the cells, suggesting that cd105 affects integrin activity. the exploitation of ceacams to trigger cd105 expression and to counteract infection-induced cell detachment represents an intriguing adaptation  of pathogens that are specialized to colonize the human mucosa.

TI  == neisseria meningitidis lactate permease is required for nasopharyngeal colonization.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a human specific pathogen that is part of the normal nasopharyngeal flora. little is known about the metabolic constraints on survival of the meningococcus during colonization of the upper airways. here we show that  glucose and lactate, both carbon energy sources for meningococcal growth, are present in millimolar concentrations within nasopharyngeal tissue. we used a mutant defective for the uptake of lactate (c311deltalctp) to investigate the contribution of this energy source during colonization. explants of nasopharyngeal tissue were inoculated with the wild-type strain (c311) and c311deltalctp; the mutant was recovered at significantly lower levels (p = 0.01)  than c311 18 h later. this defect was not due to changes in the expression of adhesins or initial adhesion in c311deltalctp to epithelial cells. instead, lactate appears to be important energy source for the bacterium during colonization and is necessary for growth of the bacterium in nasopharyngeal tissue. studies with other strains defective for the uptake of specific nutrients should provide valuable information about the environment in which n. meningitidis persists during carriage.

TI  == nitric oxide detoxification systems enhance survival of neisseria meningitidis in human macrophages and in nasopharyngeal mucosa.
AB  == nitric oxide (no) contributes to mammalian host defense by direct microbicidal activity and as a signaling molecule of innate immune responses. macrophages produce no via the inducible no synthase (inos). the genome of neisseria meningitidis includes two genes, norb (encoding nitric oxide reductase) and cycp  (encoding cytochrome c'), both of which detoxify no in pure cultures of n. meningitidis. we show here that norb, and to a lesser extent cycp, enhance survival of n. meningitidis within primary human macrophages. furthermore, accumulation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (lamp-1) is modified in phagosomes containing an isogenic norb mutant of n. meningitidis compared to the  wild type. the survival enhancement conferred by norb and cycp is ablated by pretreatment of macrophages with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor n(g)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-nmma). despite this evidence that no detoxification confers advantage, we find, using a highly sensitive chemiluminescence technique, that human macrophage-associated [no] is low even after activation by lipopolysaccharide and interferon alpha. furthermore, wild-type n. meningitidis further depletes cell-associated no during phagocytosis by an active mechanism and survives relatively poorly in the presence of l-nmma, suggesting that the wild-type organism may utilize no for optimal survival during intracellular life. the natural habitat of n. meningitidis is the human nasopharynx. using a nasopharyngeal mucosa organ culture system, we show that mutants lacking norb and cycp also survive poorly in nasopharyngeal tissue compared to wild-type n. meningitidis. these findings indicate that the meningococcus requires active no detoxification systems for optimal survival during experimental nasopharyngeal colonization and processing by human phagocytic cells.

TI  == the n. gonorrhoeae type iv pilus stimulates mechanosensitive pathways and cytoprotection through a pilt-dependent mechanism.
AB  == the neisseria gonorrhoeae type iv pilus is a retractile appendage that can generate forces near 100 pn. we tested the hypothesis that type iv pilus retraction influences epithelial cell gene expression by exerting tension on the  host membrane. wild-type and retraction-defective bacteria altered the expression of an identical set of epithelial cell genes during attachment. interestingly, pilus retraction, per se, did not regulate novel gene expression but, rather, enhanced the expression of a subset of the infection-regulated genes. this is accomplished through mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and at least one other undefined stress-activated pathway. these results can be reproduced by applying artificial force on the epithelial membrane, using a magnet and magnetic beads. importantly, this retraction-mediated signaling increases the ability of the cell to withstand apoptotic signals triggered by infection. we conclude that  pilus retraction stimulates mechanosensitive pathways that enhance the expression of stress-responsive genes and activate cytoprotective signaling. a model for the role of pilus retraction in influencing host cell survival is presented.

TI  == carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (ceacam)-binding recombinant polypeptide confers protection against infection by respiratory and urogenital pathogens.
AB  == the human-specific pathogens neisseria meningitidis, n. gonorrhoea, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis share the property of targeting the carcinoembryonic antigen (cea)-related cell adhesion molecules (ceacams) expressed on human epithelia. ceacams are signalling receptors implicated in cell adhesion and regulation of several physiological functions. their targeting by pathogens can lead to tissue invasion. although the ceacam-binding ligands of the bacteria are structurally diverse, they target a common site on the receptor. we  have generated a recombinant polypeptide that blocks the interactions of the mucosal pathogens with human epithelial cells and antibodies against it inhibit m. catarrhalis interactions with the receptor. as such, it is a potential antimicrobial agent to prevent infection via a strategy unlikely to promote bacterial resistance and a vaccine candidate against m. catarrhalis. in addition, it could serve more widely as a novel research tool and as a potential therapeutic agent in ceacam-based physiological disorders.

AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

AB  == background: most clinical studies assume that the subgingival microbiota is similar from one geographic location to another. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the composition of the subgingival microbiota in chronic periodontitis subjects from four countries. method: subjects with chronic periodontitis (n, sweden=101; usa=115; brazil=58; chile=26) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bleeding on probing (bop), suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) at six sites per  tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples=6036). % dna probe counts comprised by each species was determined for each site and averaged across sites  in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species among countries was determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status. p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in the four countries. thirteen species differed significantly in adjusted mean proportions among countries even after adjusting for multiple comparisons. porphyromonas gingivalis, one species that differed in proportions among countries, comprised adjusted means of 7.5, 11.9, 1.6 and 6.6% of the microbiota  in subjects from brazil, chile, sweden and usa (p<0.001), while mean proportions  of treponema denticola were 6.7, 4.2, 0.8 and 2.3, respectively (p<0.001). in contrast, a key periodontal pathogen, tannerella forsythensis, exhibited mean proportions ranging from 6.2-8.5% and did not differ significantly among countries. besides these species, prominent species in brazil were actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 (8.4%, 7.2%) and prevotella intermedia (6.5%); in  chile, prevotella melaninogenica (6.4%) and neisseria mucosa (5.3%); in sweden a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (8.4%), capnocytophaga gingivalis (7.1%) and peptostreptococcus micros (5.0%); in usa a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (7.5%), p. intermedia (6.8%) and c. gingivalis (6.1%). conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from chronic periodontitis subjects in four countries showed surprisingly marked differences. these differences persisted after adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking status.

TI  == [piercing and tattoos in patients with congenital heart disease -- is it a problem?].
AB  == piercing and tattooing enjoy widespread popularity in modern society. patients with congenital heart disease are at elevated risk for infective endocarditis. however, it is not yet known whether piercing and tattooing are dangerous for these patients.a search of the literature provided 10 published cases of infective endocarditis after piercing or tattooing. affected patients were adolescents or young adults ranging in age from 13 to 30 years (5 male, 5 female). four of the patients had a known cardiac risk factor for endocarditis (bicuspid aortic valve, postoperative trans-position of the great arteries, postoperative coarctation, postoperative aortic valve stenosis). piercing preceded endocarditis in 9 cases (4 times mouth, 2 ear, 1 nose, 1 breast, 1 navel), one tattoo. the following agents were isolated: s. aureus in 4 cases, 2 s. epidermidis, 1 str. viridans, 1 neisseria mucosa, 1 haemophilus aphrophilus, 1 haemophilus parainfluenzae. all patients were treated with antibiotics. six patients underwent cardiac surgery (5 of them valve replacement). patients with congenital heart disease constitute less than 1% of the population. thus, they are clearly overrepresented in the published literature. epidemiologic conclusions are not possible from these data. however, patients with congenital heart disease and their parents should be strongly advised against piercing and tattooing with regard to the risk of infective endocarditis.

TI  == streptococcal gingivitis: a report of case with a description of a unique gingival prosthesis.
AB  == acute streptococcal gingivitis is an acute inflammation of the oral mucosa. specific bacterial infections of the gingiva may be due to neisseria gonorrhea, treponema pallidum, streptococci, and other organisms. streptococcal infections are seen rarely. this case report describes a patient who presented with severe gingival inflammation and pain that was diagnosed as an acute streptococcal infection. bacterial cultures were obtained from the lesion, and biopsies were obtained from the gingiva of lower incisors for histopathologic evaluation. the patient was successfully treated using conventional periodontal therapy (scaling, root planning, curettage) and antibacterial agents. the reconstructive phase for  this patient consisted of the fabrication of a heat-cured acrylic gingival facade to mask the gingival recession. the treatment of acute gingivostomatitis is of importance because of the possibility of systemic secondary infections. when esthetics is important, a gingival prostheses can be considered. the differential diagnosis, etiology, and treatment of acute streptococcal gingivitis are discussed and the literature is reviewed in this report.

TI  == preclinical study of influenza virus a m2 peptide conjugate vaccines in mice, ferrets, and rhesus monkeys.
AB  == a universal influenza virus vaccine that does not require frequent updates and/or annual immunizations will offer significant advantages over current seasonal flu  vaccines. the highly conserved influenza virus a m2 membrane protein has been previously suggested as a potential antigen target for such a vaccine. here, we report systematic evaluation of m2 peptide conjugate vaccines (synthetic peptides of m2 extracellular domain conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (klh) or neisseria meningitidis outer membrane protein complex (ompc)) in mice, ferrets, and rhesus monkeys. the conjugate vaccines were highly immunogenic in all species tested and were able to confer both protection against lethal challenge of either h1n1 or h3n1 virus in mice and reduce viral shedding in the lower respiratory tracts of mice and ferrets. the protection against lethal challenge in mice could also be achieved by passive transfer of monkey sera containing high m2 antibody titers. in addition, we showed that m2 antisera were cross reactive with m2 peptides derived from a wide range of human influenza a strains, but they failed  to react with m2 peptides of the pathogenic h5n1 virus (a/hong kong/97). the data presented here will permit better understanding of the potential of an m2-based vaccine approach.

TI  == unique modifications with phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine define alternate antigenic forms of neisseria gonorrhoeae type iv pili.
AB  == several major bacterial pathogens and related commensal species colonizing the human mucosa express phosphocholine (pc) at their cell surfaces. pc appears to impact host-microbe biology by serving as a ligand for both c-reactive protein and the receptor for platelet-activating factor. type iv pili of neisseria gonorrhoeae (ng) and neisseria meningitidis, filamentous protein structures critical to the colonization of their human hosts, are known to react variably with monoclonal antibodies recognizing a pc epitope. however, the structural basis for this reactivity has remained elusive. to address this matter, we exploited the finding that the pile pilin subunit in ng mutants lacking the pilv  protein acquired the pc epitope independent of changes in pilin primary structure. specifically, we show by using mass spectrometry that pile derived from the pilv background is composed of a mixture of subunits bearing o-linked forms of either phosphoethanolamine (pe) or pc at the same residue, whereas the wild-type background carries only pe at that same site. therefore, pilv can influence pilin structure and antigenicity by modulating the incorporation of these alternative modifications. the disaccharide covalently linked to ng pilin was also characterized because it is present on the same peptides bearing the pe  and pc modifications and, contrary to previous reports, was found to be linked by means of 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyhexose. taken together, these findings provide new insights into ng type iv pilus structure and antigenicity and resolve long-standing issues regarding the nature of both the pc epitope and the pilin glycan.

TI  == protozoan predation, diversifying selection, and the evolution of antigenic diversity in salmonella.
AB  == extensive population-level genetic variability at the salmonella rfb locus, which encodes enzymes responsible for synthesis of the o-antigen polysaccharide, is thought to have arisen through frequency-dependent selection (fds) by means of exposure of this pathogen to host immune systems. the fds hypothesis works well for pathogens such as haemophilus influenzae and neisseria meningitis, which alter the composition of their o-antigens during the course of bloodborne infections. in contrast, salmonella remains resident in epithelial cells or macrophages during infection and does not have phase variability in its o-antigen. more importantly, salmonella shows host-serovar specificity, whereby strains bearing certain o-antigens cause disease primarily in specific hosts; this behavior is inconsistent with fds providing selection for the origin or maintenance of extensive polymorphism at the rfb locus. alternatively, selective  pressure may originate from the host intestinal environment itself, wherein diversifying selection mediated by protozoan predation allows for the continued existence of salmonella able to avoid consumption by host-specific protozoa. this selective pressure would result in high population-level diversity at the salmonella rfb locus without phase variation. we show here that intestinal protozoa recognize antigenically diverse salmonella with different efficiencies and demonstrate that differences solely in the o-antigen are sufficient to allow  for prey discrimination. combined with observations of the differential distributions of both serotypes of bacterial species and their protozoan predators among environments, our data provides a framework for the evolution of  high genetic diversity at the rfb locus and host-specific pathogenicity in salmonella.

TI  == high correlation between the bacterial species in denture plaque and pharyngeal microflora.
AB  == objectives: the morbidity and mortality of the dependent elderly that result from aspiration pneumonia are recognized as a major geriatric health problem. most cases of bacterial pneumonia are initiated following colonization or superinfection of the pharynx by pathogenic bacteria, followed by aspiration of pharyngeal contents. a recent study revealed that bacteria, that commonly cause respiratory infection, colonized the dentures of dependent elderly. this suggests that denture plaque may function as a reservoir of potential respiratory pathogens to facilitate colonization on the pharynx. the purpose of this study was to determine the possible correlation between denture and pharyngeal microflora. study design: the denture and pharyngeal bacterial flora of 50 dependent elderly were examined, and the microorganisms identified by culturing.  the agreement between the bacterial species in denture plaque and pharyngeal microflora was investigated using the kappa method. results: the microorganism species on the dentures and pharyngeal mucosa of the subjects had an agreement rate of 68.5%. the agreement rate for each of the bacterial species of the dentures and pharynx was also demonstrated to be high. conclusions: dentures should be considered an important reservoir of organisations which could colonise the pharynx, and the importance of controlling denture plaque for the prevention  of aspiration pneumonia cannot be overemphasized.

TI  == bacterial pathogenesis: exploiting cellular adherence.
AB  == cell adhesion molecules, such as integrins, cadherins, the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules and selectins, play important structural roles and are involved in various signal transduction processes. as an initial step in the infectious process, many bacterial pathogens adhere to cell adhesion  molecules as a means of exploiting the underlying signaling pathways, entering into host cells or establishing extracellular persistence. often, bacteria are able to bind to cell adhesion molecules by mimicking or acting in place of host cell receptors or their ligands. recent studies have contributed to our understanding of bacterial adherence mechanisms and the consequences of receptor  engagement; they have also highlighted alternative functions of cell adhesion molecules.

TI  == cd46 in meningococcal disease.
AB  == the human-specific bacterial pathogen neisseria meningitidis is a major cause of  sepsis and/or meningitis. the pili of n. meningitidis interact with cd46, a human cell-surface protein involved in regulation of complement activation. transgenic  mice expressing human cd46 were susceptible to meningococcal disease, because bacteria crossed the blood-brain barrier in these mice. development of disease was more efficient with piliated bacteria after intranasal, but not intraperitoneal, challenge of cd46 transgenic mice, suggesting that human cd46 facilitates pilus-dependent interactions at the epithelial mucosa. hence, the human cd46 transgenic mice model is a potentially useful tool for studying pathogenesis and for vaccine development against meningococcal disease.

AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

TI  == opposing selective forces for expression of the gonococcal lactoferrin receptor.
AB  == all isolates of neisseria gonorrhoeae express receptors that bind human transferrin (tf). although lactoferrin (lf) is abundant on mucosa and in purulent exudates, many gonococci do not express an lf receptor. the naturally occurring lf receptor deletion mutant fa1090 (lbpb-lbpa-) is infectious, but a tf receptor  mutant of fa1090 is unable to infect male volunteers [cornelissen, c.n., kelley,  m., hobbs, m.m., anderson, j.e., cannon, j.g., cohen, m.s., and sparling, p.f. (1998) mol microbiol 27: 611-616]. here, we report that expression of an lf receptor in the absence of the tf receptor was sufficient for infection, and that expression of both lf and tf receptors resulted in a competitive advantage over a strain that made only the tf receptor in mixed infection of male volunteers. we confirmed that nearly 50% of clinical isolates do not make an lf receptor. surprisingly, about half of geographically diverse lf - isolates representing many different auxotypes and porin serovars carried an identical lbpb lbpa deletion. among lf+ strains, all produced the integral outer membrane protein lbpa, but 70% did not express the lipoprotein lbpb. thus, there are apparently selective pressures for expression of the lf receptor in the male urethra that are balanced by others against expression of the lf receptor in niches other than the male urethra.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == the innate and early immune response to pathogen challenge in the female genital  tract and the pivotal role of epithelial cells.
AB  == the female reproductive tract is immunologically unique in its requirement for tolerance to allogeneic sperm and, in the upper tract, to the conceptus. however, it must also be appropriately protected from, and respond to, a diverse array of  sexually transmitted pathogens. some of these infections can be lethal (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus (hiv), human papilloma virus (hpv)), and others (e.g. chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae) can have potentially devastating reproductive sequelae. interactions between a host and a pathogen are complex, diverse and regulated, and are a function of the individual pathogen, and host immunity. although there is undoubtedly commonality in the mucosal immune response, there is also evidence of a degree of site-specificity in immune mechanisms, dependent upon the function and anatomical location of an organ. in this article, we review the evidence on the pivotal role of epithelial cells in the innate and early immune response to pathogen challenge in female genital tract tissues, and examine the evidence that the 'sterile' upper and the 'non-sterile' lower female genital tract may maintain a different immunological surveillance milieu, and may also respond differentially to pathogen challenge. we also review the unique characteristics, and subsequent ramifications of the acute cervical immune response to c. trachomatis, and discuss how natural antimicrobial mediators of immunity may be utilized to decrease the spread of sexually transmitted infections.

TI  == invasion by neisseria meningitidis varies widely between clones and among nasopharyngeal mucosae derived from adult human hosts.
AB  == colonization of the human nasopharynx is a feature of some species of neisseria,  and is a prerequisite of invasive meningococcal disease. the likelihood of colonization by neisseria meningitidis varies widely between humans, and very few develop invasive disease. explants of nasal mucosa derived from adult patients with non-allergic nasal obstruction were infected experimentally with neisseria spp. at intervals over 18 h incubation, washed explants were homogenized, and viable bacteria were counted. to estimate bacterial invasion of mucosa, explants  were exposed to 0.25% sodium taurocholate for 30 s prior to homogenization. n. meningitidis was recovered from the mucosa and the organism invaded and replicated within the tissue, in contrast to n. lactamica and n. animalis (n=9, p<0.008). n. meningitidis isolates of clones et-5, et-37 and lineage iii were recovered from and invaded tissue, but strains of clones a4, a:subgroup i, a:subgroup iii and a:subgroup iv-1 did not invade (n=6). to measure host variation, survival of n. meningitidis within nasal mucosa of 40 different human  donors was measured. intra-class correlation of replicates was 0.97, but the coefficient of variation of recovered viable counts was 1335% after 4 h and 77% after 18 h incubation. it is concluded that the distinctive colonization and disease potential of neisseria spp. may be partly a consequence of their ability  to invade and survive within human nasopharyngeal mucosa, but that this is influenced greatly by genetic or environmental factors operating on the host mucosa. this is consistent with the unpredictable epidemiology of meningococcal disease.

TI  == vdac and the bacterial porin porb of neisseria gonorrhoeae share mitochondrial import pathways.
AB  == the human pathogen neisseria gonorrhoeae induces host cell apoptosis during infection by delivering the outer membrane protein porb to the host cell's mitochondria. porb is a pore-forming beta-barrel protein sharing several features with the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel (vdac), which is involved  in the regulation of apoptosis. here we show that porb of pathogenic neisseria species produced by host cells is efficiently targeted to mitochondria. imported  porb resides in the mitochondrial outer membrane and forms multimers with similar sizes as in the outer bacterial membrane. the mitochondria completely lose their  membrane potential, a characteristic previously observed in cells infected with gonococci or treated with purified porb. closely related bacterial porins of non-pathogenic neisseria mucosa or escherichia coli remain in the cytosol. import of porb into mitochondria in vivo is independent of a linear signal sequence. insertion of porb into the mitochondrial outer membrane in vitro depends on the activity of tom5, tom20 and tom40, but is independent of tom70. our data show that human vdac and bacterial porb are imported into mitochondria by a similar mechanism.

TI  == efficacy and safety of a new vaginal contraceptive antimicrobial formulation containing high molecular weight poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate).
AB  == host cell infection by sexually transmitted disease (std)-causing microbes and fertilization by spermatozoa may have some mechanisms in common. if so, certain noncytotoxic agents could inhibit the functional activity of both organisms. high molecular mass poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (t-pss) may be one of these compounds. t-pss alone (1 mg/ml) or in a gel (2% or 5% t-pss) completely prevented conception in the rabbit. contraception was not due to sperm cytotoxicity or to an effect on sperm migration. however, t-pss inhibited sperm hyaluronidase (ic(50) = 5.3 microg/ml) and acrosin (ic(50) = 0.3 microg/ml) and caused the loss of acrosomes from spermatozoa (85% maximal loss by 0.5 microg/ml). t-pss (5% in gel) also reduced sperm penetration into bovine cervical mucus (73% inhibition by 1 mg gel/ml). t-pss (5% in gel) inhibited human immunodeficiency virus (hiv; ic(50)= 16 microg gel/ml) and herpes simplex viruses (hsv-1 and hsv-2; ic(50) = 1.3 and 1.0 microg gel/ml, respectively). the drug showed high efficacy against a number of clinical isolates and laboratory strains. t-pss (5% in gel) also inhibited neisseria gonorrhea (ic(50) < 1.0 gel/ml) and chlamydia trachomatis (ic(50) = 1.2 microg gel/ml) but had no effect  on lactobacilli. these results imply that t-pss is an effective functional inhibitor of both spermatozoa and certain std-causing microbes. the noncytotoxic  nature should make t-pss safe for vaginal use. t-pss was nonmutagenic in vitro and possessed an acute oral toxicity of >5 g/kg (rat). gel with 10% t-pss did not irritate the skin or penile mucosa (rabbit) and caused no dermal sensitization (guinea pig). vaginal administration of the 5% t-pss gel to the rabbit for 14 consecutive days caused no systemic toxicity and only mild (acceptable) vaginal irritation. t-pss in gel form is worthy of clinical evaluation as a vaginal contraceptive hiv/std preventative.

TI  == specific entry of helicobacter pylori into cultured gastric epithelial cells via  a zipper-like mechanism.
AB  == although helicobacter pylori has generally been considered an extracellular pathogen, a number of in vitro infection experiments and biopsy examinations have shown that it is capable of occasionally entering mammalian host cells. here, we  characterized this entry process by using ags cells as a host cell model. in gentamicin protection-invasion assays, the number of h. pylori colonies recovered was lower than that for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium x22, escherichia  coli expressing inva, and yersinia enterocolitica yo:9 grown at 25 degrees c but  higher than that for neisseria gonorrhoeae vp1 and y. enterocolitica yo:9 grown at 37 degrees c. at the ultrastructural level, the entry process was observed to  occur via a zipper-like mechanism. internalized h. pylori was bound in tight lamp-1-containing vacuoles in close association with condensed filamentous actin  and tyrosine phosphorylation signals. wortmannin, a potent inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and calphostin c, an inhibitor of protein kinase c, both inhibited the entry of h. pylori in a sensitive and dose-dependent manner; however, the level of entry was enhanced by sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases and atpases. furthermore, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha antagonized the entry of h. pylori into ags cells. collectively, these results demonstrate that the entry of h. pylori into ags cells occurs via a zipper-like mechanism which involves various host signal transduction events.

AB  == a 66 year old patient presented with a nine month history of recurrent oral ulcerations involving the tongue. we diagnosed chancriform pyoderma and a previously not identified multiple myeloma with secondary immunoglobulin deficiency. clinically and histologically we excluded a necrotizing ulcerative stomatitis as found in individuals with cellular immunodeficiency as in late-stage hiv-infection. on culture only neisseria catarrhalis was found. chancriform pyoderma is often associated with local bacterial infections, especially staphylococcus aureus. the most common sites are the genitalia and periorbital region; involvement of the oral mucosa is uncommon. to the best of our knowledge, this is the fourth reported case with tongue lesions. the multiple myeloma-associated immunoglobulin deficiency might have facilitated the oral manifestations of chancriform pyoderma.

TI  == prevalence and risk indicators for destructive periodontal diseases in 3 urban american minority populations.
AB  == background, aims: destructive periodontal diseases have been reported disproportionately more prevalent and severe in african-americans relative to other american populations. differences in subgingival microbiota and host immune response have also been reported for african-americans, implying that risk factors for disease progression may also differ for these populations. since it is not clear whether these differences are truly genetic or due to confounding variables such as social economic status, we examined a series of clinical, environmental, demographic, and microbiologic features associated with periodontal disease status in a group of 185 urban minority subjects resident within the greater new york metropolitan area. methods: the study population consisted of 56 asian-american, 71 african-american and 58 hispanic subjects. clinical data recorded included pocket depth, attachment level, gingival erythema, bleeding upon probing, suppuration, and the presence of supragingival plaque. environmental and demographic data recorded included smoking history, years resident in the united states, whether the subject reported a private dentist and occupational status. subgingival plaque was sampled from the mesial aspect of all teeth exclusive of third molars and the levels of 40 subgingival species enumerated using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the african-american group had more missing teeth, deeper periodontal pocket depth and more attachment loss than the asian-american or hispanic groups. however, the african-american group were less likely to report having a private dentist, had a greater proportion of smokers and a greater proportion of unskilled individuals.  the profile of subgingival species differed among the three ethnic/racial groups  with a. actinomycetemcomitans, n. mucosa, s. noxia and t. socranskii significantly elevated in the asian-american group and p. micros significantly elevated in the african-american group. when subset by occupational status, numbers of missing teeth, pocket depth, attachment level and prior disease activity were all found increased in the unskilled relative to the professional group. local factors including the mean % of sites with plaque, marginal gingival erythema, bleeding upon probing and suppuration were also elevated in the unskilled group. the microbial profile differed among the 3 occupational groups with the unskilled group having elevated numbers of species associated with destructive periodontal diseases. conclusions: although greater destructive periodontal disease prevalence and severity were found in the african-american group, these results suggest that environmental and demographic variables, such as occupational status, may have a greater influence on risk indicators associated with disease prevalence and progression in these populations.

TI  == selenium deficiency is associated with shedding of hiv-1--infected cells in the female genital tract.
AB  == objective: to assess the relation between selenium deficiency and vaginal or cervical shedding of hiv-1-infected cells. design: cross-sectional study of 318 hiv-1 seropositive women in mombasa, kenya. methods: vaginal and cervical swab specimens were tested for the presence of hiv-1 dna by polymerase chain reaction. multivariate logistic regression models, adjusting for cd4 count and vitamin a deficiency, were used. results: selenium deficiency (defined as levels <85 microg/l) was observed in 11% of the study population. in unstratified multivariate analyses, there was no significant association between selenium deficiency and vaginal or cervical shedding. in stratified analyses, however, significant associations became apparent after excluding women with predictors of shedding with strong local effects on the genital tract mucosa. among women who did not use oral contraceptives and who did not have vaginal candidiasis, selenium deficiency was significantly associated with vaginal shedding (adjusted  odds ratio [aor] 2.9, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.0--8.8, p =.05). effect modification was also observed in the relation between selenium deficiency and cervical shedding, with a significant association seen among those women who were not using oral contraceptive pills or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate and who did not have neisseria gonorrhoeae infection (aor 2.8, 95% ci 1.1--7.0, p =.02).  conclusions: we found selenium deficiency to be associated with a nearly threefold higher likelihood of genital mucosal shedding of hiv-1--infected cells, suggesting that deficiency may increase the infectiousness of women with hiv-1. nutritional interventions to prevent hiv-1 transmission warrant investigation.

TI  == diagnostics of neisseriaceae and moraxellaceae by ribosomal dna sequencing: ribosomal differentiation of medical microorganisms.
AB  == fast and reliable identification of microbial isolates is a fundamental goal of clinical microbiology. however, in the case of some fastidious gram-negative bacterial species, classical phenotype identification based on either metabolic,  enzymatic, or serological methods is difficult, time-consuming, and/or inadequate. 16s or 23s ribosomal dna (rdna) bacterial sequencing will most often  result in accurate speciation of isolates. therefore, the objective of this study was to find a hypervariable rdna stretch, flanked by strongly conserved regions,  which is suitable for molecular species identification of members of the neisseriaceae and moraxellaceae. the inter- and intrageneric relationships were investigated using comparative sequence analysis of pcr-amplified partial 16s and 23s rdnas from a total of 94 strains. when compared to the type species of the genera acinetobacter, moraxella, and neisseria, an average of 30 polymorphic positions was observed within the partial 16s rdna investigated (corresponding to escherichia coli positions 54 to 510) for each species and an average of 11 polymorphic positions was observed within the 202 nucleotides of the 23s rdna gene (positions 1400 to 1600). neisseria macacae and neisseria mucosa subsp. mucosa (atcc 19696) had identical 16s and 23s rdna sequences. species clusters were heterogeneous in both genes in the case of acinetobacter lwoffii, moraxella  lacunata, and n. mucosa. neisseria meningitidis isolates failed to cluster only in the 23s rdna subset. our data showed that the 16s rdna region is more suitable than the partial 23s rdna for the molecular diagnosis of neisseriaceae and moraxellaceae and that a reference database should include more than one strain of each species. all sequence chromatograms and taxonomic and disease-related information are available as part of our ribosomal differentiation of medical microorganisms (ridom) web-based service (http://www.ridom.hygiene.uni-wuerzburg.de/). users can submit a sequence and conduct a similarity search against the ridom reference database for microbial identification purposes.

TI  == expression of pathogen-like opa adhesins in commensal neisseria: genetic and functional analysis.
AB  == several species of commensal neisseriae (cn) may colonize the human nasopharynx,  but little is known about their adhesion mechanisms. we have investigated structural and functional similarities between adhesins of cn and of neisseria meningitidis (nm), also a frequent colonizer of the nasopharynx. in this study, we demonstrate the expression of opa-like proteins in nine strains of cn. phylogenetic analysis segregated the majority of the cn opa in a cluster separated from the pathogenic cluster with a few exceptions. one opa, which located within the pathogenic cluster, was strikingly similar (74%) to an opa of  a neisseria gonorrhoeae (ng) strain and, like ng, it lacked the extra y11 or the  136dkf138 triplet insert, which are conserved among many n. meningitidis opa proteins. most importantly, the majority of the cn opa proteins were able to interact with human ceacam1 (cd66a) molecules, previously identified as receptors for pathogenic opa proteins. by the use of ceacam1 n-domain mutants, we demonstrate that cn opa target the same region of the n-domain of the receptor as that used by nm. furthermore, cn strains bound to cell-expressed human ceacam1. in competition assays, adherent cn strain c450, exhibiting high affinity for ceacam1, was not displaced by a nm isolate and vice versa. but in simultaneous incubation, nm out-competed the cn strain. this is the first study to demonstrate the expression of adhesins in cn that are structurally and functionally closely related to pathogenic adhesins. the studies imply that some cn have the potential to occupy and thus compete with the pathogens for receptors on human mucosa, their common and exclusive niche.

TI  == experimental nasopharyngeal colonization by neisseria meningitidis using explant  organ culture.
AB  == this chapter will describe the use of organ cultures of human nasopharyngeal mucosa to study the interaction of neisseria meningitidis with this complex tissue. colonization of nasopharyngeal mucosa is the first step in the pathogenesis of meningococcal disease. supporting evidence for this is the correlation between the prevalence of community carriage and the occurrence of meningococcal disease (1). during nonepidemic periods, the baseline prevalence of nasopharyngeal carriage of meningococci is 5-10% but is considerably higher in certain populations such as military personnel (2), and in households of cases (3). there are a number of influences on the acquisition of meningococcal carriage; these include smoking (4) but not season (5). it is possible that coincident viral infections may affect acquisition of meningococ cal carriage (6,7). there is good evidence that genetic factors are involved, as some individuals appear resistant to acquisition of carriage, while others chronically or intermittently carry n. meningitidis (8). carriage of the organism also appears to be associated with secretor status (9). the precise site within the nasopharynx that neisseria meningitidis colonizes and invades is not known. however, during natural carriage, the organism can be isolated both from the rhinopharynx and from the throat (10).

TI  == molecular recognition mechanisms of meningococci : identifying receptor-ligand pairs involved in microbe-host interactions.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis is a human specific pathogen and resides primarily in the  nasopharynx of its host. the molecular-recognition mechanisms that operate at the host-microbe interface to impart such precise host/tissue specificity are not fully defined. given the host muco-cilliary clearance mechanisms, an obvious prerequisite for colonization is the ability of bacteria to make firm and rapid contact with the nasopharyngeal mucosa. the specificity for the niche indicates that one or more meningococcal adhesins have evolved an exquisite level of affinity for particular target molecules. they also exhibit considerable structural and phase modulations that aid in immune evasion. these properties have been exploited to derive distinct phenotypes for investigations on the mechanisms of adhesion. the in vitro investigations that use cell cultures of human origin or "humanized" cells (created by transfection of animal cells with human dna) have identified a number of receptors targeted by meningococci. detailed examination of the molecular mechanisms of bacterial ligation with the receptors will clarify the basis of tissue specificity and tropism and provide information that may lead to novel strategies to control the disease. we will describe some of the methods we have implemented over the years for such investigations.

AB  == the colonization due to neisseria spp. in the nasopharynx of forty healthy adults was studied by using a selective medium that allows the differentiation of neisseria species and inhibits the rest of pharyngeal microbiota. the medium detected a variety of colonial morphology types and some metabolic characteristics of the isolates. we demonstrated the multicolonization by several neisseria spp. in the same individual, and we isolated several strains of the same species, after analysis by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) patterns  obtained from the different colonial types previously identified as the same species. the forty adults studied were colonized by 112 forms of neisseria spp.,  and twelve colonization patterns were obtained: one species (45%), two (45%), three (7.5%) and four (2.5%). n. perflava-n. sicca, either alone or in combination with other species was the most frequent isolate (92.5%). the analysis of pfge patterns obtained from different colonial types revealed the multicolonization by several strains of the same species in some individuals. this fact was found in n. perflava-n. sicca (50%) and n. mucosa (2.5%).

TI  == effect of alpha-oligosaccharide phenotype of neisseria gonorrhoeae strain ms11 on invasion of chang conjunctival, hec-1-b endometrial, and me-180 cervical cells.
AB  == the genes encoding the glycosyltransferases responsible for the addition of the five sugars in the alpha-oligosaccharide (alpha-os) moiety of lipooligosaccharide (los) have been identified. disruption of these glycosyltransferase genes singly  or in combination results in corresponding truncations in los. in the present work we show that sequential deletion of the terminal four sugar residues of gonococcal alpha-os had no discernible effect on the invasion of human conjunctival, endometrial, and cervical cell lines. however, deletion of the proximal glucose, which resulted in the complete deletion of alpha-os, significantly impaired invasion of the gonococci into all three cell lines. the effect of deleting alpha-os on invasion was independent of and additive to the known invasion-promoting factor opaa. these data suggest that the proximal glucose residue of the alpha-os chain of los is required for efficient invasion of gonococci into host mucosa.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == do pathogenic neisseriae need several ways to modify the host cell cytoskeleton?
AB  == neisseria meningitidis and neisseria gonorrhoeae are human pathogens which have to interact with mucosa and/or cellular barriers for their life cycle. even though they both give rise to dramatically different diseases, most of the mechanisms mediating cellular interactions are common to n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae. this suggests that bacterial cell interactions may be essential not  only for pathogenesis but also for other aspects of the bacterial life cycle that are common to both n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae. opacity proteins and pili  are two major components identified as transducing signals to host cells, thus leading to cytoskeleton modifications. this manuscript will review the recent developments concerning the mechanisms mediating cellular interactions of pathogenic neisseria and will tentatively put them into the perspective of pathogenesis and bacterial life cycle.

AB  == the mef gene, originally described for gram-positive organisms and coding for an  efflux pump, has been identified in clinical isolates of acinetobacter junii and  neisseria gonorrhoeae. these strains could transfer the mef gene at frequencies ranging from 10(-6) to 10(-9) into one or more of the following recipients: gram-negative moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria perflava/sicca and neisseria mucosa and gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. three streptococcus pneumoniae strains could transfer the mef gene into eikenella corrodens, haemophilus influenzae, kingella denitrificans, m. catarrhalis, neisseria meningitidis, n. perflava/sicca, and n. mucosa at similar frequencies. the mef gene can thus be transferred to and expressed in a variety of gram-negative recipients.

TI  == carcinoembryonic antigens are targeted by diverse strains of typable and non-typable haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae (hi), a commensal of the human respiratory mucosa, is an important cause of localized and systemic infections. we show that distinct strains belonging to typable (thi) and non-typable (nthi) h. influenzae target human carcinoembryonic antigens (the membrane associated cea family of cell adhesion molecules, are now termed ceacams). all strains of h. influenzae biogroup aegyptius (hi-aeg) and more than 70% of thi and nthi strains tested specifically recognize ceacami-fc soluble constructs. furthermore, transfection of chinese hamster ovary cells with human ceacam1 cdna alone was sufficient for promoting hi interactions with the transfected cells. the majority of the hi-aeg  strains tested interacted with soluble constructs containing only the n-terminal  domain. in contrast, several thi and nthi strains reacted with soluble constructs only when additional extracellular a and b domains of the receptor were present.  the use of monoclonal antibodies confirmed that thi and nthi strains also interact primarily at the n-domain. we used site-directed mutants of ceacam1 that contained substitutions at surface exposed amino acids and a molecular model of the n-domain to identify the residues involved in interactions with hi ligands. the studies show that a common region exposed at the cfg face of the molecule is  targeted by diverse hi strains. however, mutation at distinct sites within this area affected the interactions of distinct strains signifying the potential for tissue tropism via this receptor. analyses of the molecular basis of interaction  with human cell lines and purified cea show that hi strains, especially those belonging to hi-aeg, interact with multiple ceacams. because neisseria meningitidis (nm) strains are also known to bind at the cfg face of the receptor, we used nm and hi strains in co-infection experiments and demonstrate competition between these mucosal pathogens in colonization of target cells via ceacams.

AB  == diverse organisms ranging from escherichia coli to humans contain a variety of dna repair proteins that function in the removal of damage caused by shortwave uv light. this study reports the identification, purification, and biochemical characterization of two dna glycosylases with associated abasic lyase activity from neisseria mucosa. these enzymes, pyrimidine dimer glycosylase i and ii (nmu-pdg i and nmu-pdg ii), were purified 30,000- and 10,000-fold, respectively.  sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that nmu-pdg i is approximately 30 kda, whereas nmu-pdg ii is approximately 19 kda. the n-terminal  amino acid sequence of nmu-pdg ii exhibits 64 and 66% identity with e. coli and hemophilus parainfluenzae endonuclease iii, respectively. both nmu-pdg i and nmu-pdg ii were found to have broad substrate specificities, as evidenced by their ability to incise dna containing many types of uv and some types of oxidative damage. consistent with other glycosylase/abasic lyases, the existence  of a covalent enzyme-dna complex could be demonstrated for both nmu-pdg i and ii  when reactions were carried out in the presence of sodium borohydride. these data indicate the involvement of an amino group in the catalytic reaction mechanism of both enzymes.

TI  == phosphorylcholine decoration of lipopolysaccharide differentiates commensal neisseriae from pathogenic strains: identification of lica-type genes in commensal neisseriae.
AB  == phosphorylcholine (chop) is a potential candidate for a plurispecific vaccine, because it is present on surface components of many mucosal organisms, including  haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition, chop has been detected on pili of neisseria meningitidis and neisseria  gonorrhoeae. in this study, we demonstrate the presence of the phosphorylcholine  epitope on the lipopolysaccharides (lpss) of several species of commensal neisseriae (cn), a property that differentiates commensal from the pathogenic strains of neisseriae. in an extended survey of 78 strains, we confirmed the exclusive expression of the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. despite the presence of pili on cn, which are homologous to class ii pili of n. meningitidis, they did not react with anti-chop antibody. this observation was further supported by the fact that 14c-labelled choline was incorporated only in  the lpss of cn. analysis of the lps of n. lactamica strain nl4 revealed two distinct and interconvertible molecular species of lps with high and low levels of reactivity with anti-chop antibody. in addition, on/off phase variation gave rise to frequent modulation in the levels of antibody reactivity. a concurrent modulation was also observed in the binding of c-reactive protein, crp, a chop-binding reactant that is implicated in bacterial clearance. genetic analysis showed the presence of a gene in several cn spp. with significant sequence identity to h. influenzae lica. this gene encodes choline kinase and is also involved in phase variation of the lps-associated chop in h. influenzae. in contrast, lica-like genes were not identified in the pathogenic neisseria strains tested. they are absent from n. meningitidis strain z2491 genome database. these  data suggest that the genetic basis for chop incorporation in cn lps resembles that in h. influenzae spp. and may be distinct from that generating the chop epitope on pili of pathogenic neisseriae. further, the modulation of chop expression on cn lps, and corresponding modulation of crp binding, has the potential to confer the property of immune avoidance and thus of persistence on mucosa.

TI  == hydrogels containing monocaprin prevent intravaginal and intracutaneous infections with hsv-2 in mice: impact on the search for vaginal microbicides.
AB  == hydrogel formulations containing the 1-monoglyceride of capric acid (monocaprin)  possess potent in vitro microbicidal activity against hiv and hsv, chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. these formulations were studied to determine whether they prevent intracutaneous and intravaginal infections of mice with hsv-2, a virus that is in vitro as sensitive to the virucidal action of the  compound as is hiv. in mice intravaginal infection with hsv-2 and the associated  mortality was prevented completely when the infection was carried out in the presence of a 20 mm monocaprin containing gel formulation. similarly, virtually complete protection of lesion development and associated mortality was observed when mice were infected intracutaneously with hsv-2 in the presence of gels containing 10 or 20 mm monocaprin. no irritation or toxicity was observed following application of the gel to the skin or the vaginal mucosa. hydrogel formulations of monocaprin could thus be pursued as vaginal microbicides for the  prevention of sexual transmission of hsv, hiv and other infectious pathogens.

TI  == inactivated meningococci and pertussis bacteria are immunogenic and act as mucosal adjuvants for a nasal inactivated influenza virus vaccine.

AB  == a whole-cell pertussis vaccine, each dose consisting of 250 microg of protein, was given intranasally four times at weekly intervals to six adult volunteers. all vaccinees responded with increases in nasal fluid iga antibodies to bordetella pertussis whole-cell antigen. three vaccinees with high nasal antibody responses also developed increased serum iga and igg antibodies to this antigen.  salivary antibody responses to the whole-cell antigen, as well as antibodies in serum and secretions to pertussis toxin (pt) and filamentous haemagglutinin (fha) were negligible, except for a moderate increase in nasal fluid antibodies to fha. unexpectedly, the same vaccinees developed significant rises in nasal and salivary iga antibodies to meningococcal outer-membrane antigens, whereas corresponding serum iga and igg antibodies were unchanged. thus it appears that mucosal immunisation may induce secretory antibodies with broader specificities than can be found in serum.

TI  == update on meningococcal disease with emphasis on pathogenesis and clinical management.
AB  == the only natural reservoir of neisseria meningitidis is the human nasopharyngeal  mucosa. depending on age, climate, country, socioeconomic status, and other factors, approximately 10% of the human population harbors meningococci in the nose. however, invasive disease is relatively rare, as it occurs only when the following conditions are fulfilled: (i) contact with a virulent strain, (ii) colonization by that strain, (iii) penetration of the bacterium through the mucosa, and (iv) survival and eventually outgrowth of the meningococcus in the bloodstream. when the meningococcus has reached the bloodstream and specific antibodies are absent, as is the case for young children or after introduction of a new strain in a population, the ultimate outgrowth depends on the efficacy of the innate immune response. massive outgrowth leads within 12 h to fulminant meningococcal sepsis (fms), characterized by high intravascular concentrations of endotoxin that set free high concentrations of proinflammatory mediators. these mediators belonging to the complement system, the contact system, the fibrinolytic system, and the cytokine system induce shock and diffuse intravascular coagulation. fms can be fatal within 24 h, often before signs of meningitis have developed. in spite of the increasing possibilities for treatment in intensive care units, the mortality rate of fms is still 30%. when the outgrowth of meningococci in the bloodstream is impeded, seeding of bacteria in the subarachnoidal compartment may lead to overt meningitis within 24 to 36 h. with appropriate antibiotics and good clinical surveillance, the mortality rate of this form of invasive disease is 1 to 2%. the overall mortality rate of meningococcal disease can only be reduced when patients without meningitis, i.e., those who may develop fms, are recognized early. this means that the fundamental  nature of the disease as a meningococcus septicemia deserves more attention.

TI  == identification of regions of the chromosome of neisseria meningitidis and neisseria gonorrhoeae which are specific to the pathogenic neisseria species.
AB  == neisseria meningitidis and neisseria gonorrhoeae give rise to dramatically different diseases. their interactions with the host, however, do share common characteristics: they are both human pathogens which do not survive in the environment and which colonize and invade mucosa at their port of entry. it is therefore likely that they have common properties that might not be found in nonpathogenic bacteria belonging to the same genetically related group, such as neisseria lactamica. their common properties may be determined by chromosomal regions found only in the pathogenic neisseria species. to address this issue, we used a previously described technique (c. r. tinsley and x. nassif, proc. natl. acad. sci. usa 93:11109-11114, 1996) to identify sequences of dna specific for pathogenic neisseriae and not found in n. lactamica. sequences present in n. lactamica were physically subtracted from the n. meningitidis z2491 sequence and  also from the n. gonorrhoeae fa1090 sequence. the clones obtained from each subtraction were tested by southern blotting for their reactivity with the three  species, and only those which reacted with both n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae (i.e., not specific to either one of the pathogens) were further investigated. in a first step, these clones were mapped onto the chromosomes of both n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae. the majority of the clones were arranged in clusters extending up to 10 kb, suggesting the presence of chromosomal regions common to n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae which distinguish these pathogens from the commensal n. lactamica. the sequences surrounding these clones were determined from the n. meningitidis genome-sequencing project. several clones corresponded to previously described factors required for colonization and survival at the port of entry, such as immunoglobulin a protease and pilc. others were homologous to virulence-associated proteins in other bacteria, demonstrating that the subtractive clones are capable of pinpointing chromosomal regions shared by n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae which are involved in common aspects of the host interaction of both pathogens.

AB  == the development of effective prophylactic agents against gonorrhea and the study  of adaptation by neisseria gonorrhoeae to the urogenital mucosa are hindered by the lack of a well-established animal model of gonococcal genital tract infection. here, a murine model of long-term gonococcal genital tract infection is described. female balb/c mice were treated with 17-beta-estradiol and inoculated intravaginally with wild-type gonococcal strain fa1090 or ms11. n. gonorrhoeae was recovered from vaginal swabs for an average of 12 to 13 days following inoculation with 10(6) cfu of either strain. inflammation occurred in over 80% of infected mice, and diplococci were associated with epithelial cells and neutrophils in stained vaginal smears. ascended infection occurred in 17 to 20% of mice inoculated with strain fa1090. an outbred mouse strain (slc:ddy) previously reported to be naturally susceptible to n. gonorrhoeae was also tested; however, as with balb/c mice, estradiol was required for prolonged infection. although piliation was not maintained during experimental murine infection, 46 to 100% of vaginal isolates from four of eight balb/c mice and three of four slc:ddy mice expressed one or more opacity (opa) proteins within 4  days after inoculation with an opa-negative variant of strain fa1090. the observed selection for and/or induction of gonococcal opa protein expression during murine infection appears to parallel events that occur during experimental urethritis in volunteers.

AB  == objective: to investigate the in vitro microbicidal and cytocidal potency of monocaprin dissolved in pharmaceutical hydrogel formulations and to evaluate their potential use as vaginal microbicides against sexually transmitted pathogens such as herpes simplex virus type 2 (hsv-2), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (hiv-1), chlamydia trachomatis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. methods:  gel formulations were mixed with equal volumes of virus/bacteria suspensions in culture medium and incubated for 1 and 5 minutes. the reduction in virus/bacteria titre was used as a measure of microbicidal activity. similarly, gels were mixed  with human semen to study their effect on leucocytes. the toxicity of the gels was tested in rabbits by the standard vaginal irritation test. results: gels containing 20 mm of monocaprin caused a greater than 100,000-fold inactivation of hsv-2 and neisseria in 1 minute and of chlamydia in 5 minutes. similarly, the gels caused a greater than 10,000-fold inactivation of hiv-1 in semen in 1 minute. they caused more than a 10,000-fold reduction in the number of viable leucocytes in semen in 1 minute. no toxic effect on the vaginal mucosa of rabbits was observed after daily exposure for 10 days. conclusions: hydrogels containing  monocaprin are potent inactivators of sexually transmitted viruses and bacteria in vitro. this simple lipid seems to be a feasible choice as a mucosal microbicide for prevention of sexually transmitted infections. it is a natural compound found in certain foodstuffs such as milk and is therefore unlikely to cause harmful side effects in the concentrations used.

TI  == interactions of pathogenic neisseria with host cells. is it possible to assemble  the puzzle?
AB  == neisseria meningitidis and neisseria gonorrhoeae are human pathogens that have to interact with mucosa and/or cellular barriers for their life cycles to progress.  even though they both give rise to dramatically different diseases, the use of in vitro models has shown that most of the mechanisms mediating cellular interactions are common to n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae. this suggests that bacterial cell interactions may be essential not only for pathogenesis but also for other aspects of the bacterial life cycle that are common to both n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae. this manuscript will review the most recent developments concerning the mechanisms mediating cellular interaction of pathogenic neisseria and will then try to put them into the perspective of pathogenesis and bacterial life cycle.

TI  == erythromycin-resistant neisseria gonorrhoeae and oral commensal neisseria spp. carry known rrna methylase genes.
AB  == two neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates from seattle and two isolates from uruguay were resistant to erythromycin (mic, 4 to 16 microg/ml) and had reduced susceptibility to azithromycin (mic, 1 to 4 microg/ml) due to the presence of the self-mobile rrna methylase gene(s) ermf or ermb and ermf. the two seattle isolates and one isolate from uruguay were multiresistant, carrying either the 25.2-mda tetm-containing plasmid (seattle) or a beta-lactamase plasmid (uruguay). sixteen commensal neisseria isolates (10 neisseria perflava-n. sicca, 2 n. flava, and 4 n. mucosa) for which erythromycin mics were 4 to 16 microg/ml were shown to carry one or more known rrna methylase genes, including ermb, ermc, and/or ermf.  many of these isolates also were multiresistant and carried the tetm gene. this is the first time that a complete transposon or a complete conjugative transposon carrying an antibiotic resistance gene has been described for the genus neisseria.

TI  == coinfection with influenza b virus does not affect association of neisseria meningitidis with human nasopharyngeal mucosa in organ culture.
AB  == there is an epidemiological association between influenza virus infection and meningococcal disease. proposed mechanisms are the destruction of the normal epithelial barrier function of the upper respiratory tract by influenza virus or  the expression of human or viral surface-exposed proteins that enhance bacterial  adherence and/or invasion. to test these hypotheses, human nasopharyngeal mucosa  specimens from a total of 19 individual donors were successfully infected with influenza b virus and then inoculated with serogroup b neisseria meningitidis. subsequent bacterial association with the epithelial surface was measured in three separate series of experiments by using transmission electron microscopy (n = 6), scanning electron microscopy (n = 6), and counting of viable bacteria within homogenates of explants (n = 7). penetration of the mucosa was estimated by measuring the count of viable bacteria recovered from explants after exposure  to sodium taurocholate. bacterial association with the surface of explants was time dependent over 24 h of superinfection. influenza virus did not positively or negatively influence bacterial attachment to or penetration of explant mucosa compared to those of uninfected controls, even when the period of preincubation with virus was extended to 7 days. when proteins were purified from mucosal epithelium and immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes, n. meningitidis attached  predominantly to bands corresponding to proteins of 210 and 130 kda. in the presence of influenza virus infection, these proteins were gradually lost over the course of 72 h. in conclusion, influenza b virus did not increase association of serogroup b n. meningitidis with human nasopharyngeal mucosa.

TI  == pathogenic neisseriae: complexity of pathogen-host cell interplay.
AB  == recent studies have provided insight into the function of important neisserial adhesins (pili and opa) and their interaction with cellular receptors, including  members of heparan sulfate proteoglycan, cd66, and integrin receptor families. these interactions not only allow colonization of the human mucosa but also stimulate cellular signaling cascades involving phosphatidylcholine-dependent phospholipase c, acidic sphingomyelinase and protein kinase c in epithelial cells, and src-related kinases, rac1, p21-activated kinase, and jun n-terminal kinase in phagocytic cells. activation of these pathways is essential for cellular entry and intracellular accommodation of the pathogens but also leads to early induction of cytokine release, thus priming the immune response. detailed knowledge of the cellular signaling cascades that are activated by infection will aid us in applying both current and novel interfering drugs (in addition to classical antibiotic therapy) as therapy and prophylaxis for persistent or otherwise difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, including periodontal infections.

TI  == gonococcal infection of human fallopian tube mucosa in organ culture: relationship of mucosal tissue tnf-alpha concentration to sloughing of ciliated cells.
AB  == background and objectives: an experimental model consisting of gonococcal infection of human fallopian tube mucosa in organ culture has proven useful in studying the molecular pathogenesis of acute gonococcal salpingitis and postsalpingitis sequelae. gonococcal infection of human fallopian tube mucosa in  organ culture results in the sloughing of ciliated epithelial cells from the mucosa. this damage to the mucosa can be quantified on fallopian tube pieces by an assay of the percent of the periphery that has ciliary activity (ppca) remaining at specific time points after infection. although assay of the ppca has been quite valuable, it is labor-intensive, somewhat subjective, and requires that the observers have training and experience. a more practical assay for genital mucosal damage is desirable for further investigations that employ the fallopian tube experimental model. gonococcal infection of fallopian tube mucosa  in organ culture also results in the production of easily quantified tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) by the mucosa. furthermore, treatment of the organ cultures with recombinant human tnf-alpha (rhutnfalpha) alone also causes sloughing of ciliated cells from the mucosa. these findings strongly suggest that tnf-alpha is a mediator of the mucosal damage that attends gonococcal infection.  goals of the study: to determine: (1) whether the ppca values and the tnf-alpha concentrations in fallopian tube mucosal tissues correlate closely enough to allow prediction of the ppca from a measurement of the mucosal tissue tnf-alpha concentration; and (2) whether the correlation of the tnf-alpha mucosal tissue concentration with the sloughing of ciliated cells (measured by the ppca) supports the hypothesis that induction of tnf-alpha by gonococcal infection, with resultant sloughing of ciliated cells, is likely to be a major pathogenic mechanism of gonococcal salpingitis and might mediate postsalpingitis infertility and ectopic pregnancy. study design: a metaanalysis was performed on studies from three research groups (two laboratories in the united states and one in the united kingdom, using identical techniques for quantifying the ppca, tnf-alpha, or both. results: there was a close and statistically significant correlation between the tnf-alpha mucosal tissue concentration and the proportion of ciliated cells lost from the mucosa as measured by the ppca (r = 0.95, p < 0.001). therefore, as the mucosal tissue concentration of endogenous tnf-alpha increased, the loss of ciliated cells from the epithelium increased proportionately. conclusions: during gonococcal infection of human fallopian tube mucosa in organ  culture, the mucosal tissue concentration of tnf-alpha can be used to predict the ppca, and therefore, the extent of mucosal damage. this finding should facilitate studies of the molecular pathogenesis of infectious diseases involving human genital mucosa. further, the close correlation of mucosal tnf-alpha concentration with genital mucosal damage, evaluated by the ppca, supports the hypothesis that  induction of the proinflammatory cytokine, tnf-alpha, by gonococcal infection, with resultant inflammation and sloughing of ciliated cells, is an important pathogenic mechanism of gonococcal salpingitis and may mediate postsalpingitis infertility and ectopic pregnancy as well.

TI  == the effect of cigarette smoke on adherence of respiratory pathogens to buccal epithelial cells.
AB  == smoking is associated with an increased risk of respiratory tract infection in adults. in children, exposure to cigarette smoke is a risk factor for respiratory tract infection and bacterial meningitis: active smoking and passive exposure to  cigarette smoke is also associated with carriage of some potentially pathogenic species of bacteria in both adults and children. the aims of the study were to determine the effect of active smoking on: (1) bacterial binding to epithelial cells; (2) expression of host cell antigens that act as receptors for some species; and (3) the effects of passive exposure to water-soluble components of cigarette smoke on bacterial binding. flow cytometry was used to assess binding to buccal epithelial cells of the following species labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate: neisseria meningitidis, neisseria lactamica, streptococcus pneumoniae, bordetella pertussis, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis,  staphylococcus aureus. flow cytometry was also used to assess expression of host  cell antigens which have been identified as bacterial receptors. for each species, binding to cells of smokers was significantly higher than to cells of non-smokers; however, expression of host cell antigens was similar on epithelial  cells of both groups. non-dilute cigarette smoke extract reduced binding of bacteria to epithelial cells, but dilutions between 1 in 10 and 1 in 320 enhanced binding. we conclude that smokers might be more densely colonised by a variety of potentially pathogenic bacteria. the enhanced bacterial binding to epithelial cells of smokers is not related to enhanced expression of host cell antigens that can act as receptors for some species, but possibly to components in the smoke that alter charge or other properties of the epithelial cell surface. passive coating of mucosal surfaces with components of cigarette smoke might enhance binding of potentially pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == invasion of human mucosal epithelial cells by neisseria gonorrhoeae upregulates expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1).
AB  == infection of the mucosa by neisseria gonorrhoeae involves adherence to and invasion of epithelial cells. little is known, however, about the expression by mucosal epithelial cells of molecules that mediate cellular interactions between  epithelial cells and neutrophils at the site of gonococcal infection. the aim of  this study was to determine the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) by epithelial cells during the process of gonococcal invasion. the highly invasive strain fa1090 and the poorly invasive strain ms11 were incubated  with human endometrial adenocarcinoma (hec-1-b) or human cervical carcinoma (me-180) epithelial cells, after which icam-1 expression was measured by flow cytometry. after 15 h of infection with fa1090, expression of icam-1 increased 4.7- and 2.1-fold for hec-1-b and me-180 cells, respectively, whereas 15 h of infection of hec-1-b cells with ms11 increased icam-1 expression only 1.6-fold. icam-1 expression was restricted to the cell surface, since no soluble icam-1 was detected. the distribution of staining was heterogeneous and mimicked that seen after treatment of hec-1-b cells with the icam-1 agonist tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) in the absence of bacteria. pcr and dot blot analyses of icam-1 mrna showed no change in levels over time in response to infection. although tnf-alpha was produced by hec-1-b cells after infection, the extent of icam-1 upregulation was not affected by neutralizing anti-tnf-alpha antiserum. dual-fluorescence flow cytometry showed that the cells with the highest levels of icam-1 expression were cells with associated gonococci. we conclude that epithelial cells upregulate the expression of icam-1 in response to infection with invasive gonococci. on the mucosa, upregulation of icam-1 by infected epithelial cells may function to maintain neutrophils at the site of infection, thereby reducing further invasion of the mucosa by gonococci.

TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae : detection and typing by probe hybridization, lcr, and pcr.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae, first described by neisser in 1879, is a gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming diplococcus, belonging to the family neisseriaceae. it is the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. the other pathogenic species is neisseria meningitidis, to which n. gonorrhoeae is genetically closely related. although n. meningitidis is not usually considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, it may infect the mucous membranes of the anogenital area of homosexual men (1). the other members of the genus, which include neisseria lactamic a, neisseriapolysaccharea, neisseria cinerea, and neisseria flavescens, which are related to neisseria gonorrhoeae, and saccharolytic strains, such as neisseria subflava, neisseria sicca, and neisseria mucosa, which are less genetically related to the aforementioned, are considered to be nonpathogenic, being normal flora of the nasopharyngeal mucous membranes (2).

TI  == immunogenicity of intranasally administered meningococcal native outer membrane vesicles in mice.
AB  == colonization of the human nasopharyngeal region by neisseria meningitidis is believed to lead to natural immunity. although the presence of bactericidal antibody in serum has been correlated with immunity to meningococcal disease, mucosal immunity at the portal of entry may also play an important role. this study was undertaken to examine in mice the possibility of safely using native outer membrane vesicles (nomv) not exposed to detergent as an intranasal (i.n.) vaccine. the mucosal and systemic responses of mice to intranasal and intraperitoneal (i.p.) vaccination with nomv were compared over a range of doses  from 0.1 to 20 microgram. intranasal vaccination of mice with nomv induced a strong systemic bactericidal antibody response, as well as a strong local immunoglobulin a immune response in the lung as determined by assay of lung lavage fluid by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lung antibody secreting cells by enzyme-linked immunospot assay. however, 8- to 10-fold-higher doses of nomv were required i.n. compared to i.p. to elicit an equivalent bactericidal antibody response in serum. some nomv vaccine was aspirated into the lungs of mice during i.n. immunization and resulted in an acute inflammatory response that peaked at 1 to 2 days postimmunization and was cleared by day 7. these results indicate that i.n. delivery of meningococcal nomv in mice is highly effective in  eliciting the production of both a mucosal immune response and a systemic bactericidal antibody response.

AB  == characteristic features of fauces aerobic microflora in children treated in intensive care units (icu) were analysed. for comparison fauces microflora in children outpatients and in children patients from general surgical units was investigated. a retrospective analysis of all the smears without exception for 2  years (a total of 2120) revealed a direct dependence of the changes in the fauces microflora composition on the patient condition and the antibiotic load. it was shown that the fauces indigenic microflora in icu patients was more often replaced by enterococci, gramnegative enteric bacteria and nonfermenting bacteria which are not usual under the normal conditions. the flora in such cases was represented by monoculture. thus, microorganisms natural for the fauces i.e. haemophilus influenzae and neisseria spp. were not practically detected in the fauces of the icu patients (0.5 and 0.4 per cent, respectively). grampositive cocci in the children of the surgical units and in the outpatients included alpha-hemolytic streptococci in association with beta-hemolytic or nonhemolytic streptococci. no such bacteria were isolated from the icu newborns. the associations of gramnegative organisms from the icu patients included 40 variants. seventy-eight association variants of pseudomonas aeruginosa were mainly represented by the combinations with serratia spp. and klebsiella spp. as  well as with coagulase negative staphylococci or enterococci, especially in the icu newborns. the results of the study demonstrated that the target-aimed antibiotic therapy providing eradication of p.aeruginosa in the icu patients was  not always justified because of possible superinfection practically due to any organism from the association. massive antibiotic therapy with pressing on gramnegative flora in the icu patients induced selective contamination of the mucosa by polyresistant enterococci thus increasing their potential role in the development of hospital infections.

TI  == pathogenic neisseria--interplay between pro- and eukaryotic worlds.
AB  == the pathogenic neisseria species constitute a multi-faceted infection model of a  highly adapted pathogen-host relationship. several bacterial and host-cell factors involved in the cellular cross-talk have been recently unraveled. using neisseria gonorrhoeae as a prototype, several structurally variable surface proteins, including pili and opa proteins, have been revealed as adhesins recognizing distinct host-cell receptors. the opa proteins, in particular, are important in facilitating interaction with heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors and members of the cd66 and integrin receptor families. these interactions not only enable the pathogens' anchoring, and penetration into, the human mucosa but  also stimulate cellular signaling cascades involving the phosphatidylcholine-dependent phospholipase c, acidic sphingomyelinase and protein kinase c in epithelial cells, and src-related kinases, rac1, p21-activated kinase and jun n-terminal kinase in phagocytic cells. activation of these pathways is essential for the entry and intracellular accommodation of the  pathogens but also leads to an early induction of cytokine release, thus priming  the immune response. it is believed that detailed knowledge of cellular signaling cascades activated by infection will aid us in applying known and novel interfering drugs, in addition to classical antibiotic therapy, to the therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of persistent or otherwise difficult-to-treat bacterial infections.

TI  == binding of vitronectin to opa-expressing neisseria gonorrhoeae mediates invasion  of hela cells.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae induces local infections in the human genitourinary tract and can disseminate to other organs to cause severe disease. blood-derived factors present in the genital mucosa have been suggested to facilitate the spread of n. gonorrhoeae in disseminated gonococcal infections. using gentamicin  invasion assays and confocal microscopy, we observed a strong stimulatory effect  of fetal calf serum (fcs) on the gonococcal invasion of hela cells. fcs-mediated  invasion was dependent on the expression of the epithelial cell invasion-associated opa protein (plasmid-encoded opa50 or its chromosomal homolog opa30), while n. gonorrhoeae expressing noninvasive opa proteins (opa(51-60)) or  no opa protein (opa-) was not invasive even in the presence of fcs. incubation of n. gonorrhoeae ms11 with biotinylated fcs revealed a 78-kda protein as the prominent protein binding to opa50- or opa30-expressing gonococci. this protein was recognized by antibodies against vitronectin (vn) in western blots. purified  human or bovine vn efficiently bound to opa50-expressing gonococci, while binding to noninvasive opa- or opa52-expressing gonococci was significantly lower. binding of vn was inhibited by heparin in a concentration-dependent manner, indicating that the heparin binding sites present in vn or opa50 may play an essential role in this interaction. based on gentamicin invasion assays and confocal microscopy studies, vn binding was associated with an increased invasion of opa50- and opa30-expressing gonococci into hela cells. the ability of vn to mediate entry into epithelial cells may constitute an important event in the pathogenesis of local as well as disseminated gonococcal infections.

AB  == group b neisseria meningitidis causes systemic disease, including meningitis, after initial colonization and subsequent penetration of nasopharyngeal mucosa, a tissue which is richly populated by macrophages. in an initial effort to characterize the interaction of n. meningitidis and mature human macrophages, the influence of the alpha2-->8) -linked polysialic acid capsule on the interaction of n. meningitidis with human monocyte-derived macrophages was investigated with  a capsulate case isolate and an isogenic tn916-derived noncapsulate transformant. the capsulate strain was fourfold less adherent to the macrophage surface after cold incubation, although adherence of both strains was significantly increased after opsonization with nonimmune c5-depleted serum. when opsonized inocula were  adjusted so that they adhered to macrophages in equal numbers, the two strains were internalized at equivalent rates and both entered membrane-bound compartments (phagosomes). colocalization of bacteria with the late endosomal and lysosomal marker lysosome-associated membrane protein revealed that fusion of lysosomes with phagosomes containing the capsulate organism was significantly reduced 10 and 30 min after entry, but by 1 h, no difference between the strains  was observed. once internalized, meningococci were effectively killed, although more rapid killing of the capsulate strain was observed over the first 3 h. these results indicate that the (alpha2-->8)-linked polysialic acid capsule modifies the interaction of meningococci with human macrophages at multiple steps, including adherence to the macrophage surface and phagosome-lysosome fusion. moreover, the discordance between the kinetics of phagosome- lysosome fusion and  bacterial killing suggests that a nonlysosomal mechanism may be responsible for a significant fraction of macrophage killing of n. meningitidis.

TI  == uptake and nuclear transport of neisseria iga1 protease-associated alpha-proteins in human cells.
AB  == pathogenic neisseria species, the causative agents of gonorrhoea and bacterial meningitis, encode a family of polymorphic exo-proteins which are autoproteolytically processed into several distinct extracellular components, including an iga1 protease and an alpha-protein. iga1 protease, a putative virulence determinant, is a sequence-specific endopeptidase known to cleave human iga1, but additional target proteins have been postulated. the physical linkage of iga1 protease and alpha-protein suggests a functional relationship of both precursor components. previous work has shown that alpha-protein is essential neither for extracellular transport nor for the proteolytic activity of iga1 protease. intriguingly, alpha-proteins carry amino acid sequences reminiscent of  nuclear location signals of viral and eukaryotic proteins. here we demonstrate the functionality of these nuclear location signal sequences in transfected eukaryotic cells. chimeric alpha-proteins show nuclear transport and selectively  associate with nucleolar structures. more importantly, native purified alpha-proteins are capable of entering certain human primary cells from the exterior via an endocytotic route and accumulate in the nuclei. the neisserial alpha-proteins share several features with eukaryotic transcription factors, such as the formation of dimers via a heptad repeat sequence. we propose a role for alpha-proteins in the regulation of host-cell functions. as the alpha-proteins are covalently connected with iga1 protease they may also serve as carries for the iga1 protease into human cells where additional proteolytic targets may exist. neisseria meningitidis, which locally colonizes the nasopharyngeal mucosa  of many human individuals without apparently causing symptoms, secretes this nucleus-targeted factor in large quantities.

TI  == the role of humoral mucosal immunity in the induction and maintenance of chronic  airway infections.
AB  == the respiratory mucosa is protected primarily by a secretory immune system that is under complex and only partly understood immunoregulatory control. secretory immunoglobulins (siga and sigm) protect the mucosal surface by immune exclusion of antigens. however, the fact that most iga produced in the respiratory tract belongs to the iga1 subclass renders siga in this region susceptible to iga-specific proteases produced by haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumonia, and neisseria meningitidis. immunoglobulin g can also perform immune exclusion at respiratory surfaces but, like ige, it reaches the secretions merely by passive diffusion. the phlogistic properties of antibodies belonging to these  classes explain their potential involvement in maintaining mucosal inflammation.  in patients with selective iga deficiency, siga is lacking and is not regularly compensated for satisfactorily by sigm. in such patients unexplained immunoregulatory mechanisms, perhaps involving the local microbiota, give rise to a large number of igd-producing cells in the upper respiratory tract. immunoglobulin d cannot act as a secretory antibody and might block the protective properties of igg; this could explain why these patients are particularly prone to recurrent infections. our observations show that there are  large individual variations in the mucosal immune system with regard to humoral immunity in the upper respiratory tract.

AB  == the interaction of neisseria meningitidis with rhinopharyngeal epithelium was studied by experimental infection of explants of human nasal turbinate mucosa with two wild strains: a fully capsulate case isolate, and an epidemiologically related non-capsulate nasopharyngeal isolate. after incubation for 4 h, epithelial cells of infected explants changed conformation from tall columnar morphology towards cuboidal, and there was increased discharge of mucus globules  from goblet cells. by 24 h there was significant damage to infected epithelia, including projection of cells out of the surface, cytoplasmic blebbing and mitochondrial abnormalities. meningococci were associated with surface non-ciliated cells by 4 h after infection. by 24 h after infection they were associated extensively with all cell types exhibiting damage. there was little association with secreted mucus. in areas of cell damage, penetration between surface cells was observed. endocytosis into non-ciliated cells was observed in only a minority of explants studied and only in those infected for 24 h. from this intracellular site there was apparent migration to adjacent cells and to intercellular locations. no organisms were observed within or beneath basement membrane collagen in any explants but internalisation into mononuclear phagocytes was observed occasionally.

TI  == time required for elimination of neisseria gonorrhoeae from the urogenital tract  in men with symptomatic urethritis: comparison of oral and intramuscular single-dose therapy.
AB  == background and objectives: the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (stds), including gonorrhea, is affected by the duration of infection. oral antibiotic therapy for gonococcal infection has been shown to be as effective as conventional intramuscular injection with ceftriaxone. rapid cure would be expected to limit further spread of gonorrhea. however, the speed with which neisseria gonorrhoeae is eliminated from the urogenital tract has not been evaluated. goal of this study: to determine the time required for elimination of  neisseria gonorrhoeae for the urine, mucosa, and semen in male subjects after treatment with ceftriaxone (250 mg intramuscularly), ciprofloxacin (500 mg by mouth, single dose) or cefixime (400 mg by mouth, single dose.) results: in 14 subjects, gonococci were eliminated from the urine within 4 hours of therapy and  the mucosa within 24 hours after therapy. in 9 additional subjects, gonococci were eliminated from the semen by 24 hours after therapy. conclusions: these results support the efficacy of single-dose oral therapy for gonorrhea and suggest that earlier follow-up for proof of cure in clinical trials of new antibiotics for gonorrhea may be acceptable. rapid elimination of gonorrhea reduces the risk for continued transmission of the organism.

TI  == anti-alpha-galactosyl immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, and igm in human secretions.
AB  == anti-alpha-galactosyl (anti-gal) is a natural human serum antibody that binds to  the carbohydrate gal alpha 1,3gal beta 1,4glcnac-r (alpha-galactosyl epitope) and is synthesized by 1% of circulating b lymphocytes in response to immune stimulation by enteric bacteria. we were able to purify secretory anti-gal from human colostrum and bile by affinity chromatography on silica-linked gal alpha 1,3gal beta 1,4glcnac. we found similar secretory anti-gal antibodies in human milk, saliva, and vaginal washings. secretory anti-gal from milk and saliva was exclusively immunoglobulin a (iga); that from colostrum and bile also contained igg and igm isotypes. serum was also found to contain anti-gal igm and iga in addition to the previously reported igg. anti-gal iga purified from colostrum and bile had both iga1 and iga2. secretory anti-gal from saliva, milk, colostrum, and bile agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes (rrbc) and bound to bovine thyroglobulin, both of which have abundant alpha-galactosyl epitopes. the rrbc-hemagglutinating  capacity of human saliva, milk, bile, and serum was specifically adsorbed by immobilized gal alpha 1,3gal beta 1,4glcnac but not by gal alpha 1,4gal beta 1,4glcnac, gal beta 1,3galnac, gal beta 1,4glcnac, gal beta 1,4glcnac alpha 1,2man, or fuc alpha 1,2gal beta 1,4glcnac. no rrbc-hemagglutinating activity could be detected in rat milk, rat bile, cow milk, or rabbit bile, suggesting a restricted species distribution for secretory anti-gal similar to that found for  serum anti-gal. colostral anti-gai iga bound strongly to a sample of gram-negative bacteria isolated from the throats and stools of well children as well as to an escherichia coli k-1 blood isolate. colostral anti-gai iga inhibited the binding of a neisseria meningitidis strain to human buccal epithelial cells, suggesting that this antibody may play a protective role at the mucosal surface.

TI  == identification and characterization of specific sequences encoding pathogenicity  associated proteins in the genome of commensal neisseria species.
AB  == the distribution of distinct sequences in pathogenic and commensal neisseria species was investigated systematically by dot blot analysis. probes representing the genes of rmp, pilin and iga1 protease were found to hybridize exclusively to  the chromosomal dna of the pathogenic species, neisseria gonorrhoeae and/or neisseria meningitidis. in contrast, specific sequences for the genes of the porin protein por and the opacity protein (opa) were also detected in a panel of  commensal neisseria species such as n. lactamica, n. subflava, n. flava, n. mucosa and n. sicca. using opa-specific oligonucleotides as probes in chromosomal blots, the genomes of the commensal neisseria species show a totally reduced repertoire of cross-hybridizing loci compared to the complex opa gene family of n. gonorrhoeae. dna sequence analysis of one opa-related gene derived from n. flava and n. sicca, respectively, revealed a large degree of homology with previously described gonococcal and meningococcal genes, e.g., a typical repetitive sequence in the leader peptide and the distribution of the hypervariable and conserved regions. this observation, together with the finding, that the gene is constitutively transcribed, leads to the assumption that some of the commensal neisseria species may have the potential for the expression of a protein harboring similar functions as the opa proteins in pathogenic neisseriae.

TI  == the effect of variations in the expression of pili on the interaction of neisseria meningitidis with human nasopharyngeal epithelium.
AB  == bacterial adherence is essential to colonization of the nasopharynx by neisseria  meningitidis, and pili may facilitate adherence. scanning electron microscopy and immunogold labeling were used to study the interaction of 2 piliated and 1 nonpiliated variant of n. meningitidis with nasopharyngeal mucosa in an adenoid organ culture system with an air-mucosal interface. meningococcal infection caused epithelial damage, loss of ciliated epithelium, and ciliary disorganization, which progressed with time and were greater with the piliated strains. pili increased adherence of meningococci to the mucosa, and there was tropism of piliated strains for nonciliated cells containing microvilli, damaged  epithelium, and sites of cell separation. bacterial adherence was associated with a change in the appearance of the microvilli.

AB  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. these fell into four major areas. areas a, b and c contained species of neisseria, whereas area d contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with branhamella, moraxella and kingella species. area a contained n. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), n. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and n. cinerea closely associated), n. polysaccharea, n. elongata subsp, glycolytica and n. lactamica. area b contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, n. mucosa, n. perflava and n. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. area c contained several groups from animals, n. animalis, n. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. area c also contained n.  elongata, n. subflava (with n. flavescens), type strain of morococcus cerebrosis  and the cdc groups m-5 (n. weaveri) and ef-4. area d contained branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' n. caviae and n. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' n. ovis, and a group of moraxella strains. a small group representing kingella kingae is included in area d. mean test error was 1.7%.

TI  == binding of mannan-binding protein to various bacterial pathogens of meningitis.
AB  == mannan-binding protein (mbp), a calcium-dependent plasma lectin, may play a role  in the innate defence against microorganisms. after binding to carbohydrate structures at the bacterial surface, mbp activates the classical pathway of the complement system. to investigate the binding capacity of mbp to various bacteria associated with meningitis, an assay was developed to study the binding of mbp to bacteria grown in a semisynthetic fluid culture medium. salmonella montevideo (containing a mannose-rich lipopolysaccharide (lps)), used as a positive control  strain, showed binding of radiolabelled mbp at a level of 80% compared with binding of mbp to zymosan. binding of labelled mbp to salm. montevideo was time-dependent, temperature-dependent and saturable. the binding was inhibited by unlabelled mbp, by mannose and by n-acetyl-d-glucosamine. among bacterial pathogens often found to cause meningitis, a wide range of mbp binding capacities could be determined. the encapsulated neisseria meningitidis (representatives from 11 serogroups other than group a were included: n = 22), n. mucosa (n = 1),  haemophilus influenzae type b (n = 10) and streptococcus agalactiae (n = 5) had a low mbp binding capacity of 21.7% (95% confidence interval (ci) 3.3-40.1%). escherichia coli k1 (n = 11), strep. suis (n = 5), strep. pneumoniae (n = 10) and n. meningitidis serogroup a (n = 2) showed intermediate mbp binding capacity of 58.4% (95% ci 40.0-76.8%). a third group consisting of non-encapsulated listeria  monocytogenes (n = 11), non-encapsulated h. influenzae (n = 2), non-encapsulated  n. meningitidis (n = 2), n. cinera (n = 1) and n. subflava (n = 1) strains had a  high mbp binding capacity of 87.5% (95% ci 62.5-112.5%). the majority of encapsulated pathogens causing bacterial meningitis seem to have a rather low mbp binding capacity.

TI  == inhibitory effect of saliva from secretors and non-secretors on binding of meningococci to epithelial cells.
AB  == carriage of neisseria meningitidis b:4:p1.15 was higher among non-secretors during a school outbreak of meningitis; non-secretors had lower levels of anti-meningococcal salivary igm. flow cytometry was used to assess effects of secretor and non-secretor saliva on binding of b:4:p1.15 to buccal epithelial cells: (1) to assess inhibition by iga and igm; and (2) to assess contributions of salivary antibodies to inhibitory activities. greater inhibition was obtained  with secretor saliva: pooled (p = 0.049); fresh (p = 0.0001). purified iga (p = 0.02) and igm (p = 0.03) were equally inhibitory. after absorption of anti-meningococcal antibodies, there was still significant inhibitory activity in the pools: secretors (p = 0.018); non-secretors (p = 0.005). these results indicate that both secretory immunoglobulins and other factors contribute to protection against colonisation by meningococci and might explain the increased carriage of b:4:1.15 in this population.

TI  == genetic diversity of the iron-binding protein (fbp) gene of the pathogenic and commensal neisseria.
AB  == the pathogenic neisseria and most commensal neisseria species produce an iron-binding protein (fbp) when grown under iron-limited conditions. in the current study, we confirmed the presence of fbp, as well as dna sequences homologous to the gonococcal fbp, in strains of n. gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis,  n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. subflava, n. kochii and n. polysaccharea. the fbp genes from these strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, digested with stui or rsai, and the restriction patterns examined. the patterns for the gonococcal and meningococcal fbp were virtually identical; however, variations were observed in the fbp sequences of the commensal neisseria species. n. flavescens, n. mucosa, n. sicca, n. ovis and branhamella catarrhalis, did not  produce fbp as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with an fbp specific monoclonal antibody, nor did  they hybridize to an fbp-specific dna probe.

TI  == phase variation of lipopolysaccharide directs interconversion of invasive and immuno-resistant phenotypes of neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == phase variation of neisseria gonorrhoeae lipopolysaccharide (lps) controls both bacterial entry into human mucosal cells, and bacterial susceptibility to killing by antibodies and complement. the basis for this function is a differential sialylation of the variable oligosaccharide moiety of the lps. lps variants that  incorporate low amounts of sialic acid enter human mucosal epithelial cells very  efficiently, but are susceptible to complement-mediated killing. phase transition to a highly sialylated lps phenotype results in equally adhesive but entry deficient bacteria which, however, resist killing by antibodies and complement because of dysfunctional complement activation. phase variation of n. gonorrhoeae lps thus functions as an adaptive mechanism enabling bacterial translocation across the mucosal barrier, and, at a later stage of infection, escape from the host immune defence.

TI  == humoral immune response patterns of human mucosae: induction and relation to bacterial respiratory tract infections.
AB  == immunoglobulin-producing cells in mucosal tissues, quantitatively the body's most important humoral immune system, synthesize mainly dimers and larger polymers of  iga (poly-iga) with incorporated j (joining) chain. poly-iga is actively transported to exocrine secretions by a transmembrane epithelial glycoprotein called secretory component. enhancing secretory immunity by oral vaccination is an interesting possibility, but mucosal antigen uptake and local immune regulation are complex and only partly understood. immunoglobulin isotype response patterns in the upper respiratory mucosa and distal gut are strikingly different. the preferential production of iga1 in nasal and bronchial mucosae is  intriguing in view of the frequent synthesis of iga1-specific proteases by haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and neisseria meningitidis. a relationship of proneness to produce invasive disease and enzymatically induced deterioration of secretory immunity has been proposed. differences in mucosal immune response patterns among patients with selective iga deficiency or igg subclass deficiencies also suggest that local humoral immunity is an important variable in resistance to infections.

AB  == tumor necrosis factor (tnf) is an endogenously produced cytokine that plays a critical role in mediating septic shock and multi-organ failure, but previous studies of the role tnf in disease have not examined its role in mucosal disease  processes. in an experimental model of acute gonococcal salpingitis, gonococcal infection of human fallopian tube mucosa resulted in increased mucosal production of tnf. recombinant human tnf-alpha damaged fallopian tube mucosa in a dose-response manner and produced epithelial damage with the same ultrastructural features as those observed in gonococcal infection. blocking production of tnf during gonococcal infection diminished the extent of damage to fallopian tube mucosa. in addition to mediating systemic disease, such as septic shock, tnf is also produced locally, and can play a critical role in mediating mucosal disease  processes, such as acute gonococcal salpingitis.

AB  == the pan 1 protein of neisseria gonorrhoeae is a novel 54-kda outer membrane protein expressed only when gonococci are grown in the absence of oxygen. it is a major antigen recognized by sera from patients with gonococcal infection. we raised mouse monospecific polyclonal antiserum to gel-purified pan 1 from gonococcal strain f62. the antiserum was broadly cross-reactive among gonococcal  strains; all strains tested reacted in immunoblot analysis proportionate to the amount of pan 1 visible in silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-polyacrylamide gels. in immunoblot experiments, n. lactamica and n. cinerea reacted very strongly to the anti-pan 1 antiserum, whereas n. sicca, n. flava, and n. mucosa did not react at all. the other commensals tested, n. subflava and  n. perflava, exhibited only a minor reaction. these results correlated with the apparent amount of pan 1 seen on sds-polyacrylamide gels of outer membranes. sds-polyacrylamide gel analysis of six meningococcal strains revealed no visible  anaerobically induced outer membrane proteins, and the subsequent immunoblots showed only slight or no reaction to the anti-pan 1 antibody. in the four meningococcal strains that did react slightly with the antiserum, a pan 1-like protein was seen only in anaerobically grown cells. thus, meningococci did not express pan 1 at levels comparable to that found in gonococci; however, when pan  1 was expressed in meningococcal strains, it was oxygen regulated. this is the first example of a protein found in the gonococcal outer membrane that, under identical growth conditions, is not expressed at similar levels in the meningococcus.

AB  == to predict the efficacy of antibiotics in eliminating nasopharyngeal carriage of  organisms such as neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), a novel approach for measuring drug concentrations in nasal secretions was developed. five healthy individuals received four doses of rifampin and then, at a later date, ciprofloxacin. at 2, 5, and 8 h after the last dose, serum, saliva, and cold-stimulated nasal secretion samples were collected, and drug levels were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. nasopharyngeal levels of rifampin reached but did not substantially exceed 90% of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic90) for h. influenzae, exceeded the mic90 for n. meningitidis,  and were well above that for mrsa. ciprofloxacin levels in nasal secretions far exceeded the mic90 for meningococci and haemophilus organisms but were below that for mrsa. these findings are consistent with the clinical studies showing that rifampin eliminates, in most instances, the nasal carriage of n. meningitidis and to a lesser extent h. influenzae. a single dose of ciprofloxacin has been shown to eradicate meningococci, yet a long course of treatment with this drug is not adequate for mrsa. on the basis of these results, clinical trials with ciprofloxacin to eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of h. influenzae appear to be  warranted.

TI  == [the effect of gangliosides on the adhesive interaction of neisseria meningitidis with human cells].
AB  == the influence of a number of gangliosides and sialic acid on the adhesive interaction of meningococci and human cells have been studied. sialic acid has been found to produce no influence on adhesion, and the preliminary treatment of  meningococci with gangliosides or their preparations suppresses the capacity of meningococci for attachment to epithelial cells and erythrocytes. at the same time the degree of the inhibition of adhesion depends on the kind and concentration of gangliosides. on the contrary, after the treatment of target cells with gangliosides (1.25 micrograms/ml) the adhesion indices of meningococci with respect to these cells increase 5- to 8-fold. these data are indicative of the participation of gangliosides in the adhesive interaction of meningococci and human cells.

TI  == the evolutionary watershed of susceptibility to gonococcal infection.
AB  == gonococci do not cause genital infection in any convenient experimental animal, but all too easily cause genital infection in humans. to determine the 'evolutionary watershed' of gonococcal infections (the point on the evolutionary  tree at which susceptibility to gonococcal infection begins) we extended previous studies of the interaction of gonococci with animal oviduct mucosa to include chimpanzees and baboons. gonococci attached to, damaged, and invaded the oviduct  (fallopian tube) mucosa of chimpanzees (which are apes) but not the oviduct mucosa of baboons (which are monkeys). thus, the pattern of gonococcal infection  in chimpanzees was identical to that in humans, whereas the pattern in baboons was like that in other animals. these studies indicate that the point in evolution at which susceptibility to gonococcal infection commences is between baboons and chimpanzees (or between monkeys and apes). susceptibility to gonococcal disease appears to require the presence on genital epithelial cells of receptors for gonococcal ligands such as pili, receptors for gonococcal lipopolysaccharide, or both. the physiological role of these receptors may be to  interact with more useful, as yet unidentified molecules.

AB  == opa-expressing variants of neisseria gonorrhoeae strain f62-sf and an opa- variant, all non-piliated, were examined for differences in the interaction of the bacteria within colonies and in attachment to and damage of human fallopian tube mucosa. expression of certain opas was associated with the formation of transparent colonies where the bacteria were tightly packed and evenly spaced within the colonies. expression of other opas was associated with the formation of opaque colonies where the gonococci were less tightly packed and were unevenly spaced. distinct differences in the size of the gonococci and in their surface characteristics were dependent upon the opa being expressed. certain opas were associated with gonococci that had significantly larger cross-sectional areas and bigger perimeters. scanning electron microscopy showed that opac- and opad-containing variants yielded greater mucosal damage than opab-containing and  opa- variants with the least damage caused by the opaa-containing variant (clumped bacteria from dark opaque friable colonies). the mucosal damage after 60 min incubation included shortening and decreased numbers of microvilli on non-ciliated cells and invagination and sloughing of ciliated cells. differences  in the interactions of gonococci within colonies and in attachment to fallopian tube mucosa and damage to the mucosal cells occurred with different opa-expressing variants of n. gonorrhoeae strain f62-sf.

AB  == aerobic microflora of the throat mucosa was studied in 518 healthy persons aged 1 to 50 years. on the basis of the study results, criteria for estimating microbiocenoses of the upper respiratory tracts were defined. it was shown that the throat symbiotic flora included three groups of microorganisms playing different roles in the development of microbiocenosis. the indigenous group consisted of representatives of streptococcus and neisseria and was characterized by permanent (90-100 per cent) and intensive (3-8 lg cfu/ml) colonization, broad  species spectrum, associations of 2-3 and more species and no significant influence of sociological, age and season factors. the representatives of the facultative group i.e. bacteria belonging to staphylococcus, corynebacterium and  haemophilus were less frequent (25-50 per cent). the intensity of their isolation was lower (1-4 lg cfu/ml) and their species spectrum was narrow. the microorganisms of the transitory group were characterized by low frequency (5-20  per cent) and insignificant contamination of the throat mucosa (1-2 lg cfu/ml). the nature of the colonization was monospecific. the group was more numerous by generic composition (candida, escherichia, klebsiella, citrobacter, enterobacter, pseudomonas, branhamella, moraxella and micrococcus). however, it was generally limited by one colonization type. the facultative and transitory groups were subject to age and season variation. they were also different in urban and rural  populations.

TI  == respiratory symptoms due to branhamella catarrhalis and other neisseria species infections--response to erythromycin therapy.
AB  == neisseria microorganisms (neisseria lactamica, neisseria sicca, and neisseria mucosa) are regarded as normal respiratory commensals. branhamella catarrhalis (formerly neisseria catarrhalis) has also been regarded as a normal respiratory commensal, but reports indicate that it can be pathogenic. the role of neisseria  spp was studied in 160 patients with chest infections and symptoms and signs of obstructive respiratory disease. group i patients (n = 140) had a history of asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema. group ii patients (n = 20) had an initially responsive pulmonary tuberculosis but presented with fever and obstructive airway disease. group i patients had disease that was difficult to control despite increased bronchodilator therapy, but they responded dramatically after two to three days of appropriate antibiotic therapy. patients in group ii showed a similar response to erythromycin. neisseria infection was responsible for precipitating or exacerbating respiratory distress in both groups. accordingly, it is concluded that neisseria can be pathogenic and that patients with fever and obstructive respiratory symptoms require treatment.

TI  == parasite-directed endocytosis.
AB  == following the attachment of gonococci to human fallopian tube mucosa in organ culture, the gonococci are endocytosed by specialized low columnar epithelial cells, are transported to the base of the epithelial cells, and are subsequently  exocytosed into the subepithelial tissues. this transepithelial transport process by which "invasion" of the host occurs appears to be dependent on microbial factors is designated parasite-directed endocytosis to distinguish it from host-directed endocytosis by cells such as macrophages that eventually degrade the parasites. "invasion" of the host by a number of human pathogens--bacteria (e.g., neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, and listeria monocytogenes), viruses, or protozoa--appears to be accomplished by parasite-directed endocytosis.

TI  == microbial invasion: a covert activity?
AB  == in contrast to nonpathogenic microorganisms that exist happily in biofilms on various organic and inorganic surfaces, many pathogenic microbes have the additional ability to invade host tissues by inducing their own endocytosis and transport across normally protective barriers. this phenomenon, designated "parasite-directed endocytosis," has been observed with a variety of surfaces (intestinal, genital, nasopharyngeal, and tracheal epithelium) as well as in endothelial cells. the mechanisms involved in invasion may involve a single factor as described for some species of yersinia, or may require multiple factors as observed in shigellae. for the majority of pathogens, the molecular mechanisms of invasion are not well understood (e.g., neisseria gonorrhoeae). because parasite-directed endocytosis is reminiscent of receptor-mediated endocytosis, it is quite possible that some pathogens engage in biologic mimicry by producing a molecule that resembles a natural host ligand, for which there is a host cell receptor. such a masquerade may allow some microbes to enter the host's inner sanctum covertly in a manner analogous to the trojan horse, rather than overtly by destroying the mucosa and entering host tissues directly. whereas this hypothesis is speculative at present, bacteria that produce molecules resembling  insulin, calmodulin, and chorionic gonadotropin have been described.

TI  == structure and functions of the bordetella tracheal cytotoxin.
AB  == of the various toxins and virulence-related factors produced by bordetella pertussis, only one has been demonstrated to reproduce the specific respiratory epithelial cytopathology characteristic of the pertussis syndrome. that molecule  is tracheal cytotoxin (tct), which is released by b. pertussis during log phase growth. an hplc-based method has allowed us to purify tct from culture supernatants, resulting in a preparation with undetectable levels of endotoxin and which is homogeneous by all analytical criteria, including fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms). exposure to purified tct specifically damages ciliated epithelial cells, causing ciliostasis and extrusion of these cells. other species of bordetella, which generate remarkably similar respiratory tract infections and ciliated cell-specific pathology, produce a chemically identical tct. compositional analysis and fab-ms have unambiguously defined the structure of tct as n-acetylglucosaminyl-1, 6-anhydro-n-acetylmuramylalanyl-gamma-glutamyl-diaminopimelylalanine+ ++. this particular disaccharide-tetrapeptide composition and arrangement reveals that tct is apparently formed by cleavage of peptidoglycan. unlike other gram-negative bacteria, however, b. pertussis seems to be very selective in its release of cell wall fragments: greater than 95% of soluble peptidoglycan in culture supernatants is tct. the structure of tct places it in the "muramyl peptide" family, a group of structurally related molecules that are responsible for a diverse array of biological activities. neisseria gonorrhoeae also releases muramyl peptides (one  of which is identical to tct) that can cause ciliated cell-specific damage like that seen during gonococcal infection of fallopian tube mucosa. in addition, tct  is absolutely identical in structure to fsu, a potent sleep-promoting factor isolated from humans.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == enteric immunization reveals a t cell network for iga responses and suggests that humans possess a common mucosal immune system.
AB  == the local iga response is a result of two related events, the induction of sensitized t and b cells in gut- or bronchial-associated lymphoreticular tissues  (galt or balt) and the final differentiation of iga plasma cells in mucosal tissues where iga is produced and transported to become secretory iga (s-iga) antibodies into external secretions. oral administration of various types of antigens/vaccines may result in two types of response, i.e., s-iga antibodies at  mucosa and systemic unresponsiveness to antigen, a state termed oral tolerance. regulatory t cells in galt help account for both s-iga responses and oral tolerance and thus serve to fine tune responses to orally encountered antigens. studies in animal models and humans have shown that oral administration of antigens sensitize lymphoid cells in galt which subsequently home to mucosa and result in s-iga responses in several external secretions. the significant promise of oral vaccines for prevention of microbial diseases including neisserial diseases is discussed.

AB  == the aim of this study was to develop an immunization scheme appropriate for the induction of an immunoglobulin a (iga) response against neisseria gonorrhoeae at  the mucosae. for several reasons, the major outer membrane protein of n. gonorrhoeae (gonococcal pi) is attractive as a component of a gonococcal vaccine. purified pi obtained from strain b2 was used in zwittergent 3-14 for immunization. rats received the antigen subcutaneously, intraintestinally, or directly in peyer's patches with or without the adjuvant n-acetylmuramyl dipeptide (mdp) or alpo4. the immune response was studied in situ by a newly developed antigen-specific three-step immunoperoxidase method, whereas specific antibodies in the serum were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay procedure. subcutaneous immunizations triggered peripheral lymphoid organs, whereas intraintestinal and intra-peyer's patch immunizations triggered mucosa-associated lymphoid organs. this was reflected not only in the lymph nodes involved, popliteal versus mandibular and mesenteric lymph nodes, but also in the isotypes of the produced anti-pi antibodies, igg versus iga. the adjuvants alpo4  and mdp appeared to act differently during subcutaneous and intraintestinal immunizations. alpo4 augmented subcutaneous immune responses, whereas mdp had no  effects. in contrast, intraintestinal immune responses increased most with the adjuvant mdp. in summary, we concluded that pi is capable of inducing a mucosa-associated iga response when administered intraintestinally and that this  response can be augmented by the adjuvant mdp.

TI  == superoxide dismutase and oxygen toxicity defenses in the genus neisseria.
AB  == among aerotolerant cells, neisseria gonorrhoeae is very unusual because despite its obligately aerobic lifestyle and frequent isolation from purulent exudates containing polymorphonuclear leukocytes vigorously evolving o2- and h2o2, it contains no superoxide dismutase (sod). strains (14) of n. gonorrhoeae were compared with each other and with strains of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria mucosa, and neisseria subflava under identical growth conditions for their contents of the oxy-protective enzymes catalase, peroxidase, and sod, as well as  respiratory chain proteins and activity. the absence of sod from n. gonorrhoeae strains was demonstrated under a variety of oxygen-stress conditions. the neisserial species showed very different sod, catalase, and peroxidase profiles.  these profiles correlated well with the tolerance of the species to various intra- and extracellular oxygen insults. the high tolerance of n. gonorrhoeae for extracellular o2- and h2o2 appeared to be due to very high constitutive levels of peroxidase and catalase activity combined with a cell envelope impervious to o2-. nevertheless, n. gonorrhoeae 19424 was much more sensitive to an intracellular flux of o2- than were the other (sod-containing) neisserial species. the responses of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis respiratory and oxy-protective enzymes to growth under high and low oxygen tensions were followed, and a novel response, the apparent repression of the respiratory chain intermediates, respiration, and sod, peroxidase, and catalase activity, was observed. the gonococcal catalase was partially purified and characterized. the results suggest that the very active terminal oxidase, low po2 natural habitat, o2-stable catalase, and possibly the high glutathione content of the organism explain its aerobic survival in the absence of sod.

AB  == the rate of growth of the predominant bacterial strains of plaque from the developmental grooves of first deciduous molar teeth was determined. median doubling times were 3.32, 3.45, 2.88 and 4.54 h for streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and neisseria mucosa respectively. withdrawal of dietary food did not greatly influence the number of bacteria found in the grooves 18 h after they had been cleaned when compared to the number in fed monkeys; exceptions were significant increases in streptococcus mitior and n. mucosa. addition of 0.5 per  cent (w/v) glucose to the drinking water of fasted monkeys also did not influence the size of this bacterial population 18 h after cleaning, so bacteria growing in cleaned grooves must gain a major part of their nutritional needs from their immediate environment, most likely salivary constituents. the ability of oral bacteria to use the oligosaccharide side-chains of salivary glycoproteins was then explored. exoglycosidases for the preferred anomeric linkages of the principal monosaccharide units of salivary glycoproteins were produced both by oral bacteria in vitro and by dental plaque in vivo. thus plaque flora has the potential to degrade glycoproteins and this may explain how bacteria in the grooves grow in the absence of dietary food.

TI  == studies on the implication of surface hydrophobicity in the adherence of neisseria meningitidis to buccal epithelial cells.
AB  == the study of surface hydrophobicity and adherence to human buccal epithelial cells of four neisseria meningitidis strains and the correlation analysis of the  data obtained for both parameters has demonstrated that hydrophobicity of meningococci is not a causative factor in adherence in normal conditions. modification of the bacterial surfaces (by freezing, heating, ultraviolet irradiation, fixation with glutaraldehyde or sodium metaperiodate cleavage of external sugars) induced significant changes in one or both parameters, but these changes were not correlative in both properties. in contrast to other bacteria, the hydrophobicity levels shown by our meningococci are not relevant to their adherent processes.

TI  == molecular mechanisms of pathogenicity of gonococcal salpingitis.
AB  == despite the availability of effective antimicrobial agents and aggressive public  health programmes, gonococcal infections, including salpingitis, remain a major worldwide problem resulting in significant rates of morbidity and infertility. using an experimental model of gonococcal-infected human fallopian tubes in organ culture which are examined by light microscopy and scanning and transmission electron microscopy, basic pathogenic interactions between the gonococcus and the fallopian tube have been elucidated. the major steps in the pathogenic process include attachment, damage and invasion. attachment appears to result from interaction of gonococcal pili with the tips of microvilli of non-ciliated cells  of the fallopian tube mucosa. after gonococcal attachment occurs, fallopian tube  damage is evident with loss of ciliary activity and sloughing of ciliated cells.  the 2 compounds most likely to be mediators of this damage appear to be gonococcal lipopolysaccharide, which is released from the surface of the organism in the form of outer membrane blebs, as well as monomeric units of peptidoglycan, which are elaborated by the organism. gonococcal attachment and perhaps elaboration of some molecule appear to initiate phagocytosis by non-ciliated epithelial cells. gonococci are transported to the base of the non-ciliated cells and are released into the subepithelial space. this may lead to local disease (salpingitis) or disseminated disease (dermatitis-arthritis). understanding the molecular mechanisms by which gonococci attach to, damage or invade the fallopian tube mucosa may result in identification of ways of preventing gonococcal infections and their sequelae.

TI  == scanning and transmission electron microscopy of bacterial attachment to mucosal  surfaces with particular reference to the human fallopian tube.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis are the common bacteria isolated  from bacterial cervicitis and are the leading etiological agents for pelvic inflammatory disease. neisseria gonorrhoeae cause infection of the mucosa of fallopian tubes in organ culture by attaching to microvilli of nonciliated cells, phagocytosis by these cells, transport across and exocytosis from the epithelial  cells. in contrast the chlamydia attach to the epithelial surface without apparent ligand binding and are taken into the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell.  exocytosis of chlamydia is into the tubal lumen and not into the subepithelial spaces. the ciliated epithelial cells of the fallopian tube are damaged by a gonococcal toxin but chlamydia do not exhibit such activity. these observations suggest that the mechanism of attachment to and invasion of the mucosal epithelium by gonococci and chlamydia are quite different and their potential for disease production occurs by different methods.

AB  == the discovery that penicillinase production in neisseria gonorrhoeae was plasmid  mediated and the spread of the beta-lactamase encoding plasmids in gonococcal isolates since 1976, raise the possibility that a nonpathogenic indigenous bacterium could serve as a reservoir for these plasmids. we initiated studies to  define the ability of commensal neisseria species and branhamella catarrhalis strains, as well as strains of the pathogen neisseria meningitidis, to serve as recipients in conjugation with neisseria gonorrhoeae. we found that with n. gonorrhoeae as the donor, 3 of 5 neisseria cinerea, 2 of 5 neisseria flava, 0 of  1 neisseria flavescens, 1 of 3 neisseria subflava, 0 of 6 b. catarrhalis, 0 of 7  neisseria lactamica, 1 of 5 neisseria mucosa, 1 of 7 neisseria perflava/sicca, and 0 of 13 n. meningitidis strains gave detectable conjugation frequencies (greater than 10(-8). n. cinerea was the only species found to maintain the gonococcal conjugal plasmid (ple2451). a n. cinerea transconjugant containing ple2451 was observed to transfer both the beta-lactamase plasmid and ple2451 to n. gonorrhoeae at high frequency.

AB  == a more complete understanding of meningococcal disease has been hampered by lack  of an appropriate animal model. we subjected 5-day-old guinea pigs, rats, and mice to intranasal challenge with meningococci and we measured rates of bacteremia as a marker of mucosal invasion. after a single intranasal instillation of 10(7) serotype 2 meningococci, positive blood cultures were found in 0% of guinea pigs, 16% of rats, and 39% of mice, and so mice were used for further studies. death occurred in 4% of mice and was associated with a purulent  leptomeningitis and ventriculitis. forty percent of mice had nasopharyngeal colonization which increased to 65% with repeated injections. carrier strains were avirulent, a nonserotype 2 disease strain had low invasiveness, and serotype 2 strains were most virulent. iron dextran increased rates of bacteremia after challenge with serotype 2 strains. adult animals were not susceptible to bacteremia after intranasal challenge. the neonatal mouse model fulfills most of  the criteria for an appropriate experimental model of meningococcal disease.

TI  == [natural reproduction of all stages of a generalized meningococcal infection in mice].
AB  == the present work is based on the direct relationship, revealed in our investigations, between the hyaluronidase activity of meningococcal strains and their capacity to penetrate into the blood and the liquor. the use of the intranasal route (i.e. the natural route) for infecting previously untreated mice with meningococci in the presence of hyaluronidase made it possible to follow the generalized form of meningococcal infection in all its stages from the period of  incubation and microbial invasion to bacteriemia, accompanied by the penetration  of the infective agent into the meninges, and toxinemia. this route of infection  ensured the penetration of the infective agent, but the natural specific resistance of mice to meningococci prevented their multiplication with the subsequent liberation of a sufficient amount of endotoxin killing the animals. to overcome natural immunity and increase toxicity, actinomycin d was injected intraperitoneally in a volume of 0.5 ml (5 gamma) simultaneously with the administration of the microbial culture and hyaluronidase, thus ensuring 40-60% mortality among the animals. our model of the generalized form of meningococcal infection can be used in the study of pathogenesis and for the development of the methods of treatment and microbiological diagnosis.

TI  == mechanisms of mucosal invasion by pathogenic neisseria.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae are transported across the mucosa of human fallopian tubes  in organ culture by mucosal cells. the steps in this process are (1) attachment of gonococci to microvilli of nonciliated cells, (2) phagocytosis of gonococci by these cells, (3) transport of phagocytic vacuoles containing gonococci to the base of the cell, and (4) exocytosis of gonococci with phagocytic vacuoles into the subepithelial tissues. in vivo gonococci in the subepithelial tissues may cause extensive local disease (e.g., salpingitis) or invade blood vessels to cause disseminated disease. preliminary studies of human nasopharyngeal tissue in organ culture infected with neisseria meningitidis indicate that meningococci attach to microvilli of nonciliated cells and are phagocytized by these cells. they subsequently appear in subepithelial tissues, but the route they take is not yet certain. these observations suggest that the mechanisms of attachment to and  penetration of fallopian tube and nasopharyngeal mucosa by n. gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis are similar or possibly identical.

TI  == attachment of pathogenic neisseria to human mucosal surfaces: role in pathogenesis.
AB  == studies of the interaction between neisseria gonorrhoeae and human fallopian tube mucosa in organ culture suggest that attachment of gonococci is important, not only to secure th organism in the host, but also to initiate the disease process. the steps observed in gonococcal infection of fallopian tube organ cultures are:  1) attachment of gonococci to microvilli of nonciliated cells; 2) release from gonococci of lipopolysaccharide and possibly other toxic moities to cause mucosa  damage; 3) engulfment or phagocytosis of gonococci by nonciliated cells; 4) transport of phagocytic vacuoles containing gonococci to the base of the nonciliated cells; and 5) exocytosis of gonococci within phagocytic vacuoles into the subepithelial tissues. in vivo, these steps might result in extensive local disease (e.g. salpingitis) or in the invasion of blood vessels to cause disseminated disease. preliminary studies of human nasopharyngeal tissue in organ culture infected with neisseria meningitidis indicate that meningococci attach to microvilli of nonciliated cells and are phagocytized by these cells. meningococci subsequently appear in subepithelial tissues, though the route they take is not yet certain. these observations suggest at least some of the ways in which attachment may play a role in disease caused by n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis. mechanisms to block this attachment may provide new approaches to the prevention of infections caused by the pathogenic neisseria.

TI  == attachment of neisseria meningitidis to human mucosal surfaces: influence of pili and type of receptor cell.
AB  == the factors that determine attachment of meningococci predominantly to the mucosa of the nasopharynx rather than to other mucosal surfaces are unknown. isolates of neisseria meningitidis from the nasopharynx of carriers and from patients with meningococcal disease were found to be heavily piliated. isogenic piliated and nonpiliated meningococcal clones were derived from blood and cerebrospinal fluid  isolates. meningococci with pili consistently attached to human nasopharyngeal cells in greater numbers than meningococci without pili. meningococci treated with trypsin or mechanical shear forces lost pili and exhibited decreased attachment. attachment of piliated meningococci differed markedly among epithelial cells from different sites. in contrast, nonpiliated meningococci attached equally but in low numbers to all cell types. these data suggest that pili are important mediators of meningococcal attachment. the number and distribution of receptor sites for pili or pili-associated meningococcal ligands  differ among human cells and may determine sites of meningococcal colonization.

AB  == a quantitative research into the aerobic bacteria of human nasal cavities has been carried out; 183 healthy individuals observed, negative results 18 (9.83%).  streptococcus, enterococcus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, micrococcus, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria, were numerically determined and the incidence of each single species or genus exactly specified. among gram-negative bacteria, enterobacter, providencia, proteus, citrobacter freundii, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, serratia, herella, pseudomonas, and among the hyphomycetes, candida albicans have been identified and their number calculated. diphteroid bacteria were also detected and counted; among them, the corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum seemed to be the most frequent and numerous species. finally, interference phenomena in vivo by staphylococcus aureus and environmental and nourishment competition by staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus and diphtheroids were noted.

TI  == toxic activity of purified lipopolysaccharide of neisseria gonorrhoeae for human  fallopian tube mucosa.
AB  == an experimental model of human fallopian tubes in organ culture was used to examine the ability of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of neisseria gonorrhoeae to damage the fallopian tube mucosa. gonococcal lps was purified by hot phenol-water extraction and sequential ultracentrifugation. this lps was highly lethal for lead-sensitized mice and at a concentration as low as 6 pg/ml reproducibly gelled limulus amoebocyte lysate. gonococcal lps damaged fallopian tube mucosa in concentrations as low as 0.015 microgram/ml, a values less than the lps concentration in organ culture medium surrounding fallopian tube mucosa that was  damaged by gonococcal infection. the toxic effect of lps was neutralized by polymyxin b. gonococci were shown to elaborate blebs of outer membrane material that is likely to contain lps. these studies suggest that gonococci elaborate lps-containing material into their surrounding medium, that the lps is capable of mediating damage to human fallopian tube mucosa, and that the production of mucosal damage requires the lipid a portion of the lps molecule.

TI  == studies of toxicity of neisseria gonorrhoeae for human fallopian tube mucosa.
AB  == infection of human fallopian tubes in organ culture with neisseria gonorrhoeae causes extensive damage of the mucosa. filter-sterilized supernatant from gonococci-infected organ cultures produced similar damage in recipient uninfected organ cultures. this observation indicated the presence of one or more toxic factors. the toxic activity was unchanged after heating the supernatant to 85 c and was only partially diminished by dialysis. toxic activity could not be detected in homogenates of uninfected organ cultures but was present in supernatants of gonococcal broth cultures. toxic supernatants from organ cultures contained microgram quantities of gonococcal lipopolysaccharide (lps). amounts of this lps and toxic activity for genital mucosa were both substantially reduced by absorption of the supernatant with limulus amoebocyte lysate. thus, gonococcal lps appears to be responsible for most of the toxicity of filter-sterilized supernatant from gonococci-infected human fallopian tubes in organ culture and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of gonococcal infection in vivo.

TI  == pathogenic mechanisms of neisseria gonorrhoeae: observations on damage to human fallopian tubes in organ culture by gonococci of colony type 1 or type 4.
AB  == the relative virulence of isogenic clones of colony type 1 (t1) (piliated) and colony type 4 (t4) (nonpiliated) gonococci was assessed in organ cultures of human fallopian tubes. the rate of damage to fallopian tube mucosa was determined by measurements of ciliary activity and was correlated with the sequential pathologic events observed by light and electron microscopy. during the first 24  hr of the infection, t1 gonococci attached to and damaged the mucosa more rapidly than did t4 gonococci. this damage was manifested primarily by sloughing of ciliated cells. the observation that gonococci attached almost exclusively to nonciliated cells but damaged primarily ciliated cells suggested that this damage was mediated by one or more toxic factors. after attaching, gonococci entered the nonciliated mucosal cells, increased in numbers inside them, and then invaded the subepithelial tissues. thus, attachment of gonococci to the fallopian tube mucosa may facilitate effective delivery of one or more gonococcal toxins to target cells in the mucosa and may initiate a process by which gonococci traverse the mucosal barrier.

TI  == adherence of neisseria meningitidis to human epithelial cells.
AB  == carrier strains of neisseria meningitidis are recovered almost solely from the posterior pharynx and they are often nongroupable or rough. invasive strains can  be serogrouped (encapsulated). we studied adherence of both carrier- and patient-derived serogroupable and nongroupable meningococci to buccal epithelial  and posterior pharyngeal cells. fresh meningococcal isolates attached significantly better to pharyngeal than to buccal cells (p = 0.01). strains that  could be serogrouped adhered less than nongroupable strains (p less than 0.05). meningococci passed in vitro became hemagglutinin negative and nonpiliated. hemagglutinin-negative meningococci always adhered less to both epithelial cell types than the hemagglutinin-positive variants of the same strain. these results  indicate that meningococcal pili probably mediate attachment to oropharyngeal cells, but encapsulation may reduce adherence. localization of meningococci in the posterior pharynx is in part explained by the receptivity of the epithelial cells in this area for meningococci.

TI  == adhesion of neisseria gonorrhoeae and disease.
AB  == adhesion of gonococci to mucosal epithelial cells appear to be a critical step in the pathogenesis of gonococcal infection. parameters affecting adhesion, the antigens involved in adhesion and the human antibody response that blocks adhesion have been studied. gonococci adhere to a variety of human cells grown either in tissue culture or organ culture or scraped from mucosal surfaces. they  adhere in greatest number to mucosal cells derived from sites of natural infection but buccal mucosal cells were used for most of these studies because of the ease of obtaining them, the homogeneous population obtained, and the similarity of the results of antibody studies with all cell types. the ability of a given strain of gonococci to attach to buccal cells (receptors) varied with the individual from whom the cells were obtained, and the capacity to support adhesion of a given strain fluctuated from day to day. the principal antigens mediating attachment are pili (filamentous protein appendages extending from the  bacterial cell wall) which are antigenically heterogeneous. lipopolysaccharide also blocks attachment but it is less efficient than pili and is not species-specific. other antigens, probably proteins, also block attachment. human antibody (both local and humoral) blocked the adhesion of gonococci. the antibody was directed against pili and the antigens in naturally occurring disease and could be induced by immunizing subjects with purified pili. the results of these  studies suggest two new approaches to the prevention of gonorrhoea: (1) (competitive) inhibition of the adhesion with specific antigens, i.e. pili; and (2) immunization with purified attachment antigens to produce shielding antibodies.

TI  == gonococcal lipopolysaccharide: a toxin for human fallopian tube mucosa.
AB  == gonococci damaged the mucosa of human fallopian tubes in organ culture (ftoc), producing characteristic pathologic features. filter-sterilized supernatant fluid from donor gonococcal-infected ftoc damaged recipient ftoc in a similar fashion.  gonococcal lipopolysaccharide (lps) was detected in these toxic donor fluids in concentrations of 1.2 to 8.3 microgram/ml. purified gonococcal lps in concentrations as low as 0.015 microgram/ml produced damage equivalent to that caused by toxic donor fluid and was neutralized by polymyxin b. such lps-mediated damage to ciliated cells, if it occurs in gonococcal salpingitis, may impair mucociliary flow and predispose to ectopic pregnancy and recurrent ascending infection.

AB  == organ cultures of human and guinea-pig genital mucosa were inoculated with neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the association of the bacteria with the epithelial surface of each tissue was studied by light microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy. gonococci attached to the mucosa of human fallopian tube, adhering specifically to the surface of non-ciliated epithelial cells. in contrast, gonococci rarely attached to the mucosal surface of guinea-pig uterine horn, vagina or bladder, although organisms were occasionally seen associated with the  submucosal tissue in areas where the epithelium had sloughed, and in extracellular mucus secretions. there is no evidence from this study that gonococci adhere to guinea-pig tissue in a manner analogous to that seen with human genital tissue.

TI  == the cohesive properties of variants of neisseria gonorrhoeae strain p9: specific  pilus-mediated and non-specific interactions.
AB  == the cohesive properties of virulent pilated neisseria gonorrhoeae strain p9 (p++) have been compared with those of a non-pilated isogenic variant (p-) possessing the same outer membrane components. the binding of p++ gonococci to buccal epithelial cells was dependent on ph, with an optimum at ph 6.5 to 7.0 . this adhesion was markedly inhibited by treatment of the buccal epithelial cells with  a neuraminidase/exoglycosidase mixture. in contrast, the binding of p++ gonococci to erythrocytes was unaffected by ph. a possible explanation is that pili bind to a carbohydrate receptor present on buccal epithelial cells but lacking on erythrocytes. the adhesion of p- gonococci to erythrocytes and to buccal epithelial cells was unaffected by ph but enhanced by treatment of the cells with neuaminidase or periodate. presumably, neuraminic acid residues on host cell surface carbohydrates inhibit adhesion. the finding that p- gonococci bind to amphipathic gels suggests hydrophobic interactions as a possible non-specific mechanism attaching p- gonococci to host cell surfaces.

TI  == attachment role of gonococcal pili. optimum conditions and quantitation of adherence of isolated pili to human cells in vitro.
AB  == gonoccocal pili facilitate attachment of virulent neisseria gonorrhoeae to human  cells. to characterize this attachment function, purified gonococcal pili isolated from four strains possessing antigenically distinct pili were radiolabeled with 125i and used to measure the attachment of pili to various human cells in vitro. human buccal and cervical-vaginal mucosal epithealial cells, fallopian tube mucosa, and sperm bound pili in greater numbers per micrometer2 of surface area (1--10) than fetal tonsil fibroblasts, hela m cells,  erythrocytes, or polymorphonuclear leukocytes. this cell specificity of attachment suggests a greater density of membrane pili binding sites on cells similar or identical to cells from natural sites of infection. the pili binding sites were quantitated as 1 x 10(4) per cervical-vaginal squamous cell. pili of all antigenic types attached equally to a given cell type, implying that the attachment moiety of each pilus was similar. attachement of gonoccocal pili to human cells occurred quickly with saturation of presumed receptor sites within 20--60 min. attachment was temperature dependent (37 degrees greater than 20 degrees greater than 4 degrees c), and ph dependent (3.5 less than 4.5 less than  5.5 less than 7.5). attachment was inhibited by antibody to pili (homologous pili ab greater than heterologous ab). the extent of possible protection against gonococcal infection due to inhibition of pili-mediated attachment might prove limited as a result of the considerable antigenic heterogeneity among pili and the observation that blockage of pili attachment is maximal only with antibody to pili of the infecting strain.

AB  == an experimental organ culture model has been developed in which rates of damage to fallopian tube mucosa by agents of sexually transmitted diseases can be quantitated. this required assessment of the effect on organ cultures of such variables as the anatomic area of the fallopian tube employed, endocrinological status of the donor, and composition of media. organ cultures established from the ampulla of tubes of nonpregnant, premenopausal women and maintained with eagle minimal essential medium containing 0.05 m n-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-n'-2-ethanesulfonic acid buffer were most suitable for quantitative studies. various means of quantitating damage to fallopian tube mucosa were evaluated. of these, sequential estimations of ciliary vigor and percentage of the periphery of fallopian tube pieces with active cilia proved the most successful. to assess the specificity of the model, fallopian tube organ cultures were infected with neisseria gonorrhoeae or n. pharyngis, a commensal neisseria. damage by n. gonorrhoeae was significantly greater than that by n. pharyngis at each period of observation (p less than 0.001), suggesting that, by  using the model, differences in virulence can be determined in vitro that reflect differences in virulence for humans. this model is a potentially valuable tool for studying the interaction of human genital mucosa with known or suspected agents of sexually transmitted diseases.

TI  == microscopic and baceriologic analysis of expectorated sputum.
AB  == samples of expectorated sputum were examined grossly and microscopically to determine their suitability for bacterial cultures. microscopically, specimens were categorized according to the number of leukocytes and squamous epithelial cells (sec) observed under low-power (times 100) in a gram-stained smear. the mean number of species isolated was greater than 4 from specimens with more than  10 sec per field, 2.7 from specimens with fewer than 10 sec per field, and 2.4 from transtracheal aspirates. oropharyngeal flora was isolated from nearly all of the specimens with more than 10 sec per field, and potential pathogens were found in less than 15% of such specimens. the bacterial flora of specimens with fewer than 10 sec per field closely resembled that of transtracheal aspirates.

TI  == [how fastidious are the so-called non-fastidious neisseriae? (author's transl)].
AB  == 75 strains of all the so-called non-fastidious neisseria species were examined for their ability to grow on blood and nutrient agar at temperatures between 22 degrees c and 45 degrees c. the result was that only neisseria mucosa var. mucosa, n. catarrhalis, n. ovis and n. canis grow sufficiently on nutrient agar at 22 degrees c. n. lactamica has an even narrower range of of growth (30-37 degrees c) than meningococci. therefore, the statement in bergey's mnaual that the saprophytic neisseriae can be separated from the pathogenic species by their  minor needs for temperature and media should be corrected.

TI  == nasal bacterial flora of calves in healthy and in pneumonia-prone herds.
AB  == an enclosed swab assembly was employed in a survey of 790 samples of nasal mucus  collected from calves in 12 herds. it was possible to classify the nasal bacterial flora of calves in three components, basal, supplementary and transient. the potential pathogens, p. multocia, and p.hemolytica, together with  micrococci, saprophytic neisseria and a streptococcus composed the basal flora and were judged to be widely distributed in the cattle population.a special bacteriological-statistical formula was employed to quantitatively classify the populations of several bacterial species. enzootic pneumonia of calves was not found to be associated with a characteristic nasal bacterial flora; in contrast,  cases of bacterial pneumonia in a well-managed "pool" herd of young bulls were regularly associated with the isolation of p. hemolytica from the nasal secretion. pasteurella species were capable of dominating the flora for periods of several days at a time in what was judged to be a state of active colonization of the nasal muscosa with shedding of the organisms in large numbers. this state  of active colonization did not fore-tell the likelihood of the development of pneumonia in affected calves; periodic suppression of p. hemolytica was observed  in closely studied calves.

TI  == fatty acid composition of neisseria species as determined by gas chromatography.
AB  == duplicate cultures of 53 strains representing 9 species of neisseria were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography for cellular fatty acids. n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. flavescens, n. perflava, n. subflava, and the several serotypes of n. meningitidis examined were found to comprise a fairly homogeneous group on the basis of the percentages of individual fatty acids present. lactose-fermenting neisseria also were in this group. n. catarrhalis, however, contained decanoic acid in addition to the acids occurring in the other species.  moreover, the 18 c-saturated and monoenoic acids together constituted 36% of the  total fatty acid composition for n. catarrhalis, while the comparable mean value  for the other species was less than 13%.
