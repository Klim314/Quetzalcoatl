TI  == restrictive reporting of selected antimicrobial susceptibilities influences clinical prescribing.
AB  == background: cascade and restrictive reporting are useful strategies to enhance antibiotic stewardship programs. methods: we combined both strategies to improve  the prescribing of antibiotics aimed at gram-negative infections. results: for enterobacter aerogenes, the susceptibility rates to amikacin increased from 10% to 100%; for third generation cephalosporins, these rates increased from 55% to 89%. the susceptibility rates of e. aerogenes to cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam changed little, and the ampicillin susceptibility decreased from 30% in 2009 to 11% in 2010. for proteus mirabilis, the susceptibility rates increased for third-generation cephalosporins (48% vs. 92%)  and piperacillin-tazobactam (10% vs. 98%), with minimal changes for cefepime (96% vs. 93%), ampicillin (69% vs. 73%) and amikacin (96% vs. 84%). for pseudomonas aeruginosa, the susceptibility rates improved slightly for third-generation cephalosporins (81% vs. 91%) but reduced for piperacillin-tazobactam (99% vs. 59%). hospital-acquired clostridium difficile infections decreased from 0.11 to 0.07 per 1000 patient days. conclusions: selective reporting helps physicians choose the most appropriate antibiotics for their patients within a stewardship program, with reduced c. difficile infection.

TI  == epidemiological surveillance of bacterial nosocomial infections in the surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == introduction: intensive care units (icus) are associated with a greater risk of developing nosocomial infections (nis) than other departments. aim: the aim of this study was to determine the rate, the site and causative organisms of nis in  the surgical icu at university clinical center tuzla. methods: all patients admitted to the surgical icu were followed prospectively, for the development of  nis (january-december 2010). determination of nis was performed using standardized the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) criteria. results: 94 out of 834 patients (11.27%) developed nis. respiratory tract infections were seen in 56 (60%), urinary tract infections in 15 (16%) and gastrointestinal tract infections in 8 (9%) patients. other infections identified were surgical site, bloodstream and skin infections. gram-negative organisms were reported in approximately 75% of cases (78.7% extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producers). klebsiella pneumoniae was the commonest (51.0%), followed by proteus mirabilis (21.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.6%). methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (16%), and clostridium difficile (9.6%) were the commonest among gram-positive bacteria. conclusion: respiratory and urinary tract infections made up the great majority of nis. icu patients are more susceptible to nis, emphasizing the importance of continuous surveillance and enforcement of specific infection control measures.

TI  == american journal of gastroenterology lecture: intestinal microbiota and the role  of fecal microbiota transplant (fmt) in treatment of c. difficile infection.
AB  == the vital roles that intestinal flora, now called microbiota, have in maintaining our health are being increasingly appreciated. starting with birth, exposure to the outside world begins the life-long intimate association our microbiota will have with our diet and environment, and initiates determination of the post-natal structural and functional maturation of the gut. moreover, vital interactions of  the microbiota with our metabolic activities, as well as with the immunological apparatus that constitutes our major defense system against foreign antigens continues throughout life. a perturbed intestinal microbiome has been associated  with an increasing number of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal diseases including clostridium difficile infection (cdi). it has become recognized that fecal microbiota transplantation (fmt) can correct the dysbiosis that characterizes chronic cdi, and effect a seemingly safe, relatively inexpensive, and rapidly effective cure in the vast majority of patients so treated. in addition, fmt has been used to treat an array of other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal disorders, although experience in these other non-cdi diseases is in its infancy. more work needs to be done with fmt to ensure its safety and optimal route of administration. there is a conceptual sea change that is developing in our view of bacteria from their role only as pathogens to that of being critical to health maintenance in a changing world. future studies are certain to narrow the spectrum of organisms that need to be given to patients to  cure disease. fmt is but the first step in this journey.

TI  == failure of tigecycline to treat severe clostridium difficile infection.
AB  == clostridium difficile infection is an emerging and often difficult-to-treat iatrogenic complication. recent data suggest that tigecycline, a novel antibiotic with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, can be used successfully to treat patients with severe clostridium difficile infection. we report a 70-year-old man who developed severe clostridium difficile infection, was admitted to the intensive care unit and eventually succumbed to complications of his illness despite receiving tigecycline for approximately three weeks in combination with vancomycin, metronidazole and intravenous immunoglobulin. additionally, we discuss the unique challenges that emerged during tigecycline treatment, such as  the development of proteus mirabilis bacteraemia and of colonisation with acinetobacter baumannii resistant to tigecycline. finally, we review data on other cases reported in the medical literature. even though tigecycline looks promising for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection, we urge caution against its indiscriminate use for off label indications.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxins a and b can alter epithelial permeability and promote bacterial paracellular migration through ht-29 enterocytes.
AB  == clostridium difficile toxins a and b are the widely recognized etiologic agents of antibiotic-associated diseases ranging from diarrhea to pseudomembranous colitis. we hypothesized that c. difficile toxins may alter intestinal epithelial permeability and facilitate bacterial penetration of the intestinal epithelial barrier. experiments were designed to clarify the effects of c. difficile toxins  a and b on the flux of inert particles across ht-29 enterocyte monolayers, and to correlate these results with bacteria-enterocyte interactions. in all experiments, mature, confluent ht-29 cultures were preincubated 16 h with toxin a or b (1-100 ng/ml). to study alterations in epithelial permeability, toxin-treated enterocytes were incubated with 5 pm solutions of 10- and 40-kd inert dextran particles. toxin a, but not toxin b, was associated with increased  dextran flux through enterocyte monolayers. to study bacteria-enterocyte interactions, toxin-treated enterocytes were incubated with 10(8) salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, or escherichia coli. although numbers of internalized bacteria were generally unaffected, both toxins were associated with increased bacterial adherence, as well as increased bacterial transmigration through enterocyte monolayers. bacterial transmigration was significantly greater using toxin a- compared to toxin b-treated enterocytes, consistent with the observation that dextran flux was significantly greater using toxin a- compared to toxin b-treated enterocytes. thus intestinal colonization with toxigenic c. difficile may facilitate bacterial penetration of the intestinal epithelium by a  mechanism involving increased permeability of the intestinal epithelial barrier.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxins may augment bacterial penetration of intestinal epithelium.
AB  == background: clostridium difficile can be recovered from many high-risk hospitalized patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy. clostridium difficile toxins a and b have been associated with increased intestinal permeability in vitro and there is growing evidence that increased intestinal permeability may be a common mechanism whereby enteric bacteria penetrate the intestinal epithelium. hypothesis: clostridium difficile-induced alterations in the intestinal barrier facilitate microbial penetration of the intestinal epithelium, which in turn facilitates the translocation of intestinal bacteria. design: mature caco-2 enterocytes were pretreated with varying concentrations of  toxin a or toxin b followed by 1 hour of incubation with pure cultures of either  salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, or proteus mirabilis. the effects of toxins a and b on enterocyte viability, cytoskeletal actin, and ultrastructural topography were assessed using vital dyes, fluorescein-labeled phalloidin, and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. the toxins' effects on bacterial adherence and bacterial internalization by cultured enterocytes were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative culture, respectively. epithelial permeability was assessed by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance and by quantifying paracellular bacterial movement through caco-2 enterocytes cultivated on permeable supports. results: neither toxin a nor toxin  b had a measurable effect on the numbers of enteric bacteria internalized by caco-2 enterocytes; however, both toxins were associated with alterations in enterocyte actin, decreased transepithelial electrical resistance, and increased  bacterial adherence and paracellular transmigration. conclusion: clostridium difficile toxins a or b may facilitate bacterial adherence and penetration of the intestinal epithelial barrier.

TI  == antimicrobial activities of synthetic bismuth compounds against clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen responsible for pseudomembranous colitis and many cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea. because of potential relapse of disease with current antimicrobial therapy protocols, there is a need for additional and/or alternative antimicrobial agents for the treatment of disease caused by c. difficile. we have synthesized a systematic series of 14 structurally simple bismuth compounds and assessed their  biological activities against c. difficile and four other gastrointestinal species, including helicobacter pylori. here, we report on the activities of six  compounds that exhibit antibacterial activities against c. difficile, and some of the compounds have mics of less than 1 microgram/ml. also tested, for comparison, were the activities of bismuth subcitrate and ranitidine bismuth citrate obtained from commercial sources. c. difficile and h. pylori were more sensitive both to the synthetic bismuth compounds and to the commercial products than were escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis, and the last three species were markedly resistant to the commercial bismuth salts. testing with human foreskin fibroblast cells revealed that some of the synthetic compounds were more cytotoxic than others. killing curves for c. difficile treated with the more active compounds revealed rapid death, and electron microscopy showed that the bismuth of these compounds was rapidly incorporated by c. difficile. energy dispersive spectroscopy x-ray microanalysis of c. difficile  cells containing electron-dense material confirmed the presence of internalized bismuth. internalized bismuth was not observed in c. difficile treated with synthetic bismuth compounds that lacked antimicrobial activity, which suggests that the uptake of the metal is required for killing activity. the nature of the  carrier would seem to determine whether bismuth is transported into susceptible bacteria like c. difficile.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of bo-3482, a novel dithiocarbamate carbapenem with activity  against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  == bo-3482, a dithiocarbamate carbapenem, inhibited clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococci (mrs) at 6.25 microg/ml (mic at which 90% of  isolates tested are inhibited [mic90]), while the mic90 of imipenem was > 100 microg/ml. bo-3482 was generally less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, streptococci, enterococci, and gram-negative bacteria, although bo-3482 showed better activity (mic90) than imipenem against enterococcus faecium, haemophilus influenzae, proteus mirabilis, and clostridium difficile. the affinities (50% inhibitory concentrations) of bo-3482 for penicillin-binding protein (pbp) pbp 2' of mrs and pbp 5 of e. faecium (both pbps have low affinities for ordinary beta-lactam antibiotics) were 3.8 and 20 microg/ml, respectively, reflecting the greater activity of bo-3482 against mrs than against e. faecium.

TI  == review of in vitro activity, pharmacokinetic characteristics, safety, and clinical efficacy of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == objective: to review the pharmacokinetics, microbiology, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerance of cefprozil, a new, broad-spectrum oral cephalosporin. data sources: published clinical trials and microbiologic, pharmacokinetic, and safety data were identified by medline; additional references were derived from bibliographies of these articles; microbiologic data on file were provided by bristol-myers squibb. study selection: only published comparative clinical trial  reports are included in the review of clinical efficacy. noncomparative clinical  data pertaining to uses of cefprozil not approved by the food and drug administration are not included. data synthesis: data are presented on the in vitro microbiologic activity of cefprozil against 10,152 bacterial isolates, including most of the clinically important streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae), beta-lactamase-positive and -negative staphylococcus aureus and haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, clostridium difficile, and numerous other gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. in clinical trials, cefprozil appears to be  at least as effective as commonly used comparison agents such as cefaclor, cefixime, and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. additionally, cefprozil is better tolerated than the latter two agents, especially with regard to gastrointestinal  adverse effects. conclusions: cefprozil is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin that provides coverage against both gram-negative and -positive bacteria that may cause otitis media, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, skin and skin-structure infections,  secondary bacterial infection of acute bronchitis, and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. the beta-lactamase stability of cefprozil appears to exceed that of other oral cephalosporins for some important pathogens. cefprozil is used primarily for second-line treatment as less-expensive, first-line generic alternatives generally are available. cefprozil demonstrates clinical advantages over many other orally administered beta-lactam antibiotics in terms of antimicrobial spectrum, a once- or twice-daily dosing regimen, and/or reduced incidence of adverse effects.

TI  == review of the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefprozil, a new oral cephalosporin.
AB  == cefprozil is a newer oral cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity against organisms that include gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. a review of published data shows that cefprozil is active (susceptibility, less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml; moderate susceptibility, 16 micrograms/ml; resistance, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml) against gram-positive species such as  streptococci, methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, and listeria monocytogenes;  it may have marginal activity against some enterococci. among the gram-negative species, cefprozil has activity against escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. for anaerobic species, cefprozil has activity against clostridial species, including clostridium difficile, peptostreptococci, and possibly bacteroides melaninogenicus and eubacterium. the  activity of cefprozil is generally greater than that of cephalexin and generally  similar to that of cefaclor. in these reports, cefprozil showed more in vitro activity than cephalexin and cefaclor against penicillin-resistant pneumococci, penicillin-resistant viridans streptococci, beta-lactamase-positive methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, and c. difficile, although the clinical significance of some of these differences has yet to be studied.

TI  == nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase encoded  by the plasmid pscs7 from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene (cat) and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pscs7 from staphylococcus aureus, was determined. the structural cat gene encoded a protein of 209 amino acids, which represented one monomer of the enzyme chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat). comparisons between the amino acid sequences of the pscs7-encoded cat from s. aureus and the previously sequenced cat variants from s. aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, staphylococcus haemolyticus, bacillus pumilis, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and proteus mirabilis were performed. an alignment of cat amino acid sequences demonstrated the presence of 34 conserved amino acids among all cat variants. these conserved residues were considered for their possible roles in the structure and function of cat. on the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic  tree was constructed. it demonstrated relatively large evolutionary distances between the cat variants of enteric bacteria, clostridium, bacillus, and staphylococcus species.

TI  == open trial of cefepime (bmy 28142) for infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of cefepime, a new broad-spectrum, semisynthetic parenteral cephem antibiotic, were evaluated in an open trial at a single hospital. seventy patients were treated with cefepime: 44 had lower respiratory tract infections, 4 had urinary tract infections, and 22 had skin or soft tissue  infections. of 65 clinically evaluable patients, 64 (98%) had satisfactory responses. no mortality or superinfections occurred. of 57 respiratory and urinary tract pathogens, 54 (95%) were eradicated and 3 (5%) persisted after therapy. five bacteremias (two with streptococcus pneumoniae and one each with staphylococcus aureus, proteus mirabilis, and a coagulase-negative staphylococcus) were eradicated. mics ranged from 1 to 8 micrograms/ml for 13 s.  aureus and 9 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and were less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 10 streptococcal isolates. adverse effects occurred in two patients: transient diarrhea and clostridium difficile toxin in the stool in one  patient and loose bowel movements and increased transaminases in the other patient. cefepime appeared to be well tolerated in humans and was effective against a wide range of isolates, including s. aureus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == [in vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  == imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and providencia (1 mu/ml). the mics of  cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. imipenem  also exhibited satisfactory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against acinetobacter (mode mic 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). the mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.5) for haemophilus and from 0.25  to 1 micrograms/ml for neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. the mics for n. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode mic 0.016). the mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). the mics for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode mic 1-2). with the exception of clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode mic 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for bacteroides fragilis).

TI  == review of the in vitro spectrum of activity of imipenem.
AB  == imipenem (n-formimidoyl thienamycin, mk0787), a new carbapenem was found to have  the widest antimicrobial activity of currently available beta-lactam drugs. enterobacteriaceae had minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem of 8.0 micrograms/ml or less for 99.8 percent of clinical isolates. only rare strains of enterobacter species and proteus mirabilis have higher imipenem minimal inhibitory concentration results. hemophilus and neisseria species were inhibited, but minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem were higher than those reported for third-generation cephalosporins. only pseudomonas maltophilia  and pseudomonas cepacia strains were imipenem resistant (mic50 greater than 32 micrograms/ml) among the commonly isolated non-enteric gram-negative bacilli. all anaerobes were found susceptible to imipenem with the exception of some strains of clostridium difficile. staphylococcus species and non-enterococcal streptococci were very susceptible to imipenem. streptococcus faecalis had higher minimal inhibitory concentrations of imipenem (mic90 3.1 micrograms/ml) and s. faecium strains were frankly resistant. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates  had a mic90 of 27.2 micrograms imipenem/ml. imipenem was generally bactericidal except for marked minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentration differences with enterococci, listeria, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, and  some p. aeruginosa strains. the minimal inhibitory and minimal bactericidal concentrations of imipenem were not significantly influenced by organism inoculum size, probably because of its beta-lactamase stability to nearly all commonly encountered bacterial enzymes. imipenem was found to be an excellent inhibitor of beta-lactamases and a potent enzyme inducer. the induction characteristic seems responsible for the antagonistic interactions of imipenem with some enzyme-labile beta-lactams in combination. imipenem had limited stability in some in vitro susceptibility test systems. the 10 micrograms disk test or dry-form broth micro-dilution systems were preferred, applying the interpretive criteria from the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (m2-a3). imipenem-resistant strains were rarely found in clinical practice and bacteria resistant to newer beta-lactams and aminoglycosides were generally very susceptible to this new carbapenem.

TI  == [multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (n-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. imipenem proved highly active against enterobacteriaceae, with an mic less than or equal to 0.25  for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. the different groups of enterobacteriaceae exhibited  similar mode mics (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of serratia (0.25-0.5), p. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive proteus (2), and providencia (1). mics of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. imipenem also  exhibited satisfactory activity against p. aeruginosa (mode mic 1-2) and acinetobacter sp. (mode mic: 0.25-0.5). mics ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode mic: 0.5) for haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. mics for meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low mics, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode mic : 0.016); mics for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely,  from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees c. streptococci, except for enterococci, and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); mics for enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode mic: 1-2). except  for four c. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode mics: 0.06 for c. perfringens and 0.03 for b. fragilis).

TI  == competitive effects of intestinal microflora on vibrio cholerae in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the coexistence of vibrio cholerae and several intestinal bacteria was determined in gnotobiotic mice. the bacteria tested included a bacteroides sp, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens type a, 2 separate isolates of escherichia coli, 2 different lactobacilli, 2 separate isolates of proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas maltophilia, and streptococcus faecalis. each species of bacteria became established and was recovered repeatedly from the stools during the studies. no single strain or species was found that would eliminate v cholerae from these mice within 2 wk. not until a combination of e coli, p mirabilis, and  s faecalis was present in the mice did v cholerae disappear from the stools in 14 da.
