TI  - Effects of Ensiling Fermentation and Aerobic Deterioration on the Bacterial Community in Italian Ryegrass, Guinea Grass, and Whole-crop Maize Silages Stored at High Moisture Content.
AB  - The effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in Italian ryegrass (IR), guinea grass (GG), and whole-crop maize (WM) silages. Direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-Butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the IR, GG, and WM silages, respectively. The acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of GG ensiling. Pantoea agglomerans, Rahnella aquatilis, and Enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the IR silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. Staphylococcus sciuri and Bacillus pumilus were detected when IR silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community at silo opening. Lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the GG silage. Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus brevis, and Morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. Enterobacter cloacae appeared when the GG silage was spoiled. In the WM silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. Throughout the ensiling, Weissella paramesenteroides, Weissella confusa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. lactis. Upon deterioration, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Klebsiella variicola, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Bacillus gibsonii were detected. These results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling and aerobic spoilage of IR, GG, and WM silages.
TI  - Seasonally variable intestinal metagenomes of the red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus  ferrugineus).
AB  - The intestinal microbes residing in the red palm weevil (RPW, Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) larva consume tender interior fibrous tissues of date palm trunks. The understanding of such microbiota at molecular level provides vital clues for the biological control of this devastating pest. Using pyrosequencing and shotgun strategy, we first study taxonomic profiles of the microbiota sampled at different months (March, July and November), and then confirm the impact of high-temperature stress on the microbial populations based on data from 16S rRNA amplicons using both field and laboratory samples. We further identify Klebsiella pneumoniae in November and Lactococcus lactis in July as the dominant species of the microbiota. We find that the RPW gut microbiota degrades polysaccharides and sucrose with hydrolases and that different active bacterial species in November and July are responsible for the symbiotic relationship between the microbiota and the host. Our results provide vital information for pest control and cellulolytic bacterial species characterization.
TI  - Production of 2-butanol from crude glycerol by a genetically-engineered Klebsiella pneumoniae strain.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae was engineered to produce 2-butanol from crude glycerol as  a sole carbon source by expressing acetolactate synthase (ilvIH), keto-acid reducto-isomerase (ilvC) and dihydroxy-acid dehydratase (ilvD) from K. pneumoniae, and alpha-ketoisovalerate decarboxylase (kivd) and alcohol dehydrogenase (adhA) from Lactococcus lactis. Engineered K. pneumonia, ldhA/pBR-iBO (ilvIH-ilvC-ilvD-kivd-adhA), produced 2-butanol (160 mg l-1) from crude glycerol. To increase the yield of 2-butanol, we eliminated the 2,3-butanediol pathway from the recombinant strain by inactivating alpha-acetolactate decarboxylase (adc). This further engineering step improved the yield of 2-butanol from 160 to 320 mg l-1. This represents the first successful attempt to produce 2-butanol from crude glycerol.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Screening of lactic-acid bacteria from South African barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  - Strains of Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain ST11BR), L. pentosus  (strain ST151BR), L. plantarum (strain ST13BR), and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain ST34BR) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the Western, Northern and Eastern provinces of South Africa. The peptides (bacST11BR, bacST151BR, bacST13BR and bacST34BR) lost their activity after treatment with proteinase K, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. The peptides inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus casei, L. sakei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis, but not Enterobacter cloacae, Lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. salivarius, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus uberis, S. agalactiae, S. caprinus and S. pneumoniae. Peptides bacST11BR and bacST13BR differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill Klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the E. coli strains. Peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at pH 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees C. When autoclaved (121 degrees C, 20 min), only bacST13BR lost its activity. The bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees C, but not at 37 degrees C.
TI  - Membrane potential-generating malate (MleP) and citrate (CitP) transporters of lactic acid bacteria are homologous proteins. Substrate specificity of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporter family.
AB  - Membrane potential generation via malate/lactate exchange catalyzed by the malate carrier (MleP) of Lactococcus lactis, together with the generation of a pH gradient via decarboxylation of malate to lactate in the cytoplasm, is a typical example of a secondary proton motive force-generating system. The mleP gene was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in a malolactic fermentation-deficient L. lactis strain. Functional analysis revealed the same properties as observed in membrane vesicles of a malolactic fermentation-positive strain. MleP belongs to a family of secondary transporters in which the citrate carriers from Leuconostoc mesenteroides (CitP) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (CitS) are found also. CitP, but not CitS, is also involved in membrane potential generation via electrogenic citrate/lactate exchange. MleP, CitP, and CitS were analyzed for their substrate specificity. The 2-hydroxycarboxylate motif R1R2COHCOOH, common to the physiological substrates, was found to be essential for transport although some 2-oxocarboxylates could be transported to a lesser extent. Clear differences in substrate specificity among the transporters were observed because of different tolerances toward the R substituents at the C2 atom. Both MleP and CitP transport a broad range of 2-hydroxycarboxylates with R substituents ranging in size from two hydrogen atoms (glycolate) to acetyl and methyl groups (citromalate) for MleP and two acetyl groups (citrate) for CitP. CitS was much less tolerant and transported only citrate and at a low rate citromalate. The substrate specificities are discussed in the context of the physiological function of the transporters.
TI  - Antitermination of transcription of catabolic operons.
AB  - Antitermination of transcription mediated by proteins interacting with mRNA sequences is described for nine operons/regulons. Eight of the systems are catabolic, while the ninth, the Klebsiella pneumoniae nas regulon, is involved in the assimilation of nitrate and nitrite. Six of the catabolic operons/regulons are found in Bacillus subtilis, one is found in Escherichia coli, and one in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antitermination system of five of the operons/regulons (E. coli blg, and sacPA, sacB, bgl, and lic from B. subtilis) are assigned to the bgl-sac family on the basis of extensive similarities with regard to antiterminator proteins and the sequences of the antiterminators. Other members of the bgl-sac family are the arb operon of Erwinia chrysanthemi and a presumed bgl operon of Lactococcus lactis. The antitermination systems of the other four operons/regulons (B. subtilis glp, B. subtilis hut, P. aeruginosa ami, and K. pneumoniae nas) seem to be unrelated both to the bgl-sac family and to each other. The antiterminator protein of the B. subtilis glp regulon has been found not only to cause antitermination but also to stabilize the resultant mRNA and to mediate glucose repression. If other antiterminator proteins, and antitermination factors, also prove to have additional functions, it will broaden the impact of antitermination as a means of controlling gene expression.
TI  - Membrane topology of the sodium ion-dependent citrate carrier of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Evidence for a new structural class of secondary transporters.
AB  - The predicted secondary structure model of the sodium ion-dependent citrate carrier of Klebsiella pneumoniae (CitS) presents the 12-transmembrane helix motif observed for many secondary transporters. Biochemical evidence presented in this paper is not consistent with this model. N-terminal and C-terminal fusions of CitS with the biotin acceptor domain of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase of K. pneumoniae catalyze citrate transport, showing the correct folding of the CitS part of the fusion proteins in the membrane. Proteolysis experiments with these fusion proteins revealed that the N terminus of CitS is located in the cytoplasm, while the C terminus faces the periplasm. The membrane topology was studied further by constructing a set of 20 different fusions of N-terminal fragments of the citrate transporter with the reporter enzyme alkaline phosphatase (CitS-PhoA fusions). Most fusion points were selected in hydrophilic areas flanking the putative transmembrane-spanning domains in CitS that are predicted from the hydropathy profile of the primary sequence. The alkaline phosphatase activities of cells expressing the CitS-PhoA fusions suggest that the polypeptide traverses the membrane nine times and that the C-terminal half of the protein is characterized by two large hydrophobic periplasmic loops and two large hydrophilic cytoplasmic loops. CitS belongs to the family of the 2-hydroxycarboxylate transporters in which also the citrate carriers, CitPs, of lactic acid bacteria and the malate transporter, MleP, of Lactococcus lactis are found. Since the hydrophobicity profile of CitS is very similar to the hydrophobicity profiles of CitP and MleP, it is most likely that the new structural motif of nine transmembrane segments is shared within this new transporter family.
TI  - Cloning, DNA sequence, and regulation of expression of a gene encoding beta-galactosidase from Lactococcus lactis.
AB  - The beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli is one of the most important enzymes in molecular biology. Here we report the cloning and sequencing of a gene encoding beta-galactosidase from Lactococcus lactis and compare the predicted amino acid sequence to that from other organisms. The beta-galactosidase from L. lactis was found to be a protein of 996 residues with 68.7% similarity to the E. coli enzyme and 65.8% similarity to the enzyme from Klebsiella pneumoniae. The lactococcal beta-galactosidase has lower similarity (approx 55%) to the enzymes from other lactic acid bacteria and no significant similarity to the beta-galactosidase enzymes from Agrobacterium radiobacter, Bacillus stearothermophilus, or Clostridium thermosulfurogenes. Expression of the lacZ gene from L. lactis was found to be higher when cells were grown in medium containing lactose than when grown in glucose, and expression was higher when cells were grown at 30 degrees C than at 35 degrees C.
TI  - Growth and Energy Generation by Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis during Citrate Metabolism.
AB  - Growth of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis was observed on media with citrate as the only energy source. At pH 5.6, steady state was achieved in a chemostat on a citrate-containing medium in the absence of a carbohydrate. Under these conditions, pyruvate, acetate, and some acetoin and butanediol were the main fermentation products. This indicated that energy was conserved in L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis during citrate metabolism and presumably during the conversion of citrate into pyruvate. The presumed energy-conserving step, decarboxylation of oxaloacetate, was studied in detail. Oxaloacetate decarboxylase was purified to homogeneity and characterized. The enzyme has a native molecular mass of approximately 300 kDa and consists of three subunits of 52, 34, and 12 kDa. The enzyme is apparently not sodium dependent and does not contain a biotin moiety, and it seems to be different from the energy-generating oxaloacetate decarboxylase from Klebsiella pneumoniae. Energy-depleted L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis cells generated a membrane potential and a pH gradient immediately upon addition of citrate, whereas ATP formation was slow and limited. In contrast, lactose energization resulted in rapid ATP formation and gradual generation of a proton motive force. These data were confirmed during studies on amino acid uptake. alpha-Aminoisobutyrate uptake was rapid but glutamate uptake was slow in citrate-energized cells, whereas lactose-energized cells showed the reverse tendency. These data suggest that, in L. lactis subsp. lactis bv. diacetylactis, a proton motive force could be generated during citrate metabolism as a result of electrogenic citrate uptake or citrate/product exchange together with proton consumption by the intracellular oxaloacetate decarboxylase.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and functional properties of a sodium-dependent citrate transport system from Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - The gene of the sodium-dependent citrate transport system from Klebsiella pneumoniae (citS) is located on plasmid pES3 (Schwarz, E., and Oesterhelt, D. (1985) EMBO J. 4, 1599-1603) and encodes a 446-amino acid protein. Transport of citrate via this citrate transport protein (CitS) is dependent on the presence of sodium ions and is inhibited by magnesium ions. The delta pH (pH gradient across the membrane) is the major driving force for uptake. It is postulated that, in analogy with the proton-dependent citrate carrier (CitH) of K. pneumoniae (van der Rest, M. E., Abee, T., Molenaar, D., and Konings, W. N. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 195, 71-77), only one of the protonated species of citrate is recognized by CitS and that citrate is translocated across the membrane in symport with protons and sodium ions. The hydrophobicity profile of CitS suggests that the protein is very hydrophobic and contains 12 membrane-spanning segments. These segments are not centered around a hydrophilic core as has been suggested for other transport proteins, but the protein is asymmetrical with seven transmembrane segments in front of a large hydrophilic loop and five after this loop. The amino acid sequence is highly similar to a citrate transport system of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis var. diacetylactis (CitP) (David, S., van der Rest, M. E., Driessen, A. J. M., Simons, G., and de Vos, W. M. (1990) J. Bacteriol. 172, 5789-5794) and less similar to CitH of K. pneumoniae. We conclude that the citS gene of K. pneumoniae encodes a sodium-dependent citrate transport system that belongs to a novel subclass of transport proteins.
TI  - Silver-coated nylon fiber as an antibacterial agent.
AB  - A blend of nylon fiber and silver-coated nylon fiber (the latter known as X-static) was used in these experiments. This fiber was bactericidal when bacteria were exposed to it directly or to an extract derived from its prior incubation in salt solution. At ambient temperatures, a rapid exponential decrease of survival occurred, usually after a delay of approximately 1 h. The rate of killing (decrease of survival) increased with an increase in X-static percentage of the fiber blend, temperature of fiber extraction, concentration of Tris buffer present during extraction, and temperature at which bacteria were exposed to the extract. When bacteria were exposed to the extract at 37 degrees C as opposed to ambient temperature, there was no delay in onset of killing. Escherichia coli was generally the indicator organism tested, but comparable results were also found for Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus, and Streptococcus species. The rate of killing increased with increasing silver ion concentration of the fiber extract, as determined through atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The rate of killing was greater and the onset was earlier with an extract containing silver ions from fiber than with a salt solution containing the same concentration of silver ions from silver nitrate. Studies of the kinetics of ion release suggested that X-static may be an effective, sustained-release antibacterial agent.
