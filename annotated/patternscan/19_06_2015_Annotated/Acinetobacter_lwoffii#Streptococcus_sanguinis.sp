TI  == [a clinical evaluation of sultamicillin fine granules in the treatment of meibomianitis].
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and the safety of sultamicillin (sbtpc) fine granules in the treatment of patients with meibomianitis. a dose of 375 mg sbtpc granules was orally given to 10 patients with meibomianitis after each meal, three times a day. the results obtained are summarized as follows. efficacies were rated as good in 7 cases, fair in 2 and poor in 1 with an efficacy ratio of 70.0%. no side effects were observed throughout the study. the organisms isolated were gram-positive bacteria such as  staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, coagulase negative staphylococcus and streptococcus sanguis, and gram-negative bacteria such as alcaligenes denitrificans subsp. denitrificans, alcaligenes denitrificans subsp.  xylosoxidans, xanthomonas maltophilia and acinetobacter lwoffii. a bacteriological study showed lower mics of sbtpc than those of ampicillin (abpc), suggesting that sbtpc has more potent antibacterial activity than abpc. such bacteriological activity of sbtpc was well reflected in its clinical efficacy; the drug was effective in patients with infections caused by organisms moderately or highly resistant to abpc or cefaclor.
