TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == development of in vitro denture biofilm models for halitosis related bacteria and their application in testing the efficacy of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == objective: since dentures can serve as a reservoir for halitosis-causing oral bacteria, halitosis development is a concern for denture wearers. in this study,  we surveyed the prevalence of four selected halitosis-related species (fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, veillonella atypica and klebsiella pneumoniae) in clinical denture plaque samples, and developed denture  biofilm models for these species in vitro to facilitate assessment of antimicrobial treatment efficacy. design : denture plaque from ten healthy and ten denture stomatitis patients was screened for the presence of aforementioned four species by pcr. biofilm formation by these halitosis-associated species on the surfaces of denture base resin (dbr) discs was evaluated by crystal violet staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. the efficacy of denture cleanser treatment on these mono-species biofilms was evaluated by colony counting. results : 80% of the subjects in the denture stomatitis group and 60% in the healthy group contained at least one of the targeted halitosis-related species in their denture plaque. all halitosis species tested were able to form biofilms on  dbr disc surfaces to varying degrees. these in vitro mono-species resin biofilm models were used to evaluate the efficacy of denture cleansers, which exhibited differential efficacies. when forming biofilms on resin surfaces, the halitosis-related species displayed enhanced resistance to denture cleansers compared with their planktonic counterparts. conclusion : the four selected halitosis-related bacterial species examined in this study are present on the majority of dentures. the mono-species biofilm models established on dbr discs for these species are an efficient screening tool for dental product evaluation.

TI  == bacterial profile of aggressive periodontitis in morocco: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: aggressive periodontitis (agp) is one of the most severe forms of periodontal diseases. in morocco, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans has been  strongly associated with agp, however limited knowledge is available about the implication of other periodontal pathogens in this entity. therefore, the main aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the subgingival microbiota in moroccan patients with agp. methods: subgingival plaque samples were collected from 50 aggressive, 13 localized and 37 generalized periodontitis patients. samples from 20 chronic periodontitis (chp) patients were taken as controls. samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were  pooled in pre-reduced transport fluid and examined by culture. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans was significantly more frequent (p = 0.004) in generalised  agp compared to chp, and porphyromonas gingivalis was less prevalent in localized agp, when compared with generalized agp (p = 0.040) or chp (p = 0.016). prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia were also frequently detected in all groups. mean proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans were significantly higher in agp groups, when compared to chp, and generalized agp patients harbored significantly higher proportions of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia, when compared to localized agp or chp. conclusions: a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum were frequently detected in this moroccan population with agp. differences in frequency of detection, counts and proportions of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. forsythia suggests the presence of distinct microbiological profiles for localized agp, generalized agp and chp patients.

TI  == laser supported reduction of specific microorganisms in the periodontal pocket with the aid of an er,cr:ysgg laser: a pilot study.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a radial firing tip of an er,cr:ysgg laser as an adjunct to a nonsurgical periodontal treatment. methods: twelve patients with chronic or aggressive periodontitis were treated by conventional periodontal treatment using ultrasonic devices and hand instruments and, additionally, in two quadrants with an er,cr:ysgg laser. a new radial firing tip (rfpt 14-5, biolase) was used with 1.5 w, 30 hz, 11% air, 20% water, and pulse duration 140 mus. microbiological smears were taken before treatment, one day after lasing, and three and six months after lasing. pocket depths of all periodontal sites were measured before and six months after treatment. results: the total bacterial load of prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans inside the pocket was reduced significantly throughout the whole examination time. greater pocket depth reductions were observed in all groups. there was a slight higher reduction of pocket depth in the lased group after six months. conclusions: these results support the thesis that er,cr:ysgg laser supported periodontal treatment leads to a significant reduction of periopathogenes and thereby helps the maintenance of periodontal health.

TI  == occurrence of periodontal pathogens in ethnic groups from a native brazilian reservation.
AB  == objective: the present study was designed to evaluate the occurrence of periodontal pathogens in the subgingival biofilm of 100 native brazilians living  at the umutina indian reservation, mato grosso state, brazil. methods: periodontal clinical examinations were carried out prior to collection of subgingival biofilm, and the presence of 14 periodontal microorganisms was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the prevalence and risk analysis was performed using cochran and mantel-haenszel statistics for dichotomous variables or pearson's chi-squared test for analysis of proportions when variables had three or more categories. the interrelations between clinical and microbiological parameters were assessed using fisher's exact test and the mann-whitney u test. results: individuals with chronic periodontitis were frequently colonized by the association between porphyromonas gingivalis and campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedia, or p. gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. patients with chronic periodontitis were also colonized by porphyromonas gulae and p. intermedia or by the association between p. gulae and t. forsythia. p. gulae was detected only in the subgingival samples from natives on a traditional diet. gingival bleeding was associated with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, t. forsythia, p.  gingivalis, p. gulae, porphyromonas endodontalis, p. intermedia, and prevotella nigrescens. treponema denticola was uncommon. conclusions: peculiar microbiota was demonstrated to be associated with different periodontal disease statuses in  native brazilians, with modest occurrence of certain pathogens, such as t. denticola, and the presence of p. gulae in natives with gingivitis or chronic periodontitis.

TI  == microbiota at teeth and implants in partially edentulous patients. a 10-year retrospective study.
AB  == objective: to determine the microbiota at implants and adjacent teeth 10 years after placement of implants with a sandblasted and acid-etched surface. material  and methods: plaque samples obtained from the deepest sites of 504 implants and of 493 adjacent teeth were analyzed for certain bacterial species associated with periodontitis, for staphylococci, for aerobic gram-negative rods, and for yeasts  using nucleic acid-based methods. results: species known to be associated with periodontitis were detectable at 6.2-78.4% of the implants. significantly higher  counts at implants in comparison with teeth were assessed for tannerella forsythia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum/necrophorum, and campylobacter rectus. higher counts of periodontopathogenic species were detectable at implants of current smokers than at those of non-smokers. in addition, those species were found in higher quantities at implants of subjects with periodontitis. the prevalence of prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, c. rectus, and moreover of staphylococcus warneri might be associated with peri-implant inflammation. selected staphylococcal species (not staphylococcus aureus), aerobic gram-negative rods, and yeasts were frequently detected, but with the exception of s. warneri, they did not show any association with periodontal or peri-implant diseases. conclusions: smoking and periodontal disease are risk factors for colonization of periodontopathic bacteria at implants. those bacterial species may play a potential role in peri-implant inflammation. the role of s. warneri needs further validation.

TI  == effects of adjunctive daily phototherapy on chronic periodontitis: a randomized single-blind controlled trial.
AB  == purpose: the purpose of this randomized single-blind controlled trial was to elucidate the clinical and antimicrobial effects of daily phototherapy (pt) as an adjunct to scaling and root planing (srp) in patients with chronic periodontitis. methods: the study was conducted from december 2013 to may 2014 at ewha womans university mokdong hospital, seoul, korea. forty-one patients with mild to moderate chronic periodontitis were randomly divided into two therapeutic groups  in a 1:1 ratio: srp+pt and srp (control) groups. all participants underwent full-mouth srp. pt was performed thrice a day for a month by using electric toothbrushes with embedded light-emitting diodes. plaque index, gingival index, probing pocket depth (ppd), clinical attachment level (cal), and bleeding on probing were assessed before (baseline) and four weeks after (follow-up) the treatment. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction at the same points in time. results: the clinical parameters improved in both the groups. at the follow-up assessment, ppd was significantly decreased in the srp+pt group (p=0.00). further, ppd and cal showed significantly greater changes in the srp+pt group than in the srp group (ppd, p=0.03; cal, p=0.04). p. gingivalis and t. forsythia levels decreased in this group, but no significant intergroup differences were noted. conclusions: adjunctive pt seems to have clinical benefits, but evidence of its antimicrobial  effects is not sufficient. long-term studies are necessary to develop the most effective pt protocol and compare the effectiveness of pt with and without exogenous photosensitizers.

TI  == distribution of 8 periodontal microorganisms in family members of chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == objective: to date, no information on the distribution of periodontal microorganisms among family members of chinese patients with aggressive peridontitis (agp) is available. the aim of the present study was to investigate  the probability of transmission of eight periodontal microorganisms between patients with aggressive periodontitis and their family members. design: saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples were collected from 103 participants from 41 nuclear families (including 41 agp probands, 19 mothers, 22 fathers, 21 siblings). eight periodontal microorganisms, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and fusobacterium nucleatum were detected in these samples by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in addition, the distribution of fima genotypes was assessed in p. gingivalis-positive individuals by pcr. results: p. gingivalis, t. forsythia,  t. denticola, c. rectus and f. nucleatum were the most frequently detected species both in agp probands and in their relatives. kappa statistical analysis revealed that the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans (kappa = 0.503) and f. nucleatum (kappa = 0.565) in probands was highly consistent with that in their relatives. most probands shared the identical fima genotype of p. gingivalis with their relatives. conclusions: our results suggested that the intrafamilial transmission of periodontal microorganisms may occur between chinese patients with aggressive periodontitis and their relatives.

TI  == shifts in campylobacter species abundance may reflect general microbial community shifts in periodontitis progression.
AB  == background: oral campylobacter species have been found to be associated with periodontitis progression. while the etiological significance of campylobacter rectus is quite established, the association of c. gracilis, c. concisus, and c.  curvus with health or disease remains contradictory. objectives: this study hypothesizes that the proportion of species within the campylobacter genus rather than the absolute abundance of a single species is a suitable indicator for periodontitis progression. design: subgingival plaque from 90 periodontitis patients and gingival sulcus fluid of 32 healthy individuals were subjected to a  newly developed nested pcr approach, in which all campylobacter spp. were amplified simultaneously. the resulting mixture of 16s-rrna-gene-amplicons were separated by single-stranded conformation polymorphism (sscp) gel electrophoresis, followed by sequencing and identification of excised bands and relative quantification of band intensities. in all samples, the abundance of selected periodontitis marker species was determined based on dna hybridization on a microarray. results: the highly prevalent campylobacter community was composed of varying proportions of c. rectus, c. gracilis, c. concisus, and c. curvus. cluster analysis based on sscp-banding pattern resulted in distinct groups which in turn coincided with significant differences in abundance of established periodontitis marker species (tannerella forsythia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum) and progression. conclusions: the shift  in the campylobacter community composition seems to display the general microbial community shift during clinical progression in a simplified manner. the focus on  members of the campylobacter in this study suggests that this genus can be an indicator of ecological changes in the subgingival oral microflora.

TI  == prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in subgingival samples of italian patients with chronic periodontitis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the subgingival prevalence of six periodontal pathogens in 352 italian patients with chronic periodontitis. possible correlations with clinical parameters, age, gender and smoking status were also investigated. at first visit a pooled subgingival plaque sample was obtained for each subject by using the paper-point method. the samples were processed and analysed according to a commercially available quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction assay (meridol(r) perio diagnostics, gaba international, switzerland). porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), treponema denticola (td), tannerella forsythia (tf), prevotella intermedia (pi), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) were investigated.  fn resulted the most frequently detected (95%) while tf showed the highest load (12x105 cells/plaque sample). aa was the less represented bacteria for load and presence. bacterial load of pg, td, tf and fn showed a direct correlation to bleeding on probing (bop) and presence of suppuration (p=0.0001). the bacterial load was always directly correlated to probing pocket depth (ppd) (p=0.0001). among the investigated variables, ppd resulted the most important risk indicator  for periodontal pathogens. bop appeared as a risk indicator for td, tf, pg detection. few studies have described the microbiological pattern of chronic periodontal disease in the italian population. considering the different forms of periodontitis, similar investigations in other countries are needed to disclose any microbiological differences among populations, which may lead to more specific approaches to prevention and therapy.

TI  == association between polycystic ovary syndrome, oral microbiota and systemic antibody responses.
AB  == polycystic ovary syndrome (pcos) is a hormonal disorder of women that not only is the leading cause of infertility but also shows a reciprocal link with oral health. this study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the levels of putative periodontal pathogens in saliva and their antibody response in serum are elevated in pcos, compared to systemic health. a total of 125 women were included in four groups; 45 women with pcos and healthy periodontium, 35 women with pcos and gingivitis, 25 systemically and periodontally healthy women, 20 systemically  healthy women with gingivitis. salivary levels of seven putative periodontal pathogens were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and serum antibody levels were analyzed by elisa. in women with pcos, salivary porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis and tannerella forsythia levels were higher than matched systemically healthy women,  particularly in the case of gingivitis. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and treponema denticola levels were similar among study groups. the presence of pcos  also enhanced p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and s. oralis serum antibody levels, when gingivitis was also present. gingival inflammation correlated positively with levels of the studied taxa in saliva, particularly in pcos. the presence of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum in saliva also exhibited a strong positive correlation with the corresponding serum antibody levels. in conclusion, as an underlying systemic endocrine condition, pcos may quantitatively affect the composition of oral microbiota and the raised systemic response to selective members of this microbial community, exerting a confounding role in resultant gingival inflammation and periodontal health. the most consistent effect appeared to be exerted on p. gingivalis.

TI  == real-time pcr quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva samples from  healthy young adults.
AB  == objective: the use of saliva as a diagnostic fluid for the evaluation of periodontal health has gained attention recently. most published real-time pcr assays focused on quantification of bacteria in subgingival plaque, not in saliva. the aims of this study were to develop a real-time pcr assay for quantification of six periodontal pathogens in saliva and to establish a relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and colony-forming unit (cfu). materials and methods: taqman primers/probe sets were used for the detection of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), and total bacteria. six periodontal pathogens and total bacteria in saliva from 24 periodontally healthy individuals  were determined. the relationship between the amount of dna (fg) and cfu was established by measuring the concentrations of extracted bacterial dna and cfu per milliliter of bacteria on agar plates. results: fn, ec, and pi were detected  in all saliva samples, while 58.5, 45.8, and 33.3% were detected for tf, pg, and  aa, respectively. numbers of ec and fn in saliva were highly correlated (r(2) = 0.93, p < 0.01). the values of dna (fg) per cfu ranged from 64 for ec to 121 for  pg. conclusion: the real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu can be used to quantitate periodontal pathogens in saliva and estimate the number of live bacteria (cfu). clinical relevance: this real-time pcr assay in combination with the relationship between dna (fg) and cfu has the potential to be an adjunct in evaluation of periodontal health status.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

TI  == microbial signature profiles of periodontally healthy and diseased patients.
AB  == aim: to determine microbial profiles that discriminate periodontal health from different forms of periodontal diseases. methods: subgingival biofilm was obtained from patients with periodontal health (27), gingivitis (11), chronic periodontitis (35) and aggressive periodontitis (24), and analysed for the presence of >250 species/phylotypes using homim. microbial differences among groups were examined by mann-whitney u-test. regression analyses were performed to determine microbial risk indicators of disease. results: putative and potential new periodontal pathogens were more prevalent in subjects with periodontal diseases than periodontal health. detection of porphyromonas endodontalis/porphyromonas spp. (or 9.5 [1.2-73.1]) and tannerella forsythia (or  38.2 [3.2-450.6]), and absence of neisseria polysaccharea (or 0.004 [0-0.15]) and prevotella denticola (or 0.014 [0-0.49], p < 0.05) were risk indicators of periodontal disease. presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (or 29.4 [3.4-176.5]), cardiobacterium hominis (or 14.9 [2.3-98.7]), peptostreptococcaceae sp. (or 35.9 [2.7-483.9]), p. alactolyticus (or 31.3 [2.1-477.2]), and absence of fretibacterium spp. (or 0.024 [0.002-0.357]), fusobacterium naviforme/fusobacterium nucleatum ss vincentii (or 0.015 [0.001-0.223]), granulicatella adiacens/granulicatella elegans (or 0.013 [0.001-0.233], p < 0.05) were associated with aggressive periodontitis. conclusion: there were specific microbial signatures of the subgingival biofilm that were able to distinguish between microbiomes of periodontal health and diseases. such profiles may be used to establish risk of disease.

TI  == reducing the bioactivity of tannerella forsythia lipopolysaccharide by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is considered a pathogen of periodontitis and forms a biofilm with multi-species bacteria in oral cavity. lipopolysaccharide is a powerful immunostimulator and induces inflammation and shock. the purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of t. forsythia lps in its co-cultivation with fusobacterium nucleatum or porphyromonas gingivalis. t. forsythia was co-cultured in the presence and absence of f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis and then t. forsythia lps was extracted. the extracts were analyzed by sds-page and nf-kappab reporter cho cell lines. thp-1 cells were treated with the lps and evaluated induction of cytokine expression by real-time rt-pcr and elisa. for analysis of the bioactivity of t. forsythia lps, the binding assay on lps-binding protein (lbp) and cd14 was processed. the extracts did not contaminate other molecules except lps and showed tlr4 agonists. co-cultured t. forsythia lps with p. gingivalis exhibited a lower level of induction of tnf-alpha, il-1beta, and il-6 expression than single- or co-cultured t. forsythia lps with f. nucleatum in the conditions of human serum. however, the three t. forsythia lps did not show difference of cytokine induction in the serum free conditions. co-cultured t. forsythia lps with p. gingivalis exhibited a lower affinity to lbp and cd14 as binding site of o-antigen and attached at a lower level to thp-1 cells compared to single- or co-cultured t. forsythia lps with f.  nucleatum. the virulence of t. forsythia lps was decreased by co-culturing with p. gingivalis and their affinity to lbp and cd14 was reduced, which may due to modification of o-antigen chain by p. gingivalis.

TI  == active invasion of porphyromonas gingivalis and infection-induced complement activation in apoe-/- mice brains.
AB  == periodontal disease is a polymicrobial inflammatory disease that leads to chronic systemic inflammation and direct infiltration of bacteria/bacterial components, which may contribute to the development of alzheimer's disease. apoe-/- mice were orally infected (n = 12) with porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum as mono- and polymicrobial infections. apoe-/- mice were sacrificed following 12 and 24 weeks of chronic infection. bacterial genomic dna was isolated from all brain tissues except for the f. nucleatum mono-infected group. polymerase chain reaction was performed using universal 16 s rdna primers and species-specific primer sets for each organism to determine whether the infecting pathogens accessed the brain. sequencing amplification products confirmed the invasion of bacteria into the brain during infection. the innate immune responses were detected using antibodies against complement activation products of c3 convertase stage and the  membrane attack complex. molecular methods demonstrated that 6 out of 12 apoe-/-  mice brains contained p. gingivalis genomic dna at 12 weeks (p = 0.006), and 9 out of 12 at 24 weeks of infection (p = 0.0001). microglia in both infected and control groups demonstrated strong intracellular labeling with c3 and c9, due to  on-going biosynthesis. the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus in 4 out of 12 infected mice brains demonstrated characteristic opsonization with c3 activation  fragments (p = 0.032). these results show that the oral pathogen p. gingivalis was able to access the apoe-/- mice brain and thereby contributed to complement activation with bystander neuronal injury.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characterization of localized aggressive periodontitis: a cohort study.
AB  == background: localized aggressive periodontitis (lagp) is an infectious periodontal disease which generally affects young people. recent data suggest the involvement of different bacterial species in different populations. the causative bacterial species in israel has never been identified despite a high prevalence of lagp in this population. the objectives of this study were to characterize the bacterial microbiota of periodontal pockets within an israeli lagp population who were also clinically assessed. methods: twenty-one lagp patients (test) and 12 chronic periodontitis patients (control) were examined. bacterial samples were collected from periodontal pockets and analysed by both culture and polymerase chain reaction techniques. mann-whitney u test and chi-square test were used to compare results between the groups. results: higher  levels of parvimonas micra (>10(6) ), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (>10(5) ), fusobacterium nucleatum/f. periodonticum (>10(6) ), and tannerella forsythia (levels of 10(5) to 10(6) bacteria) were detected in the lagp group compared to the control (p < 0.05), while levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and  prevotella intermedia were higher in the cp group. conclusions: the characteristic periodontal bacterial flora of lagp patients in israel is mainly comprised of p. micra, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum/f. periodonticum and t. forsythia. similar population based studies of each population will improve the quality of treatment of lagp when individual sampling is not possible.

TI  == evaluation of periodontal pathogens of the mandibular third molar pericoronitis by using real time pcr.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the mandibular third molar pericoronitis flora by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). materials and methods: the quantitative values of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), campylobacter rectus (cr), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi) and tannerella forsythia (tf) were evaluated in comparison with the healthy third molar flora by using real time pcr. results: aa, cr, pg, and pi were not statistically significant but numerically higher than the pericoronitis group. in contrast to samples from control subjects, statistically significant higher numbers of tf were detected in samples from pericoronitis patients. the study revealed the strong relation between risk of pericoronitis and the presence of tf. individuals who have tf in  their samples present with an almost eight times relative risk of pericoronitis as the individuals with an absence of tf in their samples. conclusion: tf plays an important role in the development of clinical symptoms related to pericoronitis.

TI  == relationship between expression of human gingival beta-defensins and levels of periodontopathogens in subgingival plaque.
AB  == background and objective: human beta-defensins (hbds) are a group of antimicrobial peptides important in epithelial innate immunity, and their differential expression is associated with periodontal diseases. the aim of this  study was to explore relationships among hbds, total subgingival bacteria and periodontopathogens in healthy subjects and in patients with chronic periodontitis. material and methods: the periodontal clinical parameters of 29 healthy subjects and 25 patients with chronic periodontitis were recorded. the relative expression of hbd1, hbd2 and hbd3 genes in gingival biopsies was measured using real-time pcr. the numbers of total bacteria and of treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia in subgingival plaque were quantified by real-time pcr. data were analyzed using the mann-whitney u-test and spearman's rank correlation test. results: no significant differences in expression of the hbd genes were found between the group of healthy subjects and  the group of patients with chronic periodontitis. total bacteria and t. denticola were detected in all participants. f. nucleatum and t. forsythia were detected in all patients with chronic periodontitis and in 86.21% and 51.72%, respectively, of healthy volunteers. p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans were detected in 24.14% and 17.24%, respectively, of the healthy group and in 84.00% and 12.00%, respectively, of the chronic periodontitis group. the prevalence of all bacteria, except a. actinomycetemcomitans, was significantly higher in the group  of patients with chronic periodontitis than in the group of healthy subjects (p < 0.05). a significant, negative correlation was observed between total bacteria and hbd-2 (r = -0.384, p = 0.011). upon analyzing the data in different groups, total bacteria and hbd-2 were significantly correlated (r = -0.492, p = 0.026) only in the group of healthy subjects. conclusion: the negative correlations between hbd-2 and total bacteria, especially in the group of healthy subjects, indicate that hbds may play an important role by limiting an increase of bacterial load at the initial stage of periodontitis.

TI  == oral cavity anaerobic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.
AB  == background: a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based method has been used to identify oral anaerobic pathogens in biofilms on voice prostheses. the purpose of the present study was to determine the location of those pathogens inside the biofilms. methods: biofilms of 15 voice prostheses were sampled and used to identify the oral pathogens. fluorescence in situ hybridization was applied on smears made on glass slides and on sections of intact biofilms visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: fusobacterium nucleatum (f. nucleatum) was the most frequently detected pathogen and the only tested species  detected in microcolonies. the other microbes (parvimonas micra [p. micra], porphyromonas gingivalis [p. gingivalis], tannerella forsythia [t. forsythia], and treponema denticola [t. denticola]) were not detected or only detected as single cells. clsm analysis showed that f. nucleatum resided on the biofilm surface. conclusion: although detectable, oral anaerobic pathogens seem to be no  more than passers-by that adhere without further observed proliferation and apparently play no striking role in biofilm formation on voice prostheses.

TI  == transcriptional responses of treponema denticola to other oral bacterial species.
AB  == the classic organization by socransky and coworkers categorized the oral bacteria of the subgingival plaque into different complexes. treponema denticola, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia are grouped into the red complex that is highly correlated with periodontal disease. socransky's work closely associates red with orange complex species such as fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia but not with members of the other complexes.  while the relationship between species contained by these complexes is in part supported by their ability to physically attach to each other, the physiological  consequences of these interactions and associations are less clear. in this study, we employed t. denticola as a model organism to analyze contact-dependent  responses to interactions with species belonging to the same complex (p. gingivalis and t. forsythia), the closely associated orange complex (using f. nucleatum and p. intermedia as representatives) and the unconnected yellow complex (using streptococcus sanguinis and s. gordonii as representatives). rna was extracted from t. denticola alone as well as after pairwise co-incubation for 5 hrs with representatives of the different complexes, and the respective gene expression profiles were determined using microarrays. numerous genes related to  motility, metabolism, transport, outer membrane and hypothetical proteins were differentially regulated in t. denticola in the presence of the tested partner species. further analysis revealed a significant overlap in the affected genes and we identified a general response to the presence of other species, those specific to two of the three complexes as well as individual complexes. most interestingly, many predicted major antigens (e.g. flagella, msp, ctlp) were suppressed in responses that included red complex species indicating that the presence of the most closely associated species induces immune-evasive strategies. in summary, the data presented here provide an in-depth understanding of the transcriptional responses triggered by contact-dependent interactions between microorganisms inhabiting the periodontal pocket.

TI  == periodontal bacteria in the genital tract: are they related to adverse pregnancy  outcome?
AB  == one of the most important factors implicated in preterm birth (ptb) is acute genitourinary tract infection. the bacteria causing chronic periodontal inflammation include gram-negative rods and anaerobes similar to those found in women with bacterial vaginosis. the aim of this prospective study is to investigate the relationship between oral and vaginal microflora and preterm low  birth weight. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to detect both the presence and level of six periodontitis-related species: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), tannerella forsythia (tf), treponema denticola (td), fusobacterium nucleatum ssp(fn), and prevotella intermedia (pi) for both oral samples of subgingival plaque and cervical samples, obtained from 80 patients, during gynaecological examinations. the more representative oral pathogen (less than 60 percent) species in oral samples of preterm and term group were tf, td, and fn. 24.4 percent of pregnant women presented periodontal pathogens in vaginal swab; the most representative species  with a percentage over 0.1 percent of total bacteria in genital tract of preterm  group were tf, td, and piwith a positive correlation (less than 0.5). the presence of the bacterium t. denticolain the vagina, regardless of the amount, adversely affects preterm delivery.

TI  == the effects of different orthodontic appliances upon microbial communities.
AB  == objectives: orthodontic appliances can promote accumulation of dental plaque, with associated enamel decalcification or gingival inflammation. the aim of this  study was to examine longer-term microbiological changes during orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. materials and methods: twenty-four orthodontic patients aged 11-14 years undergoing fixed appliance therapy were recruited into  the study. each was randomized for cross-mouth assignment of molar bands and bonded molar tubes to contralateral quadrants of the mouth. all patients received self-ligating brackets, but again using randomization, one upper lateral incisor  bracket (left or right) also received an elastomeric ligature. plaque samples from the molars and upper lateral incisors were obtained at intervals during treatment and up to 1 year after appliance removal. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and 16s rdna microarray were used to compare plaque microbial fingerprints. results: plaque populations changed within 3 months of commencing treatment at all sites. the greatest differences in plaque composition were seen  with self-ligating brackets with an elastomeric ligature. post-treatment plaque associated with both types of molar attachment contained increased levels of periodontal pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and eubacterium nodatum, while campylobacter rectus, parvimonas micra, and actinomyces odontolyticus were also elevated with bonds. conclusions: the results suggest that orthodontic treatment may cause sustained changes in plaque microbiotas and that molar bond-associated plaque may have raised disease potential.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

TI  == association of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin d concentrations and pathogenic oral bacteria in postmenopausal females.
AB  == background: previous findings of an association between 25-hydroxyvitamin d [25(oh)d] concentrations and periodontal disease may be partially explained by the antimicrobial properties of vitamin d. to the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has investigated the association between 25(oh)d and pathogenic oral bacteria, a putative cause of periodontal disease. methods: the association between plasma 25(oh)d concentrations and pathogenic oral bacteria was examined among postmenopausal females in the buffalo osteoporosis and periodontal disease  study (1997 to 2000), an ancillary study of the women's health initiative observational study. subgingival plaque samples were assessed using immunofluorescence for the presence of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and campylobacter rectus. logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ors) and 95% confidence intervals (cis) for prevalent bacteria by quintile (q) of 25(oh)d concentrations, adjusting for age and body mass index. results: of the 855 participants, 288 (34%) had deficient/inadequate (<50 nmol/l) 25(oh)d concentrations, and 496 (58%) had at least one species of pathogenic bacteria. no significant association was found between 25(oh)d and presence of any of these bacteria (adjusted or for high [q5] compared to low [q1] 25(oh)d = 0.96; 95% ci:  0.61 to 1.50; p for trend = 0.50). inverse, although not statistically significant, associations were found between 25(oh)d and more than one species of pathogenic bacteria (adjusted or for adequate compared to deficient/inadequate 25(oh)d = 0.85; 95% ci: 0.60 to 1.19). conclusions: no association was observed between pathogenic oral bacteria and 25(oh)d concentrations in postmenopausal females. this may be attributable to the species of bacteria assessed, small effect size, or a true absence of an association.

TI  == quantitative analysis of periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of geriatric subjects.
AB  == purpose: at present, information regarding periodontal disease in geriatric patients is scarce. the purpose of this study was to quantify the periodontal pathogens present in the saliva of korean geriatric patients and assess the relationship between the bacterial levels and the periodontal condition. methods: six putative periodontal pathogens were quantified by using a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay in geriatric patient groups (>60 years) with mild chronic periodontitis (mcp), moderate chronic periodontitis (mocp), and severe chronic periodontitis (scp). the copy numbers of porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia were measured. results: it was found that the bacterial copy numbers increased as the severity of the disease increased from mcp to scp, except for p. intermedia. for p. intermedia, it was found that samples in the mcp group yielded the largest amount. it was also found that the quantities of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, and t. denticola, the so-called "red complex" bacteria, were lower than those of f. nucleatum, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia in all of the samples. conclusions: collectively, the results of this study suggest that the levels of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia, f. nucleatum, and t. denticola present in saliva are associated with the severity of periodontal disease in geriatric patients.

TI  == the effects of stress hormones on growth of selected periodontitis related bacteria.
AB  == the focus of this study was to examine in vitro the effects of stress hormones (catecholamines: epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine and hydrocortisone: cortisol) on the growth of four anaerobic species of periodontitis-related bacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and tannerella forsythia) and one facultative anaerobic species (eikenella corrodens). bacterial growth was determined by two different methods:  fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish), and the viable count by culture method. to simulate stress, each single strain was grown in a special growth medium with three different concentrations of each hormone, using an anaerobic chamber at 37 degrees c. growth of f. nucleatum increased in the presence of all  stress hormones. growth of p. gingivalis was not significantly influenced by any  hormone. growth of p. intermedia and e. corrodens was inhibited by almost all stress hormones tested. both methods of analysis revealed that the highest concentrations of norepinephrine and cortisol increased the growth of t. forsythia. different hormones have a different effect on the growth of periodontitis-related bacteria in vitro. it appears that bacterial viability is more strongly influenced than is bacterial metabolic activity. the growth of f. nucleatum particularly and partially of t. forsythia is increased by several stress hormones and may have an additional negative impact on periodontal disease.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and toll-like receptor 2 are associated with hypertensive disorders in placental tissue: a case-control study.
AB  == aim(s): to explore the associations between the presence of periodontal pathogens and the expression of toll-like receptors (tlr-2 and tlr-4) in the placental tissue of patients with hypertensive disorders compared to the placentas of healthy normotensive patients. material and methods: a case-control study was performed. from a cohort composed of 126 pregnant women, 33 normotensive healthy  pregnant women were randomly selected, and 25 cases of patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, including gestational hypertension and pre-eclampsia, were selected. placental biopsy was obtained after aseptic placental collection at the time of delivery. all of the samples were processed and analysed for the detection of porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. determination of the expressions of tlr-2 and tlr-4 was performed in samples of total purified protein isolated from  placental tissues and analysed by elisa. the data were assessed using descriptive statistics. the associations among variables were estimated through multiple logistic regression models and the mann-whitney test to evaluate the differences  between the two groups. results: a significant increase was observed in the expression of tlr-2 in the placentas of patients with hypertensive disorders (p = 0.04). additionally, the multiple logistic regression models demonstrated an association between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis in placental tissues and hypertensive disorders (or: 9.39, p = 0.001, ci 95% 2.39-36.88 and or: 7.59, p = 0.019, ci 95% 1.39-41.51, respectively). conclusions: in the present study, pregnant women with periodontal disease presented an association in the placental tissue between the presence of t. denticola and p. gingivalis and hypertensive disorders. additionally, increased expression of tlr-2 was observed. however, further studies are required to determine the specific roles of periodontal pathogens and tlrs in the placental tissue of patients with pregnancy-related hypertensive disorders.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == validation of a quantitative real-time pcr assay and comparison with fluorescence microscopy and selective agar plate counting for species-specific quantification  of an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

AB  == objective: knowledge of the microbial composition of deciduous endodontic infections is limited. this study aimed to evaluate the presence of the 10 oral bacterial species in samples from primary tooth root canals by using microarray technology and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical conditions. study design: the samples were collected from 30 root canals of primary teeth with primer infection. the bacterial composition of the samples was semi-quantitatively defined using a microarray system (parocheck). results: all the tested species were detected in the samples. fusobacterium nucleatum was the  most frequently isolated bacterium (96.7%), followed by prevotella intermedia (86.7%), parvimonas micra (83.3%), treponema denticola (76.7%) and tannerella forsythia (66.7%). these bacteria were also present in high levels. all pairs of  bacterial species were positively associated (rr > 1), except pintermedia and p > micra. on average, five species (range:3-8) were detected per amplified sample. root canals of teeth with > 5 different species were statistically associated with periapical radiolucency (p = 0.049). conclusions: primary teeth with endodontic infections show a highly diverse variety of bacteria, in which the most prevalent specie are present in high proportions. the well-directed use of the improved microarray technology will provide additional valuable information for causative factors associated with endodontic diseases, helping to develop more successful antibacterial or anti-inflammatory treatment strategies.

TI  == detection and enumeration of periodontopathogenic bacteria in subgingival biofilm of pregnant women.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use the fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) technique to test the hypothesis of qualitative and quantitative differences of 8 periodontopathogens between pregnant and non-pregnant women. this cross-sectional study included 20 pregnant women in their second trimester of pregnancy and 20 non-pregnant women. probing depth, bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, and presence of calculus were recorded. subgingival plaque samples were collected and the fish technique identified the presence and numbers of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens. the mann-whitney u-test was applied to compare the data between the two groups. the mean age, ethnicity, marital status, education, and economic level in both groups were similar. the clinical parameters showed no significant differences between pregnant and non-pregnant women. the numbers of subgingival periodontopathogens were not found to be significantly different between groups, despite the higher mean counts of p. intermedia in pregnant women. colonization patterns of the different bacteria  most commonly associated with periodontal disease were not different in the subgingival plaque of pregnant and non-pregnant women.

TI  == periodontal pathogen load and increased antibody response to heat shock protein 60 in patients with cardiovascular disease.
AB  == aim: to determine the relationship between periodontal pathogen load and anti-human heat shock protein 60 (hhsp60) antibodies in patients with established cardiovascular disease (cvd). materials and methods: participants were cardiovascular patients (n = 74) with a previous hospital admission for myocardial infarction. concurrent periodontal pathogen load of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was determined using quantitative real-time pcr. serum antibodies to these pathogens, groel and hhsp60 were determined using an elisa. results: there was a trend for increasing anti-hhsp60 antibody as the number of bacterial species increased. the strongest positive correlations were found between anti-hhsp60 levels and numbers of t. forsythia (r = 0.43; p < 0.001) and  between anti-hhsp60 and anti-groel levels (r = 0.39; p = 0.001). patients with extensive periodontal pocketing (>/=4 mm) had higher numbers of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (p < 0.05) and a higher subgingival pathogen load (p < 0.05) than patients with minimal pocketing (</=1 site >/= 4 mm). they also had significantly elevated anti-hhsp60 levels (p < 0.05). overall, the highest anti-hhsp60 levels were seen in patients with extensive periodontal pocketing and all four bacterial species. conclusions: in cardiovascular patients, a greater burden of subgingival infection with increased levels of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia is associated with modestly higher anti-hhsp60 levels.

TI  == subgingival microbiota from cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  == this present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the tufted capuchin monkey procreation center (sao paulo state university - unesp) or free-ranging monkeys. for this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. the primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to vmga iii transport medium and ultrapure water. the microbiota was  cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial dna was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using pcr and real-time pcr. the actinomycetes, fusobacteria, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented gram-negative anaerobic rods, tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, dialister pneumosintes and prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas treponema denticola was not found. populations of c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.

TI  == a microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. methods: samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. the presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, tannerella forsythia, enterococcus faecalis, neisseria  mucosa, campylobacter gracilis, and prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp  space cases they were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, n. mucosa, e. faecalis, e. saburreum, c. gracilis, and porphyromonas gingivalis. counts of f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, campylobacter sputigena, capnocytophaga showae, treponema socrenskii,  porphyromonas endodontalis, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (p < .05). conclusions: the data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and  an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp  space cases.

TI  == co-localized or randomly distributed? pair cross correlation of in vivo grown subgingival biofilm bacteria quantified by digital image analysis.
AB  == the polymicrobial nature of periodontal diseases is reflected by the diversity of phylotypes detected in subgingival plaque and the finding that consortia of suspected pathogens rather than single species are associated with disease development. a number of these microorganisms have been demonstrated in vitro to  interact and enhance biofilm integration, survival or even pathogenic features. to examine the in vivo relevance of these proposed interactions, we extended the  spatial arrangement analysis tool of the software daime (digital image analysis in microbial ecology). this modification enabled the quantitative analysis of microbial co-localization in images of subgingival biofilm species, where the biomass was confined to fractions of the whole-image area, a situation common for medical samples. selected representatives of the disease-associated red and orange complexes that were previously suggested to interact with each other in vitro (tannerella forsythia with fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis with prevotella intermedia) were chosen for analysis and labeled with  specific fluorescent probes via fluorescence in situ hybridization. pair cross-correlation analysis of in vivo grown biofilms revealed tight clustering of f. nucleatum/periodonticum and t. forsythia at short distances (up to 6 microm) with a pronounced peak at 1.5 microm. while these results confirmed previous in vitro observations for f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, random spatial distribution was detected between p. gingivalis and p. intermedia in the in vivo samples. in conclusion, we successfully employed spatial arrangement analysis on the single cell level in clinically relevant medical samples and demonstrated the utility of this approach for the in vivo validation of in vitro observations by analyzing statistically relevant numbers of different patients. more importantly, the culture-independent nature of this approach enables similar quantitative analyses for "as-yet-uncultured" phylotypes which cannot be characterized in vitro.

TI  == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum  ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of  which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

(c) 2012 john wiley & sons a/s background and objective: to study the effectiveness of azithromycin in combination with nonsurgical periodontal therapy on clinical and microbiological parameters, and on the mmp-8 and timp-1 levels in gingival crevicular fluid, over a 6-mo time-period in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: thirty-two patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis were included in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm study. they were randomly assigned to azithromycin or placebo groups (500 mg once daily for 3 d). probing depth, clinical attachment levels, presence of bleeding on probing and plaque were recorded. gingival crevicular fluid samples were obtained from one single-rooted  tooth, while microbiological samples were obtained from two single-rooted teeth,  all with a probing depth of >/= 6 mm. microbiological parameters were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and total bacteria. gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers were determined by immunofluorometric assay and elisa. results: all clinical parameters improved, and microbiological parameters and gingival crevicular fluid mmp-8 levels significantly decreased, over the 6-mo period (p < 0.05); both groups demonstrated similar improvements. the azithromycin group presented a higher percentage of deep pockets resolved (probing depth reduction of >/= 3 mm from baseline) compared with the placebo group at 1 mo (p < 0.05). conclusion: adjunctive azithromycin therapy provides no additional benefit over nonsurgical periodontal treatment on clinical parameters, microbiological parameters and gingival crevicular fluid biochemical markers investigated in patients with generalized aggressive periodontitis.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia induce synergistic alveolar bone loss in a mouse periodontitis model.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is strongly associated with chronic periodontitis, an inflammatory disease of the tooth-supporting tissues, leading to tooth loss. fusobacterium nucleatum, an opportunistic pathogen, is thought to promote dental  plaque formation by serving as a bridge bacterium between early- and late-colonizing species of the oral cavity. previous studies have shown that f. nucleatum species synergize with t. forsythia during biofilm formation and pathogenesis. in the present study, we showed that coinfection of f. nucleatum and t. forsythia is more potent than infection with either species alone in inducing nf-kappab activity and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in monocytic cells and primary murine macrophages. moreover, in a murine model of periodontitis, mixed infection with the two species induces synergistic alveolar  bone loss, characterized by bone loss which is greater than the additive alveolar bone losses induced by each species alone. further, in comparison to the single-species infection, mixed infection caused significantly increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the gingivae and osteoclastic activity in the jaw bones. these data show that f. nucleatum subspecies and t. forsythia synergistically stimulate the host immune response and induce alveolar bone loss  in a murine experimental periodontitis model.

TI  == serum antibodies to periodontal pathogens are a risk factor for alzheimer's disease.
AB  == background: chronic inflammation in periodontal disease has been suggested as a potential risk factor in alzheimer's disease (ad). the purpose of this study was  to examine serum antibody levels to bacteria of periodontal disease in participants who eventually converted to ad compared with the antibody levels in  control subjects. methods: serum samples from 158 participants in the biologically resilient adults in neurological studies research program at the university of kentucky were analyzed for immunoglobulin g antibody levels to seven oral bacteria associated with periodontitis, including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus, treponema  denticola, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and prevotella intermedia. all 158 participants were cognitively intact at baseline venous blood draw. in all, 81 of the participants developed either mild cognitive impairment (mci) or ad or both, and 77 controls remained cognitively intact in the years of  follow-up. antibody levels were compared between controls and subjects with ad at baseline draw and after conversion and controls and subjects with mci at baseline draw and after conversion using the wilcoxon rank-sum test. ad and mci participants were not directly compared. linear regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding. results: antibody levels to f nucleatum and p intermedia were significantly increased (alpha = 0.05) at baseline serum draw in  the patients with ad compared with controls. these results remained significant when controlling for baseline age, mini-mental state examination score, and apolipoprotein epsilon 4 status. conclusions: this study provides initial data that demonstrate elevated antibodies to periodontal disease bacteria in subjects  years before cognitive impairment and suggests that periodontal disease could potentially contribute to the risk of ad onset/progression. additional cohort studies profiling oral clinical presentation with systemic response and ad and prospective studies to evaluate any cause-and-effect association are warranted.

TI  == oral bacteria and yeasts in relationship to oral ulcerations in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients.
AB  == background: oral mucositis is a serious and debilitating side effect of conditioning regimens for hematopoietic stem cell transplant (hsct). through hsct, the homeostasis in the oral cavity is disrupted. the contribution of the oral microflora to mucositis remains to be clarified. the aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between yeasts, bacteria associated with periodontitis, and oral ulcerations in hsct recipients. methods: this prospective observational study included 49 adult hsct recipients. twice weekly, oral ulcerations were scored, and oral rinsing samples were obtained. samples were evaluated for the total bacterial load; the gram-negative bacteria: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, and  treponema denticola; and the yeasts: candida albicans, candida glabrata, candida  kefyr, candida krusei, candida parapsilosis, and candida tropicalis using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and probes. explanatory variables for oral ulcerations were calculated using the multilevel generalized estimated equations (gee) technique. results: none of the samples was positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans, while f. nucleatum was found most often (66 % of samples). c. albicans was the most isolated yeast (88 % of samples), whereas c. parapsilosis was found in only 8 % of the samples. multivariate gee analyses identified p. gingivalis, p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and  c. kefyr as significant explanatory variables of oral ulcerations. conclusions: our data indicate that p. gingivalis in particular, but also p. micra, t. denticola, f. nucleatum, c. glabrata, and c. kefyr may play a role in ulcerative  oral mucositis in patients undergoing hsct.

TI  == quantification of subgingival bacterial pathogens at different stages of periodontal diseases.
AB  == anaerobic gram-negative oral bacteria such as treponema denticola, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum are closely associated with periodontal diseases. we measured the relative population (bacterial levels) of these oral pathogens in subgingival tissues of patients at  different stages of korean chronic periodontal diseases. we divided the individuals into those with chronic gingivitis (g), moderate periodontitis (p1),  severe periodontitis (p2), and normal individuals (n) (n = 20 for each group) and subgingival tissue samples were collected. we used real-time pcr with taqman probes to evaluate the change of periodontal pathogens among different stages of  periodontitis. bacterial levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus are significantly increased in individuals with chronic gingivitis and moderate periodontitis, but unchanged in severe periodontitis patients. these results suggest that analyzing certain bacterial levels among total oral pathogens may facilitate understanding of the role of periodontal bacteria in the early stages  of periodontitis.

TI  == comparison of microbial changes in early redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.
AB  == background: surfaces and fluids can affect oral bacterial colonization. the aim of this study is to compare redeveloping biofilms on natural teeth and dentures.  methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 55 dentate individuals and  the denture teeth of 62 edentulous individuals before and after professional cleaning. also, samples from seven "teeth" (samples included dentures) in randomly selected quadrants were collected after 1, 2, 4, and 7 days of no oral hygiene. samples were analyzed using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. counts and proportions of 41 bacterial taxa were determined at each time point, and significant differences were determined using the mann-whitney u test. ecological succession was determined using a modified moving window analysis. results: mean  total dna probe counts were similar precleaning but were higher in dentate individuals at all post-cleaning visits (p <0.01). precleaning edentate biofilms  had higher counts and proportions of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus mutans, whereas dentate individuals had higher proportions of tannerella forsythia, selenomonas noxia, and neisseria mucosa. by day 2, mean counts of all taxa were higher in natural teeth, and most remained higher at day  7 (p <0.01). succession was more rapid and complex in dentate individuals. both groups demonstrated increased proportions of s. mitis and s. oralis by day 1. n.  mucosa, veillonella parvula, and eikenella corrodens increased in both groups, but later in samples from edentate individuals. conclusions: "mature" natural and denture teeth biofilms have similar total numbers of bacteria but different species proportions. post-cleaning biofilm redevelopment is more rapid and more complex on natural teeth than on denture teeth.

TI  == anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in the biofilm formation on voice prostheses: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives/hypothesis: voice rehabilitation with voice prostheses is a standard therapy in laryngectomized patients. biofilm formation on the surface of the voice prostheses causes device failure and requires frequent replacements. studies analyzing the biofilm of voice prostheses have mainly focused on aerobic  bacteria. anaerobic bacteria as an integral part of the biofilms on voice prostheses have not been investigated yet. study design: prospective pilot study  on the occurrence of anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens in biofilm formation on voice prostheses. methods: biofilm samples of 15 voice prostheses were analyzed using a polymerase chain reaction-based hybridization method regarding the presence of 11 selected anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens. results: in  80% of the voice prostheses, at least one and up to 10 of the tested bacteria could be identified. fusobacterium nucleatum was the pathogen most often present  (73%). other frequently occurring pathogens were treponema denticola (40%), tannerella forsythia (33%), and eikenella corrodens (33%). there was no correlation between the number of identified bacteria and the indwelling times (mean, 127 days; maximum, 344 days; minimum, 22 days). conclusions: for the first time, anaerobic and microaerophilic pathogens have been identified as part of the biofilm formation on the surface of voice prostheses. those pathogens might be responsible for accelerated biofilm formation and reduced lifetime of the voice prostheses.

TI  == molecular analysis of 16s rrna genes identifies potentially periodontal pathogenic bacteria and archaea in the plaque of partially erupted third molars.
AB  == purpose: small subunit rrna sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to identify cultivable and uncultivable microorganisms present in the dental plaque  of symptomatic and asymptomatic partially erupted third molars to determine the prevalence of putative periodontal pathogens in pericoronal sites. materials and  methods: template dna prepared from subgingival plaque collected from partially erupted symptomatic and asymptomatic mandibular third molars and healthy incisors was used in polymerase chain reaction with broad-range oligonucleotide primers to amplify 16s rrna bacterial and archaeal genes. amplicons were cloned, sequenced,  and compared with known nucleotide sequences in online databases to identify the  microorganisms present. results: two thousand three hundred two clones from the plaque of 12 patients carried bacterial sequences from 63 genera belonging to 11  phyla, including members of the uncultivable tm7, sr1, and chloroflexi, and difficult-to-cultivate synergistetes and spirochaetes. dialister invisus, filifactor alocis, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas endodontalis, prevotella denticola, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola, which have been associated with periodontal disease, were found in significantly greater abundance in pericoronal compared with incisor sites. dialister invisus and f nucleatum were found in greater abundance in sites exhibiting clinical symptoms.  the archaeal species, methanobrevibacter oralis, which has been associated with severe periodontitis, was found in 3 symptomatic patients. conclusions: these findings have provided new insights into the complex microbiota of pericoronitis. several bacterial and archaeal species implicated in periodontal disease were recovered in greater incidence and abundance from the plaque of partially erupted third molars compared with incisors, supporting the hypothesis that the pericoronal region may provide a favored niche for periodontal pathogens in otherwise healthy mouths.

TI  == oral bacterial dna differ in their ability to induce inflammatory responses in human monocytic cell lines.
AB  == background: deoxyribonucleic acids (dna) of periodontal pathogens, porphyromonas  gingivalis (pg) and tannerella forsythia, stimulate cytokine production in human  monocytic cells (thp-1) through toll-like receptor 9 (tlr-9) and nuclear factor-kappab signaling. fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) is one of the most frequently isolated bacteria in periodontally diseased tissues and is reported to synergize with pg, enhancing the pathogenicity. we investigate inflammatory mediator production in thp-1 cells challenged with fn and streptococcus sanguinis (ss) dna, a non-pathogenic oral bacteria, and further assess whether cytokines triggered by whole pathogens or pg lipopolysaccharide (lps) are affected by tlr-9 signaling inhibitors (chloroquine). methods: thp-1 cells were stimulated with pg-dna (100 ng/mul), fn-dna (100 ng/mul), ss-dna (100 ng/mul), pg-lps (10 ng/mul), and heat-killed whole bacteria (multiplicity of infection, 1:100) for 16 hours with or without chloroquine pretreatment (10 mug/ml). interleukin (il)-1beta, il-6, il-8, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. statistical analyses included analysis of variance with multiple comparisons using dunnett or tukey methods and paired t test. a value of p <0.05 was significant. results: inflammatory mediator levels were increased in response to all the stimuli with the exception of ss-dna (p <0.05). chloroquine pretreatment significantly decreased cytokine production from thp-1 cells with the exception of il-6 production triggered by whole fn and ss (p <0.05). conclusions: differences exist among oral bacterial dna in inducing immune responses. by altering the conditions in cytosolic compartments, we can interfere with cellular responses triggered by extracellular receptor activation. thus, alternative treatment approaches targeted to intracellular receptors might  be of benefit in controlling periodontal inflammation.

AB  == background and objective: whilst certain bacteria have long been known to secrete extracellular deoxyribonuclease (dnase), the purpose in microbial physiology was  unclear. recently, however, this enzyme has been demonstrated to confer enhanced  virulence, enabling bacteria to evade the host's immune defence of extruded dna/chromatin filaments, termed neutrophil extracellular traps (nets). as nets have recently been identified in infected periodontal tissue, the aim of this study was to screen periodontal bacteria for extracellular dnase activity. material and methods: to determine whether dnase activity was membrane bound or secreted, 34 periodontal bacteria were cultured in broth and on agar plates. pelleted bacteria and supernatants from broth cultures were analysed for their ability to degrade dna, with relative activity levels determined using an agarose gel electrophoresis assay. following culture on dna-supplemented agar, expression was determined by the presence of a zone of hydrolysis and dnase activity related to colony size. results: twenty-seven bacteria, including red and orange complex  members porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum,  parvimonas micra, prevotella intermedia, streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus and prevotella nigrescens, were observed to express extracellular dnase activity. differences in dnase activity were noted, however,  when bacteria were assayed in different culture states. analysis of the activity  of secreted dnase from bacterial broth cultures confirmed their ability to degrade nets. conclusion: the present study demonstrates, for the first time, that dnase activity is a relatively common property of bacteria associated with advanced periodontal disease. further work is required to determine the importance of this bacterial dnase activity in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == the comparative evaluation of xanthan gel with chlorhexidine (chlosite) in smokers and non-smokers: a clinical and microbiological assessment.
AB  == background and objectives: prevention of the periodontal disease progression is the primary goal of periodontal therapy. when conventional therapy is found inadequate to attain periodontal health in chronic periodontitis, local antimicrobial agents have been used as an adjunct with scaling and root planning  (srp) which has reproduced encouraging results. hence, this study was undertaken  to evaluate the new sustained released local drug chlosite clinically and microbiologically in smokers and non-smokers. materials and methods: the patients were grouped into experimental group a treated with srp plus chlosite (srp + chl), experimental group b treated with chlosite alone (chl), and control group c treated only with srp alone. a total number of 141 sites from six patients (67 sites from three non-smoker patients and 74 sites from three smoker patients) participated in this study. the clinical parameters, plaque index (pi), gingival  index (gi), bleeding index (bi), and relative attachment level (ral), were recorded and subgingival plaque samples were collected and subjected to microbiological analysis. results: on comparison of smokers and non-smokers, in srp group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in bi and gi and smokers showed  a higher reduction in pi. there was no significant gain in ral of both smokers and non-smokers. in srp + chl group, non-smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to bi and gi and smokers showed a higher reduction in relation to pi. there was no significant gain in ral of both smokers and non-smokers. in chl group, both smokers and non-smokers showed a nonsignificant reduction in bi, gi,  and ral, but smokers showed a significant reduction in pi as compared with non-smokers. all the groups showed reduction in the microbial count of fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia which were found to be statistically not significant when it was compared between non-smokers and smokers. interpretation and conclusion: in this study, all treatment groups were found to be efficacious in the treatment of periodontal disease as demonstrated by improvement in pi, gi, bi, and ral. combination of srp and chlosite resulted in added benefits compared with the two treatment groups.

TI  == colonisation of the oral cavity by periodontopathic bacteria in complete denture  wearers.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to investigate colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria and the sites of colonisation in elderly upper and lower complete denture wearers. we also investigated the relationship between level of oral hygiene and colonisation by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: forty edentulous and 37 dentate volunteers participated in this study. samples were collected from whole saliva, and levels of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by pcr invader technology. detection of these species on oral mucosal and denture surfaces was performed by pcr. fisher's exact test was used for the statistical analysis. cluster analysis was employed to investigate trends in the periodontopathic bacteria flora in each sampling area. results: detection rates of periodontopathic bacteria in whole saliva were lower under edentulous conditions than under dentulous conditions, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum (p < 0.01). detection rate of f. nucleatum was the highest in all areas. a positive correlation was observed between dna quantification of p. gingivalis and number of candida species in saliva. cluster analysis of the test  species identified two clusters. tongue-coating status was associated with the detection rate of all periodontopathic bacteria investigated, and denture plaque  status was associated with the detection rate of t. denticola and f. nucleatum. conclusion: results indicate the presence of periodontopathic bacteria under edentulous conditions and that the status of oral hygiene of the mucosal or denture surfaces affects colonisation by t. denticola and f. nucleatum.

TI  == levels of periodontal pathogens in neonatal gastric aspirates and possible maternal sites of origin.
AB  == maternal periodontal infection has been recognized as a risk factor for preterm and low birthweight infants. it is suspected that pathogens causing periodontal disease may translocate to the amniotic cavity and so contribute to triggering an adverse pregnancy outcome. this study aimed to determine levels and proportions of periodontal bacteria in neonatal gastric aspirates obtained from complicated pregnancies and the respective maternal oral and vaginal samples using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction approach, and also to determine the origin of the neonate's bacteria by sequence comparisons between the three sites. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and tannerella forsythia were not observed  in the neonates or in the women's vaginas. interestingly, porphyromonas gingivalis was identified in the neonates in two samples (2.98e+02 and 1.75e+02 cells ml(-1)) and in association with fusobacterium nucleatum, which was observed at high prevalence (10%) and at high levels reaching up to 2.32e+03 cells ml(-1). although f. nucleatum was also present in the vaginal samples, the results demonstrated that the neonatal strains were more likely to originate from the mother's oral cavity than to be vaginal strains.

TI  == [prevalence of helicobacter pylori detected by real-time pcr in the subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis].
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in gastric disease. the  aim of the present pilot study was to evaluate the prevalence of h. pylori detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time pcr) in the sub-gingival plaque of chronic periodontitis patients and to determine periodontopathogens profile of positive sites at h. pylori. methodology: 109 subgingival samples collected from 17 subjects with chronic periodontitis were studied. the dna was extracted from the oral samples and analyzed for the presence of h. pylori by real-time pcr (lightcycler) using 16s rrna#120 primers which targeted the 16s rrna gene. dna from h. pylori dsm 4867 was used as a positive control. seven bacteria implicated in chronic periodontitis were selected to explore the presence of these periodontopathic species in the oral positive sites for h. pylori. results: 16 of 109 samples (14.7%) were positives of h. pylori. all the positives sites were also positives to fusobacterium nucleatum and eikenella corrodens, 62.5% to porphyromonas gingivalis, 31.25% to treponema denticola, 25% to prevotella intermedia, 12.5% to aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and 6.25% to tannerella forsythia. conclusions: h. pylori may be present in the subgingival plaque samples of patients with chronic periodontitis who are resident in a developing country. f. nucleatum and e. corrodens could coaggregate with h. pylori in the subgingival dental plaque.

AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of chlorhexidine mouthrinse (chx) in addition to daily plaque control on subgingival microbiota in patients with untreated gingivitis. fifty gingivitis patients were randomized to  chx or placebo groups. chx group rinsed with 0.2% chx, while placebo group rinsed with placebo mouthrinse for 4 weeks. subgingival plaque samples were collected and plaque index (pi), papilla bleeding index (pbi), calculus index, and probing  pocket depth (ppd) were recorded at baseline and at 4 weeks. the amounts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and total bacteria were detected by quantitative real-time pcr method. in the chx group the total bacteria count was significantly reduced in posterior teeth at 4 weeks (p < 0.05), while no significant decrease was observed in the placebo group (p > 0.05). chx mouthrinse as an adjunct to daily plaque control could be useful in the management of plaque-associated gingivitis and in reducing the subgingival total bacteria count especially in posterior teeth.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus reuteri on periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the interaction between lactobacillus reuteri, a probiotic bacterium, and oral pathogenic bacteria have not been studied adequately. this study examined the effects of l. reuteri on the proliferation of periodontopathic bacteria including aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia, and on the formation of streptococcus mutans biofilms. human-derived l. reuteri strains (kctc 3594 and kctc 3678) and rat-derived l. reuteri kctc 3679 were used. all strains exhibited significant inhibitory effects on the growth of periodontopathic bacteria and the formation of s. mutans biofilms. these antibacterial activities of l. reuteri were attributed to the production of organic acids, hydrogen peroxide, and a bacteriocin-like compound. reuterin, an antimicrobial factor, was produced only by l. reuteri kctc 3594. in addition, l. reuteri inhibited the production of methyl mercaptan by f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis. overall, these results suggest that l. reuteri may be useful as a probiotic agent for improving oral health.

TI  == spiramycin resistance in human periodontitis microbiota.
AB  == purpose: the occurrence of in vitro resistance to therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin, amoxicillin, and metronidazole was determined for putative periodontal pathogens isolated in the united states. materials and methods: subgingival plaque specimens from 37 consecutive adults with untreated severe periodontitis were anaerobically cultured, and isolated putative periodontal pathogens were identified to a species level. in vitro resistance to spiramycin at 4 mug/ml, amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and/or metronidazole at 16 mug/ml was noted when putative periodontal pathogen growth was noted on the respective antibiotic-supplemented primary culture plates. results: a total of 18 (48.7%) subjects yielded antibiotic-resistant putative periodontal pathogens with spiramycin at 4 mug/ml in drug-supplemented primary isolation plates, as compared to 23 (62.2%) subjects with amoxicillin at 8 mug/ml, and 10 (27.0%) subjects with metronidazole at 16 mug/ml. spiramycin in vitro resistance occurred among species of fusobacterium nucleatum (44.4% of organism-positive subjects), prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (11.1%), parvimonas micra (10.8%), streptococcus constellatus (10%), streptococcus intermedius (10%), porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%), and tannerella forsythia (5.3%). amoxicillin in vitro resistance was found in p. intermedia/nigrescens (55.5%), t. forsythia (15.8%), s. constellatus  (10%), f. nucleatum (5.6%), and p. micra (2.7%). only s. constellatus (70%) and s. intermedius (40%) exhibited in vitro resistance to metronidazole. when subject-based resistance data for spiramycin and metronidazole were jointly considered, all isolated putative periodontal pathogens were inhibited in vitro by one or the other of the antibiotic concentrations, except for one strain each  of s. constellatus and s. intermedius from one study subject. similarly, either amoxicillin or metronidazole at the drug concentrations tested inhibited in vitro all recovered putative periodontal pathogens, except s. constellatus in one subject. conclusions: in vitro spiramycin resistance among putative periodontal pathogens of united states origin occurred in approximately one-half of severe periodontitis patients evaluated, particularly among subgingival f. nucleatum species. in vitro resistance patterns also suggest that therapeutic concentrations of spiramycin plus metronidazole may have potential antimicrobial  efficacy in non-aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-associated periodontitis similar to amoxicillin plus metronidazole, which may be beneficial, where spiramycin is clinically available, for patients hypersensitive to amoxicillin or other beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == detection of periodontal bacteria in atheromatous plaque by nested polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == background: in recent years, increasing evidence regarding the potential association between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases has been identified. the available evidence underlines the importance of detecting periodontal pathogens on atheromatous plaque as the first step in demonstrating the causal relationship between the two conditions. the main aim of this investigation is to detect periodontitis-associated bacteria from carotid artery  atheromatous plaque from patients who received an endarterectomy using strict sample procurement and laboratory procedures. methods: atheromatous plaque from endarterectomies from carotid arteries were scraped and homogenized, and bacterial dna was extracted. to obtain a representative concentration of amplicons, two amplifications of the bacterial 16s ribosomal-rna gene were carried out for each sample with universal eubacteria primers by a polymerase chain reaction (pcr). a nested pcr with specific primers for the target bacteria  was performed next. statistical tests included the chi(2) test. results: forty-two atheromatous plaque were analyzed. all of them were positive for >/=1 target bacterial species. the bacterial species most commonly found was porphyromonas gingivalis (78.57%; 33 of 42), followed by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) (66.67%;  28 of 42), tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (61.90%; 26 of 42),  eikenella corrodens (54.76%; 23 of 42), fusobacterium nucleatum (50.00%; 21 of 42), and campylobacter rectus (9.52%; four of 42). the simultaneous presence of various bacterial species within the same specimen was a common observation. conclusion: within the limitations of this study, the presence of dna from periodontitis-associated bacteria in carotid artery atheromatous plaque retrieved by endarterectomy is confirmed.

TI  == clustering of subgingival microbial species in adolescents with periodontitis.
AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == salivary infectious agents and periodontal disease status.
AB  == background and objectives: the potential of salivary microorganisms to diagnose periodontal disease and to guide periodontal treatment is a research topic of current interest. this study aimed to determine whether the salivary counts of periodontopathic microbes correlated with the periodontal pocket counts of the same infectious agents, and whether the salivary counts of the test infectious agents could distinguish among individuals with periodontal health and various types of periodontal disease. material and methods: the study included 150 systemically healthy adults, of whom 37 were periodontally healthy, 31 had gingivitis, 46 had chronic periodontitis and 36 had aggressive periodontitis. each study subject contributed microbial samples from the two deepest periodontal pockets of the dentition and from whole saliva. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia and epstein-barr virus were identified using the taqman real-time pcr methodology. statistical analysis was performed using the mann-whitney u-test and the receiver operating characteristic statistics. results: c. rectus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia and t. forsythia occurred with significantly higher copy-counts in salivary samples from patients with gingivitis, chronic periodontitis and aggressive periodontitis than from periodontally healthy individuals. a. actinomycetemcomitans only showed higher salivary copy-counts in  subjects with aggressive periodontitis compared with subjects with healthy periodontium, and the salivary copy-counts of epstein-barr virus did not reveal any significant difference among the four subject groups studied. the diagnostic  sensitivity for periodontitis was 89.19 for p. gingivalis and for t. forsythia and 86.49 for p. intermedia, with specificities ranging from 83.78 to 94.59. the  optimal copy-counts per ml saliva for identifying periodontitis were 40,000 for p. gingivalis, 700,000 for t. forsythia and 910,000 for p. intermedia. conclusion: salivary copy-counts of p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and p. intermedia appear to have the potential to identify the presence of periodontitis, whereas the salivary level of the other test infectious agents may possess little or no diagnostic utility. longitudinal studies are warranted to determine the ability of salivary copy-counts of major periodontopathic bacteria to predict future periodontal breakdown.

TI  == predation of oral pathogens by bdellovibrio bacteriovorus 109j.
AB  == periodontal diseases are multifactorial infections elicited by a complex of primarily gram-negative bacteria that interact with host tissues and lead to the  destruction of the periodontal structures. bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a gram-negative bacterium that preys upon other gram-negative bacteria. it was previously shown that b. bacteriovorus has an ability to attack and remove surface-attached bacteria or biofilms. in this study, we examined the host specificity of b. bacteriovorus strain 109j and its ability to prey on oral pathogens associated with periodontitis, including; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. we further demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus 109j has an ability to remove biofilms of ei.  corrodens as well as biofilms composed of a. actinomycetemcomitans. bdellovibrio  bacteriovorus was able to remove a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms developed on hydroxyapatite surfaces and in the presence of saliva, as well as to detach metabolically inactive biofilms. experiments aimed at enhancing the biofilm removal aptitude of b. bacteriovorus with the aid of extracellular-polymeric-substance-degrading enzymes demonstrated that proteinase-k inhibits predation. however, treating a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilms with dspb, a poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pga) -hydrolysing enzyme, increased biofilm removal. increased biofilm removal was also recorded when a. actinomycetemcomitans pga-defective mutants were used as host cells, suggesting that pga degradation could enhance the removal of a. actinomycetemcomitans biofilm by b. bacteriovorus.

AB  == objective: to compare the use of the halimeter and the oral chroma to assess the  ability of common oral anaerobic bacteria isolated from the kuwaiti population to produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs). materials and methods: broth cultures of common anaerobes isolated from supragingival plaque were centrifuged and pellets resuspended in phosphate buffer (ph 7.7) with an optical density od(550)  of 0.3. 100 mul of this suspension and 870 mul of buffer were added in 2 sterile  15-ml head space vials. reaction was initiated by addition of 30 mul of 33 mml-methionine and l-cysteine, respectively, in each vial and incubation at 37 degrees c for 90 min. 500 mul of 3 m phosphoric acid was added to tubes and was kept aside for 10 min. production of vscs was measured using the halimeter and the oral chroma. results: the major vsc producers identified by both halimeter and oral chroma with l-cystenine as substrate were campylobacter ureolyticus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and gemella morbillorum. the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide recorded by both halimeter and oral chroma were essentially identical. with l-methionine as substrate, both halimeter and oral chroma identified different complements of anaerobes with c. ureolyticus,p. gingivalis,fusobacterium nucleatum and p. intermedia as major vsc producers. the  concentrations of methyl mercaptan recorded by the halimeter were lower compared  to those assessed by the oral chroma. conclusion: the results suggest that the oral chroma may produce a more comprehensive assessment of vsc production by oral microflora than the halimeter.

TI  == early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health around zirconia and titanium  abutments: an in vivo study in man.
AB  == aim: to compare the early bacterial colonization and soft tissue health of mucosa adjacent to zirconia (zro(2)) and titanium (ti) abutment surfaces in vivo. materials and methods: twenty edentulous subjects received two endosseous mandibular implants. the implants were fitted with either a zro(2) or a ti abutment (non-submerged implant placement, within-subject comparison, left-right  randomization). sulcular bacterial sampling and the assessment of probing pocket  depth, recession and bleeding on probing were performed at 2 weeks and 3 months post-surgery. wilcoxon matched-pairs, sign-rank tests were applied to test differences in the counts of seven marker bacteria and the clinical parameters that were associated with the zro(2) and ti abutments, at the two observation time points. results: zro(2) and ti abutments harboured similar counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, peptostreptococcus micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and treponema denticola at 2 weeks and 3 months. healthy clinical conditions were seen around both zro(2) and ti abutments at all times, without significant differences in most clinical parameters of peri-implant soft tissue health. mean probing depths around ti abutments were slightly deeper than around  zro(2) abutments after 3 months (2.2 sd 0.8 mm vs. 1.7 sd 0.7 mm, p=0.03). conclusions: no difference in health of the soft tissues adjacent to zro(2) and ti abutment surfaces or in early bacterial colonization could be demonstrated, although somewhat shallower probing depths were observed around zro(2) abutments  after 3 month.

TI  == apical root canal microbiota as determined by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis of cryogenically ground root samples from teeth with apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: bacteria located in the apical root canal system potentially participate in the pathogenesis of apical periodontitis. detection and identification of apical bacteria can be compromised because of limitations in conventional sampling and identification procedures. this study identified several bacterial taxa in the apical and middle/coronal segments of primarily infected root canal system by using pulverized root segments and a culture-independent molecular method. methods: seventeen extracted teeth with attached apical periodontitis lesions were sectioned to obtain 2 root fragments (apical and middle/coronal segments). root fragments were cryogenically ground, and dna was extracted from samples. after multiple displacement amplification, dna from samples was used as template in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay targeting 28 bacterial taxa. results: bacterial dna was detected in all samples. the most prevalent taxa in the apical root canal system  were olsenella uli (76.5%), prevotella baroniae (71%), porphyromonas endodontalis (65%), fusobacterium nucleatum (53%), and tannerella forsythia (47%). o. uli, p.  endodontalis, and propionibacterium acnes were as frequently detected in apical samples as they were in middle/coronal samples. p. baroniae, t. forsythia, and f. nucleatum were found more frequently in the apical part of the canal as compared  with matched coronal segments. streptococcus species were more prevalent in middle/coronal samples. the median and mean of shared bacterial taxa between matched apical and middle/coronal segments were 27% and 41%, respectively. conclusions: several candidate endodontic pathogens were very prevalent in the apical root canal system. the apical microbiota was usually complex and differed  in species composition when compared with the microbiota of middle/coronal samples from the same tooth.

TI  == a 6-month study of the effects of 0.3% triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on dental implants.
AB  == aim: supportive therapy to maintain dental implants is increasingly important. this study examined the effect of a 0.3% triclosan/2% copolymer dentifrice on oral biofilms and gingival inflammation (gi) on dental implants and peri-implant  tissues. materials and methods: one hundred and twenty adults with a dental implant and contra-lateral tooth were enrolled in this 6 month, double-blind, two-treatment, parallel group study. sixty subjects were randomly assigned to a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice test group and 60 subjects to a fluoride dentifrice control group and instructed to brush twice daily for 6 months. at baseline, 3, and 6 months, a calibrated dentist assessed dental plaque, gi and collected supragingival dental plaque for microbiological analysis. results: subjects in the triclosan/copolymer group demonstrated significantly lower levels of dental plaque, gingivitis, and bleeding on probing at 3 and 6 months at both the implant and contra-lateral tooth compared with the fluoride group (p<0.05). there were significantly fewer gram-negative anaerobes in the triclosan/copolymer group (p<0.05) including >90% reductions in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella melaninogenica, solobacterium moorei, and tannerella forsythia. conclusions: twice daily use of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice may enhance dental implant maintenance by reducing dental plaque and gi.

TI  == mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. ii. microbiological results.
AB  == background: peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. we performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. materials and methods: an expanded checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in  17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. statistics included non-parametric tests and glm multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. results: at selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: fusobacterium nucleatum sp., staphylococci sp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, helicobacter pylori, and tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, a. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, and veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). no such  differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. no microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. conclusions: both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. no group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.

TI  == mixture of periodontopathogenic bacteria influences interaction with kb cells.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to investigate the adhesion and invasion of periodontopathogenic bacteria in varied mixed infections and the release of interleukins from an epithelial cell line (kb cells). methods: kb cells were co-cultured with porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 and m5-1-2, tannerella forsythia atcc 43037, treponema denticola atcc 35405 and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 in single and mixed infections. the numbers of adherent and  internalized bacteria were determined up to 18 h after bacterial exposure. additionally, the mrna expression and concentrations of released interleukin (il)-6 and il-8 were measured. results: all periodontopathogenic bacteria adhered and internalized in different numbers to kb cells, but individually without any evidence of co-aggregation also to f. nucleatum. high levels of epithelial mrna of il-6 and il-8 were detectable after all bacterial challenges. after the mixed  infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 the highest levels of released interleukins were found. no il-6 and il-8 were detectable after the mixed infection of p. gingivalis m5-1-2 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586 and the fourfold infection of p. gingivalis atcc 33277, t. denticola atcc 35405, t. forsythia atcc 43037 and f. nucleatum atcc 25586. conclusion: anaerobic periodontopathogenic bacteria promote the release of il-6 and il-8 by epithelial  cells. despite a continuous epithelial expression of il-8 mrna by all bacterial infections these effects are temporary because of the time-dependent degradation  of cytokines by bacterial proteases. mixed infections have a stronger virulence potential than single bacteria. further research is necessary to evaluate the role of mixed infections and biofilms in the pathogenesis of periodontitis.

TI  == detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  == to culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. micro-ident and micro-ident plus (hain  lifescience gmbh, nehren, germany) tests are two commercially available rapid pcr-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. in this study, we compared these commercial pcr-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. a  total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. the overall agreement between both methods was excellent for eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia  and porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for capnocytophaga sp, eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra (micromonas micros), and campylobacter rectus (86-78%). discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i p. intermedia/prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-ident and micro-ident plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.

TI  == oral biofilm architecture on natural teeth.
AB  == periodontitis and caries are infectious diseases of the oral cavity in which oral biofilms play a causative role. moreover, oral biofilms are widely studied as model systems for bacterial adhesion, biofilm development, and biofilm resistance to antibiotics, due to their widespread presence and accessibility. despite descriptions of initial plaque formation on the tooth surface, studies on mature  plaque and plaque structure below the gum are limited to landmark studies from the 1970s, without appreciating the breadth of microbial diversity in the plaque. we used fluorescent in situ hybridization to localize in vivo the most abundant species from different phyla and species associated with periodontitis on seven embedded teeth obtained from four different subjects. the data showed convincingly the dominance of actinomyces sp., tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, spirochaetes, and synergistetes in subgingival plaque. the latter proved to be new with a possibly important role in host-pathogen interaction due to its localization in close proximity to immune cells. the present study identified for the first time in vivo that lactobacillus sp. are the central cells of bacterial aggregates in subgingival plaque, and that streptococcus sp. and the yeast candida albicans form corncob structures in supragingival plaque. finally, periodontal pathogens colonize already formed biofilms and form microcolonies therein. these in vivo observations on oral biofilms provide a clear vision on biofilm architecture and the spatial distribution of predominant species.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of a genius nd:yag laser.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the 'in vitro' bactericidal effect of the nd:yag laser (genius, molsgaard dental, copenhagen, denmark) on six periodontal pathogens. methods: suspensions of six different periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and parvimonas micra) were prepared in small eppendorff tubes, and exposed to a nd:yag laser for five different periods of time. laser settings used: power 6 watt (on a scale of 1-12 w), frequency 50 hz, pulse duration 250 mus. after exposure to the laser, aliquots of the suspensions were spread on blood agar plates for bacterial counting. results: after 5 s of laser exposure, there was a decrease in total colony forming units for all six selected microorganisms. after 15, 30 and 45 s, no viable bacterial cells could be retrieved. conclusion: in this 'in vitro' model, 15 s of nd:yag laser use was found to be effective for total killing of the six tested periodontal pathogens.

TI  == microbiologic testing and outcomes of full-mouth scaling and root planing with or without amoxicillin/metronidazole in chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background: it has been suggested that use of systemic antibiotics should be limited to patients with specific microbiologic profiles. the main purpose of the present analysis was to study whether microbiologic testing before therapy was of value in predicting which patients would specifically benefit from adjunctive amoxicillin and metronidazole, given in the context of full-mouth scaling and root planing (srp) within 48 hours. methods: this was a 6-month, single-center, double-masked, placebo-controlled, randomized longitudinal study. fifty-one patients received full-mouth periodontal debridement, performed within 48 hours;  then, 25 subjects received metronidazole, 500 mg, and amoxicillin, 375 mg, three  times a day for 7 days, and 26 received a placebo (control group). pooled microbiologic samples were taken from the deepest pocket at baseline in each quadrant before and 6 months after treatment. six periodontal pathogens were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: forty-seven patients  were followed for 6 months. after treatment, test subjects had a substantially lower mean number of persisting sites with probing depth >4 mm and bleeding on probing than did control subjects (0.4 versus 3.0; p = 0.005; month 6). aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans) could not be detected in the antibiotic group after treatment. however, in the placebo group, three of six subjects positive for a. actinomycetemcomitans continued to be positive. lower frequencies were also noted in the test group for porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.013) and tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis) (p = 0.007). however, even subjects testing negative for a. actinomycetemcomitans at baseline had a significantly better primary clinical outcome if they received the active drugs. the presence of six putative periodontal pathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum spp., p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and t. forsythia) quantified prior to therapy was not correlated with the outcome of full-mouth srp with or without amoxicillin and metronidazole. conclusion: excellent clinical results in the antibiotics group were obtained regardless of the presence or absence of six classic periodontal periopathogens prior to treatment.

TI  == differential effects of periopathogens on host protease inhibitors slpi, elafin,  scca1, and scca2.
AB  == objective: secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitors (slpi), elafin, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 1 and 2 (scca1 and scca2) are specific endogenous serine protease inhibitors expressed by epithelial cells that prevent tissue damage from excessive proteolytic enzyme activity due to inflammation. to determine the effects of various periopathogens on these protease inhibitors, we utilized human gingival epithelial cells (gecs) challenged with cell-free bacteria supernatants  of various periopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and fusobacterium nucleatum. design: the gene expression and secretion of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were determined using real-time pcr and elisa, respectively. the direct effects of periopathogens and p. gingivalis gingipain mutants on these inhibitors were examined in vitro by western blot. the effect on the innate immune response of gecs was measured by expression of antimicrobial peptides: human beta-defenisin-2 (hbd2) and chemokine (c-c motif) ligand 20 (ccl20). results: we found that slpi, scca2, elafin, hbd2,  and ccl20 gene expression levels were significantly induced (p<0.001) in response to p. gingivalis, whose virulence factors include cysteine proteases, but not in  response to stimulation by other bacteria. p. gingivalis reduced the secretion of slpi and elafin significantly in gecs, and degraded recombinant slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2. differential degradation patterns of slpi, elafin, scca1, and scca2 were observed with different bacteria as well as p. gingivalis mutants associated with the loss of specific gingipains secreted by p. gingivalis. in addition, pretreatment of gecs with slpi, scca1, or scca2 partially blocked hbd2  and ccl20 mrna expression in response to p. gingivalis, suggesting a protective effect. conclusion: our results suggest that different periopathogens affect the  host protease inhibitors in a different manner, suggesting host susceptibility may differ in the presence of these pathogens. the balance between cellular protease inhibitors and their degradation may be an important factor in susceptibility to periodontal infection.

TI  == transmission of periodontopathic bacteria from natural teeth to implants.
AB  == purpose: prevention of peri-implantitis is essential for the success of implant rehabilitation. infection by periodontopathic bacteria is a major cause of peri-implantitis. the aim of the present study was to identify the source of peri-implant colonization by periodontopathic bacteria. materials and methods: twenty-one patients with implants were enrolled in the study. subgingival plaque  samples from the adjacent, occluding, and contralateral natural teeth were collected prior to second-stage surgery. samples from implant sulci were then obtained 2 weeks later. detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed by the polymerase chain reaction. results: the detection rates for aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium nucleatum in all subgingival samples from natural teeth were similar to that in the peri-implant sulci. multiple logistic regression analysis revealed an association between the detection of a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum in the gingival crevices of adjacent teeth and that of the peri-implant sulcus, but no association for tannerella forsythia. conclusions: the present findings suggest that colonization by a. actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and f. nucleatum at the implant sulcus was affected by these microorganisms in the gingival crevice of adjacent teeth rather than those on occluding and contralateral teeth.

TI  == progression of chronic periodontitis can be predicted by the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola in subgingival plaque.
AB  == introduction: chronic periodontitis is an inflammatory disease of the supporting  tissues of the teeth associated with bacteria. diagnosis is achieved retrospectively by clinical observation of attachment loss. predicting disease progression would allow for targeted preventive therapy. the aim of this study was to monitor disease progression in patients on a maintenance program and determine the levels of specific bacteria in subgingival plaque samples and then  examine the ability of the clinical parameters of disease and levels of specific  bacteria in the plaque samples to predict disease progression. methods: during a  12-month longitudinal study of 41 subjects, 25 sites in 21 subjects experienced disease progression indicated by at least 2 mm of clinical attachment loss. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia in subgingival plaque samples. results: no clinical parameters were able to predict periodontal disease progression. in sites undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression within  the next 3 months, significant partial correlations were found between p. gingivalis and t. forsythia (r = 0.55, p < 0.001) and t. denticola and t. forsythia (r = 0.43, p = 0.04). the odds of a site undergoing imminent periodontal disease progression increased with increasing levels of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusion: monitoring the proportions of p. gingivalis and t.  denticola in subgingival plaque has the potential to help identify sites at significant risk for progression of periodontitis, which would assist in the targeted treatment of disease.

TI  == differential ability of periodontopathic bacteria to modulate invasion of human gingival epithelial cells by porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == periodontitis is a polymicrobial infection caused by selected gram-negative bacteria including porphyromonas gingivalis. host cell invasion by p. gingivalis  has been proposed as a possible mechanism of pathogenesis in periodontitis. the aim of the present study was to assess the influence of periodontopathogens on p. gingivalis invasion of gingival epithelial cells in polymicrobial infection. p. gingivalis was tested for its ability to invade a human gingival epithelial cell  line ca9-22 in co-infection with periodontopathogens, using an antibiotic protection assay. among the pathogens tested, only fusobacterium nucleatum demonstrated the ability to significantly promote p. gingivalis invasion (p<0.01). this increased invasion was confirmed by confocal scanning laser microscopy utilizing a dual labeling technique. in contrast, co-infection with aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans or tannerella forsythia attenuated p. gingivalis invasion. the fusobacterial enhancement of host cell invasion was not  observed in co-incubation with other periodontopathogens tested. these results suggested that complex synergistic or antagonistic physiologic mechanisms are intimately involved in host cell invasion by p. gingivalis in polymicrobial infection.

AB  == the present study compared the recovery of six periodontal pathogens by paper point samples from two different aspects of periodontal lesions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr). twenty patients with untreated chronic periodontitis were randomized into two groups. before subgingival instrumentation and after 10 weeks samples in group a were taken first with a paper point half length (hp) of the probing depth, then with a paper point full length (fp) at the same site. in group b sampling sequence was reversed. analysis by real-time pcr enabled quantification of six bacteria as well as total bacterial count (tbc). statistical analysis included t test, kappa, and spearman's correlations. higher  tbc could be harvested by use of fp than by hp (mean of differences of ln-transformed counts before therapy: -0.791, ci [-1.515, -0.068], sd 0.770, p =  0.034; after therapy: -0.563, ci [-1.151, 0.024], sd 0.625, p = 0.059). the plaque composition regarding total target pathogens was similar for both samples. both, for tbc as well as for single target bacteria a strong positive correlation was found between hp and fp (kappa, spearman correlation: aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans 0.807, 0.778; fusobacterium nucleatum 0.573, 0.772; porphyromonas gingivalis 0.733, 0.824; prevotella intermedia 0.480, 0.756; treponema denticola 0.807, 0.814; and tannerella forsythia 0.692, 0.695). the recovery of target pathogens was similar following sampling at various depths of  the periodontal lesion.

TI  == quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  == oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. in this study, the presence of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time pcr. forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and dna was obtained. quantitative  detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific taqman probe/primer sets. total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial dna were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. all periodontal bacteria except for the f. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their dna represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial dna obtained from periodontitis patients. porphyromonas gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected most often. the presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. in addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial dna could be observed. the significant number of periodontopathic bacterial dna species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.

TI  == bone microbial contamination influences autogenous grafting in sinus augmentation.
AB  == background: the oral occurrence of putative microbial pathogens in humans has been documented in health and disease. the presence of periodontopathogens in patients with a history of periodontal disease may have a negative impact on bone regeneration. this investigation was conducted to confirm the presence of periodontal pathogens in bone particles harvested intraorally for maxillary sinus augmentation and to assess the clinical and radiographic outcomes 6 to 12 months  after bone augmentation. methods: culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based identification were performed by paper-point sampling of intraorally  harvested bone particles in a group of 12 maintenance patients undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation. radiographs were taken to assess and compare bone healing and volume gain at baseline and at 6 to 12 months after augmentation. results: the presence of periodontal pathogens (porphyromonas gingivalis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans [previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans], prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia [previously t. forsythensis], fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra [previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros], campylobacter rectus, enteric gram-negative rods, and dialister pneumosintes) was identified in 10 of 12 patients (83%) by culture, pcr, or both and was associated with greater bone volume loss at 6 months postaugmentation. the pcr-positive triad, p. gingivalis,  a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. intermedia, was associated with pronounced volume loss of the grafted sinus at 6 months. conclusions: to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to confirm osseous microbial contamination with major periodontopathogens in individuals undergoing maxillary sinus augmentation with a history of periodontitis. the effect on the grafting outcome  translated into bone volume loss in the grafted sinus 6 months postaugmentation.  specific microbial contamination may have an impact on osteogenesis in osseous regeneration.

AB  == background: the objective of this study was to assess the oral microbiota and clinical data in subjects without access to traditional oral hygiene methods and  who ate a diet available in the stone age. methods: ten subjects living in an environment replicating the stone age for 4 weeks were enrolled in this study. bleeding on probing (bop), gingival and plaque indices, and probing depth (pd) were assessed at baseline and at 4 weeks. microbiologic samples were collected at the mesio-buccal subgingival aspects of all teeth and from the dorsum of the tongue and were processed by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization methods. results: no subject had periodontitis. mean bop decreased from 34.8% to 12.6% (p <0.001).  mean gingival index scores changed from 0.38 to 0.43 (not statistically significant) and mean plaque scores increased from 0.68 to 1.47 (p <0.001). pd at sites of subgingival sampling decreased (mean difference: 0.2 mm; p <0.001). at week 4, the total bacterial count was higher (p <0.001) for 24 of 74 species, including bacteroides ureolyticus, eikenella corrodens, lactobacillus acidophilus, capnocytophaga ochracea, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, haemophilus influenzae, helicobacter pylori, porphyromonas endodontalis, staphylococcus aureus (two strains), streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus anginosis, and streptococcus mitis. bacterial counts from tongue samples were higher at baseline (p <0.001) for 20 species, including tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans; serotype a), and streptococcus  spp. conclusions: the experimental gingivitis protocol is not applicable if the diet (e.g., stone age) does not include refined sugars. although plaque levels increased, bop and pd decreased. subgingival bacterial counts increased for several species not linked to periodontitis, whereas tongue bacterial samples decreased during the study period.

TI  == the oxyr homologue in tannerella forsythia regulates expression of oxidative stress responses and biofilm formation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic periodontal pathogen that encounters constant oxidative stress in the human oral cavity due to exposure to air and reactive oxidative species from coexisting dental plaque bacteria as well as leukocytes. in this study, we sought to characterize a t. forsythia orf with close similarity to bacterial oxidative stress response sensor protein oxyr. to analyse the role of this oxyr homologue, a gene deletion mutant was constructed and characterized. aerotolerance, survival after hydrogen peroxide challenge and  transcription levels of known bacterial antioxidant genes were then determined. since an association between oxidative stress and biofilm formation has been observed in bacterial systems, we also investigated the role of the oxyr protein  in biofilm development by t. forsythia. our results showed that aerotolerance, sensitivity to peroxide challenge and the expression of oxidative stress response genes were significantly reduced in the mutant as compared with the wild-type strain. moreover, the results of biofilm analyses showed that, as compared with the wild-type strain, the oxyr mutant showed significantly less autoaggregation and a reduced ability to form mixed biofilms with fusobacterium nucleatum. in conclusion, a gene annotated in the t. forsythia genome as an oxyr homologue was  characterized. our studies showed that the oxyr homologue in t. forsythia constitutively activates antioxidant genes involved in resistance to peroxides as well as oxygen stress (aerotolerance). in addition, the oxyr deletion attenuates  biofilm formation in t. forsythia.

TI  == are putative periodontal pathogens reliable diagnostic markers?
AB  == periodontitis is one of the most common chronic inflammatory diseases. a number of putative bacterial pathogens have been associated with the disease and are used as diagnostic markers. in the present study, we compared the prevalence of oral bacterial species in the subgingival biofilm of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap) (n = 44) and chronic periodontitis (cp) (n = 46) patients with that of a periodontitis-resistant control group (pr) (n = 21). the control group consisted of subjects at least 65 years of age with only minimal or no periodontitis and no history of periodontal treatment. a total of 555 samples from 111 subjects were included in this study. the samples were analyzed by pcr of 16s rrna gene fragments and subsequent dot blot hybridization using oligonucleotide probes specific for aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, a treponema denticola-like phylogroup (treponema phylogroup ii), treponema lecithinolyticum, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium spp., and fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as capnocytophaga ochracea. our data confirm a high prevalence of the putative periodontal pathogens p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, and t. forsythia in the periodontitis groups. however, these species  were also frequently detected in the pr group. for most of the species tested, the prevalence was more associated with increased probing depth than with the subject group. t. lecithinolyticum was the only periodontopathogenic species showing significant differences both between gap and cp patients and between gap  patients and pr subjects. c. ochracea was associated with the pr subjects, regardless of the probing depth. these results indicate that t. lecithinolyticum  may be a diagnostic marker for gap and c. ochracea for periodontal health. they also suggest that current presumptions of the association of specific bacteria with periodontal health and disease require further evaluation.

TI  == does pregnancy have an impact on the subgingival microbiota?
AB  == background: we investigated clinical and subgingival microbiologic changes during pregnancy in 20 consecutive pregnant women > or =18 years not receiving dental care. methods: bacterial samples from weeks 12, 28, and 36 of pregnancy and at 4  to 6 weeks postpartum were processed for 37 species by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical periodontal data were collected at week 12 and at 4 to 6  weeks postpartum, and bleeding on probing (bop) was recorded at sites sampled at  the four time points. results: the mean bop at week 12 and postpartum was 40.1% +/- 18.2% and 27.4% +/- 12.5%, respectively. the corresponding mean bop at microbiologic test sites was 15% (week 12) and 21% (postpartum; not statistically significant). total bacterial counts decreased between week 12 and postpartum (p  <0.01). increased bacterial counts over time were found for neisseria mucosa (p <0.001). lower counts (p <0.001) were found for capnocytophaga ochracea, capnocytophaga sputigena, eubacterium saburreum, fusobacterium nucleatum naviforme, fusobacterium nucleatum polymorphum, leptotrichia buccalis, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, selenomonas noxia, and veillonella parvula. no changes occurred between weeks 12 and 28 of pregnancy. counts of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), and  treponema denticola did not change. counts of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia at week 12 were associated with gingivitis (p <0.001). conclusions: subgingival levels of bacteria associated with periodontitis did not change. p. gingivalis and t. forsythia counts were associated with bop at week 12. a decrease was found in 17 of 37 species from week 12 to postpartum. only counts of n. mucosa increased.

TI  == periodontal pathogen levels in adolescents before, during, and after fixed orthodontic appliance therapy.
AB  == introduction: this purpose of this study was to document and investigate changes  in periodontal pathogen levels before, during, and after orthodontic treatment in adolescents. methods: dna gene probe analysis was used to quantify the levels of  8 periodontal pathogens before, during, and after treatment with fixed orthodontic appliances in 190 concurrently treated adolescent orthodontic patients. the 8 pathogens examined were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), prevotella intermedia (pi), tannerella forsythia (tf), eikenella corrodens (ec), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), treponema denticola (td), and campylobacter rectus (cr). chi-square tests were used to determine whether the percentages of subjects with high counts significantly changed over time. logistic regression analyses were also performed to derive the relative risk of higher counts of pathogenic bacteria with fixed appliances at the various time intervals studied. results: for 6 (pi, tf, ec, fn, td, cr) of the 8 pathogens, the percentages of subjects with high pathogen counts increased  significantly after 6 months of fixed appliance treatment, but these returned to  pretreatment levels by 12 months of orthodontic treatment. no pathogen level was  significantly higher after 12 months of orthodontic treatment, and orthodontic treatment was found to be significantly protective for half of the pathogens (ec, fn, td, cr) posttreatment. conclusions: orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances does not increase the risk of high levels of these periodontal pathogens.

TI  == periodontal bacterial profiles in pregnant women: response to treatment and associations with birth outcomes in the obstetrics and periodontal therapy (opt)  study.
AB  == background: a recent clinical trial (obstetrics and periodontal therapy [opt] study) demonstrated that periodontal therapy during pregnancy improved periodontal outcomes but failed to impact preterm birth. the present study evaluated seven target bacteria, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, and fusobacterium nucleatum, in subgingival dental plaque of pregnant women in the opt study and their association with birth outcomes. methods: pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment before 21 weeks' gestation or after delivery. subgingival plaque was sampled at baseline (13 to 16 weeks; 6 days of gestation)  and at 29 to 32 weeks. we analyzed subgingival plaque samples from women who experienced fetal loss, delivered a live preterm infant (preterm women), or delivered a full-term infant (full-term women). samples were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. associations between preterm birth and bacterial counts and percentages were tested using multiple linear regression. results: no significant differences were observed at baseline between preterm and full-term women for any measured bacterial species or group of species, after accounting for multiple comparisons. changes in bacterial counts and proportions  during pregnancy also were not associated with birth outcomes. in full-term and preterm women, periodontal therapy significantly reduced (p <0.01) counts of all  target species except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusions: in pregnant women with periodontitis, non-surgical periodontal therapy significantly reduced  levels of periodontal pathogens. baseline levels of selected periodontal pathogens or changes in these bacteria resulting from therapy were not associated with preterm birth.

TI  == photodynamic therapy as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.
AB  == background: recent preclinical and clinical data have suggested a potential benefit of photodynamic therapy (pdt) in the treatment of periodontitis. however, there are very limited data from controlled clinical trials evaluating the effect of pdt in the treatment of periodontitis. the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and microbiologic effects of the adjunctive use of pdt to non-surgical periodontal treatment. methods: twenty-four subjects with chronic periodontitis were randomly treated with scaling and root planing followed by a single episode of pdt (test) or scaling and root planing alone (control). full-mouth plaque score (fmps), full-mouth bleeding score (fmbs), probing depth (pd), gingival recession, and clinical attachment level (cal) were measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months after therapy. primary outcome variables were changes in pd and cal. microbiologic evaluation of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  (previously actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), treponema denticola, parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, eubacterium nodatum, eikenella corrodens, and capnocytophaga spp. was performed at baseline and 3 and 6 months following therapy by using a commercially available polymerase chain reaction test. results: at 3 and 6 months after treatment, there were no statistically significant differences between the groups with regard to cal, pd,  fmps, or microbiologic changes. at 3 and 6 months, a statistically significantly  greater improvement in fmbs was found in the test group. conclusion: the additional application of a single episode of pdt to scaling and root planing failed to result in an additional improvement in terms of pd reduction and cal gain, but it resulted in a significantly higher reduction in bleeding scores compared to scaling and root planing alone.

TI  == rapid and simple detection of eight major periodontal pathogens by the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method.
AB  == loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) was applied to develop a rapid and  simple detection system for eight periodontal pathogens: aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola and tannerella forsythia. primers were designed from the 16s ribosomal rna gene for each pathogen, and the lamp amplified the targets specifically and efficiently under isothermal condition at 64 degrees c.  to simplify the manipulation of lamp examination, boiled cells and intact cells suspended in phosphate-buffered saline (pbs) were tested as templates besides extracted dna template. the detection limits were 1-10 cells per tube using extracted dna template. however, lamp methods using boiled cells and intact cells required 10-100 and 100-1000 cells per tube, respectively. lamps for a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and p. intermedia were then applied to clinical plaque samples, and the method demonstrated equal or higher sensitivity  compared with the conventional real-time pcr method. these findings suggest the usefulness of the lamp method for the rapid and simple microbiological diagnosis  of periodontitis, and the possibility of lamp examination without the dna extraction step.

TI  == effects of age and oral disease on systemic inflammatory and immune parameters in nonhuman primates.
AB  == this report evaluated systemic inflammatory and immune biomarkers in a cohort of  macaca mulatta (rhesus monkeys) maintained as a large family social unit, including an age range from <1 year to >24 years. we hypothesized that the systemic host responses would be affected by the age, gender, and clinical oral presentation of the population, each contributing to inflammatory and immune responses that would reflect chronic oral infections. the results demonstrated that the prevalence and severity of periodontitis, including missing teeth, increased significantly with age. generally, minimal differences in clinical parameters were noted between the genders. systemic inflammatory mediators, including acute-phase reactants, prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)), cytokines/chemokines, and selected matrix metalloproteinases (mmp), demonstrated  significant differences among the various age groups of animals. levels of many of these were increased with age, although pge(2), rantes, bactericidal permeability-inducing factor (bpi), mmp-1, and mmp-9 levels were significantly increased in the young group ( approximately 1 to 3 years old) relative to those  for the older animals. we observed that in the adult and aged animals, levels of  the systemic inflammatory mediators related to gingival inflammation and periodontal tissue destruction were significantly elevated. serum antibody levels in response to a battery of periodontal pathogens were generally lower in the young animals, <50% of those in the adults, and were significantly related to aging in the cohort. the levels of antibodies, particularly those to porphorymonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and tannerella forsythia, were most significantly elevated in animals with periodontal disease, irrespective of  the age of the animal. these results provide a broad description of oral health and host responses in a large cohort of nonhuman primates from very young animals to the aged of this species. the findings afford a base of data with which to examine the ontogeny of host responses at mucosal sites, such as the gingival tissues.

TI  == a microbiological profile of symptomatic teeth with primary endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections associated with symptomatic teeth. samples were collected by means of a #15 h-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 symptomatic (n = 30) or asymptomatic (n = 30) single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. the presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. the species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in symptomatic cases were fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, veillonella parvula, treponema socranskii, enterococcus faecalis, and campylobacter gracilis  and in asymptomatic cases were f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, e. faecalis, eubacterium saburreum, and neisseria mucosa. total bacterial counts and counts of tannerella forsythia were significant higher in symptomatic cases (p < 0.05), whereas levels of propionibacterium acnes were reduced in this group of teeth. the data of the present investigation suggested an association between higher total bacterial counts and levels of t. forsythia and the presence of pain.

TI  == bleeding on probing differentially relates to bacterial profiles: the oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study.
AB  == aim: various bacterial species are differentially prevalent in periodontal health, gingivitis or periodontitis. we tested the independent associations between three bacterial groupings and gingival inflammation in an epidemiological study. material and methods: in 706 oral infections and vascular disease epidemiology study (invest) participants > or =55 years, bleeding on probing (bop), pocket depth (pd) and subgingival plaque samples (n=4866) were assessed in eight sites per mouth. eleven bacterial species were quantitatively assayed and grouped as follows: (i) aetiologic burden (eb, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella  forsythia); (ii) putative burden (pb, campylobacter rectus, eikenella corrodens,  fusobacterium nucleatum, micromonas micros, prevotella intermedia); (iii) health-associated burden (hab, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula). results: after mutual adjustment for eb, pb and hab, the bop prevalence increased by 45% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of eb while bop decreased by 13% ( p<0.0001) across increasing quartiles of hab. mean pd increased 0.8 mm and decreased 0.3 mm from the first to fourth quartiles of eb (p<0.0001) and hab ( p<0.0001), respectively. among 1214 plaque samples with fourth quartile eb, 60% were collected from sites with pd < or =3 mm. conclusion: bacterial species believed to be aetiologically related to periodontitis were associated with bop in sites with minimal pd and/or attachment level (al). species presumed to be associated with periodontal health demonstrated inverse associations with bop.

TI  == quantitative analysis of association between herpesviruses and bacterial pathogens in periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the development of human periodontitis may depend upon  cooperative interactions among herpesviruses, specific pathogenic bacteria and tissue-destructive inflammatory mediators. this study sought to identify associations among human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus and six putative periodontopathic bacteria in periodontitis lesions. material and methods: fifteen periodontitis patients (nine with aggressive periodontitis and six with chronic periodontitis) and 15 periodontally normal subjects were included in the study. in each study subject, a microbiological sample was collected, using a curette, from the deepest periodontal probing depth of the dentition. a real-time taqman polymerase chain reaction assay was employed to determine the subgingival counts  of human cytomegalovirus, epstein-barr virus, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum and campylobacter rectus. statistical analysis was performed using the student's t-test, the pearson correlation coefficient test and the single variable logistic regression test for odds ratio-based risk calculation. results: human cytomegalovirus was detected in eight periodontitis lesions and in one normal periodontal site, epstein-barr virus was detected in nine periodontitis lesions and in two normal periodontal sites, and the study bacteria were detected in 6-15 periodontitis lesions and in  1-11 normal periodontal sites. correlations were found between counts of human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus, between counts of human cytomegalovirus and p. gingivalis, t. forsythia and c. rectus, and between counts of epstein-barr virus and p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr  virus counts were also positively associated with the level of periodontal attachment loss, probing pocket depth and gingival bleeding on probing. conclusion: this study confirmed that periodontal human cytomegalovirus and epstein-barr virus are associated with major periodontopathic bacteria and with the severity of periodontal disease. the finding of abundant herpesviruses in periodontitis lesions redefines the pathogenic paradigm of the disease. understanding the interplay between herpesviruses and specific bacterial species  in the pathogenesis of periodontitis may form the basis for new approaches to preventing, reducing or delaying tissue breakdown from periodontal infections.

AB  == objectives: to study the short-term microbiological changes following full-mouth  compared with quadrant wise scaling and root planing (fmrp and qrp) as well as long-term effects. method: twenty patients with chronic periodontitis were randomized into a test group treated in two sessions with subgingival scaling and root planing within 24 h (fmrp) and a control group treated quadrant by quadrant  in four sessions at intervals of one week (qrp). microbiological samples were taken in the two deepest pockets of the maxillary right quadrant immediately before treatment and after 1 day, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 weeks. the samples were  evaluated by real-time pcr for quantification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia as well as for total bacterial counts (tbc). results: treatment resulted in a tbc median log reduction of 0.75 (fmrp) and 0.72 (qrp). there were no differences between groups either for the short term (1 day-4 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.3150) or for long term (4-24 weeks) (analysis of variance: p=0.9671). likewise, no differences were detected for selected target bacteria. conclusion: the results of the present study showed similar microbiological outcomes following both treatment modalities.

TI  == inflammation associated with implants with different surface types.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate associated with different transmucosal implant surfaces in dogs. methods: three experimental and one control single-stage implants were randomly placed on each side of the jaw in eight dogs. the transmucosal portion of the test implants consisted of an acid-etched surface (type a), a machined surface with a circumferential groove (type c) and a surface prepared by mild anodic oxidation (type d). the control was a standard machined surface (type b). in order to determine the response to the different surfaces, plaque control was carried out twice weekly following placement of the implants for the entire period of the experiment. at 6 months, gingival biopsies and plaque samples were  obtained. the area of inflammatory infiltrate and the nature of the infiltrating  cell types were determined using immunohistology. real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to identify putative periodontal pathogens. results: inflammatory infiltrates were associated with all implant surfaces and were commonly found subepithelially and perivascularly. t cells were the predominant infiltrating cell type in all lesions, associated with the different surfaces. in all lesions the cd4 : cd8 ratio was approximately 2 : 1. statistical analysis showed that the type c surface (machined surface with a groove) had significantly larger inflammatory infiltrates than the type b surface (machined surface without a groove; p<0.05). no statistically significant differences were found with respect to the size of the inflammatory infiltrates or in terms of the nature of  infiltrating cells. however, despite the intensive plaque control regime, plaque  was present on all implant surfaces at the time of biopsy 6 months after placement. all implants had similar numbers of tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, was not detected in any sample. conclusions: these results suggest that the development of inflammation associated with implants is independent of surface type, but is nevertheless associated with the presence of  plaque. the different surfaces had no influence on the nature of the infiltrate,  with t cells being the predominant cell type in all lesions. finally, the different implant surface types seemed not to influence the peri-implant microbiota. however, the presence of the circumferential groove tended to be associated with larger infiltrates. whether this is due to increased plaque accumulation remains to be determined.

TI  == rat model of polymicrobial infection, immunity, and alveolar bone resorption in periodontal disease.
AB  == one of the predominant polymicrobial infections of humans is expressed clinically as periodontal disease. porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia have been strongly implicated as members of a pathogenic consortium in the etiology of adult periodontitis. in this study we hypothesized  that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia are synergistic in terms of virulence potential and induce chronic periodontal inflammation that leads to alveolar bone resorption in a polymicrobial infection in rats. groups of rats were infected with either p. gingivalis, t. denticola, or t. forsythia in monomicrobial infections or with all three species in polymicrobial oral infections with or without fusobacterium nucleatum. pcr analyses of oral microbial samples demonstrated that rats infected with one bacterium were orally  colonized by each of the bacteria during the study interval, and increased serum  immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody levels substantiated the interaction of the host  with the infecting bacteria. pcr analyses of the rats with polymicrobial infections demonstrated that most rats were infected with p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia as a consortium. furthermore, all rats exhibited a significant increase in the level of igg antibody to the polymicrobial consortium. radiographic measurement of alveolar bone resorption showed that rats infected with the polymicrobial consortium with or without f. nucleatum exhibited significantly increased alveolar bone resorption compared to the resorption in uninfected control rats, as well as the resorption in rats infected with one of the microbes. these results documented that p. gingivalis, t. denticola, and t. forsythia not only exist as a consortium that is associated with chronic periodontitis but also exhibit synergistic virulence resulting in the immunoinflammatory bone resorption characteristic of periodontitis.

TI  == carpegen real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. anaerobic culture for periodontal pathogen identification.
AB  == background/aims: the aim of this study was to compare two methods of microbiological diagnosis, anaerobic bacterial culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr), for the detection of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola. methods: seventy-two samples were collected from 18 patients who were suffering from aggressive periodontitis. the data obtained were compared for the two methods. results: the results obtained with real-time pcr were different from those obtained with bacterial culture. the detection differences were 3% for a. actinomycetemcomitans, 8.33% for p. intermedia, and 12.5% for f. nucleatum. however, the differences for p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were 51.39% and 36.11%, respectively. no comparison was possible for t. denticola because it cannot be identified in culture. the variations found were the result of the better detection level (10(2) pathogens)  of the pcr probe. unlike bacterial culture, pcr allows the detection of t. denticola, which does not forming colonies and is oxygen sensitive. for f. nucleatum, t. forsythia and p. gingivalis, the real-time pcr technique was more sensitive than culture. conclusion: good results were obtained with the real-time pcr technique for the six periopathogens targeted. this method seems to be indicated for its simplicity, rapidity and reproducibility but it cannot analyze  data for an antibiotic susceptibility test. the periodontist must therefore choose one of these two methods according to his specific clinical objective: to  obtain rapid, specific detection even with weak initial concentrations (but for targeted periopathogens only) or to be non-specific and analyze the pathological  activity with an antibiogram.

AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with  chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythia. method: subgingival  plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. the samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (total samples = 21,832). mean counts, % dna probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. significance of difference between groups was determined using the mann-whitney test. association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of p. gingivalis plus t. forsythia  less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. all analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: for the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens p. gingivalis and t. forsythia as well as eubacterium nodatum and treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. there were significantly more capnocytophaga gingivalis, streptococcus gordonii and veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. e. nodatum, t. denticola, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher  counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions  of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia. logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. conclusions: this investigation confirmed the strong association of p. gingivalis and t. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of e. nodatum and t. denticola  with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. other species, including s. oralis, eikenella corrodens, s.  intermedius and f. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when p. gingivalis and t. forsythia were present in low proportions.

AB  == background: inflammation is a significant component of atherosclerosis lesions. bacteria, including periodontopathogens, have been demonstrated in atherosclerotic plaques and cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial  groel with human heat shock protein 60 has been suggested as a link between infections and atherosclerosis. methods: in this study, the nature of the inflammatory infiltrate and the presence of human heat shock protein 60 and groel were examined in 31 carotid endarterectomy specimens. additionally, monoclonal antibodies were used to detect the presence of six bacteria, including those implicated in periodontal disease. results: the inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lesions was dominated by cd14(+) macrophages and cd4(+) t cells. most cells of the infiltrate as well as the endothelium were hla-dr(+), indicating activation; however, there was an absence of cd25 expression, demonstrating that  the activated t cells were not proliferating. few cd1a(+) and cd83(+) cells were  noted. human heat shock protein 60 expression was evident on endothelial cells and cells with the appearance of smooth muscle cells and lymphocytes. groel and bacteria were detected within intimal cells. chlamydia pneumoniae, porphyromonas  gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were found in 21%, 52%, 34%, 34%, 41%, and 17% of arteries, respectively. conclusion: these results give evidence for a  specific immune response associated with atherosclerosis. whether bacteria initiate the observed inflammation in atherosclerotic lesions is not clear; however, the present study shows that maintenance of inflammation may be enhanced by the presence of periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria on the tongue dorsum of elderly people.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to analyse the prevalence of oral bacteria  on the dorsum of the tongue. in addition, the relationship between the number of  teeth and the microflora present on the coating of the tongue in a population of  85-year-old people was assessed. subjects and methods: two hundred and five individuals (89 males, 116 females) from the same geographical area who were 85 years of age were examined. five periodontopathic bacteria (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and treponema denticola) and one cariogenic bacterium (streptococcus mutans) were analysed using a polymerase chain reaction assay of tongue samples from the population. results: periodontal bacteria-positive individuals have more teeth than that of periodontal bacteria-negative people. between the periodontal bacteria-positive and -negative individuals, there were significant differences in the mean number of teeth for p. gingivalis (p<0.0001), t. denticola (p<0.001), f. nucleatum (p=0.002), and t. forsythia (p=0.005), while there were no significant differences for a. actinomycetemcomitans (p=0.998) or s. mutans (p=0.147). conclusions: a wide range of species, including anaerobes, was detected in 85-year-old subjects. it was found that the detection of periodontal bacteria on the tongue coating increased with the number of teeth. there was a positive relationship between the tooth number and periodontopathic bacteria, except for a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that tongue  care is essential for preventing oral disease and needs to be part of any oral care programme in elderly people.

TI  == anti-inflammatory activity of a high-molecular-weight cranberry fraction on macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharides from periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting oral tissues. the continuous, high production of cytokines by host cells triggered by periodontopathogens is thought to be responsible for the destruction of tooth-supporting tissues. macrophages play a critical role in this host inflammatory response to periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of non-dialyzable material prepared from cranberry juice concentrate on the pro-inflammatory cytokine response of macrophages induced by lipopolysaccharides (lps) from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, and escherichia coli. interleukin-1 beta (il-1beta), il-6, il-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha), and regulated on activation normal t-cell expressed and secreted (rantes) production by macrophages treated with the cranberry fraction prior to stimulation by lps was evaluated by elisa. our results clearly indicate that the cranberry fraction was  a potent inhibitor of the pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses induced by lps. this suggests that cranberry constituents may offer perspectives  for the development of a new therapeutic approach to the prevention and treatment of periodontitis.

TI  == immediate effect of instrumentation on the subgingival microflora in deep inflamed pockets under strict plaque control.
AB  == objective: to investigate (1) reduction in the number of microorganisms obtained  directly after subgingival instrumentation, (2) rate of bacterial re-colonization during 2 weeks, under supragingival plaque-free conditions. materials and methods: effects of subgingival instrumentation were measured at one deep pocket  in 22 patients (11 smokers and 11 non-smokers). immediately after initial therapy, experimental sites, under strict plaque control, were instrumented subgingivally. microbiological evaluation was performed at pre-instrumentation, immediate post-instrumentation and 1 and 2 weeks post-instrumentation. results: mean total anaerobic colony forming units (cfus) dropped from 3.9 x 10(6) before  to 0.09 x 10(6) immediately following instrumentation. significant reductions were found for tannerella forsythia, micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum and spirochetes. significant reductions were not observed for actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. except for spirochetes, no reduction in prevalence of specific periodontal bacteria was found immediately after instrumentation. during follow-up, mean total cfu tended to increase. prevalence of periodontal bacteria  further reduced. no effect of smoking was found. conclusion: results indicate that subgingival mechanical cleaning in itself, has a limited effect, in actually removing bacteria. the subsequent reduction in prevalence of specific periodontal bacteria shows that it is apparently difficult for these species to survive in treated pockets.

TI  == cross-reactivity of groel antibodies with human heat shock protein 60 and quantification of pathogens in atherosclerosis.
AB  == background/aims: chronic infections such as those caused by chlamydia pneumoniae  and periodontopathic bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis have been associated with atherosclerosis, possibly due to cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial groel with human heat shock protein (hhsp) 60. methods: we  examined the cross-reactivity of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies with hhsp60 in atherosclerosis patients and quantified a panel of six pathogens in atheromas. results: after absorption of plasma samples with hhsp60, there were variable reductions in the levels of anti-groel and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies, suggesting that these antibodies cross-reacted with hhsp60. all of the artery specimens were positive for p. gingivalis. fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia, c. pneumoniae, helicobacter pylori, and haemophilus influenzae were found in 84%, 48%, 28%, 4%, and 4% of arteries, respectively. the prevalence of the three periodontopathic microorganisms, p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum and t. forsythia, was significantly higher than that of the remaining three microorganisms. conclusions: these results support the hypothesis that in some patients, cross-reactivity of the immune response to bacterial hsps including those of periodontal pathogens, with arterial endothelial cells expressing hhsp60 may be a possible mechanism for the association between atherosclerosis and periodontal infection.

TI  == [efficacy variation of erythromycin and spiramycin on periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis. an in vitro comparative study].
AB  == aims: erythromycin (ery) and spiramycin (spi) are the most frequently prescribed  macrolides by dentists. however, the emergence of resistant anaerobic subgingival bacteria imposes an increased vigilance. this study aims to compare these macrolides efficacy on principal periopathogens. materials and methods: twenty adult patients with aggressive periodontitis were selected and a total of 60 samples were taken from subgingival flora. bacterial strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were isolated  according to j. slots's rapid identification method. the susceptibilities to ery  and spi were studied using disk diffusion susceptibility test and minimum inhibitory concentration test (mic test). results: the efficiency variability of  ery and spi on the 50 isolated anaerobic periopathogens was present either interindividually (between different patients) and intra-individually (within the same patient). while 68% of the tested anaerobic bacteria were sensitive to spi (22% resistant), only 54% were sensitive to ery (34% resistant). although moderate, the efficacy of spi seemed more regular in general than ery: it's variation coefficient (40%) is lower than the ery one (53%). the 7 a. actinomycetemcomitans tested showed all a high resistance. conclusion: in a general way, the spectre of activity of spi is stacked in that of ery. however, this study shows a better and regular activity of spi on the main tested periopathogens. these results are in favour of the use of spi in periodontology when penicillins and doxycycline are not useful because specific problems are identified (allergy, pregnancy...).

TI  == microarrays complement culture methods for identification of bacteria in endodontic infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the microbial composition of necrotic root canals using culture methods and microarray technology. twenty uniradicular  teeth with radiographic evidence of periapical bone loss and with no previous endodontic treatment were selected for this study. for molecular diagnosis a dna  chip with 20 different species-specific, 16s-rdna-directed catcher probes was used. the microorganisms most frequently detected by the dna chip were: micromonas micros, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp., tannerella forsythia, treponema  denticola, veillonella parvula, eubacterium nodatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces odontolyticus, and streptococcus constellatus. as expected, additional important bacterial taxa were found by culture analysis, but microorganisms such as t. forsythia and t. denticola could not be identified. in  conclusion, microarrays may provide significant additional information regarding  the endodontic microbiota by detecting bacterial species that are otherwise difficult or impossible to culture.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility variation of 50 anaerobic periopathogens in aggressive periodontitis: an interindividual variability study.
AB  == background/aims: the frequent use of antibiotics in developed countries has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance. in this study, the interindividual variability of the antibiotic susceptibility of 50 putative microorganisms in aggressive periodontitis patients has been evaluated by means of vc (variation coefficient). material and methods: a total of 60 microbial samples were collected from 20 adult patients diagnosed with aggressive periodontitis (2-4 samples by patient). bacterial strains of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus micros were isolated according to slots' rapid identification method. the susceptibilities to 10 antibiotics were studied: penicillin g (pen), ampicillin (amp), amoxicillin (amx), amoxicillin/clavulanate  (amc), tetracycline (tet), doxycycline (dox), ciprofloxacin (cip), erythromycin (ery), spiramycin (spi) and clindamycin (clin), using the disk diffusion susceptibility test (dds test: kirby-bauer's modified method for anaerobic bacteria). the broth microdilution minimum inhibitory concentration test was carried out as a control test. results: among the 50 identified bacteria, 15 were p. gingivalis, 12 p. intermedia, 8 t. forsythia, 9 f. nucleatum, and 6 p. micros. the results of the dds test show that penicillins (especially amc, amp, and amx), cyclines (especially dox) and clin are highly effective against the 50 anaerobic  studied bacteria. cip and ery have the lowest efficacy against those bacteria. cip shows a very variable activity according to anaerobic bacteria species, being particularly inactive against p. gingivalis and very efficient against t. forsythia and p. micros. spi is also highly efficient but not against p. micros.  conclusions: the interindividual susceptibility of principal periodontal pathogens to antibiotics is not homogeneous and seems to vary according to bacterial species and antimicrobial molecules. this variability seems to be greater with older molecules (pen, tet, ery) than with more recent ones, which indicates more stable results (amc, amx, amp, and dox). p. intermedia appeared to be the bacteria most resistant to penicillins and showed the highest coefficient  variation. together with scaling and root planing, the combination of two antibiotics would therefore seem to be recommended in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis, particularly in the presence of p. intermedia.

TI  == effect of khat chewing on 14 selected periodontal bacteria in sub- and supragingival plaque of a young male population.
AB  == background/aims: the habit of chewing khat (catha edulis) for its amphetamine-like effects is highly prevalent in yemen and east africa, and has expanded to western countries. the purpose of this study was to estimate and compare the prevalence and levels of 14 periodontal bacteria in gingival plaque of khat chewers and khat nonchewers, as well as of khat chewing sides and khat nonchewing sides. methods: a total of 408 sub- and supragingival plaque samples were collected from 51 young males (29 khat chewers and 22 khat nonchewers; age range 19-28 years) and analyzed using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical parameters were recorded for all teeth at six sites per tooth. results: streptococcus intermedius and veillonella parvula were  significantly more prevalent in the subgingival plaque of chewers, which also showed significantly higher levels of v. parvula and eikenella corrodens. similar results were found for the subgingival plaque of the chewing sides compared to the nonchewing sides. however, there was a significantly higher prevalence and higher levels of tannerella forsythia in the subgingival plaque of the nonchewing sides. no significant differences were observed for the supragingival plaque between the two study groups. there was a significantly lower prevalence of capnocytophaga gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in the khat chewing sides,  and higher levels of v. parvula and actinomyces israelii. conclusion: the data suggest that khat chewing induces a microbial profile that is not incompatible with gingival health.

TI  == differences in prevalence of selected bacterial species in primary endodontic infections from two distinct geographic locations.
AB  == objective: this study intended to compare the prevalence of 7 putative endodontic pathogens in samples of primary endodontic infections taken from patients of 2 distant geographic locations. study design: samples from infected root canals associated with asymptomatic periradicular lesions or from pus aspirated from acute periradicular abscesses were collected from patients in rio de janeiro, brazil, and seoul, south korea. south korean samples were frozen and delivered to brazil, where all steps in the molecular analysis were performed. dna was extracted and a species-specific nested polymerase chain reaction assay was used  to detect 7 target bacterial species. results: the most prevalent species detected in brazilian samples were porphyromonas endodontalis (79% of the cases)  , treponema denticola (79%), and dialister pneumosintes (76%). the most prevalent species found in south korean samples were fusobacterium nucleatum (38% of the cases) , tannerella forsythia (26%), and treponema maltophilum (24%). overall, p  endodontalis, d pneumosintes, filifactor alocis, t denticola, and t forsythia were significantly more detected in brazilian samples than in south korean samples ( p < .05). conclusions: findings indicated that the prevalence of some species in infections of endodontic origin may significantly differ from one geographic location to another.

TI  == quantitative detection of volatile sulfur compound- producing microorganisms in oral specimens using real-time pcr.
AB  == objective: it is well-known that some periodontopathic bacteria, especially porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, tannerella forsythia (formerly bacteroides forsythus or tan. forsythensis), and treponema denticola, actively produce volatile sulfur compounds (vscs), such as h2s and ch3sh. we previously reported a qualitative relationship between periodontopathic bacteria and vscs; however, a quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria in oral specimens is required for further characterization of the relationship between oral bacteria and vscs. in this study, we report a real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing bacteria in oral specimens. subjects and methods: specimens were collected from 22 patients who visited the preventive dentistry and breath odor clinic of kyushu dental college. a real-time pcr assay using the taqman system, based on the 5'-3' exonuclease activity of taq polymerase, was employed for the quantitative analysis of periodontopathic bacteria that produce vscs. results: using real-time pcr, we performed a quantitative analysis of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, tan. forsythia, and t. denticola in the saliva, on the tongue coat, and in the subgingival plaque of patients with oral malodor. conclusion: real-time pcr using the taqman system  can be used for the quantitative analysis of vsc-producing oral bacteria.

TI  == impact of sample storage on detection of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == background/aims: information on the impact of sample storage prior to analysis by dna methods is limited. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of subgingival sample storage on bacterial detection and enumeration. material and methods: subgingival plaque samples were studied by a) checkerboard dna-dna hybridization by immediate processing, b) storage at + 4 degrees c for 6 weeks, c) storage at - 20 degrees c for 6 months or d) storage at - 20 degrees c for 12  months. results: no differences in total dna were found between protocol 1 and 2, or between protocol 3 and 4. protocol 1 yielded 2.4 times more total bacterial dna than did protocol 3 (p < 0.001). actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and campylobacter gracilis were detected in 21.1% of the immediately processed samples but only in 6.6% of the samples after 12 months of storage. similar changes were noticed for treponema denticola, which was detected in 22.3% and 9.2%, respectively. streptococci spp., fusobacterium nucleatum and tannerella forsythia did not seem to be affected by storage. in contrast, the level of campylobacter rectus detection frequency changed from 2.6% if processed immediately to 15.8% if samples were stored for 12 months. conclusions: in longitudinal clinical studies including microbiological samples and processed with dna-dna hybridization methods, samples should be stored for the same period  of time before processing to avoid loss of microbiological information.

TI  == synergy between tannerella forsythia and fusobacterium nucleatum in biofilm formation.
AB  == during dental plaque formation, the interaction of different organisms is important in the development of complex communities. fusobacterium nucleatum is considered a 'bridge-organism' that facilitates colonization of other bacteria by coaggregation-mediated mechanisms and possibly by making the environment conducive for oxygen intolerant anaerobes. these studies were carried out to determine whether coaggregation between f. nucleatum and tannerella forsythia is  important in the formation of mixed species biofilms. further, the role of bspa protein, a surface adhesin of t. forsythia, in coaggregation and biofilm formation was investigated. the results showed the development of synergistic mixed biofilms of f. nucleatum and t. forsythia when these bacteria were cocultured. the bspa protein was not involved in biofilm formation. though bspa plays a role in coaggregation with f. nucleatum, presumably other adhesins are also involved. the synergistic biofilm formation between the two species was dependent on cell-cell contact and soluble components of the bacteria were not required. this study demonstrates that there is a positive synergy between f. nucleatum and t. forsythia in the development of mixed biofilms and that the cell-cell interaction is essential for this phenomenon.
