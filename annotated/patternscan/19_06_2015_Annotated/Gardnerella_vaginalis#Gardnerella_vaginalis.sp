TI  == the influence of biofilm formation by gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes on bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the worldwide leading vaginal disorder in women of reproductive age. bv is characterized by the replacement of beneficial lactobacilli and the augmentation of anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a predominant bacterial species, however, bv is also associated with other numerous anaerobes, such as atopobium vaginae, mobiluncus mulieris, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium nucleatum and peptoniphilus sp.. currently, the role of g. vaginalis in the etiology of bv remains a matter of controversy. it is however known that, in bv patients, a biofilm is usually formed on the vaginal epithelium and g. vaginalis is typically the predominant species. so, the current paradigm is that the establishment of a biofilm plays a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. this review provides background on the influence of biofilm formation by g. vaginalis and other anaerobes in the polymicrobial etiology of bv, through its initial adhesion until biofilm formation and discusses the commensal and synergic interactions established between them to understand the phenotypic shift of g. vaginalis' biofilms into bv establishment.

TI  == sensitive detection of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by a polymicrobial proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and depletion of lactobacilli, which are components of natural vaginal microbiota. currently, there are limited conventional methods for bv diagnosis, and these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and rarely allow for  the detection of more than one agent simultaneously. therefore, we conceived and  validated a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) assay for the simultaneous screening of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents (bv-aas) related to symptomatic bv: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, atopobium vaginae, ureaplasma urealyticum, megasphaera type i, clostridia-like bacteria vaginosis-associated bacteria (bvabs) 1, 2, and 3, sneathia sanguinegens, and mycoplasma genitalium. the overall validation parameters of m-pcr compared to single pcr (spcr) were extremely high, including agreement of 99.1% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 100.0%, negative predictive value of 97.0%, accuracy of 99.3%, and agreement with nugent results of 100.0%. the prevalence of bv-aas was very high (72.6%), and simultaneous agents were detected in 53.0%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the m-pcr assay. therefore, the m-pcr assay has great potential to impact bv diagnostic methods in vaginal samples and  diminish associated complications in the near future.

TI  == the sactibiotic subclass of bacteriocins: an update.
AB  == the sactibiotics are a recently designated subclass of bacteriocins that contain  characteristic cysteine thiol to alpha-carbon linkages as post-translational modification. they are a relatively small subclass of bacteriocins compared to the most thoroughly studied lantibiotics. the sactibiotics that have been extensively studied thus far are thuricin cd, subtilosin a, thurincin h, and propionicin f. despite their recent discovery, there have already been significant advances made in the study of sactibiotics, most notably the discovery of the narrow spectrum anti-clostridium difficile sactibiotic, thuricin cd. in addition, scientists have gained insights into the mechanisms of action of the sactibiotic subtilosin a, which targets listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, and other pathogens. also, the development of heterologous host systems and homologous expression and site-directed mutagenesis systems for the sactibiotic thurincin h have opened up many opportunities for further studies on  this sactibiotic. these and other recent studies concerning the molecular biology, 3d structural elucidation, mode of action, self-protection mechanisms, and antimicrobial spectrum of the sactibiotic subgroup of bacteriocins are discussed in this review.

TI  == prevalence of sexually transmitted pathogens associated with hpv infection in cervical samples in a mexican population.
AB  == cervical cancer development has been mainly associated with persistent human papillomavirus (hpv) infections. however, hpv infection is unlikely to be sufficient to cause cervical cancer, and the contribution of other sexually transmitted infections (stis) could be the determining factor for cervical lesion-progression. the aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of stis  associated with hpv-positivity in 201 cervical samples from patients who underwent annual routine gynecological exams. the overall prevalence of stis was  57.7%, and the most frequent infection was ureaplasma spp (up) (39.8%), followed  by gardnerella vaginalis (gv) (25.9%), alpha-hpv (18.4%), chlamydia trachomatis (ct) (1.5%), and mycoplasma genitalium (mg) (0.5%). the highest prevalence rate of multiple non-hpv infections was observed for the age-range 31-40; for papillomavirus infection, the age-range was 21-30. in normal cervical samples, hpv16 was the most prevalent genotype (24.3%), followed by genotypes 58 (13.5%) and 52 (10.8%). intriguingly, hpv18 was not detected in the study population, and genotypes 52 and 58 were found exclusively in samples with abnormal cytology. papillomavirus infection with oncogenic types was significantly associated with gv (p = 0.025) and strongly associated with multiple non-hpv pathogens (p = 0.002). the following variables correlated significantly with cytological diagnosis of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (lsil): gv (p = 0.028), multiple non-hpv infections (p = 0.001), and high-risk hpv positivity (p = 0.001). epidemiological data from this study will contribute to the molecular detection of sexually transmitted pathogens from screening programs to identify those women who are at risk for developing cervical lesions. j. med. virol. 9999: xx-xx, 2015.

TI  == cervical microbiota in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes.
AB  == objective: to analyze the cervical microbiota in women with preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pprom) by pyrosequencing and to document associations between cervical microbiota, cervical inflammatory response, microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (miac), histological chorioamnionitis, and intraamniotic infection (iai). study design: sixty-one women with singleton pregnancies complicated by pprom were included in the study. specimens of cervical and amniotic fluid were collected on admission. the cervical microbiota was assessed  by 16s rrna gene sequencing by pyrosequencing. interleukin (il)-6 concentration in the cervical fluid and amniotic fluid was measured by elisa and lateral flow immunoassay, respectively. results: four bacterial community state types [cst i (lactobacillus crispatus dominated), cst iii (lactobacillus iners dominated), cst iv-a (non-lactobacillus bacteria dominated), and cst iv-b (gardnerella vaginalis  and sneathia sanguinegens dominated)] were observed in the cervical microbiota of women with pprom. cervical fluid il-6 concentrations differed between csts (cst i = 145 pg/ml, cst iii = 166 pg/ml, cst iv-a = 420 pg/ml, and cst iv-b = 322 pg/ml; p = 0.004). there were also differences in the rates of miac, of both miac and histological chorioamnionitis, and of iai among csts. no difference in the rate of histological chorioamnionitis was found among csts. conclusions: the cervical  microbiota in pprom women in this study was characterized by four csts. the presence of non-lactobacillus csts was associated with a strong cervical inflammatory response and higher rates of miac, both miac and histological chorioamnionitis, and iai representing a pprom subtype with pronounced inflammation. cst i represents the dominant type of pprom with a low rate of miac, iai, and the combination of miac and histological chorioamnionitis.

TI  == role of gardnerella vaginalis as an etiological agent of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background and objectives: bacterial vaginosis is a risk factor for obstetric infections, various adverse outcomes of pregnancy and pelvic inflammatory disease. the objectives of this study were to assess the prevalence of bacterial  vaginosis in women attending gynaecology outpatient department (o.p.d) and sexually transmitted disease (s.t.d.) clinic and to assess the role of gardnerella vaginalis as an etiological agent of bacterial vaginosis. materials and methods: two hundred women attending gynaecology o.p.d and s.t.d. clinic with symptoms suggesting lower genital tract infection were included in the study. ph  of the vaginal discharge was measured and three high vaginal swabs were collected. bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed using amsel's criteria and nugent's  method. gardnerella vaginalis was isolated and identified by standard methods. results: prevalence of bacterial vaginosis using amsel's criteria and gram stain  scoring method was found to be 51.5% and 49% respectively. gardnerella vaginalis  was isolated in only 8.7% cases of bacterial vaginosis. conclusion: our study showed a relatively high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in the population under study. women attending various healthcare facilities should be screened and treated properly to prevent recurrence. low isolation rate of gardnerella vaginalis may be attributed to factors like poor viability and fastidiousness of  the organism to grow in various media.

TI  == diagnosing inflammation and infection in the urinary system via proteomics.
AB  == background: current methodology for the diagnosis of diseases in the urinary system includes patient symptomology, urine analysis and urine culture. asymptomatic bacteriuria from urethral colonization or indwelling catheters, sample contamination from perineal or vaginal sources, and non-infectious inflammatory conditions can mimic utis, leading to uncertainty on medical treatment decisions. methods: innovative shotgun metaproteomic methods were used  to analyze urine sediments from 120 patients also subjected to conventional urinalysis for various clinical reasons including suspected utis. the proteomic data were simultaneously searched for the presence of microbial agents, inflammation, immune responses against pathogens, and evidence of urothelial tissue injury. hierarchical clustering analysis was performed to identify host protein patterns discerning uti from urethral colonization and vaginal contamination of urine samples. results: organisms causing more than 98% of all utis and commensal microbes of the urogenital and perineal area were identified from 76 urine sediments with detection sensitivities estimated to be similar to urine culture. proteomic data permitted a thorough evaluation of inflammatory and antimicrobial immune responses. hierarchical clustering of the data revealed that high abundances of proteins from activated neutrophils were associated with pathogens in most cases, and correlated well with leukocyte esterase activities and leukocyte counts via microscopy. proteomic data also allowed assessments of urothelial injury, by quantifying proteins highly expressed in red blood cells and contributing to the acute phase response. lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis were frequently identified suggesting urethral colonization and/or vaginal contamination of urine. conclusions: a metaproteomic approach of interest for routine urine clinical diagnostics is presented. as compared to urinalysis and urine culture methods, the data are derived from a single experiment for a given sample and provide additional insights into presence or absence of inflammatory responses and vaginal contamination of urine specimens.

TI  == prevalence of mycoplasma genitalium and mycoplasma hominis in urogenital tract of brazilian women.
AB  == background: the role of mycoplasma hominis and m. genitalium in urogenital tract  infections remains unknown. furthermore these mollicutes present a complex relationship with the host immune response. the role of inflammatory cytokines in infections also makes them good candidates to investigate bacterial vaginosis and mycoplasma genital infections. therefore, the aim of this study was to detect the above-mentioned mollicutes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) methodologies in vaginal swabs and dosage of cytokines. methods: vaginal swabs and peripheral blood were collected from 302 women, including healthy individuals. the molecular findings were correlated with some individual behavioral variables, clinical and demographic characteristics, presence of other important microorganisms in vaginal swabs, and levels of interleukin (il)-1beta and il-6. results: m. hominis and m. genitalium were detected in 31.8% and 28.1%  of samples, respectively. the qpcr results were associated with clinical signs and symptoms of the infections studied. the frequency of trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis was 3.0%,  21.5%, 42.4%, and 1.7% respectively. increased levels of il-1beta were associated with the presence of m. hominis and signs and/or symptoms of the genital infection of women studied. conclusion: il-1beta production was associated with the detection of m. hominis by qpcr. the sexual behavior of women studied was associated with the detection of mycoplasma and other agents of genital infections.

TI  == the significance of lactobacillus crispatus and l. vaginalis for vaginal health and the negative effect of recent sex: a cross-sectional descriptive study across groups of african women.
AB  == background: women in sub-saharan africa are vulnerable to acquiring hiv infection and reproductive tract infections. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a disruption of the  vaginal microbiota, has been shown to be strongly associated with hiv infection.  risk factors related to potentially protective or harmful microbiota species are  not known. methods: we present cross-sectional quantitative polymerase chain reaction data of the lactobacillus genus, five lactobacillus species, and three bv-related bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and prevotella bivia) together with escherichia coli and candida albicans in 426 african women across different groups at risk for hiv. we selected a reference group of adult hiv-negative women at average risk for hiv acquisition and compared species variations in subgroups of adolescents, hiv-negative pregnant women, women engaging in traditional vaginal practices, sex workers and a group of hiv-positive women on combination antiretroviral therapy. we explored the associations between presence and quantity of the bacteria with bv by nugent score, in relation to several factors of known or theoretical importance. results: the presence of species across kenyan, south african and rwandan women was remarkably similar and few differences were seen between the two groups of reference women in kenya and south africa. the rwandan sex workers and hiv-positive women had the highest g. vaginalis presence (p = 0.006). pregnant women had a higher lactobacillus genus mean log (7.01 genome equivalents (geq)/ml) compared to the reference women (6.08 geq/ml). l. vaginalis (43%) was second to l. iners (81.9%) highly present in women with a normal nugent score. recent sexual exposure negatively affected the presence of l. crispatus (<0.001), l. vaginalis (p = 0.001), and lactobacillus genus (p < 0.001). having more than one sexual partner in the last three months was associated with an increased prevalence of g. vaginalis (p = 0.044) and l. iners (p = 0.001). conclusions: although the composition of species across the studied african countries was similar, the presence of protective species i.e. l. crispatus and l. vaginalis in women with a normal nugent score appeared lower compared to non-african studies.  furthermore, lactobacillus species were negatively affected by sexual behavioural. strategies to support protective lactobacillus species are urgently  needed. trial registration: the study is registered at the trial registration at  the national health research ethics council south africa with the number doh2709103223.

TI  == complementary seminovaginal microbiome in couples.
AB  == the genital tract microbiome is tightly associated with reproductive health. although many research studies have been performed on the vaginal microbiome, current knowledge of the male microbiome is scarce, and parallel studies examining couples are extremely rare. in this work, we aimed to compare seminal and vaginal microbiomes in couples and to assess the influence of sexual intercourse on vaginal microbiome. the study included 23 couples. microbiomes of  semen and vaginal fluid (pre- and post-intercourse) were profiled using illumina  hiseq2000 sequencing of the v6 region of 16s rrna gene. seminal communities were  significantly more diverse, but with lower total bacterial concentrations than those of the vagina. gardnerella vaginalis was predominant in half of the women whose partners had significant leukocytospermia, but only in one of 17 women who  had a partner without leukocytospermia. there was significant decrease in the relative abundance of lactobacillus crispatus after intercourse, and high concordance between semen and vaginal samples. our data support the hypothesis that semen and vaginal microbiomes are in association, inasmuch as the predominance of g. vaginalis in female partners was significantly related to inflammation in male genital tracts.

TI  == natural antimicrobials subtilosin and lauramide arginine ethyl ester synergize with conventional antibiotics clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of gardnerella vaginalis but not against biofilms of healthy vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of clindamycin and metronidazole to synergize with natural antimicrobials against biofilms of bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated gardnerella vaginalis. minimum bactericidal concentrations for biofilm cells (mbcs-b) were determined for each antimicrobial. the mbcs-b of lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), subtilosin, clindamycin and metronidazole were 50, 69.5, 20 and 500 mug ml(-1), respectively. a checkerboard  assay and isobologram were used to analyze the type of interactions between these antimicrobials. the combination of metronidazole with natural antimicrobials did  not inhibit planktonic lactobacilli. clindamycin with either lae or with subtilosin was inhibitory for planktonic but not for biofilm-associated lactobacilli. all tested antimicrobial combinations were inhibitory for bv-associated mobiluncus curtisii and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. lae and subtilosin synergized with clindamycin and metronidazole against biofilms of g. vaginalis but not biofilm-associated vaginal lactobacilli. the biofilms of bv-associated pathogens can be controlled by synergistically acting combinations  of conventional antibiotics and natural antimicrobials which will help better management of current antibiotics, especially considering robust bacterial resistance. our findings create a foundation for a new strategy in the effective  control of vaginal infections.

TI  == vaginal microbiota of adolescent girls prior to the onset of menarche resemble those of reproductive-age women.
AB  == puberty is an important developmental stage wherein hormonal shifts mediate the physical and physiological changes that lead to menarche, but until now, the bacterial composition of vaginal microbiota during this period has been poorly characterized. we performed a prospective longitudinal study of perimenarcheal girls to gain insight into the timing and sequence of changes that occur in the vaginal and vulvar microbiota during puberty. the study enrolled 31 healthy, premenarcheal girls between the ages of 10 and 12 years and collected vaginal and vulvar swabs quarterly for up to 3 years. bacterial composition was characterized by roche 454 pyrosequencing and classification of regions v1 to v3 of 16s rrna genes. contrary to expectations, lactic acid bacteria, primarily lactobacillus spp., were dominant in the microbiota of most girls well before the onset of menarche in the early to middle stages of puberty. gardnerella vaginalis was detected at appreciable levels in approximately one-third of subjects, a notable  finding considering that this organism is commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis in adults. vulvar microbiota closely resembled vaginal microbiota but often exhibited additional taxa typically associated with skin microbiota. our findings suggest that the vaginal microbiota of girls begin to resemble those of  adults well before the onset of menarche. importance: this study addresses longitudinal changes in vaginal and vulvar microbial communities prior to and immediately following menarche. the research is significant because microbial ecology of the vagina is an integral aspect of health, including resistance to infections. the physiologic changes of puberty and initiation of cyclic menstruation are likely to have profound effects on vaginal microbiota, but almost nothing is known about changes that normally occur during this time. our understanding has been especially hampered by the lack of thorough characterization of microbial communities using techniques that do not rely on the cultivation of fastidious bacteria, as well as a dearth of studies on girls in the early to middle stages of puberty. this study improves our understanding of the normal development of vaginal microbiota during puberty and onset of menarche and may better inform clinical approaches to vulvovaginal care of adolescent girls.

TI  == the association of uterine cervical microbiota with an increased risk for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in korea.
AB  == recent studies have suggested potential roles of the microbiome in cervicovaginal diseases. however, there has been no report on the cervical microbiome in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin). we aimed to identify the cervical microbiota of korean women and assess the association between the cervical microbiota and cin, and to determine the combined effect of the microbiota and human papillomavirus (hpv) on the risk of cin. the cervical microbiota of 70 women with cin and 50 control women was analysed using pyrosequencing based on the 16s rrna gene. the associations between specific microbial patterns or abundance of specific microbiota and cin risk were assessed using multivariate logistic regression, and the relative excess risk due to interaction (reri) and the synergy index (s) were calculated. the phyla firmicutes, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, tenericutes, fusobacteria and tm7 were predominant in the microbiota and four distinct community types were observed in all women. a high score of the pattern characterized by predominance of atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus iners with a minority of lactobacillus crispatus had a higher cin risk (or 5.80, 95% ci 1.7319.4) and abundance of a. vaginae had a higher cin risk (or 6.63, 95% ci 1.6127.2). the synergistic effect  of a high score of this microbial pattern and oncogenic hpv was observed (or 34.1, 95% ci 4.95284.5; reri/s, 15.9/1.93). a predominance of a. vaginae, g. vaginalis and l. iners with a concomitant paucity of l. crispatus in the cervical microbiota was associated with cin risk, suggesting that bacterial dysbiosis and  its combination with oncogenic hpv may be a risk factor for cervical neoplasia.

TI  == diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by a new multiplex peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization method.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is one of most common vaginal infections. however, its diagnosis by classical methods reveals low specificity. our goal was to evaluate  the accuracy diagnosis of 150 vaginal samples with research gold standard methods and our peptide nucleic acid (pna) probes by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methodology. also, we described the first pna-fish methodology for bv diagnosis, which provides results in approximately 3 h. the results showed a sensitivity of 84.6% (95% confidence interval (ci), from 64.3 to 95.0%) and a specificity of 97.6% (95% ci [92.6-99.4%]), demonstrating the higher specificity  of the pna-fish method and showing false positive results in bv diagnosis commonly obtained by the classical methods. this methodology combines the specificity of pna probes for lactobacillus species and g. vaginalis visualization and the calculation of the microscopic field by nugent score, allowing a trustful evaluation of the bacteria present in vaginal microflora and  avoiding the occurrence of misleading diagnostics. therefore, the pna-fish methodology represents a valuable alternative for bv diagnosis.

TI  == clinical chorioamnionitis at term i: microbiology of the amniotic cavity using cultivation and molecular techniques.
AB  == introduction: the objectives of this study were: 1) to determine the amniotic fluid (af) microbiology of patients with the diagnosis of clinical chorioamnionitis at term using both cultivation and molecular techniques; and 2)  to examine the relationship between intra-amniotic inflammation with and without  microorganisms and placental lesions consistent with acute af infection. methods: the af samples obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis from 46 women with clinical signs of chorioamnionitis at term were analyzed using cultivation techniques (for aerobic and anerobic bacteria as well as genital mycoplasmas) and broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with electrospray ionization  mass spectrometry (pcr/esi-ms). the frequency of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity (miac), intra-amniotic inflammation [defined as an af interleukin 6 (il-6) concentration >/=2.6 ng/ml], and placental lesions consistent with acute af infection (acute histologic chorioamnionitis and/or acute funisitis) were examined according to the results of af cultivation and pcr/esi-ms as well as af  il-6 concentrations. results: 1) culture identified bacteria in af from 46% (21/46) of the participants, whereas pcr/esi-ms was positive for microorganisms in 59% (27/46) - combining these two tests, microorganisms were detected in 61% (28/46) of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term. eight patients had discordant test results; one had a positive culture and negative pcr/esi-ms result, whereas seven patients had positive pcr/esi-ms results and negative cultures. 2) ureaplasma urealyticum (n=8) and gardnerella vaginalis (n=10) were the microorganisms most frequently identified by cultivation and pcr/esi-ms, respectively. 3) when combining the results of af culture, pcr/esi-ms and af il-6 concentrations, 15% (7/46) of patients did not have intra-amniotic inflammation or infection, 6.5% (3/46) had only miac, 54% (25/46) had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, and 24% (11/46) had intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms. 4) placental lesions consistent with acute af  infection were significantly more frequent in patients with microbial-associated  intra-amniotic inflammation than in those without intra-amniotic inflammation [70.8% (17/24) vs. 28.6% (2/7); p=0.04]. conclusion: microorganisms in the af were identified in 61% of patients with clinical chorioamnionitis at term; 54% had microbial-associated intra-amniotic inflammation, whereas 24% had intra-amniotic inflammation without detectable microorganisms.

TI  == rapid and profound shifts in the vaginal microbiota following antibiotic treatment for bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common polymicrobial disease associated with numerous negative reproductive health outcomes, including an increased risk  of human immunodeficiency virus acquisition. bv is treatable with antibiotics, but relapse is common. a more detailed understanding of bacterial dynamics during antibiotic therapy for bv could identify conditions that favor establishment, maintenance, and eradication of bv-associated bacterial species, thereby improving treatment outcomes. methods: we used mathematical models to analyze daily quantitative measurements of 11 key bacterial species during metronidazole  treatment for 15 cases of bv. results: we identified complete reorganization of vaginal bacterial composition within a day of initiating therapy. although baseline bacterial levels predicted a longer time to clearance, all anaerobic species were eliminated rapidly within a median of 3 days. however, reemergence of bv-associated species was common following treatment cessation. gardnerella vaginalis, a facultative anaerobe, was cleared more slowly than anaerobic bv-associated species, and levels of g. vaginalis often rebounded during treatment. we observed gradual lactobacillus species growth, indicating that untargeted microbes fill the transient vacuum formed during treatment. conclusions: under antibiotic pressure, the human microbiome can undergo rapid shifts on a scale of hours. when treatment is stopped, bv-associated bacteria quickly reemerge, suggesting a possible role for intermittent prophylactic treatment.

AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin strictly depends on cholesterol and is potentiated by human cd59.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis produces cytolysin vaginolysin (vly), which has been suggested to be a contributor to bacterial vaginosis pathogenesis. vly along with intermedilysin (ily) from streptococcus intermedius have been attributed to a group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) whose pore-forming activity depends on human cd59 (hcd59). here, we show that different types of cells lacking hcd59 are susceptible to vly-mediated lysis, albeit to different extents. we analyze the effects of both hcd59 and cholesterol on vly cytolytic activity. we show that vly binds to cholesterol-rich membranes of non-human cells, while vly with an impaired cholesterol recognition site retains binding to the hcd59-containing cells. we further demonstrate that cholesterol binding by vly is sufficient to trigger the formation of oligomeric complexes on cholesterol rich-liposomes lacking hcd59. thus, vly may induce cell lysis following two alternative pathways. one requires only cholesterol and does not depend on hcd59. the second pathway involves hcd59 contribution similarly to ily. apparently, under physiological conditions vly acts in the most effective way by accepting the assistance of hcd59.

TI  == the natural antimicrobial subtilosin a synergizes with lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), epsilon-poly-l-lysine (polylysine), clindamycin phosphate and metronidazole, against the vaginal pathogen gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. bv is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately lactobacillus to a multispecies actinomyces biofilm  with the most common representatives identified as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella spp. current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. the objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against g. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. the four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-l-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin a. the use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins  as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. the microdilution method was  used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these mics in combination. clindamycin and subtilosin (cs), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against g. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). all tested combinations were found to have bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and polylysine (cp) was identified  as antagonistic against l. acidophilus in terms of both fici and bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (cm) was antagonistic against l. vaginalis for both fici and bliss synergy. the combinations of cp, clindamycin and lae, cs, and lae and polylysine were identified as bliss antagonistic against l. vaginalis but did not indicate fici antagonism.

TI  == colonization of the upper genital tract by vaginal bacterial species in nonpregnant women.
AB  == objective: the objective of the study was to evaluate the upper genital tract (ugt) presence of vaginal bacterial species using sensitive molecular methods capable of detecting fastidious bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacteria. study design: vaginal swabs were collected prior to hysterectomy. the excised uterus was sterilely opened and swabs collected from the endometrium and upper endocervix. dna was tested in 11 quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays for 12 bacterial species: lactobacillus iners, l crispatus, l jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, megasphaera spp, prevotella spp, leptotrichia/sneathia, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, and a broad-range16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene assay. endometrial fluid was tested with luminex and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokines and defensins and tissue for gene expression of defensins and cathelicidin. results: we enrolled 58 women: mean aged 43 +/- 7 years, mostly white (n = 46; 79%) and bv negative (n = 43; 74%). by species-specific quantitative pcr, 55 (95%) had ugt colonization with at least 1  species (n = 52) or were positive by 16s pcr (n = 3). the most common species were l iners (45% ugt, 61% vagina), prevotella spp (33% ugt, 76% vagina) and l crispatus (33% ugt, 56% vagina). median quantities of bacteria in the ugt were lower than vaginal levels by 2-4 log10 ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene copies per swab. there were no differences in the endometrial inflammatory markers between women with no bacteria, lactobacillus only, or any bv-associated species in the ugt. conclusion: our data suggest that the endometrial cavity is not sterile in most women undergoing hysterectomy and that the presence of low levels of bacteria in the uterus is not associated with significant inflammation.

TI  == [risk factors for bacterial vaginosis - a 3-year study in four medical centers].
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infection of the lower genital tract among women of reproductive age. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bv and the important etiological agent gardnerella vaginalis in bulgarian patients of different age groups, as well as, the risk factors forbv methods: one thousand five hundred and twenty-three (1523) women aged 16 to 45 years without previous antimicrobial therapy were included in this  study. the methods used were: scoring of gram staining of vaginal smear and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for g. vaginalis. results: positive for bv  according to the microscopic examination criteria were 47.80% from the 1523 tested women. in 88.87% from the positive samples g. vaginalis was detected using pcr, thus demonstrating high comparability of the both methods and the leading role of g. vaginalis. the most affected with bv is the age group of 21-25 years (33.21% of all subjects with bv). the most important detected risk factors were:  smoking (more than 55% with bv), single marital status (only 15% with bv are married), more than i sexual partner (more than 36% had changed the sexual partner), early onset of sexual activity (75% of b v asocciated subjects started  their sexual activity by the age 15-18 years). conclusions: the established early age for aquiring bv among bulgarian women is very important and alarming sign. this is the first study on the etiological role of g. vaginalis and on the risk factors for bv in bulgaria.

TI  == comparative genomics of lactobacillus crispatus suggests novel mechanisms for the competitive exclusion of gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == background: lactobacillus crispatus is a ubiquitous micro-organism encountered in a wide range of host-associated habitats. it can be recovered from the gastrointestinal tract of animals and it is a common constituent of the vaginal microbiota of humans. moreover, l. crispatus can contribute to the urogenital health of the host through competitive exclusion and the production of antimicrobial agents. in order to investigate the genetic diversity of this important urogenital species, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of l. crispatus. results: utilizing the completed genome sequence of a strain st1 and the draft genome sequences of nine other l. crispatus isolates, we defined the scale and scope of the pan- and core genomic potential of l. crispatus. our comparative analysis identified 1,224 and 2,705 ortholog groups present in all or only some of the ten strains, respectively. based on mathematical modeling, sequencing of additional l. crispatus isolates would result in the identification of new genes and functions, whereas the conserved core of the ten strains was a good representation of the final l. crispatus core genome, estimated to level at  about 1,116 ortholog groups. importantly, the current core was observed to encode bacterial components potentially promoting urogenital health. using antibody fragments specific for one of the conserved l. crispatus adhesins, we demonstrated that the l. crispatus core proteins have a potential to reduce the ability of gardnerella vaginalis to adhere to epithelial cells. these findings thereby suggest that l. crispatus core proteins could protect the vagina from g.  vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis. conclusions: our pan-genome analysis provides  insights into the intraspecific genome variability and the collective molecular mechanisms of the species l. crispatus. using this approach, we described the differences and similarities between the genomes and identified features likely to be important for urogenital health. notably, the conserved genetic backbone of l. crispatus accounted for close to 60% of the ortholog groups of an average l. crispatus strain and included factors for the competitive exclusion of g. vaginalis, providing an explanation on how this urogenital species could improve  vaginal health.

TI  == high atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis vaginal loads are associated with preterm birth.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis is a risk factor for preterm birth. the various conventional methods for its diagnosis are laborious and not easily reproducible. molecular quantification methods have been reported recently, but the specific risk factors they might identify remain unclear. methods: a prospective multicenter national study included pregnant women at risk of preterm birth. a quantitative molecular tool using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction  assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension quantified atopobium vaginae,  gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacilli, mycoplasma hominis, and the human albumin gene (for quality control). results: in 813 pregnancies, high vaginal loads of either or both of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were associated with preterm birth  (hazard ratio [hr], 3.9; 95% confidence interval {ci}, 1.1-14.1; p = .031). a high vaginal load of a. vaginae was significantly associated with shortened time  to delivery and therefore pregnancy length. these times were, respectively, 152.2 and 188.2 days (hr, 5.6; 95% ci, 1.5-21.3; p < .001) before 22 weeks, 149.0 and 183.2 days (hr, 2.8; 95% ci, 1.1-8.2; p = .048) before 28 weeks, and 132.6 and 170.4 days (hr, 2.2; 95% ci, 1.1-4.6; p = .033) before 32 weeks. after multivariate analysis, a. vaginae levels >/=10(8) copies/ml remained significantly associated with delivery before 22 weeks of gestation (adjusted hr, 4.7; 95% ci, .2-17.6; p = .014). conclusions: high vaginal loads of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis are associated with late miscarriage and prematurity in high-risk pregnancies. a high vaginal load of a. vaginae (dna level >/=10(8) copies/ml) identifies a population at high risk of preterm birth. further studies that both screen for and then treat a. vaginae are needed. clinical trials registration: nct00484653.

TI  == breast cancer, aromatase inhibitor therapy, and sexual functioning: a pilot study of the effects of vaginal testosterone therapy.
AB  == introduction: women with breast cancer have better cancer-related outcomes with the use of aromatase inhibitors (ais), but the physiological suppression of estradiol can negatively affect sexual functioning because of unpleasant urogenital and vaginal symptoms. local health care practitioners have observed that the benefits of vaginal testosterone in allaying these unpleasant symptoms in women with breast cancer are similar to the benefits of vaginal estrogen in women without breast cancer. aim: the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of using a daily vaginal testosterone cream on the reported sexual health quality of life in women with breast cancer taking ai therapy. methods: thirteen  postmenopausal women with breast cancer on ai therapy and experiencing symptoms of sexual dysfunction were recruited from an oncology practice. the women were prescribed a 300 mug testosterone vaginal cream daily for 4 weeks. during the first study visit, a vaginal swab was obtained to rule out the presence of candida species or gardnerella vaginalis in participants. women with positive vaginal swabs were treated prior to starting the vaginal testosterone therapy. main outcome measure: the female sexual function index (fsfi) survey, measuring female sexual health quality of life, was administered during the first study visit and at the final study visit, after completing testosterone therapy. results: twelve patients completed 4 weeks of daily vaginal testosterone therapy. when compared with baseline fsfi scores, there was a statistically significant improvement for individual domain scores of desire (p = 0.000), arousal (p = 0.002), lubrication (p = 0.018), orgasm (p = 0.005), satisfaction (p = 0.001), and pain (p = 0.000). total domain scores reflecting sexual health quality of life also improved when compared with baseline (p = 0.000). conclusions: the use  of a compounded testosterone vaginal cream applied daily for 4 weeks improves reported sexual health quality of life in women with breast cancer taking ais. dahir m and travers-gustafson d. breast cancer, aromatase inhibitor therapy, and  sexual functioning: a pilot study of the effects of vaginal testosterone therapy. sex med 2014;2:8-15.

TI  == recent progress in understanding the epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == purpose of review: bacterial vaginosis epidemiology has been transformed by new theoretical insights and methodologies, such as molecular sequencing. we summarize the progress made in these domains. recent findings: the vaginal microbiome can be classified in five to eight clusters. bacterial vaginosis-type  clusters typically constitute one of these clusters, but in higher risk women, it can constitute up to three clusters. the vaginal microbiomes may be fairly stable or be subject to rapid changes in their constitutive makeup. bacterial vaginosis  does not appear to be a single entity. certain bacterial communities are associated with particular symptoms of bacterial vaginosis that are paired with unique adverse outcomes. biofilm-producing gardnerella vaginalis are likely to play an important role in initiating the structured polymicrobial biofilm that is a hallmark of bacterial vaginosis. summary: longitudinal studies currently underway should help elucidate how to best define bacterial vaginosis and its subtypes. risk factors and outcomes associated with particular bacterial vaginosis subtypes should also be further clarified through these studies.

TI  == effectiveness of the two microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 and lactobacillus plantarum lp01, formulated in slow-release vaginal tablets, in women affected by bacterial vaginosis: a pilot study.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common reason for abnormal vaginal discharge in reproductive-age women and one of its most important causative agents is the gram-variable bacterium gardnerella vaginalis. bv is not  accompanied by significant local inflammation, whereas the "fishy odor" test is always positive. in contrast, aerobic vaginitis (av) is predominantly associated  with escherichia coli, but streptococcus agalactiae and staphylococcus aureus are also involved. standard treatment of bv consists of oral or intravaginal antibiotics, although these are unable to spontaneously restore normal flora characterized by a high concentration of lactobacilli. the main limitation is the inability to offer a long-term defensive barrier, thus facilitating relapses and  recurrences. this study was undertaken firstly to assess the ability of selected  lactobacilli to in vitro antagonize g. vaginalis to determine an association with a strain able to inhibit e. coli, thus identifying a possible use in av. the second step of the study was to conduct a human pilot trial in women affected by  bv using an association of the most promising and active bacteria. materials and  methods: for this purpose, neutralized supernatants of individual lactobacilli were tested at percentages ranging from 0.5% to 4% to determine their ability to  hinder the growth of g. vaginalis american type culture collection 10231. the bacterium that was able to exert the strongest inhibition was subsequently tested with lactobacillus plantarum lp01 in a human intervention, placebo-controlled, pilot trial involving 34 female subjects (aged between 18 and 50, mean 34.7+/-8.9, no menopausal women) diagnosed with bv. the 2 microorganisms lactobacillus fermentum lf15 (dsm 26955) and l. plantarum lp01 (lmg p-21021) were delivered to the vagina by means of slow-release vaginal tablets, also containing 50 mg of tara gum. the amount of each strain was 400 million live cells per dose. the women were instructed to apply a vaginal tablet once a day for 7 consecutive  nights, followed by 1 tablet every 3 nights for a further 3-week application (acute phase) and, finally, 1 tablet per week to maintain a long-term vaginal colonization against possible recurrences. a clinical examination was performed and the nugent score was quantified for each patient at enrollment (d0), after 28 days (d28), and at the end of the second month of relapse prevention (d56). a statistical comparison was made between d28, or d56, and d0, and between d56 and  d28 to quantify the efficacy against possible recurrences. results: l. fermentum  lf15 showed the strongest in vitro inhibitory activity towards g. vaginalis american type culture collection (atcc) 10231 after both 24 and 48 hours. in the  human trial, the 2 lactobacilli selected, namely l. fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01, significantly reduced the nugent score below the threshold of 7 after 28 days in 22 patients of 24 in the active group (91.7%, p<0.001). eight women (33.3%) recorded a nugent score between 4 and 6, evidence of an intermediate situation, whereas the remaining 14 (58.3%) showed a score <4, therefore suggesting the restoration of physiological vaginal microbiota. at the  end of the second month, only 4 women registered a nugent score >7, definable as  bv (16.7%, p=0.065 compared with d28). in the placebo group, no significant differences were recorded at any time. conclusions: bv, also known as vaginal bacteriosis is the most common cause of vaginal infection in women of childbearing age. furthermore, bv is often asymptomatic as about 50% of women with this condition have no symptoms at all and the prevalence rate in apparently healthy women is around 10%. this study suggests the ability of the 2 strains l.  fermentum lf15 and l. plantarum lp01 to counteract acute gardnerella infections effectively and significantly improve the related uncomfortable symptoms in a very high percentage of women. this could be partially attributed to the presence of tara gum, which is able to create a mechanical barrier against gardnerella on  the surface of vaginal mucosa as a primary mechanism. furthermore, long-term physiological protection seems to be established, thanks to the integration of the 2 lactobacilli into the vaginal microbiota and to their adhesion to the epithelial cells of the mucosa. in the light of the additional in vitro inhibitory activity against e. coli, their prospective use in av could also prove interesting.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis triggers nlrp3 inflammasome recruitment in thp-1 monocytes.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis is a gram-positive bacterium associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), pelvic inflammatory disease, and preterm birth. bv is the most prevalent vaginal dysbiosis in women of childbearing age characterized by the absence of normal lactobacilli and an overgrowth of g. vaginalis and other bacteria. although mucosal fluids from bv patients exhibit increases in proinflammatory cytokines and toll-like receptor 2 and 4 mrna, g. vaginalis has not been demonstrated to directly induce an inflammatory response. this study tested the hypothesis that g. vaginalis induces an inflammatory response in the human monocyte cell line, thp-1. the objectives of the study were to measure proinflammatory cytokine production, molecular mechanisms by which cytokines are  produced, and whether g. vaginalis results in death of the monocytic cells. we found that g. vaginalis induced significant increases in the inflammasome-dependent cytokines il-1beta, il-18, as well as tnf-alpha in treated cells. g. vaginalis caused significant cell death by 24h post-treatment compared  with untreated controls, but cells remained 66% viable. caspase-1 cleavage in treated cells confirmed the inflammatory cell death, and nlrp3 knockdown confirmed its involvement through reduction of il-1beta secretion. using a stably expressing yfp-asc thp-1 cell model with immunofluorescent staining, yfp-asc colocalized with nlrp3 in g. vaginalis-treated cells and the addition of a caspase-1 inhibitor wholly ameliorated il-1beta secretion. our study provides new insight into the role of g. vaginalis in inflammatory conditions in the genital tract.

AB  == objective: this study aimed to observe the morphological characteristic of vaginal discharge in patients with cytolytic vaginosis (cv) under the microscope  and to identify it in patients with cv and in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (vvc). methods: a total of 108 subjects including 21 healthy women, 33 patients with cv, and 54 patients with vvc were enrolled in the present morphological study. vaginal discharge was collected and made into smear. the morphological characteristics of these vaginal smears with gram staining were observed under the microscope. the smears were assessed for the quantity of lactobacilli, epithelial cell morphology, and the absence or presence of candida  species, trichomonas vaginalis, and clue sells. results: first, the age, the level of education, and especially the status of pregnancy of patients with cv were significantly different from those of the patients with vvc. second, the morphological characteristics of patients with cv consisted of overgrowth of lactobacilli, the presence of naked nuclei and fragments of the epithelial cells, a paucity of leukocytes, and the absence of candida species and other pathogens.  however, the morphological characteristic of patients with vvc consisted of the presence or absence of lactobacilli and the presence of normal epithelial cells,  candidal spores, blastospores, hyphae, or other pathogens such as t. vaginalis and gardnerella vaginalis. conclusions: both cv and vvc can be identified based on the quantity of lactobacilli, the morphology of the epithelial cells, and the  absence or presence of candida species and other pathogens, and the misdiagnosis  of cv as vvc can be avoided.

TI  == poly(ethylene glycol) (peg)-lactic acid nanocarrier-based degradable hydrogels for restoring the vaginal microenvironment.
AB  == women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) display reduced vaginal acidity, which make them susceptible to associated infections such as hiv. in the current study, poly(ethylene glycol) (peg) nanocarrier-based degradable hydrogels were developed for the controlled release of lactic acid in the vagina of bv-infected women. peg-lactic acid (peg-la) nanocarriers were prepared by covalently attaching lactic acid to 8-arm peg-sh via cleavable thioester bonds. peg-la nanocarriers with 4 copies of lactic acid per molecule provided controlled release of lactic acid with a maximum release of 23% and 47% bound lactic acid in phosphate buffered saline (pbs, ph7.4) and acetate buffer (ab, ph4.3), respectively. the peg nanocarrier-based hydrogels were formed by cross-linking the peg-la nanocarriers with 4-arm peg-nhs via degradable thioester bonds. the nanocarrier-based hydrogels formed within 20 min under ambient conditions and exhibited an elastic modulus that was 100-fold higher than the viscous modulus. the nanocarrier-based degradable hydrogels provided controlled release of lactic  acid for several hours; however, a maximum release of only 10%-14% bound lactic acid was observed possibly due to steric hindrance of the polymer chains in the cross-linked hydrogel. in contrast, hydrogels with passively entrapped lactic acid showed burst release with complete release within 30 min. lactic acid showed antimicrobial activity against the primary bv pathogen gardnerella vaginalis with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of 3.6 mg/ml. in addition, the hydrogels with passively entrapped lactic acid showed retained antimicrobial activity with  complete inhibition g. vaginalis growth within 48 h. the results of the current study collectively demonstrate the potential of peg nanocarrier-based hydrogels for vaginal administration of lactic acid for preventing and treating bv.

TI  == human-specific bacterial pore-forming toxins induce programmed necrosis in erythrocytes.
AB  == a subgroup of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc) family of pore-forming toxins (pfts) has an unusually narrow host range due to a requirement for binding to human cd59 (hcd59), a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gpi)-linked complement regulatory molecule. hcd59-specific cdcs are produced by several organisms that inhabit human mucosal surfaces and can act as pathogens, including gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus intermedius. the consequences and potential selective advantages of such pft host limitation have remained unknown. here, we demonstrate that, in addition to species restriction, pft ligation of hcd59 triggers a previously unrecognized pathway for programmed necrosis in primary erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]) from humans and transgenic mice expressing  hcd59. because they lack nuclei and mitochondria, rbcs have typically been thought to possess limited capacity to undergo programmed cell death. rbc programmed necrosis shares key molecular factors with nucleated cell necroptosis, including dependence on fas/fasl signaling and rip1 phosphorylation, necrosome assembly, and restriction by caspase-8. death due to programmed necrosis in rbcs  is executed by acid sphingomyelinase-dependent ceramide formation, nadph oxidase- and iron-dependent reactive oxygen species formation, and glycolytic formation of advanced glycation end products. bacterial pfts that are hcd59 independent do not induce rbc programmed necrosis. rbc programmed necrosis is biochemically distinct from eryptosis, the only other known programmed cell death pathway in mature rbcs. importantly, rbc programmed necrosis enhances the growth of pft-producing pathogens during exposure to primary rbcs, consistent with a role for such signaling in microbial growth and pathogenesis. importance: in this work, we provide the first description of a new form of programmed cell death in erythrocytes (rbcs) that occurs as a consequence of cellular attack by human-specific bacterial toxins. by defining a new rbc death pathway that shares  important components with necroptosis, a programmed necrosis module that occurs in nucleated cells, these findings expand our understanding of rbc biology and rbc-pathogen interactions. in addition, our work provides a link between cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc) host restriction and promotion of bacterial growth in the presence of rbcs, which may provide a selective advantage to human-associated bacterial strains that elaborate such toxins and a potential explanation for the narrowing of host range observed in this toxin family.

TI  == differences in vaginal microbiome in african american women versus women of european ancestry.
AB  == women of european ancestry are more likely to harbour a lactobacillus-dominated microbiome, whereas african american women are more likely to exhibit a diverse microbial profile. african american women are also twice as likely to be diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and are twice as likely to experience preterm  birth. the objective of this study was to further characterize and contrast the vaginal microbial profiles in african american versus european ancestry women. through the vaginal human microbiome project at virginia commonwealth university, 16s rrna gene sequence analysis was used to compare the microbiomes of vaginal samples from 1268 african american women and 416 women of european ancestry. the  results confirmed significant differences in the vaginal microbiomes of the two groups and identified several taxa relevant to these differences. major community types were dominated by gardnerella vaginalis and the uncultivated bacterial vaginosis-associated bacterium-1 (bvab1) that were common among african americans. moreover, the prevalence of multiple bacterial taxa that are associated with microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and preterm birth, including mycoplasma, gardnerella, prevotella and sneathia, differed between the  two ethnic groups. we investigated the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic factors, including pregnancy, body mass index, diet, smoking and alcohol use, number of sexual partners, and household income, to vaginal community composition. ethnicity, pregnancy and alcohol use correlated significantly with the relative abundance of bacterial vaginosis-associated species. trends between  microbial profiles and smoking and number of sexual partners were observed; however, these associations were not statistically significant. these results support and extend previous findings that there are significant differences in the vaginal microbiome related to ethnicity and demonstrate that these differences are pronounced even in healthy women.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal microbiota of healthy canadian women through the  menstrual cycle.
AB  == background: the vaginal microbial community plays a vital role in maintaining women's health. understanding the precise bacterial composition is challenging because of the diverse and difficult-to-culture nature of many bacterial constituents, necessitating culture-independent methodology. during a natural menstrual cycle, physiological changes could have an impact on bacterial growth,  colonization, and community structure. the objective of this study was to assess  the stability of the vaginal microbiome of healthy canadian women throughout a menstrual cycle by using cpn60-based microbiota analysis. vaginal swabs from 27 naturally cycling reproductive-age women were collected weekly through a single menstrual cycle. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was performed to amplify the universal target region of the cpn60 gene and generate amplicons representative of the microbial community. amplicons were pyrosequenced, assembled into operational taxonomic units, and analyzed. samples were also assayed for total 16s rrna gene content and gardnerella vaginalis by quantitative pcr and screened  for the presence of mollicutes by using family and genus-specific pcr. results: overall, the vaginal microbiome of most women remained relatively stable throughout the menstrual cycle, with little variation in diversity and only modest fluctuations in species richness. microbiomes between women were more different than were those collected consecutively from individual women. clustering of microbial profiles revealed the expected groupings dominated by lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus jensenii. interestingly, two additional clusters were dominated by either bifidobacterium breve or a heterogeneous mixture of nonlactobacilli. direct g. vaginalis quantification correlated strongly with its pyrosequencing-read abundance, and mollicutes, including mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma parvum, and ureaplasma urealyticum, were detected in most samples. conclusions: our cpn60-based investigation of the vaginal microbiome demonstrated that in healthy women most vaginal microbiomes remained stable through their menstrual cycle. of interest in these findings was the presence of bifidobacteriales beyond just gardnerella species. bifidobacteriales are frequently underrepresented in 16s rrna gene-based studies, and their detection by cpn60-based investigation suggests that their significance in the vaginal community may be underappreciated.

TI  == ethnic variations in cervical cytokine concentrations and vaginal flora during pregnancy.
AB  == problem: pregnancy-mediated changes in immunity may influence risk of hiv-1 acquisition. this risk appears greatest among non-caucasian women. method of study: pregnant women with low risk of immune disruption were enrolled in a prospective observational cohort. study visits occurred each trimester and postpartum. semi-quantitative vaginal cultures and concentrations of cervical cytokines were compared between caucasian and non-caucasian women. results: in the second trimester, non-caucasian women were more likely to be colonized with gardnerella vaginalis (62% versus 25%, p = 0.02) and non-pigmented anaerobic gram-negative rods (43% versus 8%, p = 0.01). mycoplasma hominis was more frequently isolated in non-caucasian women throughout the second (29% versus 4%,  p = 0.03) and third trimesters (35% versus 6%, p = 0.04). non-caucasian women had higher median interleukin (il)-10 concentrations throughout the second (128 pg/ml versus 7 pg/ml, p = 0.05) and third trimesters (224 pg/ml versus 7 pg/ml, p = 0.05). conclusion: non-caucasian women experienced a greater diversity of microorganisms and increased il-10 in the second and third trimesters.

TI  == silver sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as a valid active ingredient into a novel vaginal gel against human vaginal pathogens: in vitro antimicrobial activity assessment.
AB  == this in vitro study assessed the antimicrobial properties of a novel octasilver salt of sucrose octasulfate (iasos) as well as of an innovative vaginal gel containing iasos (silsos femme), against bacterial and yeast pathogens isolated from human clinical cases of symptomatic vaginal infections. in bhi and lapt culture media, different ionic silver concentrations and different phs were tested. iasos exerted a strong antimicrobial activity towards all the pathogens tested in both culture media. the results demonstrated that salts and organic compounds present in the culture media influenced iasos efficacy only to a moderate extent. whereas comparable mbcs (minimal bactericidal concentrations) were observed for g. vaginalis (10 mg/l ag+), e. coli and e. aerogenes (25 mg/l ag+) in both media, higher mbcs were found for s. aureus and s. agalactiae in lapt cultures (50 mg/l ag+ versus 25 mg/l ag+). no minimal concentration totally  inhibiting the growth of c. albicans was found. nevertheless, in both media at the highest ionic silver concentrations (50-200 mg/l ag+), a significant 34-52% drop in candida growth was observed. ph differently affected the antimicrobial properties of iasos against bacteria or yeasts; however, a stronger antimicrobial activity at ph higher than the physiological ph was generally observed. it can be therefore concluded that iasos exerts a bactericidal action against all the tested bacteria and a clear fungistatic action against c. albicans. the antimicrobial activity of the whole vaginal gel silsos femme further confirmed the antimicrobial activity of iasos. overall, our findings support iasos as a valid active ingredient into a vaginal gel.

TI  == comparison of lower genital tract microbiota in hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the us.
AB  == introduction: previous studies have shown that alterations of the bacterial microbiota in the lower female genital tract influence susceptibility to hiv infection and shedding. we assessed geographic differences in types of genital microbiota between hiv-infected and uninfected women from rwanda and the united states. methods: genera of lower genital tract bacterial microbiota were identified by high-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16s rrna gene from 46 us women (36 hiv-infected, 10 hiv-uninfected) and 40 rwandan women (18 hiv-infected, 22 hiv-uninfected) with similar proportions of low (0-3) nugent scores. species of lactobacillus were identified by assembling sequences along with reference sequences into phylogenetic trees. prevalence of genera and lactobacillus species were compared using fisher's exact tests. results: overall the seven most prevalent genera were lactobacillus (74%), prevotella (56%), gardnerella (55%), atopobium (42%), sneathia (37%), megasphaera (30%), and parvimonas (26%), observed at similar prevalences comparing rwandan to us women, except for megasphaera (20% vs. 39%, p = 0.06). additionally, rwandan women had higher frequencies of mycoplasma (23% vs. 7%, p = 0.06) and eggerthella (13% vs. 0%, p = 0.02), and lower frequencies of lachnobacterium (8% vs. 35%, p<0.01) and allisonella (5% vs. 30%, p<0.01), compared with us women. the prevalence of mycoplasma was highest (p<0.05) in hiv-infected rwandan women (39%), compared to  hiv-infected us women (6%), hiv-uninfected rwandan (9%) and us (10%) women. the most prevalent lactobacillus species in both rwandan and us women was l. iners (58% vs. 76%, p = 0.11), followed by l. crispatus (28% vs. 30%, p = 0.82), l. jensenii (20% vs. 24%, p = 0.80), l. gasseri (20% vs. 11%, p = 0.37) and l. vaginalis (20% vs. 7%, p = 0.10). discussion: we found similar prevalence of most major bacterial genera and lactobacillus species in rwandan and us women. further work will be needed to establish whether observed differences differentially impact lower genital tract health or susceptibility to genital infections.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal microflora in health and disease.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is an imbalance of the vaginal bacterial microbiota and its aetiology is still unknown. our aims were to investigate the diagnostic potential of species/genus specific quantitative pcr (qpcr) for bacteria present in swabs and first-void urine (fvu) samples using nugent's and claeys' criteria and 454 sequencing of the vaginal microbiome as reference. methods: self-collected swabs, vaginal smears and fvu were obtained from 177 women from greenland (study i and iii) and physician-collected vaginal swabs and  smears were obtained from 163 swedish women (study ii). bv was diagnosed by nugent's criteria in study i and iii and by amsel's criteria in study ii. the vaginal swabs and fvu samples were analysed by qpcr for selected vaginal bacteria in all three studies and for four sexually transmitted infections (stis) in study i. results: study i: stis were common in women from greenland and bv was found in 45% of these women but was not associated with individual stis. in multivariate logistic analysis, atopobium vaginae and prevotella spp. were both independently  associated with bv in swabs. bv could be subdivided into clusters dominated by a  single or a few species together. seven vaginal bacteria (a. vaginae, prevotella  spp. gardnerella vaginalis, bacterial vaginosis associated bacterium (bvab) 2, eggerthella-like bacterium, leptotrichia amnionii and megasphaera type 1) had areas under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve > 85% in swabs, suggesting that they were good predictors of bv according to nugent. study ii: for the majority of species/genera, the kappa values indicated fair to good agreement when their presence was determined by 454 pyrosequencing versus real-time pcr. the same seven vaginal bacteria as found in study i, had areas under the roc-curve > 85% in swabs from swedish women, demonstrating a good diagnostic accuracy for bv according to amsel. study iii: in a multivariate model, megasphaera type 1 and prevotella spp. remained significantly associated with bv in fvu samples. a linear regression analysis showed good agreement between bacterial load from swabs and fvu, but prevotella spp. could be detected  in high numbers in a few fvu samples without being present in swabs. after applying roc curve analysis, the same seven vaginal bacteria as previously mentioned showed good prediction for bv according to nugent in fvu. bv could be detected with comparable sensitivity in fvu and vaginal swabs. conclusion: bv can be diagnosed by molecular methods performed either on swabs or urine but it is important to apply thresholds in order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis.  furthers it was possible to identify clusters of bv dominated by single or paired bacteria, and these clusters could classify bv into subgroups, providing a more detailed understanding of the condition. seven vaginal bacteria were highly accurate for bv diagnosis both in swabs and fvu. finally a good agreement between nugent and claeys was found.

TI  == lactobacillus crispatus dominant vaginal microbiome is associated with inhibitory activity of female genital tract secretions against escherichia coli.
AB  == objective: female genital tract secretions inhibit e. coli ex vivo and the activity may prevent colonization and provide a biomarker of a healthy microbiome. we hypothesized that high e. coli inhibitory activity would be associated with a lactobacillus crispatus and/or jensenii dominant microbiome and differ from that of women with low inhibitory activity. study design: vaginal swab cell pellets from 20 samples previously obtained in a cross-sectional study  of near-term pregnant and non-pregnant healthy women were selected based on having high (>90% inhibition) or low (<20% inhibition) anti-e. coli activity. the v6 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene was amplified and sequenced using the illumina hiseq 2000 platform. filtered culture supernatants from lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus iners, and gardnerella vaginalis were also assayed for e. coli inhibitory activity. results: sixteen samples (10 with high and 6 with low activity) yielded evaluable microbiome data. there was no difference in the predominant microbiome species in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women (n = 8  each). however, there were significant differences between women with high compared to low e. coli inhibitory activity. high activity was associated with a  predominance of l. crispatus (p<0.007) and culture supernatants from l. crispatus exhibited greater e. coli inhibitory activity compared to supernatants obtained from l. iners or g. vaginalis. notably, the e. coli inhibitory activity varied among different strains of l. crispatus. conclusion: microbiome communities with  abundant l. crispatus likely contribute to the e. coli inhibitory activity of vaginal secretions and efforts to promote this environment may prevent e. coli colonization and related sequelae including preterm birth.

TI  == rifaximin modulates the vaginal microbiome and metabolome in women affected by bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common vaginal disorder characterized by the decrease of lactobacilli and overgrowth of gardnerella vaginalis and resident anaerobic vaginal bacteria. in the present work, the effects of rifaximin vaginal tablets on vaginal microbiota and metabolome of women affected by bv were investigated by combining quantitative pcr and a metabolomic approach based on (1)h nuclear magnetic resonance. to highlight the general trends of the bacterial communities and metabolomic profiles in response to the antibiotic/placebo therapy, a multivariate statistical strategy was set up based on the trajectories traced by vaginal samples in a principal component analysis space. our data demonstrated the efficacy of rifaximin in restoring a health-like condition in terms of both bacterial communities and metabolomic features. in particular, rifaximin treatment was significantly associated with an increase in the lactobacillus/bv-related bacteria ratio, as well as with an increase in lactic acid concentration and a decrease of a pool of metabolites typically produced by  bv-related bacteria (acetic acid, succinate, short-chain fatty acids, and biogenic amines). among the tested dosages of rifaximin (100 and 25 mg for 5 days and 100 mg for 2 days), 25 mg for 5 days was found to be the most effective.

AB  == microporous, poly (varepsilon-caprolactone) (pcl) matrices loaded with the antibacterial, metronidazole were produced by rapidly cooling suspensions of drug powder in pcl solutions in acetone. drug incorporation in the matrices increased  from 2.0% to 10.6% w/w on raising the drug loading of the pcl solution from 5% to 20% w/w measured with respect to the pcl content. drug loading efficiencies of 40-53% were obtained. rapid 'burst release' of 35-55% of the metronidazole content was recorded over 24 h when matrices were immersed in simulated vaginal fluid (svf), due to the presence of large amounts of drug on matrix surface as revealed by raman microscopy. gradual release of around 80% of the drug content occurred over the following 12 days. metronidazole released from pcl matrices in  svf retained antimicrobial activity against gardnerella vaginalis in vitro at levels up to 97% compared to the free drug. basic modelling predicted that the concentrations of metronidazole released into vaginal fluid in vivo from a pcl matrix in the form of an intravaginal ring would exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration of metronidazole against g. vaginalis. these findings recommend further investigation of pcl matrices as intravaginal devices for controlled delivery of metronidazole in the treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == seasonal variation of antibacterial activities in the green alga ulva pertusa kjellman.
AB  == the present study was performed to screen out the extracts of algae and assess the seasonal variation in antimicrobial activity of ulva pertusa against gardnerella vaginalis. seasonal variation in antibacterial activity was observed, with the extracts showing no activity during summer and autumn, and showing antibacterial activity from early winter (december) to middle spring (april). the maximum value of antimicrobial activity (6.5 mm inhibition zone at 5 mg disk(-1)) of u. pertusa against g. vaginalis was observed in april. otherwise, for both chlorophyll a and b, the highest content (2.87 mg g(-1) and 1.37 mg g(-1)) was observed in march 2009. these results may reflect variation in cellular chemical  compositions such as secondary metabolite(s) rather than chlorophyll and biological activities according to season.

TI  == curative effect of the probiotic strain lactobacillus fermentum l23 in a murine model of vaginal infection by gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection characterized by changes in the vaginal microbiota. the objective of this work was to evaluate the colonization ability and curative effect of lactobacillus fermentum l23 after vaginal administration in female balb/c mice infected with gardnerella vaginalis. one dose of lact. fermentum l23 containing 10(9 ) cfu ml(-1) was administered locally in a murine vaginal model. l23 colonized the vaginal tract of balb-c mice after one inoculation. the infection by g. vaginalis in a murine model was induced by vaginal administration of a 1 x 10(6 ) cfu ml(-1) suspension. infection with the  pathogen was observed in the vaginal tract for 4 days. at 144 h after inoculation, levels of 4 log10 cfu ml(-1) were observed. the curative effect of l23 was evaluated with one administration at 1 x 10(9 ) cfu ml(-1) 72 h after the inoculation with g. vaginalis. lactobacillus fermentum l23 inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis. the results of suppression of g. vaginalis using different concentrations of l23 were favourable due that these concentrations are normally  used in commercial formulas. the obtained results indicate that lact. fermentum l23 inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis. therefore, l23 might be used as a potential biotherapeutic agent for the elimination of this bacterium. significance and impact of the study: the use of the probiotic strain lactobacillus fermentum l23 as a biotherapeutic agent can be expected to prevent  and treat genital infections, particularly recurrent bacterial vaginosis, with similar concentrations to those normally used in commercial formulas. it is likely that the use of this probiotic strain for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis will provide a natural and nontoxic treatment modality.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis outcompetes 29 other bacterial species isolated from patients with bacterial vaginosis, using in an in vitro biofilm formation model.
AB  == despite the worldwide prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv), its etiology is still unknown. although bv has been associated with the presence of biofilm, the  ability of bv-associated bacteria to form biofilms is still largely unknown. here, we isolated 30 bv-associated species and characterized their virulence, using an in vitro biofilm formation model. our data suggests that gardnerella vaginalis had the highest virulence potential, as defined by higher initial adhesion and cytotoxicity of epithelial cells, as well as the greater propensity  to form a biofilm. interestingly, we also demonstrated that most of the bv-associated bacteria had a tendency to grow as biofilms.

TI  == polyethylene glycol-based hydrogels for controlled release of the antimicrobial subtilosin for prophylaxis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == current treatment options for bacterial vaginosis (bv) have been shown to be inadequate at preventing recurrence and do not provide protection against associated infections, such as that with hiv. this study examines the feasibility of incorporating the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin within covalently cross-linked polyethylene glycol (peg)-based hydrogels for vaginal administration. the peg-based hydrogels (4% and 6% [wt/vol]) provided a two-phase release of subtilosin, with an initial rapid release rate of 4.0 mug/h (0 to 12 h) followed by a slow, sustained release rate of 0.26 mug/h (12 to 120 h). the subtilosin-containing hydrogels inhibited the growth of the major bv-associated pathogen gardnerella vaginalis with a reduction of 8 log10 cfu/ml with hydrogels  containing >/=15 mug entrapped subtilosin. in addition, the growth of four common species of vaginal lactobacilli was not significantly inhibited in the presence of the subtilosin-containing hydrogels. the above findings demonstrate the potential application of vaginal subtilosin-containing hydrogels for prophylaxis  of bv.

TI  == identification of vaginal lactobacilli with potential probiotic properties isolated from women in north lebanon.
AB  == the aim of this work was to study the diversity of vaginal lactobacilli in lebanese women and to evaluate the antagonism, hydrophobicity, and safety characteristics of these strains. this study was performed on samples from 135 women who visited a gynecology clinic in the north of lebanon, between september  2012 and january 2013. from these samples, 53 different isolates of vaginal lactobacilli were collected from vaginal swabs and identified using biochemical and molecular methods. the use of genotypic rep-pcr fingerprinting allowed for the organization of these isolates into 23 different groups. seven of the isolated lactobacilli were antagonistic against the following vaginal pathogens:  gardnerella vaginalis cip7074t, staphylococcus aureus atcc33862, escherichia coli cip103982, and candida albicans atcc10231. the antagonistic lactobacilli strains  were then identified using 16s rdna sequence. the data of this study show that the antagonistic lactobacilli were non-hemolytic, sensitive to most antibiotic tests, free of plasmid dna, and exhibited interesting hydrophobicity and autoaggregation properties positioning them as potential candidates for probiotic design.

TI  == role of gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis: a conceptual model.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge and is associated with important public health complications such as preterm birth and acquisition or transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted infections. continued controversy concerning the pathogenesis of bv has led to a lack of progress in prevention and management of  this infection. methods: development of a conceptual model for the pathogenesis of bv based on review of past and current research. results: our model suggests that bv is initiated by the sexual transmission of gardnerella vaginalis, which has the appropriate virulence factors to adhere to host epithelium, create a biofilm community, and successfully compete with lactobacilli for dominance in the vaginal environment. the genetic diversity of g. vaginalis may result in virulent and avirulent strains. symbiotic relationships with normally dormant vaginal anaerobes lead to increases in the latter which contribute to the symptoms of bv. conclusions: g. vaginalis is the pathogen responsible for the initiation of bv. future research should focus on preventing its transmission and improved therapeutics for the biofilm infection that is caused by this pathogen and host anaerobes.

TI  == the composition and stability of the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women  is different from that of non-pregnant women.
AB  == background: this study was undertaken to characterize the vaginal microbiota throughout normal human pregnancy using sequence-based techniques. we compared the vaginal microbial composition of non-pregnant patients with a group of pregnant women who delivered at term. results: a retrospective case-control longitudinal study was designed and included non-pregnant women (n = 32) and pregnant women who delivered at term (38 to 42 weeks) without complications (n =  22). serial samples of vaginal fluid were collected from both non-pregnant and pregnant patients. a 16s rrna gene sequence-based survey was conducted using pyrosequencing to characterize the structure and stability of the vaginal microbiota. linear mixed effects models and generalized estimating equations were used to identify the phylotypes whose relative abundance was different between the two study groups. the vaginal microbiota of normal pregnant women was different from that of non-pregnant women (higher abundance of lactobacillus vaginalis, l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii and lower abundance of 22 other phylotypes in pregnant women). bacterial community state type (cst) iv-b or cst iv-a characterized by high relative abundance of species of genus atopobium as well as the presence of prevotella, sneathia, gardnerella, ruminococcaceae, parvimonas, mobiluncus and other taxa previously shown to be associated with bacterial vaginosis were less frequent in normal pregnancy. the stability of the  vaginal microbiota of pregnant women was higher than that of non-pregnant women;  however, during normal pregnancy, bacterial communities shift almost exclusively  from one cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. to another cst dominated by lactobacillus spp. conclusion: we report the first longitudinal study of the vaginal microbiota in normal pregnancy. differences in the composition and stability of the microbial community between pregnant and non-pregnant women were observed. lactobacillus spp. were the predominant members of the microbial community in normal pregnancy. these results can serve as the basis to study the  relationship between the vaginal microbiome and adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == the diversity of receptor recognition in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are bacterial pore-forming toxins secreted mainly by pathogenic gram-positive bacteria. cdcs generally recognize and bind to membrane cholesterol to create pores and lyse target cells. however,  in contrast to typical cdcs such as streptolysin o, several atypical cdcs have been reported. the first of these was intermedilysin, which is secreted by streptococcus intermedius and has human cell-specificity, human cd59 (hucd59) being its receptor. in the study reported here, the diversity of receptor recognition among cdcs was investigated and multi-receptor recognition characteristics were identified within this toxin family. streptococcus mitis-derived human platelet aggregation factor (sm-hpaf) secreted by s. mitis strain nm-65 isolated from a patient with kawasaki disease was previously shown to hemolyze erythrocytes in a species-dependent manner, its maximum activity being in human cells. in the present study, it was found that sm-hpaf recognizes  both membrane cholesterol and hucd59 as receptors for triggering pore-formation.  moreover, vaginolysin (vly) of gardnerella vaginalis showed similar characteristics to sm-hpaf regarding receptor recognition. on the basis of the results presented here, the mode of receptor recognition of cdcs can be categorized into the following three groups: (i) group i, comprising typical cdcs with high affinity to cholesterol and no or very little affinity to hucd59; (ii)  group ii, including atypical cdcs such as ily, with no or very little affinity to cholesterol and high affinity to hucd59; and (iii) group iii, which contains atypical cdcs such as sm-hpaf and vly with affinity to both cholesterol and hucd59.

TI  == benzoyl peroxide formulated polycarbophil/carbopol 934p hydrogel with selective antimicrobial activity, potentially beneficial for treatment and prevention of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the human vagina is colonized by a variety of indigenous microflora; in healthy individuals the predominant bacterial genus is lactobacillus while those with bacterial vaginosis (bv) carry a variety of anaerobic representatives of the phylum actinobacteria. in this study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of  benzoyl peroxide (bpo) encapsulated in a hydrogel against gardnerella vaginalis,  one of the causative agents of bv, as well as indicating its safety for healthy human lactobacilli. herein, it is shown that in well diffusion assays g. vaginalis is inhibited at 0.01% hydrogel-encapsulated bpo and that the tested lactobacillus spp. can tolerate concentrations of bpo up to 2.5%. in direct contact assays (cells grown in a liquid culture containing hydrogel with 1% bpo or bpo particles), we demonstrated that hydrogels loaded with 1% bpo caused 6-log reduction of g. vaginalis. conversely, three of the tested lactobacillus spp. were not inhibited while l. acidophilus growth was slightly delayed. the rheological properties of the hydrogel formulation were probed using oscillation  frequency sweep, oscillation shear stress sweep, and shear rate sweep. this shows the gel to be suitable for vaginal application and that the encapsulation of bpo  did not alter rheological properties.

TI  == reconstitution of cholesterol-dependent vaginolysin into tethered phospholipid bilayers: implications for bioanalysis.
AB  == functional reconstitution of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin vaginolysin (vly) from gardnerella vaginalis into artificial tethered bilayer membranes (tblms) has been accomplished. the reconstitution of vly was followed in real-time by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (eis). changes of the eis parameters of the tblms upon exposure to vly solutions were consistent with the formation of water-filled pores in the membranes. it was found that reconstitution of vly is a strictly cholesterol-dependent, irreversible process.  at a constant cholesterol concentration reconstitution of vly occurred in a concentration-dependent manner, thus allowing the monitoring of vly concentration and activity in vitro and opening possibilities for tblm utilization in bioanalysis. eis methodology allowed us to detect vly down to 0.5 nm (28 ng/ml) concentration. inactivation of vly by certain amino acid substitutions led to noticeably lesser tblm damage. pre-incubation of vly with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody 9b4 inactivated the vly membrane damage in a concentration-dependent manner, while the non-neutralizing antibody 21a5 exhibited no effect. these findings demonstrate the biological relevance of the interaction between vly and the tblm. the membrane-damaging interaction between vly and tblm was observed in the absence of the human cd59 receptor, known to strongly facilitate the hemolytic activity of vly. taken together, our study demonstrates the applicability of tblms as a bioanalytical platform for the detection of the activity of vly and possibly other cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.

TI  == increased gardnerella vaginalis urogenital biofilm in inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == introduction: inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) is a systemic inflammatory condition that affects the entire organism, not only the bowel. an impaired interaction with microbiota has been shown to be important. we looked for bacterial factors, which may contribute to the well-known higher incidence of poor reproductive outcome in ibd. methods: urine specimen of patients with crohn's disease (n=42), ulcerative colitis (n=46), and randomly selected patients attending the general internal medicine outpatient clinic of the charite for non-ibd related medical conditions (n=49) was analyzed for bacteria adherent to desquamated epithelial cells and diffusely distributed bacteria in the urine using fluorescence in situ hybridization. results: the urine of ibd patients contained significantly more often gardnerella vaginalis biofilms (cd 38%, uc 43%) than those of the control group (16%). there was no link between current disease activity, history of and present fistula and g. vaginalis biofilms, but the samples of patients with steroid refractory/dependent disease were significantly more often g. vaginalis biofilm positive. no significant differences in number of epithelial cells and leukocytes, and total bacterial counts were present. conclusions: there is a significant link between ibd and g.  vaginalis biofilm. this observation suggests an epithelial barrier dysfunction of the genital tract. since g. vaginalis is believed to be one of the reasons responsible for bacterial vaginosis, it may be an important factor in the well-known higher incidence of poor reproductive outcome in ibd. excessive g. vaginalis biofilms in steroid refractory/dependent disease suggests a need to avoid long-term steroid therapy.

TI  == more than meets the eye: associations of vaginal bacteria with gram stain morphotypes using molecular phylogenetic analysis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a highly prevalent condition associated with adverse  health outcomes. gram stain analysis of vaginal fluid is the standard for confirming the diagnosis of bv, wherein abundances of key bacterial morphotypes are assessed. these lactobacillus, gardnerella, bacteroides, and mobiluncus morphotypes were originally linked to particular bacterial species through cultivation studies, but no studies have systematically investigated associations between uncultivated bacteria detected by molecular methods and gram stain findings. in this study, 16s-rrna pcr/pyrosequencing was used to examine associations between vaginal bacteria and bacterial morphotypes in 220 women with and without bv. species-specific quantitative pcr (qpcr) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methods were used to document concentrations of two bacteria with curved rod morphologies: mobiluncus and the fastidious bv-associated bacterium-1 (bvab1). rank abundance of vaginal bacteria in samples with evidence  of curved gram-negative rods showed that bvab1 was dominant (26.1%), while mobiluncus was rare (0.2% of sequence reads). bvab1 sequence reads were associated with mobiluncus morphotypes (p<0.001). among women with curved rods, mean concentration of bvab1 dna was 2 log units greater than mobiluncus (p<0.001) using species-specific quantitative pcr. fish analyses revealed that mean number  of bvab1 cells was 2 log units greater than mobiluncus cells in women with highest nugent score (p<0.001). prevotella and porphyromonas spp. were significantly associated with the "bacteroides morphotype," whereas bacteroides species were rare. gram-negative rods designated mobiluncus morphotypes on gram stain are more likely bvab1. these findings provide a clearer picture of the bacteria associated with morphotypes on vaginal gram stain.

TI  == prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis among women with lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora.
AB  == objectives: to determine the prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis in women with normal vaginal flora. methods: women without symptoms or signs of vaginal infection and five or fewer lifetime sexual partners were recruited for a longitudinal study of vaginal flora. negative amsel criteria and a nugent score of 0-3 were required for enrolment. vaginal specimens were self-collected daily for gram stain and every 3 days for pcr for g vaginalis for 30 days. women completed daily diaries recording sexual activity, symptoms and menses. results:  twenty women were recruited for the study with 19 completing all specimens and 1  lost to follow-up. during the 30-day study period, 13/19 (68.4%) of women had normal nugent scores (0-3) whereas 6/19 (31.6%) of women had at least 2 days of nugent scores in the intermediate range (p=0.09). among the 19 women, 9 (47%) were negative for g vaginalis by pcr throughout the study period whereas 10 (53%) had at least one specimen that demonstrated the presence of g vaginalis by pcr. of those women with intermediate flora on gram stain during the course of the study 5/6 (83.3%) were positive for g vaginalis while 5/13 (38.5%) of those women with only normal nugent scores were positive for g vaginalis. thus, 61.5% of women with normal nugent scores had no evidence of g vaginalis by serial pcr. conclusions: gardnerella may not be part of the normal flora in women with optimal vaginal health.

AB  == background: the incidence of cervical cancer in paraguay is among the highest in  the world, with the human papillomavirus (hpv) being a necessary factor for cervical cancer. knowledge about hpv infection among indigenous women is limited. this cross-sectional study analyzed the frequency of hpv and other genital infections in indigenous paraguayan women of the department of presidente hayes.  methods: this study included 181 sexually active women without cervical lesions.  they belonged to the following ethnicities: maka (n = 40); nivacle (n = 23); sanapana (n = 33); enxet sur (n = 51) and toba-qom (n = 34). the detection of hpv and other gynecological infectious microorganisms was performed by either molecular methods (for mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis), gram staining and/or culture (for gardnerella vaginalis, candida sp, trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae), serological methods (for treponema pallidum, human immunodeficiency virus [hiv]) or cytology (cervical inflammation). results: a high prevalence (41.4%) of women positive for at least  one sexually transmitted infection (sti) was found (23.2% any-type hpv, 11.6% t pallidum, 10.5% t vaginalis, 9.9% c trachomatis and 0.6% hiv) with 12.2% having more than one sti. hpv infection was the most frequent, with 16.1% of women positive for high-risk hpv types. there was a statistically significant association observed between any-type hpv and c trachomatis (p = 0.004), which indicates that the detection of one of these agents should suggest the presence of the other. there was no association between any-type hpv and other genital infections or cervical inflammation, suggesting that other mechanism could exist  to favor infection with the virus. conclusion: this multidisciplinary work suggests that stis are frequent, making it necessary to implement control measures and improve diagnosis in order to increase the number of cases detected, especially in populations with poor access to health centers.

TI  == identification, quantification and subtyping of gardnerella vaginalis in noncultured clinical vaginal samples by quantitative pcr.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis is an important component of the human vaginal microflora.  it is proposed to play a key role in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis (bv), the most common vaginal condition. here we describe the development, validation and comparative analysis of a novel molecular approach capable of g. vaginalis identification, quantification and subtyping in noncultured vaginal specimens. using two quantitative pcr (qpcr) assays, we analysed g. vaginalis bacterial loads and clade distribution in 60 clinical vaginal-swab samples. a very high pathogen prevalence was revealed by species-specific qpcr not only among bv patients (100 %), but also in healthy women (97 %), although the g. vaginalis concentration was significantly lower in non-bv samples. g. vaginalis clades identified in vaginal specimens by subtyping multiplex qpcr, which targets four clade-specific genetic markers, had frequencies of 53 % for clade 1, 25 % for clade 2, 32 % for clade 3 and 83 % for clade 4. multiple clades were found in 70 % of samples. single g. vaginalis clades were represented by clade 1 and clade 4 in 28 % of specimens. a positive association with bv was shown for clade 1 and  clade 3, while clade 2 was positively associated with intermediate vaginal microflora, but not with bv. clade 4 demonstrated no correlation with the disorder. the presence of multiple clades had a high positive association with bv, whereas g. vaginalis identified as a single clade was negatively linked with  the condition. polyclonal g. vaginalis infection may be a risk factor for bv.

AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition, although its aetiology remains unexplained. the aim of this study was to analyse the composition of vaginal microbiota in women from greenland to provide a quantitative description and improve the understanding of bv. methods: self-collected vaginal smears and swabs were obtained from 177 women. the vaginal smears were graded for bv according to nugent's criteria. the vaginal swab samples were analysed by 19 quantitative pcrs (qpcrs) for selected vaginal bacteria and by pcr for four sexually transmitted infections (stis). results: stis were common: mycoplasma genitalium 12%, chlamydia trachomatis 7%, neisseria  gonorrhoeae 1%, and trichomonas vaginalis 0.5%. bv was found in 45% of women, but was not associated with individual stis. seven of the 19 vaginal bacteria (atopobium vaginae, prevotella spp., gardnerella vaginalis, bvab2, eggerthella-like bacterium, leptotrichia amnionii, and megasphaera type 1) had areas under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve > 85%, suggesting they are good predictors of bv according to nugent. prevotella spp. had the highest odds ratio for bv (or 437; 95% ci 82-2779) in univariate analysis considering only specimens with a bacterial load above the threshold determined by roc curve analysis as positive, as well as the highest adjusted odds ratio in  multivariate logistic regression analysis (or 4.4; 95% ci 1.4-13.5). bv could be  subdivided into clusters dominated by a single or a few species together. conclusions: bv by nugent score was highly prevalent. two of seven key species (prevotella spp. and a. vaginae) remained significantly associated with bv in a multivariate model after adjusting for other bacterial species. g. vaginalis and  prevotella spp. defined the majority of bv clusters.

AB  == in this contribution we present a sensitive colorimetric bioactive paper fabricated to determine sialidase-related diseases like bacterial vaginosis (bv)  in a one-step and dry format spot assay with fast response and good storage stability. the paper was prepared by three simple steps. the first step involves  preparation of poly(ethyleneimine) (pei) microcapsules, the second step is to incubate positively charged microcapsules in negatively charged 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-a-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid (bcin) solution, a color enhancer nitro blue tetrazolium (nbt), and in the third step, paper was fabricated by incorporating incubated microcapsules into paper pulp. this paper changes color from white to dark purple in the presence of sialidase in as little as 6min, and color could be enhanced with increased length of reaction time. in this reaction system, bcin was the substrate for sialidase, nbt was the color enhancer, and pei microcapsules acted as catalyst. the loading efficiency of bcin was about 22.2%, and filtered bcin solution could be reused for the next fabrication.

TI  == [sexually transmitted infections in women living in a prison in lima, peru].
AB  == in order to determine the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections (sti) in  recluse women of chorrillos penitentiary i in the city of lima, peru, a cross-sectional study was performed, including a simple random sample of women between ages 18 and 54, from whom 180 serum samples and 168 samples of cervical and vaginal discharge were analyzed. the most prevalent etiologic agents identified from cervical and vaginal discharge samples were chlamydia trachomatis in 42.3%, gardnerella vaginalis in 24.4% and trichomonas vaginalis in 10.1% and for serum samples the most prevalent were syphilis and hiv, both in 2.2%. we conclude that there is a high prevalence of sexually transmitted infections in recluse women of chorrillos penitentiary i in the city of lima, peru. there should be routine screenings established for diagnosis and treatment of stis within the prison system and this population should be included in the sexual and reproductive health programs.

TI  == vaginolysin drives epithelial ultrastructural responses to gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis, the bacterial species most frequently isolated from women  with bacterial vaginosis (bv), produces a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc),  vaginolysin (vly). at sublytic concentrations, cdcs may initiate complex signaling cascades crucial to target cell survival. using live-cell imaging, we observed the rapid formation of large membrane blebs in human vaginal and cervical epithelial cells (vk2 and hela cells) exposed to recombinant vly toxin and to cell-free supernatants from growing liquid cultures of g. vaginalis. binding of vly to its human-specific receptor (hcd59) is required for bleb formation, as antibody inhibition of either toxin or hcd59 abrogates this response, and transfection of nonhuman cells (cho-k1) with hcd59 renders them susceptible to toxin-induced membrane blebbing. disruption of the pore formation  process (by exposure to pore-deficient toxoids or pretreatment of cells with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin) or osmotic protection of target cells inhibits vly-induced membrane blebbing. these results indicate that the formation of functional pores drives the observed ultrastructural rearrangements. rapid bleb formation may represent a conserved response of epithelial cells to sublytic quantities of pore-forming toxins, and vly-induced epithelial cell membrane blebbing in the vaginal mucosa may play a role in the pathogenesis of bv.

TI  == [diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common, complex clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in the normal vaginal flora. when symptomatic, it is associated with  a malodorous vaginal discharge and on occasion vaginal burning or itching. under  normal conditions, lactobacilli constitute 95% of the bacteria in the vagina. bacterial vaginosis is associated with severe reduction or absence of the normal  h2o2-producing lactobacilli and overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and gardnerella  vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis and mobiluncus species. most types of infectious disease are diagnosed by culture, by isolating an antigen or  rna/dna from the microbe, or by serodiagnosis to determine the presence of antibodies to the microbe. therefore, demonstration of the presence of an infectious agent is often a necessary criterion for the diagnosis of the disease. this is not the case for bacterial vaginosis, since the ultimate cause of the disease is not yet known. there are a variety of methods for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis but no method can at present be regarded as the best. diagnosing bacterial vaginosis has long been based on the clinical criteria of amsel, whereby three of four defined criteria must be satisfied. nugent's scoring system has been further developed and includes validation of the categories of observable bacteria structures. up-to-date molecular tests are introduced, and better understanding of vaginal microbiome, a clear definition for bacterial vaginosis, and short-term and long-term fluctuations in vaginal microflora will help to better define molecular tests within the broader clinical context.

TI  == human epididymis protein 4 and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor in vaginal  fluid: relation to vaginal components and bacterial composition.
AB  == human epididymis protein 4 (he4) is a protease inhibitor and a recently identified serum biomarker for ovarian cancer. properties of he4 in the genital tract of healthy women have not been evaluated. we evaluated associations between he4 and a second vaginal protease inhibitor, secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), with vaginal concentrations of innate immune mediators or proteases and with the types of vaginal bacterial communities. vaginal secretions were collected from 18 healthy reproductive age women and assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for concentrations of he4, slpi, kallikrein 5,  cathepsin b, interleukin 1beta (il-1), il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1 ra), mannose-binding lectin (mbl), the inducible 70-kda heat shock protein, and matrix metalloproteinase (mmp)-8. the species composition of vaginal bacterial communities in 16 women was characterized by sequencing amplicons derived from 16s bacterial ribosomal rna genes. correlations between any 2 assays were analyzed by the spearman rank correlation tests. differences in the concentrations of he4 and slpi, and between soluble components and vaginal community types, were analyzed by the mann-whitney u tests. vaginal he4 concentrations, but not slpi levels, were positively correlated with levels of il-1beta (p = .0152), il-1ra (p = .0061), mbl (p = .0100), and mmp-8 (p = .0315). the median vaginal he4 level, as well as concentrations of mbl, il-1beta, il-1ra, and mmp-8, was highest when gardnerella vaginalis dominated a vaginal community.  the association between he4, elevated levels of proteases, immune mediators and high proportions of g vaginalis strongly suggests that he4 is a component of the  proinflammatory immune response in the female genital tract.

AB  == mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum are associated with chorioamnionitis, preterm delivery and pelvic inflammatory disease. the aim of this study was to evaluate the possible risk factors of co-colonization by m. hominis in patients already colonized by u. urealyticum and compare demographic parameters, vaginal ph and microbiota of women colonized by u. urealyticum or m.  hominis. a total of 452 patients positive for u. urealyticum or m. hominis were analysed, 421 (93.1%) of whom were positive for u. urealyticum and 31 (6.9%) for  m. hominis. patients positive for m. hominis compared to patients positive for u. urealyticum were more frequently colonized by gardnerella vaginalis (71% vs 18.5%; p 0.0001), less frequently by lactobacilli (16.1% vs 61.5%; p 0.0001), and more frequently had a ph value higher than 4.5 (96.8% vs 57%; p 0.0001), all conditions associated to bacterial vaginosis (bv). logistic regression analysis showed that only g. vaginalis colonization and ph higher than 4.5 were independently related to m. hominis colonization (respectively p 0.0001 and p 0.016). thus, in women colonized by u. urealyticum, bv is an independent risk factor for m. hominis co-colonization.

AB  == fermenticin hv6b is a class iia antimicrobial peptide produced by lactobacillus fermentum hv6b mtcc 10770 isolated from human vaginal ecosystem. it shows growth  inhibition of a wide range of opportunistic pathogens of humans, for example, bacteroides, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus, staphylococci, and streptococci,  associated with bacterial vaginosis in humans. it does possess an impressive sperm immobilization and spermicidal activity tested against human sperms which makes it an attractive proposition for formulating antibacterial vaginosis and contraceptive products. apart from this, in vitro studies conducted against four  different tissue models have indicated its potential to be used as a component of anticancerous drug therapy as it is reported to induce apoptosis in cancerous cells. this information could be integrated in future studies focusing on in vivo assessment of anticancerous activity of lactic acid bacterial toxins or bacteriocins.

TI  == reciprocal interference between lactobacillus spp. and gardnerella vaginalis on initial adherence to epithelial cells.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common vaginal disorder in women of child-bearing age. it is widely accepted that the microbial switch from normal microflora to the flora commonly associated with bv is characterized by a decrease in vaginal colonization by specific lactobacillus species together with  an increase of g. vaginalis and other anaerobes. however, the order of events leading to the development of bv remains poorly characterized and it is unclear whether the decrease in lactobacilli is a cause or a consequence of the increase  in the population density of anaerobes. our goal was to characterize the interaction between two gardnerella vaginalis strains, one of which was isolated  from a healthy woman (strain 5-1) and the other from a woman diagnosed with bv (strain 101), and vaginal lactobacilli on the adherence to cervical epithelial cells. in order to simulate the transition from vaginal health to bv, the lactobacilli were cultured with the epithelial cells first, and then the g. vaginalis strain was introduced. we quantified the inhibition of g. vaginalis adherence by the lactobacilli and displacement of adherent lactobacilli by g. vaginalis. our results confirmed that pathogenic g vaginalis 101 had a higher capacity for adhesion to the cervical epithelial cells than strain 5-1. interestingly, strain 101 displaced l. crispatus but not l. iners whereas strain  5-1 had less of an effect and did not affect the two species differently. furthermore, l. iners actually enhanced adhesion of strain 101 but not of strain  5-1. these results suggest that bv-causing g. vaginalis and l. iners do not interfere with one another, which may help to explain previous reports that women who are colonized with l. iners are more likely to develop bv.

TI  == the villain team-up or how trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis alter innate immunity in concert.
AB  == objectives: complex interactions of vaginal microorganisms with the genital tract epithelium shape mucosal innate immunity, which holds the key to sexual and reproductive health. bacterial vaginosis (bv), a microbiome-disturbance syndrome  prevalent in reproductive-age women, occurs commonly in concert with trichomoniasis, and both are associated with increased risk of adverse reproductive outcomes and viral infections, largely attributable to inflammation. to investigate the causative relationships among inflammation, bv and trichomoniasis, we established a model of human cervicovaginal epithelial cells colonised by vaginal lactobacillus isolates, dominant in healthy women, and common bv species (atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia). methods: colonised epithelia were infected with trichomonas vaginalis (tv) or exposed to purified tv virulence factors (membrane lipophosphoglycan (lpg), its ceramide-phosphoinositol-glycan core (cpi-gc) or the endosymbiont trichomonas vaginalis virus (tvv)), followed by assessment of bacterial colony-forming units, the mucosal anti-inflammatory microbicide secretory leucocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and chemokines that drive pro-inflammatory,  antigen-presenting and t cells. results: tv reduced colonisation by lactobacillus but not by bv species, which were found inside epithelial cells. tv increased interleukin (il)-8 and suppressed slpi, likely via lpg/cpi-gc, and upregulated il-8 and rantes, likely via tvv as suggested by use of purified pathogenic determinants. bv species a vaginae and g vaginalis induced il-8 and rantes, and also amplified the pro-inflammatory responses to both lpg/cpi-gc and tvv, whereas p bivia suppressed the tv/tvv-induced chemokines. conclusions: these molecular host-parasite-endosymbiont-bacteria interactions explain epidemiological associations and suggest a revised paradigm for restoring vaginal immunity and preventing bv/tv-attributable inflammatory sequelae in women.

TI  == plants traditionally used individually and in combination to treat sexually transmitted infections in northern maputaland, south africa: antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity.
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: although medicinal plants are used extensively to treat sexually transmitted infections (stis) in rural northern maputaland, kwazulu-natal, the efficacy and safety of these plants have not previously been evaluated. aim of study: a study was designed to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity profiles of a selection (individual plants and selected combinations) of traditionally used plants in this study area. materials and methods: aqueous and organic (dichloromethane: methanol, 1:1) extracts were prepared. antimicrobial activity was assessed using the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay against the sti associated pathogens; candida albicans atcc 10231, ureaplasma urealyticum clinical strain, oligella ureolytica atcc 43534, trichomonas vaginalis clinical strain, gardnerella vaginalis atcc 14018 and neisseria gonorrhoeae atcc 19424. for the combination study, interactions were assessed using the fractional inhibitory concentration (sigmafic). the plant species were assessed for safety using the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-2h-tetrazolium bromide (mtt) cellular  viability assay on the human embryonic kidney epithelial (graham, hek-293) cell line. results: for the antimicrobial studies, u. urealyticum was the most sensitive of the six test organisms, with the aqueous extract of ranunculus multifidus (0.02mg/ml) and the organic extract of peltophorum africanum (0.04mg/ml) being the most antimicrobially active plant species studied. sclerocarya birrea was found to have the broadest spectrum of activity (mean mic  of 0.89mg/ml). the only plant species to exhibit some degree of cytotoxicity against the kidney epithelial cell line was kigelia africana (100microg/ml), with 22% and 16% cell death for the aqueous and organic extracts, respectively. of the 13 combinations studied, several synergistic combinations were evident, the most  prominent being the combination of albizia adianthifolia and trichilia dregeana (aqueous extract) with an sigmafic value of 0.15 against o. ureolytica. synergistic interactions were observed regardless of the ratio of the aqueous mixtures of the two plants. syzygium cordatum and s. birrea (aqueous extract) was also a combination of interest, demonstrating synergistic (sigmafic=0.42) interactions against o. ureolytica. this combination, however, also displayed some cytotoxicity towards the human epithelial cell line. conclusion: this study  demonstrated that anecdotal evidence of plant use does not always correlate with  in vitro activity. furthermore, the toxicological profiling is of utmost importance as if not combined in its correct ratio can lead to potential adverse  effects.

TI  == anova-like differential expression (aldex) analysis for mixed population rna-seq.
AB  == experimental variance is a major challenge when dealing with high-throughput sequencing data. this variance has several sources: sampling replication, technical replication, variability within biological conditions, and variability  between biological conditions. the high per-sample cost of rna-seq often precludes the large number of experiments needed to partition observed variance into these categories as per standard anova models. we show that the partitioning of within-condition to between-condition variation cannot reasonably be ignored,  whether in single-organism rna-seq or in meta-rna-seq experiments, and further find that commonly-used rna-seq analysis tools, as described in the literature, do not enforce the constraint that the sum of relative expression levels must be  one, and thus report expression levels that are systematically distorted. these two factors lead to misleading inferences if not properly accommodated. as it is  usually only the biological between-condition and within-condition differences that are of interest, we developed aldex, an anova-like differential expression procedure, to identify genes with greater between- to within-condition differences. we show that the presence of differential expression and the magnitude of these comparative differences can be reasonably estimated with even  very small sample sizes.

TI  == [bacterial infection as a cause of infertility in humans].
AB  == microorganisms which are present in the human urogenital tract may be involved in the development of inflammatory changes negatively affecting the genitals in both men and women. pathological conditions due to inflammatory alterations may result in complete loss of fertility. infections of the urogenital tract are responsible for 15% of all cases of infertility in couples. negative impact on the human reproduction is mainly caused by direct damage to the genital tract mucosa by metabolic products of microorganisms or by induction of pro-inflammatory responses of the body. another mechanism is indirect impact of microorganisms on  the genital function. moreover, the effect of bacteria on spermatogenesis and semen quality is important in men. infections mainly caused by chlamydia trachomatis or neisseria gonorrhoeae represent the greatest risk in terms of permanent consequences for human reproduction. as for other sexually transmitted  disorders, such as infections caused by gardnerella vaginalis, urogenital mycoplasmas or ureaplasmas, the link between infection and infertility has been intensively researched.

TI  == comparison of the vaginal microbiota diversity of women with and without human papillomavirus infection: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == background: the female genital tract is an important bacterial habitat of the human body, and vaginal microbiota plays a crucial role in vaginal health. the alteration of vaginal microbiota affects millions of women annually, and is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes, including human papillomavirus  (hpv) infection. however, previous studies have primarily focused on the association between bacterial vaginosis and hpv infection. little is known about  the composition of vaginal microbial communities involved in hpv acquisition. the present study was performed to investigate whether hpv infection was associated with the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota. methods: a total of 70  healthy women (32 hpv-negative and 38 hpv-positive) with normal cervical cytology were enrolled in this study. culture-independent polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was used to measure the diversity and composition of vaginal microbiota of all subjects. results: we found significantly greater biological diversity in the vaginal microbiota of hpv-positive women (p < 0.001). lactobacillus, including l. gallinarum, l. iners  and l. gasseri, was the predominant genus and was detected in all women. no significant difference between hpv-positive and hpv-negative women was found for  the frequency of detection of l. gallinarum (p = 0.775) or l. iners (p = 0.717),  but l. gasseri was found at a significantly higher frequency in hpv-positive women (p = 0.005). gardnerella vaginalis was also found at a significantly higher frequency in hpv-positive women (p = 0.031). dendrograms revealed that vaginal microbiota from the two groups had different profiles. conclusions: our study is  the first systematic evaluation of an association between vaginal microbiota and  hpv infection, and we have demonstrated that compared with hpv-negative women, the bacterial diversity of hpv-positive women is more complex and the composition of vaginal microbiota is different.

TI  == interactions between lactobacillus crispatus and bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacterial species in initial attachment and biofilm formation.
AB  == certain anaerobic bacterial species tend to predominate the vaginal flora during  bacterial vaginosis (bv), with gardnerella vaginalis being the most common. however, the exact role of g. vaginalis in bv has not yet been determined. the main goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that g. vaginalis is an early  colonizer, paving the way for intermediate (e.g., fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (e.g., prevotella bivia). theoretically, in order to function as  an early colonizer, species would need to be able to adhere to vaginal epithelium, even in the presence of vaginal lactobacilli. therefore, we quantified adherence of g. vaginalis and other bv-associated bacteria to an inert surface pre-coated with lactobacillus crispatus using a new peptide nucleic acid  (pna) fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methodology. we found that g. vaginalis had the greatest capacity to adhere in the presence of l. crispatus. theoretically, an early colonizer would contribute to the adherence and/or growth of additional species, so we next quantified the effect of g. vaginalis biofilms  on the adherence and growth of other bv-associated species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) technique. interestingly, g. vaginalis derived a growth benefit from the addition of a second species, regardless of the species.  conversely, g. vaginalis biofilms enhanced the growth of p. bivia, and to a minor extent of f. nucleatum. these results contribute to our understanding of bv biofilm formation and the progression of the disorder.

TI  == in vitro probiotic properties of lactobacillus fermentum sk5 isolated from vagina of a healthy woman.
AB  == a lactobacillus strain isolated from a vaginal tract of a healthy woman was examined in vitro for its probiotic potential. this strain, identified as lactobacillus fermentum sk5, was able to survive at ph 3-4 and 0.1-0.2% bile, and unaffected by pepsin (3 g l(-1)) and pancreatin (1 g l(-1)), but was susceptible  to all tested antibiotics except metronidazole. l. fermentum sk5 had an antimicrobial potential against gastrointestinal pathogenic escherichia coli and  vaginal pathogenic gardnerella vaginalis. the effective substance was suspected to be a bacteriocin-like compound with a molecular weight of more than 10 kda, but hydrogen peroxide was also detected. further studies revealed that l. fermentum sk5 had good autoaggregation characteristic and a high surface hydrophobicity that enhanced its adhesion ability to epithelial cells and for biofilm formation. this lactobacillus showed coaggregation with e. coli and g. vaginalis to affect their adhesion and colonization. the adhesion of l. fermentum sk5 to hela, ht-29 and caco-2 cells and its inhibition of e. coli and g. vaginalis adherence to these cells were demonstrated. these incidences provided evidence of the possible colonization of l. fermentum sk5 that would prevent binding and growth of e. coli and g. vaginalis onto intestinal and vaginal epithelial cells. on the basis of the ability of l. fermentum sk5 to inhibit pathogenic microorganisms through coaggregation and antimicrobial substances, it  is likely that this lactobacillus strain could be a potential probiotic candidate for beneficial use in protecting against gastrointestinal and vaginal microbial infections.

AB  == the vaginal mucosa can be colonized by many bacteria including commensal organisms and potential pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus. some strains of s. aureus produce the superantigen toxic shock syndrome toxin-1, which can penetrate the vaginal epithelium to cause toxic shock syndrome. we have observed  that a female was mono-colonized with enterococcus faecalis vaginally as tested in aerobic culture, even upon repeated culture for six months, suggesting this organism was negatively influencing colonization by other bacteria. in recent studies, we demonstrated an "outside-in" mechanism of cytokine signaling and consequent inflammation that facilitates the ability of potential pathogens to initiate infection from mucosal surfaces. thus, we hypothesized that this strain  of e. faecalis may make anti-inflammatory factors which block disease progression of more pathogenic organisms. e. faecalis mn1 inhibited interleukin-8 production  from human vaginal epithelial cells in response to the vaginal pathogens candida  albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, as well as to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. we further demonstrated that this organism secretes two tetramic acid compounds which appear responsible for inhibition of interleukin-8  production, as well as inhibition of t cell proliferation due to toxic shock syndrome toxin-1. microbicides that include anti-inflammatory molecules, such as  these tetramic acid compounds naturally produced by e. faecalis mn1, may be useful in prevention of diseases that develop from vaginal infections.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis-associated bacterial vaginosis in bulgarian women.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge in women of reproductive age. the purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of bv in bulgarian pregnant and nonpregnant women from several age ranges and to compare three different laboratory methods for gardnerella vaginalis detection in patents suffering from bv. methods: between september 2011 and june 2012, 809 women of 16-40 years of age separated in two major groups: nonpregnant - 469 (355 with and 114 without symptoms) and pregnant  - 340 (213 and 127 respectively) were enrolled for the study. the women underwent three different laboratory tests simultaneously: scoring of gram staining of vaginal smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for g. vaginalis. results: the microscopic method detected high frequency of bv in symptomatic (57%) whereas only a minority of asymptomatic subjects (14%) were detected. g. vaginalis-associated bv was diagnosed in approximately equal proportions when evaluated with pcr and microscopic method for both pregnant and  nonpregnant women. the comparative analysis of microscopic evaluation, culture and pcr assays demonstrated greater concurrence (about 90%) between gram staining and pcr detection for bv, than both methods compared to culture. the combination  of microscopy and pcr turned out to be very reliable and repeatable for detecting g. vaginalis-associated bv. conclusions: this is the first comparative investigation on the epidemiology of g. vaginalis-associated bv in bulgaria. the  established highest frequency in the young bulgarian women (21-30 years) is alarming and should be considered in prophylaxis and reproductive programmes.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridization method using peptide nucleic acid probes for rapid detection of lactobacillus and gardnerella spp.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common vaginal infection occurring in women of reproductive age. it is widely accepted that the microbial switch from normal microflora to bv is characterized by a decrease in vaginal colonization by lactobacillus species together with an increase of gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes. our goal was to develop and optimize a novel peptide nucleic acid (pna) fluorescence in situ hybridization assay (pna fish) for the detection  of lactobacillus spp. and g. vaginalis in mixed samples. results: therefore, we evaluated and validated two specific pna probes by using 36 representative lactobacillus strains, 22 representative g. vaginalis strains and 27 other taxonomically related or pathogenic bacterial strains commonly found in vaginal samples. the probes were also tested at different concentrations of g. vaginalis  and lactobacillus species in vitro, in the presence of a hela cell line. specificity and sensitivity of the pna probes were found to be 98.0% (95% confidence interval (ci), from 87.8 to 99.9%) and 100% (95% ci, from 88.0 to 100.0%), for lactobacillus spp.; and 100% (95% ci, from 92.8 to 100%) and 100% (95% ci, from 81.5 to 100.0%) for g. vaginalis. moreover, the probes were evaluated in mixed samples mimicking women with bv or normal vaginal microflora,  demonstrating efficiency and applicability of our pna fish. conclusions: this quick method accurately detects lactobacillus spp. and g. vaginalis species in mixed samples, thus enabling efficient evaluation of the two bacterial groups, most frequently encountered in the vagina.

TI  == composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age--sensitive and specific molecular diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is possible?
AB  == background and objective: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common vaginal disorder, characterized by depletion of the normal lactobacillus-dominant microbiota and overgrowth of commensal anaerobic bacteria. this study aimed to investigate the composition of the vaginal microbiota in women of reproductive age (healthy women and women with bv), with the view of developing molecular criteria for bv diagnosis. materials and methods: vaginal samples from 163 women  (79 control, 73 bv and 11 intermediate (lactobacillary grade ii flora) cases) were analyzed using 454 pyrosequencing of the hypervariable regions v3-v4 of the  16s rrna gene and 16 quantitative bacterial species/genus-specific real-time pcr  assays. sensitivities and specificities of potential bv markers were computed using the amsel criteria as reference standard for bv. the use of quantitative thresholds for prediction of bv, determined for both relative abundance measured  with 454 pyrosequencing and bacterial load measured with qpcr, was evaluated. results: relative to the healthy women, the bv patients had in their vaginal microbiota significantly higher prevalence, loads and relative abundances of the  majority of bv associated bacteria. however, only gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, eggerthella, prevotella, bvab2 and megasphaera type 1 detected at or above optimal thresholds were highly predictable for bv, with the best diagnostic accuracy shown for a. vaginae. the depletion of lactobacillus species  combined with the presence of either g. vaginalis or a. vaginae at diagnostic levels was a highly accurate bv predictor. conclusions: quantitative determination of the presence of g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, eggerthella, prevotella, bvab2 and megasphaera type 1 as well as the depletion of lactobacillus was highly accurate for bv diagnosis. measurements of abundance of  normal and bv microbiota relative to total bacteria in vaginal fluid may provide  more accurate bv diagnosis, and be used for test-of-cure, rather than qualitative detection or absolute counts of bv related microorganisms.

TI  == clinical features of bacterial vaginosis in a murine model of vaginal infection with gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a dysbiosis of the vaginal flora characterized by a shift from a lactobacillus-dominant environment to a polymicrobial mixture including actinobacteria and gram-negative bacilli. bv is a common vaginal condition in women and is associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted  infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth. gardnerella vaginalis is one of the most frequently isolated bacterial species in bv. however, there has been much debate in the literature concerning the contribution of g. vaginalis to the etiology of bv, since it is also present in a significant  proportion of healthy women. here we present a new murine vaginal infection model with a clinical isolate of g. vaginalis. our data demonstrate that this model displays key features used clinically to diagnose bv, including the presence of sialidase activity and exfoliated epithelial cells with adherent bacteria (reminiscent of clue cells). g. vaginalis was capable of ascending uterine infection, which correlated with the degree of vaginal infection and level of vaginal sialidase activity. the host response to g. vaginalis infection was characterized by robust vaginal epithelial cell exfoliation in the absence of histological inflammation. our analyses of clinical specimens from women with bv  revealed a measureable epithelial exfoliation response compared to women with normal flora, a phenotype that, to our knowledge, is measured here for the first  time. the results of this study demonstrate that g. vaginalis is sufficient to cause bv phenotypes and suggest that this organism may contribute to bv etiology  and associated complications. this is the first time vaginal infection by a bv associated bacterium in an animal has been shown to parallel the human disease with regard to clinical diagnostic features. future studies with this model should facilitate investigation of important questions regarding bv etiology, pathogenesis and associated complications.

TI  == degradation, foraging, and depletion of mucus sialoglycans by the vagina-adapted  actinobacterium gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a polymicrobial imbalance of the vaginal microbiota associated with reproductive infections, preterm birth, and other adverse health  outcomes. sialidase activity in vaginal fluids is diagnostic of bv and sialic acid-rich components of mucus have protective and immunological roles. however, whereas mucus degradation is believed to be important in the etiology and complications associated with bv, the role(s) of sialidases and the participation of individual bacterial species in the degradation of mucus barriers in bv have not been investigated. here we demonstrate that the bv-associated bacterium gardnerella vaginalis uses sialidase to break down and deplete sialic acid-containing mucus components in the vagina. biochemical evidence using purified sialoglycan substrates supports a model in which 1) g. vaginalis extracellular sialidase hydrolyzes mucosal sialoglycans, 2) liberated sialic acid (n-acetylneuraminic acid) is transported into the bacterium, a process inhibited  by excess n-glycolylneuraminic acid, and 3) sialic acid catabolism is initiated by an intracellular aldolase/lyase mechanism. g. vaginalis engaged in sialoglycan foraging in vitro, in the presence of human vaginal mucus, and in vivo, in a murine vaginal model, in each case leading to depletion of sialic acids. comparison of sialic acid levels in human vaginal specimens also demonstrated significant depletion of mucus sialic acids in women with bv compared with women  with a "normal" lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. taken together, these studies  show that g. vaginalis utilizes sialidase to support the degradation, foraging, and depletion of protective host mucus barriers, and that this process of mucus barrier degradation and depletion also occurs in the clinical setting of bv.

TI  == dnase inhibits gardnerella vaginalis biofilms in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a highly prevalent and poorly understood polymicrobial disorder of the vaginal microbiota, with significant adverse sequelae. gardnerella vaginalis predominates in bacterial vaginosis. biofilms of g. vaginalis are present in human infections and are implicated in persistent disease, treatment failure, and transmission. here we demonstrate that g. vaginalis biofilms contain extracellular dna, which is essential to their structural integrity. enzymatic disruption of this dna specifically inhibits biofilms, acting on both newly forming and established biofilms. dnase liberates  bacteria from the biofilm to supernatant fractions and potentiates the activity of metronidazole, an antimicrobial agent used in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. using a new murine vaginal colonization model for g. vaginalis, we demonstrate >10-fold inhibition of g. vaginalis colonization by dnase. we conclude that dnase merits investigation as a potential nonantibiotic adjunct to  existing bacterial vaginosis therapies in order to decrease the risk of chronic infection, recurrence, and associated morbidities.

TI  == characterization of the vaginal micro- and mycobiome in asymptomatic reproductive-age estonian women.
AB  == the application of high-throughput sequencing methods has raised doubt in the concept of the uniform healthy vaginal microbiota consisting predominantly of lactobacilli by revealing the existence of more variable bacterial community composition. as this needs to be analyzed more extensively and there is little straightforward data regarding the vaginal mycobiome of asymptomatic women we aimed to define bacterial and fungal communities in vaginal samples from 494 asymptomatic, reproductive-age estonian women. the composition of the vaginal microbiota was determined by amplifying bacterial 16s rrna and fungal internal transcribed spacer-1 (its-1) regions and subsequently sequencing them using 454 life sciences pyrosequencing. we delineated five major bacterial community groups with distinctive diversity and species composition. lactobacilli were among the most abundant bacteria in all groups, but also members of genus gardnerella had high relative abundance in some of the groups. microbial diversity increased with higher vaginal ph values, and was also higher when a malodorous discharge was present, indicating that some of the women who consider themselves healthy may potentially have asymptomatic bacterial vaginosis (bv). our study is the first of its kind to analyze the mycobiome that colonizes the healthy vaginal environment  using barcoded pyrosequencing technology. we observed 196 fungal operational taxonomic units (otus), including 16 otus of candida spp., which is more diverse  than previously recognized. however, assessing true fungal diversity was complicated because of the problems regarding the possible air-borne contamination and bioinformatics used for identification of fungal taxons as significant proportion of fungal sequences were assigned to unspecified otus.

TI  == the microbiota of the human genitourinary tract: trying to see the forest through the trees.
AB  == based on traditional microbiological methods, namely cultivation and microscopic  analyses, the vaginal microbiota (vmb) has been defined as healthy when it is predominated by hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus spp., most prominently  lactobacillis crispatus. similarly, the vmb has been defined as bacterial vaginosis (bv) when it is predominated by gardnerella vaginalis as well as a number of other anaerobic bacterial species. bv is associated with a distinct vaginal discharge syndrome, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, post-operative wound infections, and endometritis after elective abortions. additionally, bv predisposes women to infection by hiv as well as other sexually  transmitted diseases (stds). the application of molecular techniques over the last decade to studies of the vmb has significantly advanced our understanding of its structure and variation. it is now clear that the diversity of the vmb is far more complex than previously recognized; it is comprised of many heretofore unknown bacteria in addition to those previously identified by culture. here we describe the application of 454 pyrosequencing technology to a study of vaginal specimens from 92 women attending the new orleans std clinic in an effort to obtain a more precise view of how different types of "trees" (bacteria) assemble  to form a recognizable "forest" (vmb). this knowledge will be useful in the design of future clinical studies that investigate the mechanisms by which the vaginal microbiome influences human health and disease.

TI  == insights into the crispr/cas system of gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == background: gardnerella vaginalis is identified as the predominant colonist of the vaginal tracts of women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis (bv). g. vaginalis can be isolated from healthy women, and an asymptomatic bv state is also recognised. the association of g. vaginalis with different clinical phenotypes could be explained by different cytotoxicity of the strains, presumably based on  disparate gene content. the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to shaping the genomes of g. vaginalis is acknowledged. the crispr loci of the recently discovered crispr/cas microbial defence system provide a historical view of the exposure of prokaryotes to a variety of foreign genetic elements. results: the crispr/cas loci were analysed using available sequence data from three g. vaginalis complete genomes and 18 g. vaginalis draft genomes in the ncbi database, as well as pcr amplicons of the genomic dna of 17 clinical isolates. the cas genes in the crispr/cas loci of g. vaginalis belong to the e. coli subtype. approximately 20% of the spacers had matches in the genbank database. sequence analysis of the crispr arrays revealed that nearly half of the spacers matched g. vaginalis chromosomal sequences. the spacers that matched g. vaginalis chromosomal sequences were determined to not be self-targeting and were presumably neither constituents of mobile-element-associated genes nor derived from plasmids/viruses. the protospacers targeted by these spacers displayed conserved protospacer-adjacent motifs. conclusions: the crispr/cas system has been identified in about one half of the analysed g. vaginalis strains. our analysis of crispr sequences did not reveal a potential link between their presence and the virulence of the g. vaginalis strains. based on the origins of the spacers found in the g. vaginalis crispr arrays, we hypothesise that the transfer of genetic material among g. vaginalis strains could be regulated by the crispr/cas mechanism. the present study is the first attempt to determine and analyse the crispr loci of bacteria isolated from the human vaginal tract.

TI  == [gynophilus--a winning relay].
AB  == the vagina is a complex biocenosis where many micro-organisms coexist and colonize it. the dominant colonizing bacteria of a healthy individual is of the genus "lactobacillus". it is also called doderlein's bacillus and determines the  vaginal microbial balance through the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, biosurfactants, bacteriocines and modify the competition of pathogens for adhesion to the vaginal epithelial cells. through these mechanisms the lactobacilli block the growth and development of other vaginal pathogenic microbial species and also inhibit the colonization of some other microorganisms  imported from outside. because of these potential therapeutic properties, the lactobacilli are used as effective medical agents for prophylaxys and therapy to  restore the physiological balance in the vaginal eco-system. according to our studies and gained clinical experience the etiological antibacterial treatment is not always sufficient to restore the normal vaginal flora. the complete recovery  of the vaginal flora could be reached using probiotics that are applied locally and per os. gynophilus is a new vaginal probiotic product containing one type of  the genus "lactobacillus": lactobacillus casei var rhamnosus. gynophilus restores the physiological balance of the vaginal flora and reduces the risk of recurrent  infection. the product is applied intravaginal and interacts locally, inhibits the growth of the most common vaginal pathogens: gardnerella vaginalis u candida  albicans.

TI  == the biofilm in bacterial vaginosis: implications for epidemiology, diagnosis and  treatment.
AB  == purpose of review: recent evidence supports the view that bacterial vaginosis presents as a polymicrobial biofilm infection. this has far-reaching implications for the pathogenesis, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of bacterial vaginosis. recent findings: gardnerella vaginalis is presumably the first species to adhere to the vaginal epithelium and then becomes the scaffolding to which other species adhere. not all g. vaginalis strains do form biofilms: g. vaginalis can be present in the vagina in a planktonic or in a biofilm mode of growth. the  presence of planktonic (dispersed) or biofilm-associated (cohesive) g. vaginalis  can be reliably shown in urine sediments in both women and men, and there is an absolute concordance in the carriage of biofilm-associated (cohesive) g. vaginalis between women with bacterial vaginosis and their partners. in-vitro data suggest that selected probiotic lactobacilli might be an effective means to  conquer the biofilm. summary: future epidemiological research may benefit from biofilm-based urine diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis to a significant extent. the search for novel therapeutic agents can now be more directed towards the biofilm-breaking agents, but is at present hampered by the lack of a proper in-vitro model of the bacterial vaginosis biofilm.

AB  == problem: vaginal microbicides represent a promising approach for preventing heterosexual hiv transmission. however, preclinical evaluation should be conducted to ensure that microbicides will be safe for human cells and healthy microflora of the female reproductive tract. one microbicide candidate, rc-101, has been effective and well tolerated in preliminary cell culture and macaque models. however, the effect of rc-101 on primary vaginal tissues and resident vaginal microflora requires further evaluation. method of study: we treated primary vaginal tissues and vaginal bacteria, both pathogenic and commensal, with rc-101 to investigate effects of this microbicide. results: rc-101 was well tolerated by host tissues, and also by commensal vaginal bacteria. simultaneously, pathogenic vaginal bacteria, which are known to increase susceptibility to hiv acquisition, were inhibited by rc-101. conclusions: by establishing vaginal microflora, the specific antibacterial activity of rc-101 may provide a dual mechanism of hiv protection. these findings support advancement of rc-101 to clinical trials.

AB  == a previous study showed that the minimal epitope recognised by the ply-5 mab in the conserved undecapeptide trp-rich loop of bacterial cdcs should consist of wewwrt (jacobs et al., 1999) [5]. now, through immunoscreening of amino acid substitution analogues, it is concluded that the second trp and the arg residues  are essential in the ply-5 epitope. the e residue is an auxiliary epitope contributor. antibody modelling and docking simulations provided support for these findings. for recognition by the antibody, the trp-rich loop flipped out, mimicking the mechanism of membrane insertion. the displaced second trp was seen  to establish aromatic stacking interactions with aromatic residues of the antibody paratope and the notably extruded guanidium tip of the arginine residue  mediated electrostatic interactions with well-exposed carboxylic groups of glutamic residues on the surface of the paratope. thus, the epitope/paratope interaction is mainly mediated by aromatic and by ionic interactions.

AB  == seventeen fructose-6-phosphate phosphoketolase-positive bacterial strains were isolated from the digestive tract of wild pigs (sus scrofa). most of them were identified as bifidobacterium boum according to sequences of 16s rrna gene. two strains isolated from the small intestine content had unusual morphology of cells in comparison with bifidobacteria. cells growing in liquid anaerobic media were regular shaped rods arranged mostly in pairs. these isolates showed relatively low 16s rrna gene sequence similarities (maximum identity of 94%) to members of the family bifidobacteriaceae. nevertheless, phylogenetic analyses of 16s rrna, hsp60 and xfp gene sequences revealed that these strains are more related to recently described neoscardovia, aeriscardovia and other scardovial genera, than  to bifidobacterium species. partial gene sequences of other phylogenetic markers  showed low (65.8-89.5%) similarities to genome sequences of bifidobacteria and gardnerella vaginalis. the major fatty acids detected in cells of the representative strain dpte4(t) were c(16:0), c(18:1), c(14:0). the peptidoglycan  type of the dpte4(t) strain was a3betal-orn(l-lys)-l-ser(l-ala)-l-ala(2). polar lipid analysis revealed two phosphoglycolipids and phospholipids, a glycolipid and diphosphatidylglycerol. the results of phylogenetic, genotypic and phenotypic analyses support the proposal of a novel taxa, pseudoscardovia suis gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain=dpte4(t)=dsm 24744(t)=ccm 7942(t)).

TI  == simultaneous direct identification of genital microorganisms in voided urine using multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot assays.
AB  == our aim was to develop and evaluate sensitive methods that would allow simultaneous direct identification of multiple potential pathogens in clinical specimens for diagnosis and epidemiological studies, using a multiplex pcr-based  reverse line blot assay. we have previously developed assays suitable for detection of bacterial respiratory and systemic pathogens. in this chapter we describe, in detail, a method developed to identify 14 genital microorganisms, for use in epidemiological studies of genital infection or colonization, using first voided urine specimens. the 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens studied were trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, and adenovirus. two species-specific primer pairs and probes were designed for each target. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism. in a clinical study among men attending sexual health clinics in sydney, we used the assay to compare rates of detection of the  14 organisms in men with urethritis with those in asymptomatic controls and found the method to be sensitive, specific, convenient, and relatively inexpensive.

TI  == phase i randomized safety study of twice daily dosing of acidform vaginal gel: candidate antimicrobial contraceptive.
AB  == background: acidform gel, an acid-buffering product that inactivates spermatozoa, may be an effective topical non-hormonal contraceptive. this study was designed to evaluate the safety of vaginal dosing and effects of acidform on mucosal immune mediators, antimicrobial properties of genital secretions, and vaginal microbiota. methods: thirty-six sexually abstinent u.s. women were randomized to  apply acidform or hydroxyethylcellulose (hec) placebo gel twice daily for 14 consecutive days. safety was assessed by symptoms and pelvic examination. the impact of gel on mucosal immunity was assessed by quantifying cytokines, chemokines, antimicrobial proteins and antimicrobial activity of genital secretions collected by cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) at screening, 2 hours after gel application, and on days 7, 14 and 21. vaginal microbiota was characterized at enrollment and day 14 using species-specific quantitative pcr assays. results: the median vaginal and cervical ph was significantly lower 2 hours after application of acidform and was associated with an increase in the bactericidal activity of cvl against e. coli. however, 65% of women who received acidform had  at least one local adverse event compared with 11% who received placebo (p = 0.002). while there was no increase in inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, cvl  concentrations of lactoferrin and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra), an  anti-inflammatory protein, were significantly lower following acidform compared to hec placebo gel application. there were no significant changes in lactobacillus crispatus or lactobacillus jensenii in either group but there was a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis in the acidform group (p = 0.08). conclusions:  acidform gel may augment mucosal defense as evidenced by an increase in bactericidal activity of genital secretions against e. coli and a decrease in gardnerella vaginalis colonization. however, acidform was associated with more irritation than placebo and lower levels of antimicrobial (lactoferrin) and anti-inflammatory (il-1ra) proteins. these findings indicate the need for additional safety studies of this candidate non-hormonal contraceptive. trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov nct00850837.

TI  == longitudinal qpcr study of the dynamics of l. crispatus, l. iners, a. vaginae, (sialidase positive) g. vaginalis, and p. bivia in the vagina.
AB  == background: to obtain more detailed understanding of the causes of disturbance of the vaginal microflora (vmf), a longitudinal study was carried out for 17 women during two menstrual cycles. methods: vaginal swabs were obtained daily from 17 non-pregnant, menarchal volunteers. for each woman, gram stains were scored, the  quantitative changes of 5 key vaginal species, i.e. atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus crispatus, l. iners, (sialidase positive) gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia were quantified with qpcr and hydrogen-peroxide production was assessed on tmb+ agar. results: women could be divided in 9 subjects with predominantly normal vmf (grades ia, ib and iab, group n) and 8 with predominantly disturbed vmf (grades i-like, ii, iii and iv, group d). vmf was variable between women, but overall stable for most of the women. menses were the strongest disturbing factor of the vmf. l. crispatus was present at log7-9 cells/ml in grade ia, iab and ii vmf, but concentrations declined 100-fold during menses. l. crispatus below log7 cells/ml corresponded with poor h(2)o(2)-production. l. iners was present at log 10 cells/ml in grade ib, ii and  iii vmf. sialidase negative g. vaginalis strains (average log5 cells/ml) were detected in grade i, i-like and iv vmf. in grade ii vmf, predominantly a mixture  of both sialidase negative and positive g. vaginalis strains (average log9 cells/ml) were present, and predominantly sialidase positive strains in grade iii vmf. the presence of a. vaginae (average log9 cells/ml) coincided with grade ii and iii vmf. p. bivia (log4-8 cells/ml) was mostly present in grade iii vaginal microflora. l. iners, g. vaginalis, a. vaginae and p. bivia all increased around  menses for group n women, and as such l. iners was considered a member of disturbed vmf. conclusions: this qpcr-based study confirms largely the results of previous culture-based, microscopy-based and pyrosequencing-based studies.

TI  == susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis biofilms to natural antimicrobials subtilosin, epsilon-poly-l-lysine, and lauramide arginine ethyl ester.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection associated with numerous gynecological and obstetric complications. this condition is characterized by the presence of thick adherent vaginal biofilms, composed mainly of gardnerella vaginalis. this organism is thought to be the primary aetiological cause of the infection paving the way for various opportunists to colonize the niche. previously, we reported that the natural antimicrobials subtilosin, epsilon-poly-l-lysine, and lauramide arginine ethyl ester selectively inhibit the growth of this pathogen. in this study, we used plate counts to evaluate the efficacy of these antimicrobials against established biofilms of g. vaginalis. additionally, we validated and compared two rapid methods (atp viability and resazurin assays) for the assessment of cell viability in the antimicrobial-treated g. vaginalis biofilms. out of the tested antimicrobials, lauramide arginine ethyl ester had the strongest bactericidal effect, followed by subtilosin, with clindamycin and polylysine showing the weakest effect. in comparison to plate counts, atp viability and resazurin assays considerably underestimated the bactericidal effect of some antimicrobials. our results indicate that these assays should be validated for every new application.

TI  == amniotic fluid and maternal race influence responsiveness of fetal membranes to bacteria.
AB  == spontaneous preterm birth (ptb) and preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (pprom) occur more frequently in african-american women than in other racial groups. this may be due to an enhanced inflammatory response to pathogens associated with the  condition. it is also possible that amniotic fluid (af) has different immunomodulatory properties in african-american women that increase their risk of ptb and pprom. to test this, we cultured fetal membranes from european-american and african-american women with sterile medium (control), escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococci (gbs), polyporphorans gingivalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum or ureaplasma parvum in the presence and absence of 50% autologous af. cytokine concentrations were quantified in the  conditioned medium. all bacterial species increased il-8 production. il-1beta and tnf-alpha production were stimulated by lps, e. coli, and g. vaginalis compared with control, but responses to group b streptococci and p. gingivalis were limited to il-1beta and tnf-alpha respectively. genital mycoplasmas stimulated tnf-alpha and il-10 but had no effect on il-1beta production. african-americans had twice the il-1beta response to e. coli as european-americans (p=0.031). conversely, european-americans produced more il-8 in response to lps than african-americans (p=0.026). af had both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties that varied between races and pathogens. these results suggest that the host response to fetal membrane infections is complex and not generalizable. interventions to prevent ptb and pprom may need to be customized based on a patient's race, type of bacterial infection and factors in her af.

TI  == association between trichomonas vaginalis and vaginal bacterial community composition among reproductive-age women.
AB  == objectives: some vaginal bacterial communities are thought to prevent infection by sexually transmitted organisms. prior work demonstrated that the vaginal microbiota of reproductive-age women cluster into 5 types of bacterial communities; 4 dominated by lactobacillus species (l. iners, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii) and 1 (termed community state type (cst) iv) lacking significant numbers of lactobacilli and characterized by higher proportions of atopobium, prevotella, parvimonas, sneathia, gardnerella, mobiluncus, and other taxa. we sought to evaluate the relationship between vaginal bacterial composition and trichomonas vaginalis. methods: self-collected vaginal swabs were obtained cross-sectionally from 394 women equally representing 4 ethnic/racial groups. t. vaginalis screening was performed using pcr targeting the 18s rrna and beta-tubulin genes. vaginal bacterial composition was characterized by pyrosequencing of barcoded 16s rrna genes. a panel of 11 microsatellite markers was used to genotype t. vaginalis. the association between vaginal microbiota and t. vaginalis was evaluated by exact logistic regression. results: t. vaginalis was detected in 2.8% of participants (11/394). of the 11 t. vaginalis-positive cases, 8 (72%) were categorized as cst-iv, 2 (18%) as communities dominated by l. iners, and 1 (9%) as l. crispatus-dominated (p = 0.05). cst-iv microbiota were associated with an 8-fold increased odds of detecting t. vaginalis compared with  women in the l. crispatus-dominated state (or: 8.26, 95% ci: 1.07-372.65). seven  of the 11 t. vaginalis isolates were assigned to 2 genotypes. conclusion: t. vaginalis was associated with vaginal microbiota consisting of low proportions of lactobacilli and high proportions of mycoplasma, parvimonas, sneathia, and other  anaerobes.

TI  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) from chlamydia trachomatis versus pid from neisseria gonorrhea: from clinical suspicion to therapy.
AB  == pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is the most significant complication of sexually transmitted infections in childbearing-age women and it represents an important public health problem because of its long-term sequelae (chronic pelvic pain, tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy). prior to the mid 1970s pid was considered a monoetiologic infection, due primarily to neisseria gonorrhea. now it is well documented as a polymicrobial process, with a great number of microrganisms involved. in addition to neisseria gonorrhea and chlamydia trachomatis, other vaginal microrganisms (anaerobes, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, enteric gram negative rods, streptococco agalactie, mycoplasma genitalium) also have been associated with pid. there is a wide variation in pid clinical features; the type and severity of symptoms vary by microbiologic etiology. women who have chlamydial pid seem more likely than women who have gonococcal pid to be asymptomatic. since clinical diagnosis is imprecise, the suspicion of pid should be confirmed by genital assessment for signs of inflammation or infection, blood test and imaging evaluation. laparoscopic approach is considered the gold standard. according to the polymicrobial etiology of pid, antibiotic treatment must provide broad spectrum coverage of likely pathogens. early administration of antibiotics is necessary to reduce the risk of long-term sequelae.

TI  == bacterial modulation of human fetal membrane toll-like receptor expression.
AB  == problem: preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes (pprom) occurs in 30-40% of spontaneous preterm births (ptb) and is associated with intra-amniotic infection  and inflammation. the membranes may sense and respond to microbes via toll-like receptors (tlrs); however, little is known about their expression and regulation  in this tissue. the objective of this study was to evaluate the expression of tlrs 1-10 in fetal membranes after exposure to pathogens associated with intra-amniotic infection and ptb. method of study: normal human term fetal membrane explants were exposed to various bacteria. after 24 hrs, rna was extracted and quantitative rt-pcr performed for tlrs1-10. results: treatment of fetal membranes with mycoplasma hominis increased expression of tlr4, tlr6, and tlr8 mrna. ureaplasma parvum upregulated tlr8 mrna, and porphyromonas gingivalis  significantly increased fetal membrane tlr7 expression. in contrast, treatment with gram-negative escherichia coli (and its cell wall component lipopolysaccharide) downregulated tlr10 mrna. no effect was detected for ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, or group b streptococcus. conclusion: these findings demonstrate that different types of bacteria have distinct effects on fetal membrane tlr expression patterns. moreover, these findings highlight the disparity of fetal membrane responses to infection and thus suggest heterogeneity in the mechanisms by which infection-associated pregnancy complications, such as pprom and ptb, arise.

TI  == preserved ex vivo inflammatory status in decidual cells from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection.
AB  == objective: to compare the inflammatory response preserved ex vivo by decidual cells isolated from women who experienced preterm labor with and without subclinical intrauterine infection. methods: fetal membranes were obtained after  cesarean section from 35 women who delivered before 37 weeks of gestation following spontaneous preterm labor, with no clinical evidence of intrauterine infection. decidua was microbiologically tested and cultured. concentrations of anti-inflammatory cytokines (il-2, il-4, il-10), pro-inflammatory cytokines (il-6, il-8, il-1beta and tnf-alpha), and matrix metalloproteinases (mmp-1, mmp-2, mmp-3, mmp-7, mmp-8, mmp-9) were measured in the supernatants using bio-plex, and prostaglandin e(2) (pge(2)) was measured by enzyme immunoassay. results: subclinical infection was confirmed in 10 women (28.5%). microorganisms  isolated were ureaplasma urealyticum (4), group b streptococci (3), gardnerella vaginalis (1), and escherichia coli (2). we found a significant increase of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease of anti-inflammatory cytokines in supernatants from decidual cells obtained from women with preterm labor and subclinical intrauterine infection compared to women without infection. secretion of mmp-1, mmp-8, mmp-9 and pge(2) was significantly higher in infected  women. secretion of il-8 by decidual cells from infected women persisted upon repeated in vitro culture passages. conclusions: almost 30% of idiopathic preterm labor cases were associated with subclinical intrauterine infection, and decidual cells isolated from these cases preserved an ex vivo inflammatory status after in vivo bacterial exposure.

TI  == resolution and characterization of distinct cpn60-based subgroups of gardnerella  vaginalis in the vaginal microbiota.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv), characterized by a shift of the vaginal microbiota from a lactobacillus-dominated community to a dense biofilm containing a complex mixture of organisms, is an important risk factor in poor reproductive health outcomes. the nugent score, based on gram stain, is used to diagnose bv and gardnerella vaginalis abundance in the sample is one factor determining nugent score. a high nugent score is indicative of bv but does not always correspond to  the presence of clinical symptoms. g. vaginalis is recognized as a heterogeneous  group of organisms, which can also be part of the normal, healthy vaginal microbiome. in addition, asymptomatic bv and non-gardnerella types of bv are being recognized. in an attempt to resolve the heterogeneous group of g. vaginalis, a phylogenetic tree of cpn60 universal target sequences from g. vaginalis isolates was constructed that indicates the existence of four subgroups of g. vaginalis. this subdivision, supported by whole genome similarity calculation of representative strains using jspecies, demonstrates that these subgroups may represent different species. the cpn60 subgroupings did not correspond with the piot biotyping scheme, but did show consistency with ardra genotyping and sialidase gene presence. isolates from all four subgroups produced biofilm in vitro. we also investigated the distribution of g. vaginalis subgroups in vaginal samples from kenyan women with nugent scores consistent with bv, intermediate and normal microbiota (n = 44). all subgroups of g. vaginalis were detected in these women, with a significant difference (z = -3.372, n = 39, p = 0.001) in frequency of g. vaginalis subgroup b between bv and normal groups. establishment of a quantifiable relationship between g. vaginalis subgroup distribution and clinical status could have significant diagnostic implications.

AB  == background: retrocyclins are cyclic antimicrobial peptides that have been shown to be both broadly active and safe in animal models. rc-101, a synthetic retrocyclin, targets important human pathogens and is a candidate vaginal microbicide. its activity against microbes associated with bacterial vaginosis is unknown. methods: we investigated the effect of rc-101 on toxin activity, bacterial growth and biofilm formation of gardnerella vaginalis in vitro. results: rc-101 potently inhibits the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin, the gardnerella vaginalis toxin, on both erythrocytes and nucleated cells. rc-101 lacks inhibitory activity against planktonic g. vaginalis but markedly decreases  biofilm formation. conclusions: these dual properties, toxin inhibition and biofilm retardation, justify further exploration of rc-101 as a candidate agent for bacterial vaginosis prevention.

TI  == mode of action and safety of lactosporin, a novel antimicrobial protein produced  by bacillus coagulans atcc 7050.
AB  == aims: to determine the mechanism of action of antimicrobial protein, lactosporin, against gardnerella vaginalis and to evaluate its safety in vitro. methods and results: bacillus coagulans atcc 7050 was grown at 37 degrees c for 18 h. the cell-free supernatant was concentrated 10-fold and screened for antimicrobial activity against indicator strain micrococcus luteus. the mode of action of lactosporin was determined by measuring the potassium release and monitoring the  changes in transmembrane potential (deltapsi) and transmembrane ph (deltaph) of the sensitive cells. lactosporin caused the efflux of potassium ions from m. luteus cells and dissipation of deltaph in g. vaginalis, while it had no effect on the deltapsi. the safety of lactosporin was evaluated by using epivaginal() ectocervical (vec-100) tissue model. over 80% of the cells in the vaginal tissue  remained viable after exposure to lactosporin for 24 h. conclusions: lactosporin  potentially exerts its antimicrobial activity by selective dissipation of deltaph and/or by causing leakage of ions from the sensitive cells. safety studies suggest that lactosporin is a noncytotoxic antimicrobial for vaginal application. significance and impact of the study: this study revealed that lactosporin is an  effective and safe antimicrobial preparation with potential application for the control of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == comparative genomic analyses of 17 clinical isolates of gardnerella vaginalis provide evidence of multiple genetically isolated clades consistent with subspeciation into genovars.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis is associated with a spectrum of clinical conditions, suggesting high degrees of genetic heterogeneity among stains. seventeen g. vaginalis isolates were subjected to a battery of comparative genomic analyses to determine their level of relatedness. for each measure, the degree of difference  among the g. vaginalis strains was the highest observed among 23 pathogenic bacterial species for which at least eight genomes are available. genome sizes ranged from 1.491 to 1.716 mb; gc contents ranged from 41.18% to 43.40%; and the  core genome, consisting of only 746 genes, makes up only 51.6% of each strain's genome on average and accounts for only 27% of the species supragenome. neighbor-grouping analyses, using both distributed gene possession data and core  gene allelic data, each identified two major sets of strains, each of which is composed of two groups. each of the four groups has its own characteristic genome size, gc ratio, and greatly expanded core gene content, making the genomic diversity of each group within the range for other bacterial species. to test whether these 4 groups corresponded to genetically isolated clades, we inferred the phylogeny of each distributed gene that was present in at least two strains and absent in at least two strains; this analysis identified frequent homologous  recombination within groups but not between groups or sets. g. vaginalis appears  to include four nonrecombining groups/clades of organisms with distinct gene pools and genomic properties, which may confer distinct ecological properties. consequently, it may be appropriate to treat these four groups as separate species.

TI  == characteristics of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis from women with or without bacterial vaginosis and their relationships in gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the objectives of the present study were to evaluate in vitro the production of antagonistic compounds against gardnerella vaginalis by lactobacillus strains isolated from women with or without bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to select one of the better lactobacillus producers of such a substance to be tested in vivo using a gnotobiotic animal model challenged with one of the more sensitive g. vaginalis isolates. a total of 24 isolates from women with and without bv were identified as g. vaginalis. a higher frequency (p<0.05) of this bacterium was observed in women with bv (56.7%) when compared to healthy women (17.6%). a total of 86 strains of lactobacillus were obtained from healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus strains were more frequently present (p<0.05) in healthy women  (97.5%) than in women with bv (76.7%). lactobacillus crispatus was the predominating strain in both healthy women and women with bv. lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus vaginalis were isolated with an intermediate frequency in the two groups. in vitro antagonism assays were performed using as indicators 17 reference strains and the g. vaginalis strains isolated from women with bv and from healthy women.  lactobacillus isolated from healthy women showed the higher antagonistic activity against all the indicator strains when compared with isolates from women with bv. concerning the indicator strains, g. vaginalis found in women with bv was more resistant to the antagonism, particularly when lactobacillus isolates from women  with bv were used as producer strains. a high vaginal population level of g. vaginalis was obtained by intravaginal inoculation of germ-free mice, and this colonization was accompanied by vaginal histopathological lesions. a tenfold decrease in vaginal population level of g. vaginalis and a reduction of histological lesions were observed when the pathogenic challenge was performed in mice previously monoassociated with an l. johnsonii strain. concluding, results of the present study suggest that progression of g. vaginalis-associated bv depends in part on a simultaneous presence of lactobacillus populations with a low antagonistic capacity and of a g. vaginalis strain with a high resistance to  this antagonism. the results could also explain why g. vaginalis is frequently found in the vaginal ecosystem of healthy women.

TI  == [possible role of enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis in the etiology of infectious vaginitis].
AB  == vaginitis is a common gynecologic disorder. it is due to several causes, some even unknown. bacteroides fragilis is the most important anaerobe in clinical bacteriology, some strains of this group are notable for being enterotoxigenic and they have been associated with intestinal and extraintestinal syndromes. they have recently been isolated from patients with vaginitis. the purpose of this study was to investigate a possible association of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis with infectious vaginitis. 265 samples of vaginal exudate were processed, 202 from symptomatic patients and 63 healthy women. the identification of the microorganisms was carried out by conventional methods. in 31.2% of symptomatic patients were identified: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus, candida albicans, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and streptococcus agalactiae. b. fragilis was identified in 27 symptomatic patients and 5 healthy women. these strains were cultivated in liquid medium and incubated during 48 h at 36 degrees  c in anaerobe chambers. supernatant activity was assayed in ht-29 cells. eighteen b. fragilis strains isolated from symptomatic patients were enterotoxigenic, because induced alterations in target cell morphology. it was not identified in healthy women (p < 0.05). 77.7% of enterotoxigenic b. fragilis strains were not associated with other specific pathogens. this fact suggests that enterotoxigenic b. fragilis could be a cause for vaginitis. the effect of enterotoxin on e-cadherin of vaginal epithelium could facilitate invasion and its possible pathogenic role in the vagina. this is the first report that associates enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis as a possible cause of infectious vaginitis.

AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) represents shifts in microbiota from lactobacillus spp. to diverse anaerobes. although antibiotics relieve symptoms and temporarily eradicate bv-associated bacteria (bvab), bv usually recurs. we investigated the role of extravaginal bvab reservoirs in recurrence. methods: risks for bv acquisition over the course of 1 year were defined. dna in vaginal,  anal, and oral swab samples from enrollment was subjected to quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays targeting 16s ribosomal rna genes of gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus crispatus, bvab1, bvab2, bvab3, megasphaera spp., lactobacillus jensenii, and leptotrichia/sneathia spp. a case-control approach analyzed bvab detection at enrollment for case patients (bv acquisition) versus controls (none). results: of 239 women enrolled without bv, 199 were seen in follow-up, and 40 experienced bv; 15 had all samples for analysis. detection of g. vaginalis in oral cavity or anal samples and leptotrichia/sneathia spp. in anal samples was more common at enrollment among case patients, who also had higher concentrations of these bacteria and megasphaera relative to 30 controls at each site. in contrast, l. crispatus was detected more frequently in anal samples among controls. conclusions: women who acquire bv are more likely have previous colonization of extravaginal reservoirs with some bvab, and less likely  to have l. crispatus, suggesting that bvab may be acquired vaginally from extravaginal reservoirs.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance of gardnerella vaginalis isolated from cases of bacterial  vaginosis].
AB  == introduction: gardnerella vaginalis is one of the dominant etiological factors related to bacterial vaginosis. literature offers a growing number of reports revealing there appear gardnerella vaginalis strains increasingly resistant to metronidazole. objectives: the aim of this study was to determine the susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis to metronidazole, clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. material and methods: the investigation was performed on collection of 67 gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from the group of 604 women participating  in the study antibiotic sensitivity of strains was verified by e-test method (biomerieux). interpretation of results was performed in accordance with eucast criteria. results: all tested strains, apart from one, were sensitive to clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. the results of susceptibility test to metronidazole indicated that 68.7% (46 out of 67 strains) were resistant to this antibiotic, while all of them were sensitive to both clindamycin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. conclusions: near future may bring the need to change the treatment regimen of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) candidate bacteria: associations with bv and behavioural practices in sexually-experienced and inexperienced women.
AB  == background: in recent years several new fastidious bacteria have been identified  that display a high specificity for bv; however no previous studies have comprehensively assessed the behavioural risk associations of these bacterial vaginosis-candidate organisms (bv-cos). methods: we examined the associations between 8 key previously described bv-cos and bv status established by nugent's score (ns). we also examined the sexual practices associated with each bv-co. we  incorporated 2 study populations: 193 from a sexually-inexperienced university population and 146 from a highly sexually-active clinic population. detailed behavioural data was collected by questionnaire and vaginal smears were scored by the nugent method. stored samples were tested by quantitative pcr assays for the  8 bv-cos: atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, leptotrichia spp., megasphaera type i, sneathia spp., and the clostridia-like bacteria bvab1, bvab2  and bvab3. associations between bv-cos and bv and behaviours were examined by univariate and multivariable analyses. results: on univariate analysis, all bv-cos were more common in bv compared to normal flora. however, only megasphaera type i, bvab2, a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were significantly independently associated with bv by multivariable analysis. six of the eight bv-cos (megasphaera type i, bvab2, bvab3, sneathia, leptotrichia and g. vaginalis) were  rare or absent in sexually-unexposed women, and demonstrated increasing odds of detection with increasing levels of sexual activity and/or numbers of lifetime sexual partners. only g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were commonly detected in sexually-unexposed women. megasphaera type i was independently associated with women-who-have-sex-with women (wsw) and lifetime sexual partner numbers, while unprotected penile-vaginal-sex was associated with bvab2 detection by multivariate analysis. conclusions: four of eight key bv-cos were significantly associated with bv after adjusting for the presence of other bv-cos. the majority of bv-cos were absent or rare in sexually-unexposed women, and associated with increasing sexual exposure, suggesting potential sexual transmission of bv-cos.

TI  == altered vaginal microbiota are associated with perinatal mother-to-child transmission of hiv in african women from burkina faso.
AB  == background: mother-to-child transmission (mtct) of hiv remains a significant problem in resource-limited settings, despite the advent of antiretroviral therapies. because perturbations in vaginal microbial communities are associated  with sexual transmission of hiv, we determined whether perinatal mtct is associated with the vaginal microbiotas of hiv-infected mothers. methods: we conducted a retrospective analysis of cervicovaginal microbiotas by pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s rrna genes (median 350 sequences per sample) from 10 transmitters and 54 nontransmitters during a perinatal mtct prevention clinical trial of azidothymidine and the microbicide benzalkonium chloride. logistic regression was performed adjusting for multiple covariates, including cd4(+) t-cell numbers and treatment group, to correlate abundances of microbial taxa with perinatal mtct. results: the vaginal microbiotas of these subjects were dominated by several lactobacilli species, although a subset of subjects was colonized by diverse anaerobic species. mtct of hiv was associated with significantly greater relative abundances of several groups of microorganisms. most notably, among the abundant bacterial species, gardnerella vaginalis was significantly enriched in cases of antepartum transmission, compared with nontransmission (odds ratio 1.7; p = 0.004). neither azidothymidine nor benzalkonium chloride treatment was associated with shifts in microbial distributions compared with the placebo control group. conclusions: these data suggest that alterations in vaginal microbial communities are associated with an  increased risk for perinatal mtct, consistent with results with horizontal transmission of hiv. therefore, determining the mucosal features associated with  alterations in vaginal microbial communities may guide efforts to modulate the risk for hiv mtct.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna genes for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.
AB  == to preliminarily evaluate the applicability of bacterial dna as a marker for the  forensic identification of vaginal fluid, we developed and performed pcr-based detection of 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus spp. dominating the vagina  and of bacterial vaginosis-related bacteria from dna extracted from body fluids and stains. as a result, 16s ribosomal rna genes of lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii and atopobium vaginae were specifically detected in vaginal fluid and female urine samples. bacterial genes detected in female urine  might have originated from contaminated vaginal fluid. in addition, those of lactobacillus iners, lactobacillus gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis were also detected in non-vaginal body fluids such as semen. because bacterial genes were successfully amplified in dna samples extracted by using the general procedure for animal tissues without any optional treatments, dna samples prepared for the  identification of vaginal fluid can also be used for personal identification. in  conclusion, 16s ribosomal rna genes of l. crispatus, l. jensenii and a. vaginae could be effective markers for forensic identification of vaginal fluid.

TI  == genetic and biochemical diversity of gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from  women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis is considered a substantial player in the progression of bacterial vaginosis (bv). we analysed 17 g. vaginalis strains isolated from the genital tract of women diagnosed with bv to establish a potential link between genotypes/biotypes and the expression of virulence factors, vaginolysin (vly) and sialidase, which are assumed to play a substantial role in the pathogenesis of bv. amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis revealed two g. vaginalis genotypes. gardnerella vaginalis isolates of genotype 2 appeared more complex than genotype 1 and were subdivided into three subtypes. biochemical typing allowed us to distinguish four different biotypes. a great diversity of the level of vly production among the isolates of g. vaginalis may be related to a different cytotoxicity level of the strains. we did not find any correlation between vly production level and g. vaginalis genotype/biotype. in contrast, a link between g. vaginalis genotype and sialidase production was established. our  findings on the diversity of vly expression level in different clinical isolates  and linking sialidase activity with the genotype of g. vaginalis could help to evaluate the pathogenic potential of different g. vaginalis strains.

TI  == the natural antimicrobial peptide subtilosin acts synergistically with glycerol monolaurate, lauric arginate, and epsilon-poly-l-lysine against bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogens but not human lactobacilli.
AB  == subtilosin is a cyclical antimicrobial peptide produced by bacillus amyloliquefaciens that has antimicrobial activity against the bacterial vaginosis-associated human pathogen gardnerella vaginalis. the ability of subtilosin to inhibit g. vaginalis alone and in combination with the natural antimicrobial agents glycerol monolaurate (lauricidin), lauric arginate, and epsilon-poly-l-lysine was tested using a checkerboard approach. subtilosin was found to act synergistically with all of the chosen antimicrobials. these promising results indicate that lower concentrations of subtilosin in combination with other compounds could effectively be used to inhibit growth of the pathogen, thereby decreasing the risk of developed antimicrobial resistance. this is the first report on the effects of subtilosin combined with other natural antimicrobials against g. vaginalis.

TI  == evidence for gardnerella vaginalis uptake and internalization by squamous vaginal epithelial cells: implications for the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv), a common condition seen in premenopausal women, is associated with preterm labor, pelvic inflammatory disease, and delivery of low birth weight infants. gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant bacterial species  associated with bv, although its exact role in the pathology of bv is unknown. using immunofluorescence, confocal and transmission electron microscopy, we found that vk2 vaginal epithelial cells take up g. vaginalis after exposure to the bacteria. confocal microscopy also indicated the presence of internalized g. vaginalis within vaginal epithelial cells obtained from a subject with bv. using  vk2 cells and (35)s labeled bacteria in an invasion assay, we found that a 1 h uptake of g. vaginalis was 21.8-fold higher than heat-killed g. vaginalis, 84-fold compared to lactobacillus acidophilus and 6.6-fold compared to lactobacillus crispatus. internalization was inhibited by pre-exposure of cells to cytochalasin-d. in addition, the cytoskeletal protein vimentin was upregulated in vk2 cells exposed to g. vaginalis, but there was no change in actin cytoskeletal polymerization/rearrangements or vimentin subcellular relocalization post exposure. cytoskeletal protein modifications could represent a potential mechanism for g. vaginalis mediated internalization by vaginal epithelial cells.  finally, understanding vaginal bacteria/host interactions will allow us to better understand the underlying mechanisms of bv pathogenesis.

TI  == characterization of low molecular weight antimicrobial peptide from human female  reproductive tract.
AB  == background & objectives: the mechanisms that protect female upper genital tract from ascending infection by microbes present in vagina are only partially understood. it is expected that epithelial cells in mucosal surfaces and their secretions directly interfere with microbial colonization and invasion. this study was aimed to demonstrate the expression of 2 kda antimicrobial peptide which was identified and purified from female genital tract tissues using chromatographic techniques. methods: low molecular weight proteins were isolated  from human female reproductive tract tissues obtained from premenopausal women. antimicrobial activity of these lmw proteins was assessed against different reproductive tract pathogens viz., neisseria gonorrhoeae, group b streptococcus,  gardnerella vaginalis, escherechia coli and candida albicans. the expression of these peptides were also documented in reproductive tract tissues with the help of hyperimmune sera raised against the rabbits. the purified peptide was characterized by n-terminal sequencing. results: immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies demonstrated that 2 kda peptide was expressed in the stratified squamous epithelial cells of the ectocervix while it was absent in columnar epithelial cells of upper genital tract. upregulation of the expression  of this peptide was observed in patients of chronic non-specific cervicitis and acute on chronic cervicitis. this purified antimicrobial peptide also showed broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against different reproductive tract pathogens. interpretation & conclusions: considering the emerging bacterial resistance against conventional antibiotics, isolation and understanding of the expression of antimicrobial peptides from female reproductive tissue extracts may provide some leads towards the development of strategies for the treatment of reproductive tract infections.

TI  == [bacterial vaginosis in 2011: a lot of questions remain].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is one of the most frequent vaginal affections. it results from a deep imbalance of the vaginal ecosystem whose mechanisms remain mysterious, even if recent progress were accomplished in their comprehension: if  the flora implied in the bacterial vaginosis is recognized like polymorphic, it appears that gardnerella vaginalis plays a major part with two genomically different forms: a commensal form (slightly adhesive to the epithelial cells), and a pathogenic one (strongly adhesive to the epithelial cells); the changes in  lactobacilli are also to take into account: l. iners could be a marker of the vaginal flora imbalance whereas l. crispatus is generally met in the normal vaginal flora. these findings could influence the composition of coming probiotics; it is recognized that bacterial vaginosis is involved in the risk of  prematurity but molecular quantification of g. vaginalis (and of atopobium vaginae) is more sensitive for the diagnosis of bv what could improve the detection of high-risk pregnant women. the isolated antibiotic treatments are not very effective on the prevention of recurrences. the rebalancing of the vaginal flora is essential. in this field, the local estrogens showed some effectiveness. the use of probiotics is promising and can be recommended in complement of the antibiotic treatment even if the results of the clinical studies are still too heterogeneous to lead to precise indications.

TI  == [the role of infection in preterm birth].
AB  == intrauterine infection could be responsible for 25% up to 40% of preterm births.  this relationship was initially demonstrated using animal models, inducing their  abortion by injecting bacteria or endotoxins. in human research, examination of amniocentesis fluid showed the anteriority of infection over labor induction, and the existence of a subclinical latency phase between these two phenomena. the ascending route is preponderant, and four stages can be distinguished: cervical and vaginal infection, chorio-decidual infection, intra-amniotic infection, fetal infection. the intrauterine infection is very frequent in case of early preterm birth (<30 wg). it is associated with an increase of neurological and pulmonary morbidity. most commonly found bacterial species are mycoplasma species, but also escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis and streptococcus b. several markers of the infection have been studied: a maternal leukocytosis>15,000/mm(3) or a c-reactive protein (crp)>20mg/l, an increase of fibronectin and/or il-6 cervical, a short cervical length especially before 32 wg, a leukocytosis of the amniotic fluid, and/or high interleukin concentrations. the main marker used for the newborn is the crp, but other markers can also be used for an early diagnosis of  an infection, especially interleukin 6.

TI  == production in yeast of pseudotype virus-like particles harboring functionally active antibody fragments neutralizing the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin.
AB  == background: recombinant antibodies can be produced in different formats and different expression systems. single chain variable fragments (scfvs) represent an attractive alternative to full-length antibodies and they can be easily produced in bacteria or yeast. however, the scfvs exhibit monovalent antigen-binding properties and short serum half-lives. the stability and avidity  of the scfvs can be improved by their multimerization or fusion with igg fc domain. the aim of the current study was to investigate the possibilities to produce in yeast high-affinity scfv-fc proteins neutralizing the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin (vly), the main virulence factor of gardnerella vaginalis. results: the scfv protein derived from hybridoma cell line producing high-affinity neutralizing antibodies against vly was fused with human igg1 fc domain. four different variants of anti-vly scfv-fc fusion proteins were constructed and produced in yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. the non-tagged scfv-fc and hexahistidine-tagged scfv-fc proteins were found predominantly as insoluble aggregates and therefore were not suitable for further purification and activity testing. the addition of yeast alpha-factor signal sequence did not support secretion of anti-vly scfv-fc but increased the amount of its intracellular soluble form. however, the purified protein showed a weak vly-neutralizing capability. in contrast, the fusion of anti-vly scfv-fc molecules with hamster polyomavirus-derived vp2 protein and its co-expression with vp1 protein resulted in an effective production of pseudotype virus-like particles (vlps) that exhibited strong vly-binding activity. recombinant scfv-fc  molecules displayed on the surface of vlps neutralized vly-mediated lysis of human erythrocytes and hela cells with high potency comparable to that of full-length antibody. conclusions: recombinant scfv-fc proteins were expressed in yeast with low efficiency. new approach to display the scfv-fc molecules on the surface of pseudotype vlps was successful and allowed generation of multivalent scfv-fc proteins with high vly-neutralizing potency. our study demonstrated for the first time that large recombinant antibody molecule fused with hamster polyomavirus vp2 protein and co-expressed with vp1 protein in the form of pseudotype vlps was properly folded and exhibited strong antigen-binding activity. the current study broadens the potential of recombinant vlps as a highly efficient carrier for functionally active complex proteins.

TI  == the microbiota of the vagina and its influence on women's health and disease.
AB  == explorations of the vaginal microbiota (vmb) began over 150 years ago. using light microscopy and bacterial cultures, the concept of normal versus abnormal microbiota in women began to emerge. the latter became known by the term "bacterial vaginosis" (bv). bv microbiota is dominated by gardnerella vaginalis and includes a number of anaerobic organisms. in contrast, normal flora is dominated by various lactobacilli. bv microbiota is associated with vaginal discharge, poor pregnancy outcomes, pelvic inflammatory disease, postoperative wound infections and endometritis after elective abortions. in addition, bv flora predisposes women to infection by human immunodeficiency virus and sexually transmitted diseases. application of molecular techniques over the past decade has significantly advanced our understanding of the vmb. it is far more complex than previously recognized and is composed of many previously unknown organisms in addition to those already identified by culture. analyses using high-throughput sequencing techniques have revealed unique microbial communities  not previously recognized within the older, established vaginal flora categories. these new findings will inform the design of future clinical investigations of the role of the vmb in health and disease.

AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis is associated with sexual activity, but mechanisms for this association are unclear. study design: cross-sectional analysis of data from women reporting sex with women who provided information on  sexual behaviors as part of a study of vaginal bacteria was conducted. vaginal bacteria were detected by semiquantitative culture. binomial regression with log-link evaluated associations between detection of bacteria and sexual behaviors reported to occur before enrollment. linear regression evaluated associations between these behaviors and quantity of bacteria. results: of the 320 women, 216 (68%) were colonized with h2o2-producing lactobacilli and 142 (44%) with gardnerella vaginalis. colonization with g. vaginalis was associated with >20 digital-vaginal sex acts (risk ratio, 2.01; 1.22, 3.29) or >10 toy-vaginal acts in the past 3 months (risk ratio, 1.76; 1.32, 2.36). quantity of h2o2-producing lactobacilli was 1.3 log lower in colonized women reporting >10 acts of insertive vaginal sex-toy use in the past 3 months (95% confidence interval: -2.04, -0.56), 1.19 log lower with toy-vaginal sex in past 7 days (-1.75, -0.62), and 0.78 log lower in women sharing toys with a partner (-1.25, -0.31). conclusions: vaginal insertive use and sharing of sex toys were associated with decreased quantities of h2o2-producing lactobacilli and higher risk of colonization with g. vaginalis.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis, atopobium vaginae and nifuratel.
AB  == as bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a potential cause of obstetric complications and gynecological disorders, there is substantial interest in establishing the most effective treatment. standard treatment - metronidazole or clindamycin, by either vaginal or oral route is followed by relapses in about 30% of cases, within a month from treatment completion. this inability to prevent recurrences reflects our lack of knowledge on the origins of bv. atopobium vaginae has been recently reported to be associated with bv in around 80% of the cases and might be involved in the therapeutic failures. this review looks at the potential benefits of nifuratel against a. vaginae compared to the standard treatments with metronidazole and clindamycin. in vitro, nifuratel is able to inhibit the growth  of a. vaginae, with a mic range of 0.125-1 mug/ml; it is active against g. vaginalis and does not affect lactobacilli. metronidazole is active against a. vaginae only at very high concentrations (8-256 mug/ml); it is partially active against g. vaginalis and also has no effect on lactobacilli. clindamycin acts against a. vaginae with an mic lower than 0.125 mug/ml and is active on g. vaginalis but it also affects lactobacilli, altering the vaginal environment. these observations suggest that nifuratel is probably the most valid therapeutic  agent for bv treatment.

TI  == generation of recombinant single-chain antibodies neutralizing the cytolytic activity of vaginolysin, the main virulence factor of gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == background: gardnerella vaginalis is identified as the predominant colonist of the vaginal tract in women with bacterial vaginosis. vaginolysin (vly) is a protein toxin released by g. vaginalis. vly possesses cytolytic activity and is considered as a main virulence factor of g. vaginalis. inhibition of vly-mediated cell lysis by antibodies may have important physiological relevance. results: single-chain variable fragments of immunoglobulins (scfvs) were cloned from two hybridoma cell lines producing neutralizing antibodies against vly and expressed  as active proteins in e. coli. for each hybridoma, two variants of anti-vly scfv  consisting of either vl-vh or vh-vl linked with a 20 aa-long linker sequence (g(4)s)(4) were constructed. recovery of scfvs from inclusion bodies with subsequent purification by metal-chelate chromatography resulted in vly-binding proteins that were predominantly monomeric. the antigen-binding activity of purified scfvs was verified by an indirect elisa. the neutralizing activity was investigated by in vitro hemolytic assay and cytolytic assay using hela cell line. calculated apparent kd values and neutralizing potency of scfvs were in agreement with those of parental full-length antibodies. vh-vl and vl-vh variants of scfvs showed similar affinity and neutralizing potency. the anti-vly scfvs derived from hybridoma clone 9b4 exhibited high vly-neutralizing activity both on human erythrocytes and cervical epithelial hela cells. conclusions: hybridoma-derived scfvs with vly-binding activity were expressed in e. coli. recombinant anti-vly scfvs inhibited vly-mediated cell lysis. the monovalent scfvs showed reduced affinity and neutralizing potency as compared to the respective full-length antibodies. the loss of avidity could be restored by generating scfv constructs with multivalent binding properties. generated scfvs is the first example of recombinant single-chain antibodies with vly-neutralizing activity produced in prokaryote expression system. g. vaginalis caused infections continue to be a world-wide problem, therefore neutralizing recombinant antibodies may provide novel therapeutic agents useful in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis and other diseases caused by g. vaginalis.

TI  == exploring the diversity of gardnerella vaginalis in the genitourinary tract microbiota of monogamous couples through subtle nucleotide variation.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is an enigmatic disease of unknown origin that affects a large percentage of women. the vaginal microbiota of women with bv is associated with serious sequelae, including abnormal pregnancies. the etiology of bv is not fully understood, however, it has been suggested that it is transmissible, and that g. vaginalis may be an etiological agent. studies using enzymatic assays to define g. vaginalis biotypes, as well as more recent genomic  comparisons of g. vaginalis isolates from symptomatic and asymptomatic women, suggest that particular g. vaginalis strains may play a key role in the pathogenesis of bv. methodology/principal findings: to explore g. vaginalis diversity, distribution and sexual transmission, we developed a shannon entropy-based method to analyze low-level sequence variation in 65,710 g. vaginalis 16s rrna gene segments that were pcr-amplified from vaginal samples of  53 monogamous women and from urethral and penile skin samples of their male partners. we observed a high degree of low-level diversity among g. vaginalis sequences with a total of 46 unique sequence variants (oligotypes), and also found strong correlations of these oligotypes between sexual partners. even though gram stain-defined normal and some gram stain-defined intermediate oligotype profiles clustered together in unifrac analysis, no single g. vaginalis oligotype was found to be specific to bv or normal vaginal samples. conclusions:  this study describes a novel method for investigating g. vaginalis diversity at a low level of taxonomic discrimination. the findings support cultivation-based studies that indicate sexual partners harbor the same strains of g. vaginalis. this study also highlights the fact that a few, reproducible nucleotide variations within the 16s rrna gene can reveal clinical or epidemiological associations that would be missed by genus-level or species-level categorization  of 16s rrna data.

TI  == multiplex detection of bacteria in complex clinical and environmental samples using oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a recurring polymicrobial syndrome that is characterized by a change in the "normal" microbiota from lactobacillus-dominated to a microbiota dominated by a number of bacterial species, including gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and others. this condition is associated with a range of negative health outcomes, including hiv acquisition, and it can be difficult to manage clinically. furthermore, diagnosis of bv has relied on the use of gram stains of vaginal swab smears that are scored on various numerical criteria. while this diagnostic is simple, inexpensive, and well suited to resource-limited settings, it can suffer from problems related to subjective interpretations and it does not give a detailed profile of the composition of the vaginal microbiota. recent deep sequencing efforts have revealed a rich, diverse  vaginal microbiota with clear differences between samples taken from individuals  that are diagnosed with bv compared to those individuals that are considered normal, which has resulted in the identification of a number of potential targets for molecular diagnosis of bv. these studies have provided a wealth of useful information, but deep sequencing is not yet practical as a diagnostic method in a clinical setting. we have recently described a method for rapidly profiling the vaginal microbiota in a multiplex format using oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads with detection on a luminex platform. this method, like current gram stain-based methods, is rapid and simple but adds the additional advantage of exploiting molecular knowledge arising from sequencing studies in probe design. this method therefore provides a way to profile the major microorganisms  that are present in a vaginal swab that can be used to diagnose bv with high specificity and sensitivity compared to gram stain while providing additional information on species presence and abundance in a semi-quantitative and rapid manner. this multiplex method is expandable well beyond the range of current quantitative pcr assays for particular organisms, which is currently limited to 5 or 6 different assays in a single sample. importantly, the method is not limited  to the detection of bacteria in vaginal swabs and can be easily adapted to rapidly profile nearly any microbial community of interest. for example, we have  recently begun to apply this methodology to the development of diagnostic tools for use in wastewater treatment plants.

AB  == aims: to elucidate the molecular mechanism of action of the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin against the foodborne pathogen listeria monocytogenes scott a. methods and results: subtilosin was purified from a culture of bacillus amyloliquefaciens. the minimal inhibitory concentration of subtilosin against l.  monocytogenes scott a was determined by broth microdilution method. the effect of subtilosin on the transmembrane electrical potential (deltapsi) and ph gradient (deltaph), and its ability to induce efflux of intracellular atp, was investigated. subtilosin fully inhibited l. monocytogenes growth at a concentration of 19 mug ml(-1) . subtilosin caused a partial depletion of the deltapsi and had a similar minor effect on the deltaph. there was no significant  efflux of intracellular atp. conclusion: subtilosin likely acts upon l. monocytogenes scott a by perturbing the lipid bilayer of the cellular membrane and causing intracellular damage, leading to eventual cell death. subtilosin's mode of action against l. monocytogenes scott a differs from the one previously described for another human pathogen, gardnerella vaginalis. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report on the specific mode of action of subtilosin against l. monocytogenes and the first report of a bacteriocin with a  species-specific mode of action.

AB  == objective: several fastidious bacteria have been associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), but their role in lactobacilli recolonization failure is unknown. we studied the effect of 7 bv-associated bacterial species and 2 lactobacillus species on vaginal colonization with lactobacillus crispatus ctv-05 (lactin-v). methods: twenty-four women with bv were given a 5-day course of metronidazole vaginal gel and then randomized 3:1 to receive either lactin-v or placebo applied vaginally once daily for 5 initial consecutive days, followed by a weekly application over 2 weeks. vaginal swabs for l. crispatus ctv-05 culture and 9 bacterium-specific 16s rrna gene quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were analyzed on several study visits for the 18 women receiving lactin-v. results: vaginal colonization with ctv-05 was achieved in 61% of the participants receiving lactin-v at either day 10 or day 28 visit and 44% at day 28. participants not colonized with ctv-05 had generally higher median concentrations of bv-associated bacteria compared to those who colonized. between enrollment and day 28, the median concentration of gardnerella vaginalis minimally reduced from  10 to 10 16s rrna gene copies per swab in women who colonized with ctv-05 but increased from 10 to 10 in those who failed to colonize (p = 0.19). similarly, the median concentration of atopobium spp. reduced from 10 16s rrna gene copies per swab to below limit of detection in women who colonized with ctv-05, but increased from 10 to 10 in those who failed to colonize (p = 0.04). the presence  of endogenous l. crispatus at enrollment was found to be significantly associated with a reduced odds of colonization with ctv-05 on day 28 (p = 0.003), and vaginal intercourse during the study significantly impaired successful ctv-05 colonization (p = 0.018). conclusion: vaginal concentration of certain bv-associated bacteria, vaginal intercourse during treatment, and the presence of endogenous l. crispatus at enrollment predict colonization with probiotic lactobacilli.

TI  == the complex vaginal flora of west african women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the spectrum of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv) has recently expanded through taxonomic changes and the use of molecular methods. these methods have yet to be used in large-scale epidemiological studies in africa where bv is highly prevalent. methods: an analysis of samples obtained during a clinical trial of the management of vaginal discharge in four west african countries. samples were available from 1555 participants; 843 (54%) had bv. nucleic acids of 13 bacterial genera or species potentially associated with bv were detected through the polymerase chain reaction. results: the associations between various components of the vaginal flora were complex. excluding lactobacillus, the other 12 micro-organisms were all associated with each other at the p</=0.001 level. the prevalence of various bacterial genera or species varied according to age, sexual activity and hiv status. in multivariate analysis, the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, bifidobacterium, megasphaera elsdenii, dialister, mycoplasma hominis, leptotrichia, and prevotella were independently associated with bv as was the absence of lactobacillus and peptoniphilus. however, mobiluncus, atopobium vaginae, anaerococcus, and eggerthella were not independently associated with bv. unexpectedly, after treatment with a regimen that included either metronidazole or tinidazole, the proportion of patients with a complete resolution of symptoms by day 14 increased with the number of bacterial genera or species present at enrolment. conclusions: numerous bacterial genera or species were strongly associated with each other in  a pattern that suggested a symbiotic relationship. bv cases with a simpler flora  were less likely to respond to treatment. overall, the vaginal flora of west african women with bv was reminiscent of that of their counterparts in industrialized countries.

TI  == elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of action of the natural antimicrobial peptide subtilosin against the bacterial vaginosis-associated pathogen gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == subtilosin a is a 35-amino acid long cyclical peptide produced by bacillus amyloliquefaciens that has potent antimicrobial activity against a variety of human pathogens, including the bacterial vaginosis-related gardnerella vaginalis. the specific mode of action of subtilosin against g. vaginalis was elucidated by  studying its effects on the proton motive force's (pmf) components: transmembrane electric potential (deltapsi), transmembrane ph gradient (deltaph), and intracellular atp levels. the addition of subtilosin to g. vaginalis cells caused an immediate and total depletion of the deltaph, but had no effect on the deltapsi. subtilosin also triggered an instant but partial efflux of intracellular atp that was twofold higher than that of the positive control bacteriocin, nisin. taken together, these data suggest that subtilosin inhibits g. vaginalis growth by creating transient pores in the cells' cytoplasmic membrane, leading to an efflux of intracellular ions and atp and eventually cell  death.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis: what is physiological in vaginal bacteriology? an update and opinion.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) was originally described as a sexually transmitted infection caused by a single microbe. the prevailing concept describes bv as a polymicrobial coitus-associated disease of uncertain origin. in this overview the natural history of bv as a monobacterial and polymicrobial entity is examined with respect to the physiological concept of bv in relation to sexual behavior before and after introduction of the hormonal contraceptive pill. bacterial vaginosis, characterized by low vaginal acidity (elevated ph) and replacement of  vaginal lactobacillus by gardnerella vaginalis flora, could be caused by unprotected intercourse when a low ph changes through the neutralizing power of male ejaculate, vaginal coital transudate and vaginal neurogenic transudate. a monobacterial form, g. vaginalis vaginitis, could be a physiological post-coital  condition for protection of ejaculated spermatozoa, characterized by 'pure'gardnerella flora and elevated ph as an immediate result of an incidental unprotected coital act through neutralization of vaginal acid and replacement of  lactobacillus by gardnerella flora. a polymicrobial form of bv could be autoinfection of the post-coital physiological g. vaginalis flora, characterized  by a mixture of g. vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis and anaerobic bacteria at lower  vaginal acidity, possibly resulting from suppression of normal vaginal acidity through repeated sexual acts, with a resultant higher ph and transfer of enteric  bacteria from the perianal region. monobacterial and polymicrobial auto-infectious forms of bv may be clinically distinct and share a common origin. the understanding of bv as a basic physiological entity could influence the prophylaxis and treatment of the largely therapy-resistant polymicrobial bv.

TI  == [short - term combined 5-nitroimidazole treatment in vaginal dysbacteriosis with  dominant anaerobic species].
AB  == the aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of short-term, combined 5-nitroimidazole treatment in vaginal dysbacteriosis with dominant anaerobic species. the presence of infection was proven by microscopic examination of vaginal fluid (nugent, modified by ison-hay-keane scale), microbiological culture, and by clinical symptoms (amsel). 179 patients were included in our study. clinical and microbiological examinations were performed prior to the treatment and at the end of the study (day 8 after the first dose of short- term  combined 5-nitroimidazole treatment). the treatment included applications of 1 g  bid tinidazole for two days and vaginal suppositories of 1000mg metronidazol at day 1 and 3. based on the microbiological tests prior to the treatment gardnerella vaginalis alone was present in 132 patients (73.7%). the rest of the  patients, 47 or 26.3% of the treatment group, the infection was present by mixture of several anaerobic species. at the end of the treatment 83.2% of the treated population showed no clinical symptoms of dysbacteriosis, and 73.7% of the treated patients showed no dysbacteriosis in microbiological test results. based on the results mentioned above it was determined that the short-term combined 5-nitroimidazole therapy was effective in treatment of vaginal dysbacteriosis with dominant anaerobic species.

TI  == diagnosis of vaginal discharge by wet mount microscopy: a simple and underrated method.
AB  == vaginal discharge is highly variable in quality and quantity among different individuals, and even in the same individual during different periods of life. vaginal discharge is most commonly caused by infection with sexually transmitted  organisms or increased colonization by different facultative pathogenic microorganisms (i.e., gardnerella vaginalis). noninfectious causes of vaginal discharge are quite rare (10% noninfectious as compared to 90% infectious causes). most common in women with a vaginal infection is bacterial vaginosis (40%-50% of cases), followed by vulvovaginal candidosis (20%-25%), and then trichomoniasis (15%-20%). if infection is suspected as the primary cause, a sample of the vaginal discharge should be taken and examined microscopically. when evaluating vaginal secretions by phase-contrast wet mount microscopy, knowledge of what is normal versus abnormal is very important. knowledge of the sensitivity and specificity of wet mount microscopy in different clinical settings is also important. target audience: obstetricians & gynecologists, family physicians learning objectives: after completing this cme activity, physicians should be better able to evaluate lifetime changes in vaginal secretions, characterize the physiological and pathological appearance of vaginal discharge, assess the clinical practicality and usefulness of wet mount microscopy and use wet mount microscopy to diagnose bacterial vaginosis and other common vaginal infections.

TI  == artemisia princeps pamp. essential oil and its constituents eucalyptol and alpha-terpineol ameliorate bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis in mice by inhibiting bacterial growth and nf-kappab activation.
AB  == to investigate the inhibitory effects of artemisia princeps pamp. (family asteraceae) essential oil (apeo) and its main constituents against bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis, their antimicrobial activities against gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans in vitro and their anti-inflammatory effects against g. vaginalis-induced vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis were  examined in mice. apeo and its constituents eucalyptol and alpha-terpineol were found to inhibit microbe growths. alpha-terpineol most potently inhibited the growths of g. vaginalis and c. albicans with mic values of 0.06 and 0.125 % (v/v), respectively. the antimicrobial activity of alpha-terpineol was found to be comparable to that of clotrimazole. intravaginal treatment with apeo, eucalyptol, or alpha-terpineol significantly decreased viable g. vaginalis and c. albicans numbers in the vaginal cavity and myeloperoxidase activity in mouse vaginal tissues compared with controls. these agents also inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 beta, il-6, tnf- alpha), cox-2, inos, and the activation of nf- kappab and increased expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10. in addition, they inhibited the expressions of  proinflammatory cytokines and the activation of nf- kappab in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages, and alpha-terpineol most potently inhibited the expressions of proinflammatory cytokines and nf- kappab activation. based on these findings, apeo and its constituents, particularly alpha-terpineol, ameliorate bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis by inhibiting the growths of vaginal pathogens and the activation of nf- kappab.

TI  == the genital econiche: focus on microbiota and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == ecological and evolutionary forces shaping the normal and abnormal microflora of  the genital econiche are discussed, in particular those related to bacterial vaginosis, which worldwide is the most common vaginal infection, with numerous obstetrical and gynecological complications, including acquisition and transmission of hiv and other sexually transmitted infections (stis). characterized by a heavy overgrowth of gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobes  with no signs of inflammation, bacterial vaginosis has been regarded a microbiological and immunological enigma. immune tolerance to both normal and abnormal vaginal microbiota, mainly derived from gut microflora, as a result of coevolution with humans might explain the absence of inflammation, supported by short-chain fatty acids, known to modulate immune responses, that are produced in large quantities by anaerobes. recent studies have implicated the development of  a vaginal biofilm with gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae as main players in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. supporting this conclusion are data such as those demonstrating heavy growth of g. vaginalis and diversified anaerobes with numerous "clue cells" that are sloughing off from the biofilm. gardnerella and atopobium organisms attached to these clue cells can be demonstrated in the male genital econiche, likely reflecting a heterosexual transmission of the disorder.

AB  == hydrogen peroxide-producing lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from women's vaginas and their anti-inflammatory effects against gardnerella vaginalis-induced vaginosis were examined in beta-estradiol-immunosuppressed mice. oral and intravaginal treatment with five labs significantly decreased viable g. vaginalis numbers in vaginal cavities and myeloperoxidase activity in mouse vaginal tissues. of the labs examined, lactobacillus johnsonii hy7042 (lj) most potently  inhibited g. vaginalis-induced vaginosis. this lab also inhibited the expressions of il-1beta, il-6, tnf-alpha, cox-2, and inos, and the activation of nf-kappab in vaginal tissues, but increased il-10 expression. orally administered lj (0.2x10(8) cfu/mouse) also inhibited the expression of tnf-alpha by 91.7% in beta-estradiol-immunosuppressed mice intraperitoneally injected with lps. however, it increased il-10 expression by 63.3% in these mice. furthermore, lj inhibited the expressions of the pro-inflammatory cytokines, tnf-alpha and il-1beta, and the activation of nf-kappab in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages. lj also killed g. vaginalis attached with and without hela cells. these findings suggest that lj inhibits bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting the expressions of cox-2, inos, il-1beta, and tnf-alpha by regulating  nf-kappab activation and by killing g. vaginalis, and that lj could ameliorate bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == self-collected vaginal swabs for the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assay of atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis and the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using self-collected vaginal specimens for the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assays of bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacteria versus practitioner-collected swabs. a cross-sectional study included 190 pregnant women enrolled before 20 weeks' gestation from september 2008 to november 2009. self- and practitioner-collected swabs were taken during the same prenatal visit for each woman, qpcr assays performed for each, and the results compared. the quantification of the human albumin gene was used as an internal control to ensure sampling quality and accurate comparisons. the level of agreement of the qpcr assays for each microorganism was calculated with the spearman product moment correlation coefficient and the kappa statistic. in all, 370 vaginal samples (185 self- and 185 practitioner-collected swabs) had a narrow range of values for the number of albumin gene copies and a significant correlation coefficient (spearman's rho = 0.532; p < 0.001). the agreement between both sampling methods was excellent (spearman's rho was 0.748 for atopobium vaginae, 0.918 for lactobacillus species, 0.940 for gardnerella vaginalis; p < 0.001), especially for high concentrations of a. vaginae (>/=10(8) copies/ml; kappa value = 0.973; p < 0.001) and g. vaginalis (>/=10(9) copies/ml; kappa value = 0.903; p  < 0.001). this study demonstrates the validity and reliability of self- versus practitioner-collected swabs for the molecular quantification of lactobacillus species, g. vaginalis, and a. vaginae.

TI  == disruption of urogenital biofilms by lactobacilli.
AB  == the process that changes a relatively sparse vaginal microbiota of healthy women  into a dense biofilm of pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria is poorly  understood. likewise, the reverse step whereby an aberrant biofilm is displaced and returns to a healthy lactobacilli dominated microbiota is unclear. in order to study these phenomena, in vitro experiments were performed to examine the structure of biofilms associated with aerobic vaginosis, urinary tract infections, and bacterial vaginosis (bv). uropathogenic escherichia coli were able to form relatively thin biofilms within five days (6 mum height), while atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis formed thicker biofilms 12 mum in height within two days. challenge of e. coli biofilms with lactobacilli did not result in pathogen displacement. however, the resulting thicker lactobacilli infused biofilms, caused significant e. coli killing. e. coli biofilms challenged with secreted products of l. rhamnosus gr-1 caused a marked decrease in cell density, and increased cell death. similarly challenge of bv biofilms with lactobacilli infiltrated bv biofilms and caused bacterial cell death. metronidazole produced holes in the biofilm but did not eradicate the organisms.  the findings provide some evidence of how lactobacilli probiotics might interfere with an aberrant vaginal microbiota, and strengthen the position that combining probiotics with antimicrobials could better eradicate pathogenic biofilms.

TI  == hiv-infected women of burkina faso: a "reservoir" of mycoplasma infection.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this work was to assess the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and genital mycoplasma colonization in 251 hiv-positive  compared to 200 hiv-negative women at the maternal and child health (mch) service of saint camille medical center ouagadougou (burkina faso). methodology: after revealing the cervix with a speculum, we collected swabs of vaginal discharge for the detection of pathogenic bacteria. results: among hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, we identified respectively: mycoplasma hominis (16.7% versus  5.5%); ureaplasma urealyticum (16.3% versus 0.0%); co-infection m. hominis with u. urealyticum (13.14% versus 0.0%); candida albicans (21.11% versus 41.5%); e. coli (9.96% versus 4.0%); and the presence of abundant vaginal discharge (27.5% versus 5.0%) respectively. the nugent's score, utilized for the diagnosis of bv,  was significantly higher in hiv-positive women (p < 0.001) associated with poor vaginal hygiene practices (p < 0.01) and no use of condoms (p < 0.01). enterobacter, klebsiella pneumonia, klebsiella oxitocica, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis were also isolated, but in a low prevalence  ranging from 0% to 5%. conclusion: these results demonstrate that the hiv-positive women of burkina faso are frequently affected by bv and represent a  reservoir for mycoplasma infection. since these germs can lead to sterility and premature delivery, it is important to develop a policy of screening.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis comprises three distinct genotypes of which only two produce sialidase.
AB  == objective: sialidase and the presence of gardnerella vaginalis have been proposed as biomarkers for bacterial vaginosis. sialidase has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. we genotyped g vaginalis isolates, assessed the presence and diversity of sialidase-encoding genes, and determined the production of sialidase. study design: one hundred thirty-four g vaginalis isolates were genotyped by random amplified polymorphic deoxyribonucleic acid (rapd) and a selection of 29 isolates with amplified ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid restriction analysis (ardra). a g vaginalis sialidase quantitative polymerase chain reaction was developed, and the sialidase production was assessed with the  filter spot test. results: three g vaginalis genotypes could be distinguished by  both rapd and ardra. only 2 genotypes encoded and produced sialidase. conclusion: three genotypes exist among g vaginalis isolates, and there is a clear link between genotype and sialidase production. a possible link between sialidase production and (symptomatic) bacterial vaginosis and biofilm production can be hypothesized.

TI  == the prevalence of urogenital micro-organisms detected by a multiplex pcr-reverse  line blot assay in women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia.
AB  == this study used a previously described multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay to assess the prevalence and distribution of 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, mycoplasma hominis, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma parvum, ureaplasma urealyticum, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, and human adenovirus. first-voided urine specimens and endocervical and self-collected vaginal swabs from each of 216 women attending three sexual health clinics in sydney, australia, were tested and the results were compared with those of reference methods for each organism. one hundred and  sixty-eight women (77.7 %) had at least one and 105 (48.6 %) had more than one target organism, most commonly g. vaginalis and ureaplasma spp. the prevalence of each of the four known sexually transmissible pathogens was <5 %. of the 216 women, 111 (51.4 %) reported at least one symptom consistent with genital or urethral infection, including discharge, pain or discomfort. only g. vaginalis was detected more frequently in women with symptoms (p = 0.05). the specificity of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with that of the reference methods for each organism and for all specimen types was 100 %. the mean sensitivities of the mpcr/rlb assay compared with those of the reference methods for self-collected vaginal swabs, cervical swabs and first-voided urine specimens for all organisms  were 99.3, 98.1 and 84.6 %, respectively; however, these differences were not significant. there were no differences in sensitivities between specimen types for c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, t. vaginalis and h. influenzae, although all  were found infrequently. overall, the mpcr/rlb platform was found to be an accurate testing platform in a sexual health clinic setting.

TI  == damage to oviduct organ cultures by gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis is a gram-variable coccobacillus found in the lower genital tract, particularly of women. very large numbers are found in the vagina in bacterial vaginosis. the pathogenicity of g. vaginalis was studied using fallopian tubes and bovine oviducts in organ culture. whole organisms, whether piliated or not, from broth cultures caused the cilia on ciliated cells in the mucosa of either human or bovine oviducts to stop beating within 3 days or less.  cilia on control tissues kept beating for at least 5 days. organism-free filtrates from broth cultures, whether frozen and thawed or heat-treated, caused  the same effect, indicating the existence of a soluble toxin. histological sections revealed little damage, but scanning electron microscopy showed damage to the mucosal surface with some loss of ciliated cells. the toxin is not human tissue specific and, therefore, unlikely to be the same as the cytotoxin with haemolytic properties described by others. the toxin could play a part in the development of salpingitis if g. vaginalis organisms gained access to the upper tract in large numbers.

TI  == vaginal flora changes on pap smears after insertion of levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device.
AB  == background: the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (lng-ius) combines a uterine foreign body and the continuous release of low-dose levonorgestrel for contraception. its influence on the rate of vulvovaginal infections and flora disturbance is insufficiently known, but important for contraceptive advice in women, especially those who develop recurrent vaginosis or candida vulvovaginitis. study design: slides of 286 women who had a pap smear taken before and 1 to 2 years after placement of a lng-ius were blindly reviewed for the presence of abnormal vaginal flora (avf), bacterial vaginosis (bv), aerobic vaginitis (av) and candida vaginitis (cv). results: prior to insertion, there were no differences in vaginal flora abnormalities between women using different  kinds of contraception. lng-ius users did not have different rates of avf, bv, av or cv, but the general risk to develop any infection was increased. uterine bleeding after insertion did not seem to predict a different flora type. conclusion: we found that pap smears suggested more vaginal infections after 1 year of lng-ius use than prior to insertion of the device.

AB  == to compare the affirm vpiii molecular test (becton dickinson, burlington, nc) with morphologic identification used in routine papanicolaou (pap) test screening in the detection and identification of candida species, trichomonas vaginalis, and gardnerella vaginalis, we identified 431 cases with a concomitant pap test and affirm vpiii assay performed from the archives of a large academic institution. the study population consisted of women ranging in age from 17 to 79 years (mean and median ages, 33 and 31 years, respectively). with a routine pap test, 60 patients (13.9%) were found to have bacterial vaginosis, 60 (13.9%) candidiasis, and 3 (0.7%) trichomonas infection. with the affirm vpiii assay, 183 (42.5%) patients tested positive for g vaginalis, 70 (16.2%) positive for candida species, and 10 (2.3%) positive for t vaginalis. the differences were statistically significant. the results demonstrate that our patient population had a high incidence of bacterial vaginosis/candida vaginitis; however, the affirm vpiii was a more sensitive diagnostic test for the detection and identification of all 3 organisms compared with the pap test.

TI  == the aetiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common vaginal infection among women of childbearing age. this condition is notorious for causing severe complications related to the reproductive health of women. five decades of intense research established many risk factors for acquisition of bv; however, because of the complexity of bv and lack of a reliable animal model for this condition, its exact aetiology remains elusive. in this manuscript, we use a historical perspective to critically review the development of major theories on the aetiology of bv, ultimately implicating bv-related pathogens, healthy vaginal microbiota, bacteriophages and the immune response of the host. none of these theories on their own can reliably explain the epidemiological data. instead, bv  is caused by a complex interaction of multiple factors, which include the numerous components of the vaginal microbial ecosystem and their human host. many of these factors are yet to be characterized because a clear understanding of their relative contribution to the aetiology of bv is pivotal to the formulation  of an effective treatment for and prophylaxis of this condition.

TI  == in vitro activity of nifuratel on vaginal bacteria: could it be a good candidate  for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis?
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a shift of the physiological flora to a diverse spectrum of bacteria, where gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae are the most important markers. in this study, the antimicrobial activity of nifuratel against g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, and lactobacilli was compared with that of the two currently used antibiotics metronidazole and clindamycin. results suggest that nifuratel has a better spectrum of activity, being highly active against g. vaginalis and a. vaginae without affecting lactobacilli.

TI  == subtle perturbations of genital microflora alter mucosal immunity among low-risk  pregnant women.
AB  == objective: alteration in the vaginal flora has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. the objective of this study was to examine the impact of changes in individual microflora on genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women in early pregnancy. design: cross-sectional study. setting: large, tertiary care, academic hospital clinic. population: low-risk women were enrolled prior to 14 weeks' gestation. methods: women were included if they had no medical or previous obstetrical complications, were non-smokers, had no sexually transmitted infections and no intercourse in the last 48 hours. consenting women underwent speculum examination for collection of vaginal culture and dacron swabs for cytokine analysis. semi-quantitative vaginal cultures were performed in a reference laboratory. main outcome measures: concentrations of immune mediators were compared in the presence of various organisms. concentrations were converted to multiples of the median to standardize the values of each mediator. regression analyses were performed to control for race. results: we enrolled 47 women. the frequencies of genital microorganisms were: h(2)o(2) -producing lactobacilli (70%), ureaplasma urealyticum (66%), gardnerella vaginalis (45%), anaerobic non-pigmented gram-negative rods (anpgnr, 40%), anaerobic pigmented gram-negative rods (apgnr, 17%). after adjusting for race and body mass index, interleukin-1beta, interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte  macrophage-colony stimulating factor were increased in the presence of g. vaginalis, anpgnr, and apgnr. there was no consistent impact on the other markers of immune activation. conclusion: the presence of individual species impacts genital immunity among low-risk pregnant women. perturbations in genital immunity could partially explain heterogeneity in adverse pregnancy outcomes.

TI  == influence of menstruation on the microbiota of healthy women's labia minora as analyzed using a 16s rrna gene-based clone library method.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the influence of menstruation on the bacterial population of healthy japanese women's vulvas, especially the labia minora. labia minora swabs were obtained from 10 premenopausal, nonpregnant japanese women at premenstruation and on day 2 of menstruation. vaginal swabs were also obtained from 3 out of the 10 women. no significant difference was found in the average bacterial cell count between the menstruation and premenstruation samples. molecular analysis using a 16s rrna gene-based clone library method detected 22 genera from the labia minora swabs (total 20), with the genus lactobacillus being predominant at both premenstruation and during menstruation in 7 out of the 10 women. of the other 3 women, 2 showed various kinds of bacterial species, including oral and fecal bacteria, with atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis predominating in the remaining woman's vulva in both conditions. in total, 6 out of 10 cases (60%) showed significantly different microbiota of the labia minora between the two conditions. these results imply that menstruation may promote a distortion of the bacterial flora around the vulva, although it causes no significant increase of the bacterial count.

TI  == inhibitory activity of thymol on native and mature gardnerella vaginalis biofilms: in vitro study.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most frequent diagnosis made in women with lower  genital tract symptoms. it has recently been observed that 90 % of subjects with  bv show the growth of bacteria in the form of biofilms as against only 10% without bv, and that gardnerella vaginalis was the predominant species. the propensity of g. vaginalis to form biofilm is clinically relevant because this form of growth allows it to tolerate higher concentrations of certain antibiotics, thus increasing the possibilty of recurrent bv even after apparently curative therapy. the aim of this study was to investigate whether thymol (cas 89-83-8), a molecule present in thyme essential oil, that is credited with having a series of pharmacological properties including antimicrobial and antifungal effects, can interfere with newly formed and mature g. vaginalis biofilms. the ability of g. vaginalis atcc 49145 and two g. vaginalis strains isolated from human bv to form biofilm in flat-bottomed 96-well microtitre plates was verified, and the effects of thymol concentrations ranging from 1 to 1/16 mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) on preformed and mature biofilms was investigated by means of spectrophotometric analysis, nomarski interference contrast microscopy,  and fluorescence microscopy with live-dead cell visualisation (syto 9 and propidium iodide). native biofilm was inhibited by concentrations ranging from 1  mic to 1/8 mic (32.77% +/- 2.37 to 11.39% +/- 1.46), and mature biofilm was inhibited by concentrations ranging from 1 mic to 1/4 mic (26.18% +/- 1.36 to 13.20% +/- 1.44). nomarski interference contrast and fluorescence microscopy visually confirmed these findings. as biofilm is a multi-factorial phenomenon, the multiple mechanisms of thymol may act on different steps in the evolution of  mature biofilm.

TI  == inerolysin, a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin produced by lactobacillus iners.
AB  == lactobacillus iners is a common constituent of the human vaginal microbiota. this species was only recently characterized due to its fastidious growth requirements and has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis. here we present the identification and molecular characterization of a protein toxin produced by l. iners. the l. iners genome encodes an open reading frame with significant primary sequence similarity to intermedilysin (ily; 69.2%  similarity) and vaginolysin (vly; 68.4% similarity), the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins from streptococcus intermedius and gardnerella vaginalis, respectively. clinical isolates of l. iners produce this protein, inerolysin (iny), during growth in vitro, as assessed by western analysis. iny is a pore-forming toxin that is activated by reducing agents and inhibited by excess cholesterol. it is active across a ph range of 4.5 to 6.0 but is inactive at ph 7.4. at sublytic concentrations, iny activates p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and allows entry of fluorescent phalloidin into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells. unlike vly and ily, which are human specific, iny is active against cells from a broad range of species. iny represents a new target for studies directed at understanding the role of l. iners in states of health and disease at the vaginal mucosal surface.

TI  == bacterial species present in the lower male genital tract: a five-year retrospective study.
AB  == objectives: to identify bacterial species present in the lower genital tract of males and to investigate the relationship with semen quality. methods: the microscopic analyses and cultures of 696 semen specimens, collected over five years from males investigated for subfertility, were retrospectively assessed. results: semen cultures were sterile in 48%; they showed a polymicrobial flora (more than two bacterial species) in 30%, and were positive (>1 x 10(3) colony forming units/ml) in 22% of the cases. gardnerella vaginalis was the most frequently isolated bacterium, followed by escherichia coli and enterococcus sp.  ureaplasma urealyticum was recovered from 13 of 147 samples (9%). of patients with bacteriospermia 42% had leukospermia (>10(6) leukocytes/ml of semen). bacteriospermia and leukospermia did not correlate with each other although a positive correlation was found between the presence of leukocytes and g. vaginalis isolation. semen parameters were correlated with the bacterial species  isolated most frequently. in comparison with controls, sperm concentration, motility and morphology were mostly deteriorated in the presence of g. vaginalis  and u. urealyticum. conclusions: positive seminal fluid cultures must be interpreted with caution, taking into account both raised colony counts of single isolates and leukocyte concentration in the semen. thus the common misdiagnosis of genital tract infection, based on the presence of seminal bacteria, and unnecessary treatment with antibiotics may be avoided.

TI  == tinidazole in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the commonest cause of vaginal discharge in women of  childbearing age. oral metronidazole has long been established as an effective therapy in the treatment of bv. however, adverse effects due to metronidazole are frequent and this may lead to problems with adherence to a 7-day course of treatment and subsequently result in treatment failure. oral tinidazole has been  used to treat bacterial vaginosis for over 25 years but in a number of different  dosage regimens. placebo controlled trials have consistently shown increases in cure rate with tinidazole. longer courses of treatment (eg, 1 g daily for 5 days) appear to be more effective than a 2 g oral single dose. comparative studies suggest that oral tinidazole is equivalent to oral metronidazole, intravaginal clindamycin cream, and intravaginal metronidazole tablets, in efficacy in treating bv. however, tinidazole has a more favorable side effect profile than oral metronidazole notably with better gastrointestinal tolerability and less metallic taste. bacterial vaginosis is associated with high rates of recurrence and appropriate management of such recurrences can prove difficult. recurrent bv  has been linked with persistence of gardnerella vaginalis after treatment; however the clinical implications of the possible greater activity of tinidazole  against g. vaginalis are not yet clear. repeated courses of oral metronidazole may be poorly tolerated and an alternative but equally effective treatment that is better tolerated may be preferable. in comparison to oral metronidazole, cost  is clearly an issue as oral metronidazole is considerably cheaper and available in generic form. however where avoidance of oral metronidazole is necessary because of side effects, oral tinidazole is a cost-effective alternative.

TI  == gardnerella biofilm involves females and males and is transmitted sexually.
AB  == objective: to study the incidence and distribution of adherent gardnerella vaginalis. methods: bacteria adherent to desquamated epithelial cells in the urine were detected using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish). urine from patients with bacterial vaginosis (bv, n = 20), their partners (n = 10) and different control populations (n = 344) including pregnant women and their partners, randomly selected populations of hospitalized man, women and children as also healthy controls was investigated. results: gardnerella was found in two  different forms: cohesive and dispersed. in the cohesive form, gardnerella were attached to the epithelial cells in groups of highly concentrated bacteria. in the dispersed form, solitary gardnerella were intermixed with other bacterial groups. cohesive gardnerella was present in all patients with proven bv and their partners, in 7% of men and 13% of women hospitalized for reasons other than bv, in 16% of pregnant women and 12% of their male partners, and in none of the healthy laboratory staff or children. in sexual partners, occurrence of cohesive  gardnerella was clearly linked. dispersed gardnerella were found in 10-18% of randomly selected females, 3-4% of males and 10% of children and not sexually linked. in daily longitudinal investigations over 4 weeks no transition between cohesive and dispersed gardnerella and vice versa was observed. transmission of a cohesive gardnerella strain could be followed retrospectively over 15 years using molecular genetic methods. conclusions: cohesive gardnerella biofilm is a distinct, clearly definable entity which involves both genders and is sexually transmitted. the correct name distinguishing it from symptom-defined conditions like bv should be gardnerellosis and for the bacterium gardnerella genitalis.

TI  == response of gardnerella vaginalis biofilm to 5 days of moxifloxacin treatment.
AB  == polymicrobial communities are often recalcitrant to antibiotics. we tested whether the polymicrobial gardnerella vaginalis biofilm can be eradicated with moxifloxacin. twenty women with bacterial vaginosis were treated with 400 mg moxifloxacin for 5 days. the changes in the occurrence and proportions of gardnerella, atopobium and lactobacillus spp. were assessed using fish. the bacterial biofilm was investigated using desquamated epithelial cells of spontaneously voided urine and sections of vaginal biopsies. fifteen of 20 women  showed a significant and sustained clinical response to moxifloxacin according to amsel and nugent criteria. the concentrations of adherent bacteria decreased significantly. the incidence and proportion of atopobium declined sustainably. the proportions of lactobacillus in the biofilm mass increased following therapy. initially, gardnerella was the main component of the polymicrobial biofilm. following treatment, gardnerella was not accessible to fish in the urine and vaginal samples of 75% of all women. ten to 12 weeks after the end of therapy, gardnerella biofilm was cumulatively present in 40%. this was not due to newly acquired disease, but due to reactivation of the persisting, but biochemically inactive biofilm. despite clear clinical efficacy, and initially definite suppression of the biofilm, moxifloxacin was, similar to metronidazole, not able  to eradicate the gardnerella vaginalis biofilm in all patients.

TI  == comparative genomics of gardnerella vaginalis strains reveals substantial differences in metabolic and virulence potential.
AB  == background: gardnerella vaginalis is described as a common vaginal bacterial species whose presence correlates strongly with bacterial vaginosis (bv). here we report the genome sequencing and comparative analyses of three strains of g. vaginalis. strains 317 (atcc 14019) and 594 (atcc 14018) were isolated from the vaginal tracts of women with symptomatic bv, while strain 409-05 was isolated from a healthy, asymptomatic individual with a nugent score of 9. principal findings: substantial genomic rearrangement and heterogeneity were observed that  appeared to have resulted from both mobile elements and substantial lateral gene  transfer. these genomic differences translated to differences in metabolic potential. all strains are equipped with significant virulence potential, including genes encoding the previously described vaginolysin, pili for cytoadhesion, eps biosynthetic genes for biofilm formation, and antimicrobial resistance systems, we also observed systems promoting multi-drug and lantibiotic extrusion. all g. vaginalis strains possess a large number of genes that may enhance their ability to compete with and exclude other vaginal colonists. these  include up to six toxin-antitoxin systems and up to nine additional antitoxins lacking cognate toxins, several of which are clustered within each genome. all strains encode bacteriocidal toxins, including two lysozyme-like toxins produced  uniquely by strain 409-05. interestingly, the bv isolates encode numerous proteins not found in strain 409-05 that likely increase their pathogenic potential. these include enzymes enabling mucin degradation, a trait previously described to strongly correlate with bv, although commonly attributed to non-g. vaginalis species. conclusions: collectively, our results indicate that all three strains are able to thrive in vaginal environments, and therein the bv isolates are capable of occupying a niche that is unique from 409-05. each strain has significant virulence potential, although genomic and metabolic differences, such as the ability to degrade mucin, indicate that the detection of g. vaginalis in the vaginal tract provides only partial information on the physiological potential of the organism.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis versus the standard methods, the amsel criteria and the nugent score. the amsel criteria, the nugent score, and results from the molecular tool were obtained independently from vaginal samples of 163 pregnant women who reported abnormal vaginal symptoms before 20 weeks gestation. to determine the performance of the molecular tool, we calculated the kappa value, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. either or  both of the amsel criteria (>/=3 criteria) and the nugent score (score >/=7) indicated that 25 women (15%) had bacterial vaginosis, and the remaining 138 women did not. dna levels of gardnerella vaginalis or atopobium vaginae exceeded  10(9) copies/ml or 10(8) copies/ml, respectively, in 34 (21%) of the 163 samples. complete agreement between both reference methods and high concentrations of g. vaginalis and a. vaginae was found in 94.5% of women (154/163 samples, kappa value = 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.70-0.81). the nine samples with discordant results were categorized as intermediate flora by the nugent score. the molecular tool predicted bacterial vaginosis with a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 93%, a positive predictive value of 73%, and a negative predictive value of 100%. the quantitative real-time pcr assay shows excellent agreement with the results of both reference methods for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.

AB  == background: women living with hiv and co-infected with bacterial vaginosis (bv) are at higher risk for transmitting hiv to a partner or newborn. it is poorly understood which bacterial communities constitute bv or the normal vaginal microbiota among this population and how the microbiota associated with bv responds to antibiotic treatment. methods and findings: the vaginal microbiota of 132 hiv positive tanzanian women, including 39 who received metronidazole treatment for bv, were profiled using illumina to sequence the v6 region of the 16s rrna gene. of note, gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus iners were detected in each sample constituting core members of the vaginal microbiota. eight major clusters were detected with relatively uniform microbiota compositions. two clusters dominated by l. iners or l. crispatus were strongly associated with a normal microbiota. the l. crispatus dominated microbiota were associated with low ph, but when l. crispatus was not present, a large fraction of l. iners was required to predict a low ph. four clusters were strongly associated with bv, and were dominated by prevotella bivia, lachnospiraceae, or a mixture of different species. metronidazole treatment reduced the microbial diversity and perturbed the bv-associated microbiota, but rarely resulted in the  establishment of a lactobacilli-dominated microbiota. conclusions: illumina based microbial profiling enabled high though-put analyses of microbial samples at a high phylogenetic resolution. the vaginal microbiota among women living with hiv  in sub-saharan africa constitutes several profiles associated with a normal microbiota or bv. recurrence of bv frequently constitutes a different bv-associated profile than before antibiotic treatment.

TI  == cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.
AB  == the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) are part of a large family of pore-forming proteins that include the human proteins perforin and the complement membrane attack complex. the activity of all family members is focused on membranes, but the proteins are themselves involved in a diverse range of phenomena. an overview of some of these phenomena is provided here, along with an historical perspective of cdcs themselves and how our understanding of their mechanism of action has developed over the years. the way in which pore formation depends on specific characteristics of the membrane under attack as well as of the protein doing the attacking is emphasised. the cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs) have been the focus of a renewed keen research interest for over ten years now. their importance has been even further enhanced by the homology now identified between them and the membrane attack complex/perforin (macpf) family of proteins, which includes several components of the complement cascade as well as perforin itself. in this chapter i aim to provide an overview  of our understanding of the interaction between cdcs and other members of what is now called the macpf/cdc superfamily, with their target membranes. cdcs (also in  the past known as thiol-activated toxins or cholesterol-binding toxins) were originally identified from four gram-positive bacterial genera (clostridium, listeria, bacillus and streptococcus). well-known examples include listeriolysin, perfringolysin, streptolysin and pneumoysin. listeriolysin from l. monocytogenes  is responsible for the escape of bacteria from the phagosome to colonise the cytoplasm and has been applied as a protein adjuvant in the development of vaccines against cancer and tuberculosis, for example. perfringolysin from c. perfringens (fig. 1a) has become perhaps the most studied cdc4 and has an important role in pathology associated with infection (gangrene). streptolysin from s. pyogenes is another intensely studied cdc and has been applied widely in  experimental permeabilisation of biological membranes. pneumolysin is a major virulence determinant for s. pneumoniae, allowing bacterial invasion of tissues and mediating inflammation and the activation of the complement cascade. however, cdcs have now, for example, been identified in the bacteria arcanobacterium pyogenes and gardnerella vaginalis and there also appear to be homologues outside prokaryotes such as the sea anemone metridium senile pore-forming toxin metridiolysin. the homology with the macpf family was unknown until the first structures of the canonical fold of that family were solved, revealing the now characteristic macpf/cdc fold of a twisted 3-sheet around which helices are clustered (fig. 1a and d). without any significant other sequence homology, the fold of this superfamily of pore-forming and membrane-binding proteins has been conserved by compensatory mutation around a handful of key conserved glycines. the glycines presumably act as critical hinges during the dramatic refolding that cdcs are known to undergo and which is presumably the selective advantage of this specific structure that has caused it to be conserved over such a vast evolutionary timescale. while not all macpf domains are involved in pore formation-for example, c6 and c8beta--they are all apparently involved in action  on membranes. the dramatic refolding undergone by cdcs is tightly coupled to their oligomerisation and results in the conversion of the helices hemming the core 3-sheet of the macpf/cdc domain into a pair of beta-hairpins which in tandem and alongside those from other subunits within the oligomer insert into the membrane to create a pore (fig. 1a-c). it is obviously the basic assumption that  where noncdc members of the superfamily-such as complement proteins and perforin-act on membranes they do so by a mechanism involving similar refolding.58 even where a member of the macpf/cdc superfamily is not known to form a pore, or has been shown not to-at least alone-the same conformational change could have other adaptive functions during activity on or at membranes. however, the bicomponent nature of some pore-forming toxins alerts us that showing an absence of activity for one pure protein does not mean that they do not contribute to pore formation quite directly, since that may require the presence of another macpf/cdc family member or members from the same specific system. complement acts by a combination of the c5b-8 complex of proteins preassembled on a target membrane recruiting c9 to form a lesion, which may be a  complete ring of c9 associated with the c5b-8 or an arc-electron microscopy images show both possibilities.perforin acts in concert with granzymes, to trigger apoptosis when delivered by cytotoxic cells at their targets (damaged, transformed and infected host cells). incomplete rings are visible for perforin also and there are many unresolved issues concerning its mechanism and the dependence ofgranzymes on it for their delivery.

TI  == efficacy of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study.
AB  == objective: we assessed the effectiveness of vaginal probiotic capsules for recurrent bacterial vaginosis (bv) prevention. study design: one hundred twenty healthy chinese women with a history of recurrent bv were assigned randomly to daily vaginal prophylaxis with 1 capsule (probaclac vaginal; nicar laboratories,  inc, blainville, quebec, canada) that contained 8 billion colony-forming units of lactobacillus rhamnosus, l acidophilus, and streptococcus thermophilus (n = 58 women) or 1 placebo capsule (n = 62 women) for 7 days on, 7 days off, and 7 days  on. results: probiotic prophylaxis resulted in lower recurrence rates for bv (15.8% [9/57 women] vs 45.0% [27/60 women]; p < .001) and gardnerella vaginalis incidence through 2 months (3.5% [2/57 women] vs 18.3% [11/60 women]; p = .02). between the 2- and 11-month follow-up period, women who received probiotics reported a lower incidence of bv and g vaginalis. aside from vaginal discharge and malodor, no adverse events were reported in either study group. conclusion: short-term probiotic prophylaxis is well tolerated and reduces bv recurrence and  g vaginalis risk through 11 months after treatment.

TI  == dissimilarity in the occurrence of bifidobacteriaceae in vaginal and perianal microbiota in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == recent data point at the similarity between the perianal and vaginal microflora in terms of lactobacillus species involved. bacterial vaginosis, the most common  perturbation of the vaginal microflora involving primarily overgrowth of gardnerella vaginalis, has also been suggested to involve a recto-vaginal pathway. we addressed this issue with regard to bacteria of the bifidobacteriaceae family. in particular, we investigated the putative concordance of the presence of g. vaginalis and a series of bifidobacteria between the perianal and vaginal microflora in 10 patients with bacterial vaginosis through multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of desquamated epithelial cells. g. vaginalis was found in a biofilm mode of growth  at the perianal and vaginal sites. in most women at least one of the following species was detected perianally: bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breves, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. at the vaginal site, none of these bifidobacteria was found. we conclude that bacterial vaginosis does not occur as a result of simple growth per continuum of perianal bacteria. only some species originating from the intestinal tract do display pronounced vaginotropism, like g. vaginalis, whereas many other  species do not.

TI  == an antimicrobial investigation of plants used traditionally in southern africa to treat sexually transmitted infections.
AB  == aim of the study: eighteen plants were assessed for antimicrobial activity against pathogens associated with prevalent urogenital/sexually transmitted infections. plant selection was based on information obtained from the ethnobotanical literature. materials and methods: dried plant material was submerged in a 1:1 mixture of methanol and dichloromethane for 24 h. aqueous extracts were prepared by submerging dried plant material in sterile distilled water for 24 h followed by lyophilization. essential oils were distilled from the two aromatic plant species (tarchonanthus camphoratus and croton gratissimus). antimicrobial activity was assessed using the micro-well minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) assay with specific modifications to facilitate fastidious growth of pathogens. results: tarchonanthus camphoratus (solvent extract) showed  the most significant broad spectrum activity with mic values ranging between 0.50 and 0.70 mg/ml against five of the six pathogens tested. other noteworthy activity was found for hypericum aethiopicum (root) at 0.3 mg/ml (neisseria gonorrhoeae).polygala fruticosa and the solvent root extract of hypericum aethiopicum showed highest sensitivities towards gardnerella vaginalis at 0.2 mg/ml. efficacy of the solvent extracts against the pathogen oligella ureolytica  demonstrated antimicrobial activity (mic values <or=1.0 mg/ml) for seven plant species. the highest activity noted against ureaplasma urealyticum was for psidium guajava (solvent extract) at 0.8 mg/ml. in general the aqueous extracts displayed mostly poor anti-sti activity. the most noteworthy susceptibility for the aqueous extracts was noted with the plant extract syzygium cordatum (mic value 0.1 mg/ml against candida albicans). the most noteworthy activity for the essential oils was observed for tarchonanthus camphoratus (0.8 mg/ml) against oligella ureolytica. conclusions: antimicrobial activity was observed for a number of the plant samples against at least one or more pathogen, thus validating the ethnobotanical use as an anti-infective to treat sexually transmitted diseases.

TI  == chronic vulvitis in pre-pubertal girls.
AB  == pre-pubertal girls with inflammatory chronic vulval disease excluding lichen sclerosus are often described as having 'non-specific vulvovaginitis'. the aim of this retrospective case series was to determine the aetiology of chronic vulvovaginitis in pre-pubertal (tanner stage 1) girls, with particular reference  to candidiasis. a chart review recorded and compared the characteristics of 38 girls and 68 post-menarchal adolescents and pre-menopausal women with chronic vulvitis. nineteen (50%) of the pre-pubertal children had been previously diagnosed with candidiasis and 21 (55%) had been treated unsuccessfully with topical antifungal agents. candida albicans was isolated in two (5%) of the children and 37 (54%) of the adults (p < 0.001). a positive candida culture was causally associated with chronic vulvovaginitis in 50% of the adults but in none  of the children (p < 0.001). in 28 (74%) of the children and 28 (41%) of the adults, no pathogens were isolated on microbiological testing. general skin examination of the girls revealed signs of psoriasis in 27 (71%) and atopic dermatitis in nine (24%). symptoms were controlled with topical anti-inflammatory treatment and environmental modification, including cessation of topical antifungals. pre-pubertal girls with chronic vulvitis are likely to have either psoriasis or atopic dermatitis. chronic vulvovaginal candidiasis is not seen in tanner stage 1 girls.

TI  == drawing the line between commensal and pathogenic gardnerella vaginalis through genome analysis and virulence studies.
AB  == background: worldwide, bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common vaginal disorder. it is associated with risk for preterm birth and hiv infection. the etiology of the condition has been debated for nearly half a century and the lack of knowledge about its cause and progression has stymied efforts to improve therapy and prevention. gardnerella vaginalis was originally identified as the causative agent, but subsequent findings that it is commonly isolated from seemingly healthy women cast doubt on this claim. recent studies shedding light on the virulence properties of g. vaginalis, however, have drawn the species back into the spotlight. results: in this study, we sequenced the genomes of a strain  of g. vaginalis from a healthy woman, and one from a woman with bacterial vaginosis. comparative analysis of the genomes revealed significant divergence and in vitro studies indicated disparities in the virulence potential of the two  strains. the commensal isolate exhibited reduced cytotoxicity and yet the cytolysin proteins encoded by the two strains were nearly identical, differing at a single amino acid, and were transcribed at similar levels. the bv-associated strain encoded a different variant of a biofilm associated protein gene and demonstrated greater adherence, aggregation, and biofilm formation. using filters with different pore sizes, we found that direct contact between the bacteria and  epithelial cells is required for cytotoxicity. conclusions: the results indicated that contact is required for cytotoxicity and suggested that reduced cytotoxicity in the commensal isolate could be due to impaired adherence. this study outlines  two distinct genotypic variants of g. vaginalis, one apparently commensal and one pathogenic, and presents evidence for disparate virulence potentials.

TI  == antagonism and synergism in gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == antagonistic and synergistic substances are important for interactions between micro-organisms associated with human body surfaces, either in healthy or in diseased conditions. in the present study, such compounds produced by gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) were detected in vitro and the antagonistic ones were partially characterized. among 11 g. vaginalis strains tested, all showed antagonistic activity against at least one of the 22 indicator bacteria assayed. interestingly, for some of these strains, antagonism reverted to synergism, favouring one of the indicator strains (peptostreptococcus anaerobius) when the growth medium was changed. partial characterization of antagonistic substances suggested a bacteriocin-like chemical nature. depending on growth conditions, g. vaginalis isolated from women with bv  produced antagonistic or synergistic compounds for other bacterial components of  the vaginal ecosystem. this is the first report to our knowledge of the production of antagonistic and/or synergistic substances by g. vaginalis. this ability may be a pivotal factor in understanding bv and the ecological role of this bacterium in the vaginal environment.

TI  == diagnosis of vulvovaginitis: comparison of clinical and microbiological diagnosis.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the present study was to compare the current diagnostic clinical and laboratory approaches to women with vulvovaginal discharge complaint. the secondary outcomes were to determine the prevalence of infections  in our setting and to look for the relation between vulvovaginal infections and predisposing factors if present. method: premenopausal women applying to our gynecology outpatient clinic with vaginal discharge complaint were enrolled prospectively into the study. each patient evaluated clinically with direct observation of vaginal secretions, wet mount examination, whiff test, vaginal ph  testing and chlamydia rapid antigen test. each patient also evaluated microbiologically with vaginal discharge culture and gram staining. clinical diagnosis was compared with the microbiological diagnosis (the gold standard). diagnostic accuracy was measured with sensitivity, specificity, positive (ppv) and negative predictive values (npv). results: 460 patients were included in the  study. 89.8% of patients received a clinical diagnosis whereas only 36% of them had microbiological diagnosis. the sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv of clinical diagnosis over microbiological culture results were 95, 13, 38, 82%, respectively. the most commonly encountered microorganisms by culture were candida species (17.4%) and gardnerella vaginalis (10.2%). clinically, the most commonly made diagnoses were mixed infection (34.1%), bacterial vaginosis (32.4%) and fungal infection (14.1%). symptoms did not predict laboratory results. predisposing factors (dm, vaginal douching practice, presence of iud and usage of oral contraceptive pills) were not found to be statistically important influencing factors for vaginal infections. conclusion: clinical diagnosis based  on combining symptoms with office-based testing improves diagnostic accuracy but  is insufficient. the most effective approach also incorporates laboratory testing as an adjunct when a diagnosis is in question or treatment is failing.

TI  == temporal variability of human vaginal bacteria and relationship with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: little is known about short-term bacterial fluctuations in the human  vagina. this study used pcr to assess the variability in concentrations of key vaginal bacteria in healthy women and the immediate response to antibiotic treatment in women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). methodology/principal findings: twenty-two women assessed for bv using amsel's criteria were evaluated daily for  7 or 14 days, then at 2, 3 and 4 weeks, using a panel of 11 bacterium-specific quantitative pcr assays. participants with bv were treated with 5 days of intravaginal metronidazole. participants without bv had vaginal biotas dominated  by lactobacilli, whose levels fluctuated with menses. with onset of menstruation, quantities of lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus crispatus decreased and were found to be inversely related to gardnerella vaginalis concentrations (p<0.001). women with bv had a variety of fastidious bacteria whose concentrations dropped below detection thresholds 1-5 days after starting metronidazole. recurrent bv was characterized by initial profound decreases of bv-associated bacteria after treatment followed by subsequent increases at relapse. conclusions/significance: the microbiota of the human vagina can be highly dynamic. healthy women are colonized with lactobacillus species, but levels can change dramatically over a month. marked increases in g. vaginalis were observed during menses. participants with bv have diverse communities of fastidious bacteria that are depleted by vaginal metronidazole therapy. women with recurrent bv initially respond to antibiotic treatment with steep declines in bacterial concentrations, but these bacteria later reemerge, suggesting that antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is not an important factor mediating bv recurrence.

TI  == gardnerella, trichomonas vaginalis, candida, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum in the genital discharge of symptomatic fertile and asymptomatic infertile women.
AB  == this study aimed to establish the different prevalence of the microorganisms investigated in the two groups considered: fertile women with symptoms and asymptomatic women with infertility problems. the data from women (n= 952) investigated for two years for quality of genital discharge and the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, streptococcus agalactiae, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyiticum and chlamydia trachomatis were retrospectively analyzed. in the population of fertile women with symptoms the microrganisms most frequently involved are gardnerella vaginalis (26.6%), candida species (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (9.2%). the genital discharges of asymptomatic women with infertility problems are characterized by a prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis (19.7%), enterobacteriaceae or enterococci (12.1%) and streptococcus agalactiae (8.6%). the reduction of vaginal lactobacilli flora and the presence of an elevated number of polymorphonucleates  in the vaginal discharge are important parameters to consider for the evaluation  of the health status of the human female urogenital tract. our results indicate that is important to culture the vaginal discharge for streptococcus agalactiae and for prevalence of enterobacteriaceae and enterococci. lastly, the reasons for the prevalence of some microorganisms (gardnerella vaginalis, enterobacteriaceae  and enterococci, streptococcus agalactiae) in the population of infertile asymptomatic women need to be better analyzed especially after the recent studies correlating idiopathic infertility with the presence of cervical cytokines in women with an abnormal vaginal flora.

AB  == objective: to establish the percentage of infections in postmenopausal women with urinary symptoms which can be confirmed by microbiological analysis, the most common causative agents and whether the urethra and vagina in patients with cystitis are concurrently colonized by pathogenic microorganisms. methods: laboratories of the croatian national institute of public health in zagreb, in the period of two years, analyzed 245 samples taken from patients with urinary symptoms who had been postmenopausal at least for a year. urine samples, as well  as urethral and vaginal swabs were taken from each patient and tested for causative agents of urogenital infections, genital mycoplasma and chlamydia trachomatis. results: cystitis was confirmed by microbiological analysis in 31.4% women, urethritis in 24.8%, and vaginitis in 15.1%. the most common causative agent of urethritis was ureaplasma urealyticum, while gardnerella vaginalis was the most common in vaginal infections. e. coli was concurrently isolated in urine, urethral and vaginal samples in 65.1% of patients with e. coli cystitis, while streptococcus agalactiae was isolated in urethral and vaginal samples in each patient with streptococcus agalactiae cystitis. conclusion: mucosal colonization of the urethra and vagina contributes to the incidence of cystitis in postmenopausal women. microbiological diagnostics is necessary to distinguish  between the symptoms of ageing of the urogenital system and infection, with a view to preventing unnecessary antibiotic therapy.

TI  == the epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis in relation to sexual behaviour.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) has been most consistently linked to sexual  behaviour, and the epidemiological profile of bv mirrors that of established sexually transmitted infections (stis). it remains a matter of debate however whether bv pathogenesis does actually involve sexual transmission of pathogenic micro-organisms from men to women. we therefore made a critical appraisal of the  literature on bv in relation to sexual behaviour. discussion: g. vaginalis carriage and bv occurs rarely with children, but has been observed among adolescent, even sexually non-experienced girls, contradicting that sexual transmission is a necessary prerequisite to disease acquisition. g. vaginalis carriage is enhanced by penetrative sexual contact but also by non-penetrative digito-genital contact and oral sex, again indicating that sex per se, but not necessarily coital transmission is involved. several observations also point at female-to-male rather than at male-to-female transmission of g. vaginalis, presumably explaining the high concordance rates of g. vaginalis carriage among couples. male antibiotic treatment has not been found to protect against bv, condom use is slightly protective, whereas male circumcision might protect against bv. bv is also common among women-who-have-sex-with-women and this relates at least in part to non-coital sexual behaviours. though male-to-female transmission cannot be ruled out, overall there is little evidence that bv acts as an std. rather, we suggest bv may be considered a sexually enhanced disease (sed), with frequency of intercourse being a critical factor. this may relate to  two distinct pathogenetic mechanisms: (1) in case of unprotected intercourse alkalinisation of the vaginal niche enhances a shift from lactobacilli-dominated  microflora to a bv-like type of microflora and (2) in case of unprotected and protected intercourse mechanical transfer of perineal enteric bacteria is enhanced by coitus. a similar mechanism of mechanical transfer may explain the consistent link between non-coital sexual acts and bv. similar observations supporting the sed pathogenetic model have been made for vaginal candidiasis and  for urinary tract infection. summary: though male-to-female transmission cannot be ruled out, overall there is incomplete evidence that bv acts as an sti. we believe however that bv may be considered a sexually enhanced disease, with frequency of intercourse being a critical factor.

AB  == background: this study aimed to define the occurrence of different organisms causing vulvovaginitis; to evaluate different laboratory methods used for diagnosis of trichomonas vaginalis (t. vaginalis); and to evaluate the direct score system and clue cell method compared with culture for diagnosis of bacterial and t. vaginalis vaginosis. methodology: clinical and laboratory evaluations were performed for 110 patients. laboratory methods used for bacteriological diagnosis were direct gram staining for clue cells and scoring by nugent score system and bacterial culture. t. vaginalis was identified by wet mount microscopic examination, culture, direct gram, giemsa staining and acridine orange (ao). results: the nugent score method revealed that the sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of vaginal discharge by direct rapid microscopic methods were 30% and 80% and for clue cells sensitivity and specificity were 37%  and 75% respectively for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis compared to culture. for diagnosis of t. vaginalis, the nugent score method revealed that the sensitivity and specificity were 60% and 90% respectively, and for clue cells 75% and 80% respectively. for microcopic methods used for t. vaginalis only, the gram stain and giemsa stain sensitivities were poor (15.2% and 48.5%, respectively). wet mount showed reasonable sensitivity of 75.8%. acridine orange sensitivity was 93.9% and specificity was 97.5%, conclusion: prevalent pathogens associated with  vaginitis were (gardnerella vaginalis) g. vaginalis, t. vaginalis and mycoplasma  hominis (m. hominis). wet mount microscopic examination, acridine orange, and high nugent score were found as rapid and sensitive methods for diagnosis of t. vaginalis.

AB  == purpose: to study the clinical and microbiological profile of women with bacterial vaginosis participating in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, which compared the vaginal use of preparations from red pepper tree and metronidazole for the treatment of genital discharge. methods: the study was conducted on a series of 277 women with bacterial vaginosis concomitantly diagnosed by the criteria of amsel and nugent, selected from a total of 462 recruited patients using the information obtained before intervention. data were  analyzed with the epi-info 3.32 software. in order to compare the outcomes frequencies between the intervention groups, the chi2 test was used and the risk  ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. the intention to treat analysis was performed. in addition to the determination of diagnostic parameters, the culture of vaginal content and a papanicolaou cytology test were  also performed. results: the most frequent clinical complaints were genital discharge, observed in 206 participants (74.4%) and the fish odor of the vaginal  secretion, which occurred in 68.6% of the cases (190 patients). among the diagnostic clinical criteria, the presence of clue-cells was positive in 275 women (99.3%), the whiff test, in 266 (96.0%), followed by ph >4.5, which occurred in 92.8% of the cases, and by the presence of fluid grayish discharge reported by 206 participants (74.4%). regarding the nugent criterion, the median  score was 8.0. culture of the vaginal content permitted the identification of gardnerella vaginalis in 96.8% of cases and of mobiluncus in 53.1%. only one third of the exams showed the presence of lactobacillus (89 women - 32.1%). fungal growth occurred in the cultures of 14 participants (5.1%). in most cases,  culture revealed the presence of corynebacterium (94.2%), gram-positive cocci (98.2%), as well as gram-positive (99.3%) and gram-negative (91.0%) bacilli. oncotic colposcopy revealed a very scarce presence of lactobacilli, which were present in only 8 cytological exams (2.9%) out of the total of 273 exams performed. conclusions: the results of the present study did not differ from the  literature regarding the symptoms reported by the women, the clinical criteria most frequently observed in the diagnosis, or the bacterial species detected in cultures of vaginal content. these findings indicate the need for further studies that might better elucidate the interrelations between the microbiological findings and the clinical expression of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == production and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against vaginolysin: mapping of a region critical for its cytolytic activity.
AB  == vaginolysin (vly) is a protein toxin released by gardnerella vaginalis. vly belongs to the group of cholesterol-dependent cytolysins (cdcs). we have generated a panel of novel monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against vly. for the generation of mabs, we have used recombinant vly expressed in escherichia coli. the functional activity of recombinant vly was confirmed by an in vitro hemolytic assay using human erythrocytes. the mabs raised against recombinant vly were reactive with vly from g. vaginalis both by western blot and elisa. the cross-reactivity of mabs with other cdcs was investigated. for this purpose, recombinant cytolysins perfringolysin, listeriolysin, intermedilysin, pneumolysin and streptolysin were expressed in e. coli. the mabs were specific exclusively to vly and did not react with other cdcs. all mabs were studied for the ability to neutralize hemolytic activity of vly in vitro and several neutralizing mabs were  identified. the mab produced by clone 9b4 showed the most potent neutralizing activity. the epitope for this mab was localized near the n-terminus of vly, between amino acid (aa) residues 112 and 268. the region recognized by the neutralizing mab 9b4 includes the conserved motif (vaarmqyd, aa 189-196) supposed to be involved in vly oligomerization. selected mabs were employed to develop a sandwich elisa for vly quantification. the mab-based immunoassay was suitable for the detection of vly in the cultures of g. vaginalis. in conclusion, the mabs described in the current study may be useful for structural and functional studies of vly as well as immunodetection of vly in biological specimens.

TI  == [vaginal ectopia of urethra as a cause of chronic recurrent cystitis in women: diagnosis and treatment].
AB  == ectopia of the urethral opening (female hypospadia) often causes chronic recurrent cystitis in women because of a retrograde delivery of urogenital infection from the introitus and vagina to the short wide urethra and urinary bladder. etiologically, cystitis develops due to pathogenic vaginal microflora: chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma genitalium, ureaplasma, urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, candida, e. coli and other gram-negative bacteria. in 64 female patients aged 16-57 years with female hypospadia (fh) the diagnosis was made by o'donnel-hirchhorn symptom. identification of urinary and vaginal microflora was made using polymerase chain reaction. radical treatment of chronic recurrent cystitis in fh is surgical transposition of the distal urethra and its  opening in the typical place with pre- and perioperative anti-inflammatory therapy according to the pathogen or with drugs having combined antimycotic and antiprotosoic properties. one of such drugs safocid demonstrates a rapid therapeutic effect in mixed urogenital infections causing chronic recurrent cystitis in women.

AB  == background: the prevalence of trichomonas vaginalis is not accurately estimated,  since it is not a reportable disease. aims: to assess the prevalence of t vaginalis infection in women attending a greek gynaecological hospital and to evaluate four diagnostic methods for t vaginalis infection. methods: 255 symptomatic and 247 asymptomatic women were included in the study during 2006-07; 372 were greek and 130 were immigrants. t vaginalis was detected in vaginal samples, using wet mount, culture in modified diamond's medium, antigen detection and two pcr assays, targeting different regions of t vaginalis genome. specimens  were considered positive for t vaginalis, when tested positive either by culture  or by both pcrs. results: 23 women (4.6%) were positive for t vaginalis. seven of the 23 positive samples (30.4%) were only pcr-positive. infection was more prevalent in symptomatic women (6.7%) than in asymptomatic ones (2.4%). t vaginalis was more frequently detected in immigrants (7.9%) than in greek women (3.3%). gardnerella vaginalis infection was significantly more frequent in women  infected with t vaginalis. pcr was the most sensitive method (100%), followed by  culture (69.6%), wet mount (69.6%) and latex agglutination (54.6%). agreement between pcr and culture as well as wet mount examination was very good (kappa=0.79). conclusions: the study shows a relatively low percentage of trichomoniasis in the female population living in athens. the infection was more  prevalent among immigrants, and a proportion of the infected women was asymptomatic. the tested methods had good agreement and pcr was found to improve  the diagnostic yield considerably.

TI  == individual and co-operative roles of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide in the killing activity of enteric strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 against enteric, uropathogenic and vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == the mechanism underlying the killing activity of lactobacillus strains against bacterial pathogens appears to be multifactorial. here, we investigate the respective contributions of hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid in killing bacterial pathogens associated with the human vagina, urinary tract or intestine  by two hydrogen peroxide-producing strains. in co-culture, the human intestinal strain lactobacillus johnsonii ncc933 and human vaginal strain lactobacillus gasseri ks120.1 strains killed enteric salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344, vaginal gardnerella vaginalis dsm 4944 and urinary tract escherichia coli cft073 pathogens. the cell-free culture supernatants (cfcss) produced the same reduction in sl1344, dsm 4944 and cft073 viability, whereas isolated bacteria had no effect. the killing activity of cfcss was heat-stable. in the presence of dulbecco's modified eagle's minimum essential medium inhibiting the lactic acid-dependent killing activity, cfcss were less effective at killing of the pathogens. catalase-treated cfcss displayed a strong decreased activity. tested alone, hydrogen peroxide triggered a concentration-dependent killing activity against all three pathogens. lactic acid alone developed a killing activity only  at concentrations higher than that present in cfcss. in the presence of lactic acid at a concentration present in lactobacillus cfcss, hydrogen peroxide displayed enhanced killing activity. collectively, these results demonstrate that for hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus strains, the main metabolites of lactobacillus, lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide, act co-operatively to kill enteric, vaginosis-associated and uropathogenic pathogens.

TI  == metronidazole is still the drug of choice for treatment of anaerobic infections.
AB  == metronidazole has been used for the treatment of infections for >45 years and is  still successfully used for the treatment of trichomoniasis, amoebiasis, and giardiasis. anaerobic bacterial infections caused by bacteroides species, fusobacteria, and clostridia respond favorably to metronidazole therapy. good clinical results in the treatment of vaginosis due to gardnerella vaginalis have  also been reported. rates of resistance to metronidazole are still generally low; however, several studies have reported decreased susceptibility among bacteroides species, as well as different mechanisms of resistance. metronidazole-resistant helicobacter pylori strains have been described, but combination therapy (eg, metronidazole, amoxicillin, or clarithromycin plus omeprazole) is still recommended for eradication of this pathogen in patients with gastroduodenal ulcers. metronidazole is considered to be a cost-effective drug because of its low cost, good activity against pathogenic anaerobic bacteria, favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, and minor adverse effects. metronidazole is still the criterion standard for therapy of anaerobic infections, as was described by tally and colleagues 35 years ago.

TI  == high vaginal concentrations of atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis in women undergoing preterm labor.
AB  == objective: to estimate the relationship between vaginal quantification of the main microorganisms related with bacterial vaginosis and the risk of preterm delivery among women with preterm labor. methods: molecular methods were used to  prospectively quantify lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium vaginae, and mycoplasma hominis in vaginal fluid samples from women admitted for  spontaneous preterm labor with intact membranes from july 2007 through july 2008. the primary outcome measure was the relationship between bacterial concentration  at admission and preterm delivery, before 37 weeks of gestation. sensitivity and  specificity of molecular cutoff values and 95% confidence intervals (cis) were calculated using the university of british columbia bayesian calculator type 2. results: of the 90 women included, 36 delivered before 37 weeks of gestation (40%). preterm delivery was not associated with the presence of lactobacillus species, g vaginalis, a vaginae, or m hominis. in contrast, molecular quantification detected high concentrations of a vaginae (10(6)/ml or more: 25.0% in the preterm group and 9.3% in the term group, p=.04) and g vaginalis (10(7)/ml or more: 16.7% and 3.7%, p=.03) more often in women with preterm deliveries compared with term deliveries. moreover, high vaginal concentrations of these two microorganisms together were associated with a significantly (p=.03) shorter interval between preterm labor and delivery (46 days, 95% ci 30-61) than were lower concentrations (85 days, 95% ci 75-95). the hazard ratio for a short preterm labor-to-delivery interval was three times higher for high vaginal fluid  concentrations of a vaginae and g vaginalis than for lower concentrations (hazard ratio 3.3, 95% ci 1.1-9.5, p=.03). conclusion: the risk of preterm delivery is significantly associated with high vaginal concentrations of a vaginae and g vaginalis in women with preterm labor. clinical trial registration: clinicaltrials.gov, www.clinicaltrials.gov, nct00484653. level of evidence: iii.

TI  == glycerol monolaurate inhibits candida and gardnerella vaginalis in vitro and in vivo but not lactobacillus.
AB  == we investigated the effects of glycerol monolaurate (gml) on lactobacillus, candida, and gardnerella vaginalis human vaginal microflora. our previous work demonstrated that 6 months of gml treatment vaginally does not alter lactobacillus counts in monkeys. candida and g. vaginalis are commonly associated with vaginal infections in women, many becoming chronic or recurrent. in vitro growth inhibition studies determined the effects of gml (0 to 500 microg/ml) against multiple candida species and g. vaginalis. a randomized, double-blind study investigated the effects of gml on vaginal microflora lactobacillus, candida, and g. vaginalis in colonized or infected women (n=36). women self-administered intravaginal gels containing 0% (n=14), 0.5% (n=13), or 5% (n=9) gml every 12 h for 2 days. vaginal swabs were collected before and immediately after the first gel administration and 12 h after the final gel administration. swabs were tested for lactobacillus, candida, g. vaginalis, and gml. in vitro gml concentrations of 500 microg/ml were candicidal for all species tested, while a concentration of 10 microg/ml was bactericidal for g. vaginalis.  control and gml gels applied vaginally in women did not alter vaginal ph or lactobacillus counts. control gels reduced g. vaginalis counts but not candida counts, whereas gml gels reduced both candida and g. vaginalis. no adverse events were reported by participating women. gml is antimicrobial for candida and g. vaginalis in vitro. vaginal gml gels in women do not affect lactobacillus negatively but significantly reduce candida and g. vaginalis.

TI  == comparison of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the normal microbial flora of the vagina plays an important role in preventing genital and urinary tract infections in women. thus an accurate understanding of the composition and ecology of the ecosystem is important to understanding the etiology of these diseases. this study aimed to compare the characteristics of main lactobacillus species between healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by quantitative culture and pcr methods. main lactobacillus species include l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. jensenii and l. iners. methods: a total of 150 women attending gynecology outpatient clinic of beijing friendship hospital, were diagnosed as having bv because three or more of the following criteria were met (standard of amsel's composite criteria): homogeneous discharge, elevated vaginal ph (ph > 4.5), production of amines, and presence of  "clue" cells. those with less than three of the criteria were considered as healthy. simultaneously, smears were made of vaginal fluid and gram stained, then were assessed qualitatively as normal (grade i), intermediate (grade ii), or consistent with bv (grade iii). gardnerella vaginalis were identified by using vitek 2 compact and pcr methods. lactobacillus species were identified by pcr methods. gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacilli colony counts were determined by  calculating the most number of colonies of each species in the appropriate plates (colonies between 10 and 300), corrected by the dilution of the sample in the plates, and multiplied by 10 (to account for plating 100 microl), in order to get colony forming units per milliliter of vaginal secretion. results: bv was diagnosed in 31% (46/150) patients using the composite criteria, the remainder being regarded as healthy. the majority of patients with bv had a smear assessed  as grade iii (91%, 42/46) and minority of them had a smear assessed as grade ii (9%, 4/46). the majority of healthy women had a smear assessed as grade i (64%, 67/104). smears assessed as grade ii were found (36%, 37/104) among patients diagnosed as healthy, with less than three of the composite criteria. l. crispatus was cultured from 94% of healthy women and 83% of women with bv, with the former colonies count average value of 10(6) and the latter of 10(3). l. gasseri, l. iners, and l. jensenii were cultured from 85%, 68% and 43% of healthy women; and 28%, 89% and 44% of bv women, respectively. conclusions: the quantities of four lactobacillus species except l. jensenii had a significant difference between healthy women and women with bv. our results provide support for the negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri. although l. crispatus were existent both in healthy and bv positive women's vagina, the numbers of l. crispatus were significantly different for the dominant number in healthy women. smears of vaginal fluid and gram stain play an important guiding role in bacteria culture.

TI  == in vitro inhibitory activity of human vaginal lactobacilli against pathogenic bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis in kenyan women.
AB  == lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit in vitro growth of many pathogens and have been used as probiotics to treat a broad range of gastrointestinal and/or vaginal disorders. we sought to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of lactobacilli of vaginal origin to some bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv), to characterize the inhibitory substances produced by these lactobacilli and to assess h2o2 production. vaginal specimens were obtained by swabbing the lateral vaginal walls from 107 women two months following bv treatment. one hundred and fifty eight lactobacillus spp. were isolated in 82 of  the 107 women. lactobacillus jensenii was the predominant strain isolated among these women (29/158; 18.4%). among 158 culture supernatants tested for antibacterial activity against bv-associated bacteria, none inhibited the growth  of bacteroides fragilis while 23% (37/158), 28% (45/158) and 29% (46/158) inhibited the growth of prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. respectively. the lactobacilli produced supernatants with a ph range between 2.62 and 6.71; the highly acidic (ph 2-3.99) supernatants were more inhibitory to the indicator strains. there was significant reduction in the mean zones of inhibition following chemical and physical treatment of the supernatants (p = 0.0025). acid, bacteriocins and h2o2 demonstrated potential for antagonism of the bacterial pathogens. these substances may augment each other rather that each working independently on the pathogens.

TI  == analysis of adherence, biofilm formation and cytotoxicity suggests a greater virulence potential of gardnerella vaginalis relative to other bacterial-vaginosis-associated anaerobes.
AB  == worldwide, bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common vaginal disorder in women  of childbearing age. bv is characterized by a dramatic shift in the vaginal microflora, involving a relative decrease in lactobacilli, and a proliferation of anaerobes. in most cases of bv, the predominant bacterial species found is gardnerella vaginalis. however, pure cultures of g. vaginalis do not always result in bv, and asymptomatic women are sometimes colonized with low numbers of  g. vaginalis. thus, there is controversy about whether g. vaginalis is an opportunistic pathogen and the causative agent of many cases of bv, or whether bv is a polymicrobial condition caused by the collective effects of an altered microbial flora. recent studies of the biofilm-forming potential and cytotoxic activity of g. vaginalis have renewed interest in the virulence potential of this organism. in an effort to tease apart the aetiology of this disorder, we utilized in vitro assays to compare three virulence properties of g. vaginalis relative to other bv-associated anaerobes. we designed a viable assay to analyse bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells, we compared biofilm-producing capacities,  and we assessed cytotoxic activity. of the bv-associated anaerobes tested, only g. vaginalis demonstrated all three virulence properties combined. this study suggests that g. vaginalis is more virulent than other bv-associated anaerobes, and that many of the bacterial species frequently isolated from bv may be relatively avirulent opportunists that colonize the vagina after g. vaginalis has initiated an infection.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis: a cause of infertility?
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common disorder of the genital tract in women characterized by an alteration of the normal acidic lactobacilli-predominant vaginal ecosystem to a vaginal environment dominated by gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma species and anaerobes, with an increase in ph. the present study evaluated whether bv is associated with reproductive complications in women. bv was screened with a gram stain of vaginal smear and interpretation was done using the nugent score. wet mount and polymerase chain reaction were used to screen other infections. among 510 enrolled women, 72 (14.1%) had bv. statistical analysis between the bv negative and positive population revealed a significant association (p = 0.0001) with infertility. in pregnant women, the infection rate  was low (p = 0.01). multiple infections such as candida, chlamydia and human papilloma virus were observed in 4.2%, 15.3% and 8.3% of bv-infected women, respectively. results suggest that bv infection is associated with infertility and its absence leads to pregnancy, emphasizing its screening and treatment.

TI  == multiplex detection of bacteria associated with normal microbiota and with bacterial vaginosis in vaginal swabs by use of oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent microspheres.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a recurrent condition that is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including the acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus and other sexually transmitted diseases, preterm births, and pelvic inflammatory  disease. in contrast to the lactobacillus-dominated normal vaginal microbiota, bv is characterized by a lack of lactobacilli and an abundance of anaerobic and gram-negative organisms, including gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae. to date, the laboratory diagnosis of bv has relied upon the fulfillment of criteria determined by microscopic observation of gram-stained vaginal swabs. we  describe a molecular-based method for the easy determination of the species profile within the vaginal microbiota based on the amplification of the chaperonin-60 genes of all bacteria present in the swab and hybridization of the  amplicon to species-specific oligonucleotide-coupled fluorescent beads that are identified by flow cytometry with a luminex instrument. we designed a nineplex luminex array for characterization of the vaginal microbiota and applied it to the analysis of vaginal swabs from individuals from africa and north america. using the presence of a. vaginae or g. vaginalis, or both, as the defining criterion for bv, we found that the method was highly specific and sensitive for  the diagnosis of bv using microscopy as a gold standard.

TI  == comparison of oral and vaginal metronidazole for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: impact on fastidious bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition that is associated with preterm birth and acquisition of complex communities of vaginal bacteria that include several fastidious species. treatment of bv in pregnancy has mixed effects on the risk of preterm delivery, which some hypothesize is due to variable antibiotic efficacy for the fastidious bacteria. both oral and intravaginal metronidazole can be used to treat bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy, but little is known about the impact of different routes of antibiotic administration on concentrations of fastidious vaginal bacteria. methods: this was a sub-study of a larger randomized trial of oral versus vaginal metronidazole for treatment of bv in pregnancy. fifty-three women were evaluated, including 30  women who received oral metronidazole and 23 who received intravaginal metronidazole. bacterial taxon-specific quantitative pcr assays were used to measure concentrations of bacterial vaginosis associated bacterium (bvab) 1, 2, and 3, gardnerella vaginalis, atopobium species, leptotrichia/sneathia species, megasphaera species, and lactobacillus crispatus before and after antibiotic treatment. results: concentrations of leptotrichia and sneathia spp. and the fastidious clostridia-like bacterium designated bvab1 decreased significantly with oral (p = .002, p = .02) but not vaginal therapy (p = .141, p = .126). the fastidious bacterium bvab3 did not significantly decrease with either treatment.  concentrations of atopobium spp., reportedly resistant to metronidazole in vitro, dropped significantly with oral (p = .002) and vaginal (p = .001) treatment. there was no significant difference in the magnitude of change in bacterial concentrations between oral and vaginal treatment arms for any of the bacterial species. lactobacillus crispatus concentrations did not change. conclusion: both  oral and vaginal metronidazole therapy in pregnant women result in a significant  decrease in concentrations of most bv-associated anaerobic bacteria, with the exception that leptotrichia, sneathia and bvab1 do not significantly decrease with vaginal metronidazole therapy. these data suggest that the route of antibiotic administration has a minor impact on bacterial eradication in pregnant women with bv. trial registration: this trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov, number nct00153517.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis: an overview for 2009.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis has been appreciated as a unique clinical entity for well over 50 years. its essential manifestations are well established: a loss of the normal bacterial population of the vagina and their replacement by other species. investigations into this condition have led to a better understanding of its prevalence and epidemiology. microbiologic and biochemical studies have exposed the remarkably complex pathophysiologic events that occur with bacterial vaginosis. several major morbidities accompany this condition. advances have been made in treatment, including the recent availability of a new therapeutic agent,  tinidazole. however, the root cause of the condition is elusive, and as a result  managing bacterial vaginosis and its complications is unsatisfactory; moreover, data suggest that therapy now is less successful than in the past. this article brings together the current fund of knowledge about bacterial vaginosis in a way  that offers clinicians a realistic view of our capabilities and concerns.

TI  == oleate lipase activity in gardnerella vaginalis and reconsideration of existing biotype schemes.
AB  == background: gardnerella vaginalis is a facultative gram positive organism that requires subculture every 1-2 days to maintain viability. it has been linked with bacterial vaginosis (bv), a syndrome that has been associated with increased risk for preterm delivery, pelvic inflammatory disease and hiv acquisition. about 10%  of the g. vaginalis isolates have been reported to produce sialidase, but there have not been any studies relating sialidase production and biotype. sialidase activity is dramatically increased in the vaginal fluid of women with bv and bacterial sialidases have been shown to increase the infectivity of hiv in vitro. there are 8 different biotypes of g. vaginalis. biotypes 1-4 produce lipase and were reported to be associated with bv and the association of these biotypes with bv is under dispute. other studies have demonstrated that g. vaginalis biotype 1  can stimulate hiv-1 production. because of the discrepancies in the literature we compared the methods used to biotype g. vaginalis and investigated the relationship of biotype and sialidase production. results: a new medium for maintenance of gardnerella vaginalis which allows survival for longer than one week is described. some isolates only grew well under anaerobic conditions. sialidase producing isolates were observed in 5 of the 6 biotypes tested. using 4-methylumbelliferyl-oleate to determine lipase activity, instead of egg yolk agar, resulted in erroneous biotypes and does not provide reliable results. conclusion: previous studies associating g. vaginalis biotype with bacterial vaginosis were methodologically flawed, suggesting there is not an association of g. vaginalis biotypes and bacterial vaginosis. sialidase activity was observed in 5 of the 8 biotypes.

TI  == antibody-based detection and inhibition of vaginolysin, the gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common vaginal infection worldwide and is associated with significant adverse sequelae. we have recently characterized vaginolysin (vly), the human-specific cytotoxin produced by gardnerella vaginalis and believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of bv and its associated morbidities. we hypothesize that novel antibody-based strategies may be useful for detection of vly and for inhibition of its toxic effects on human cells. using purified toxin as an immunogen, we generated polyclonal rabbit immune serum (is) against vly. a western blot of g. vaginalis lysate was probed with is and a  single band (57 kd) identified. immunofluorescence techniques using is detected vly production by g. vaginalis. in addition, we have developed a sandwich elisa assay capable of vly quantification at ng/ml concentrations in the supernatant of growing g. vaginalis. to investigate the potential inhibitory role of is on vly-mediated cell lysis, we exposed human erythrocytes to vly or vly pretreated with is and determined the percent hemolysis. pretreatment with is resulted in a  significant reduction in vly-mediated lysis. similarly, both human cervical carcinoma cells and vaginal epithelial cells exhibited reduced cytolysis following exposure to vly with is compared to vly alone. these results confirm that antibody-based techniques are an effective means of vly detection. furthermore, vly antiserum functions as an inhibitor of vly-cd59 interaction, mitigating cell lysis. these strategies may have a potential role in the diagnosis and treatment of bv.

AB  == the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a sensitive method for the simultaneous identification of 14 urogenital potential pathogens. a multiplex pcr-based reverse line blot (mpcr/rlb) assay was developed to detect 14 urogenital pathogens or putative pathogens, namely trichomonas vaginalis, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma parvum, u. urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus influenzae, herpes simplex virus type 1 (hsv1) and hsv2, n. meningitidis, mycoplasma hominis, m. genitalium, and adenovirus, using two species-specific primer pairs and probes for each. the method was validated using a reference strain or a well-characterized clinical isolate of each target organism and was found to be both sensitive and specific. the limits of detection for the mpcr/rlb assay varied among the 14 target organisms from 4.2 x 10(-1) to 7.0 x 10(-11) ng/microl of genomic dna. there were no cross-reactions among any of the probes. this method was used to test 529 first-voided urine specimens from male patients with  and without urethritis attending two sydney sexual health clinics. one or more target species were detected in 193 (36%) subjects. of 233 positive results, overall 216 (93%) were concordant between mpcr/rlb and a comparator method (culture and/or species-specific pcr), 9 were positive only by mpcr/rlb, and 8 were positive only by the comparator method. the mpcr/rlb method was an accurate, convenient, and inexpensive method for the detection of multiple potential pathogens in first-voided urine specimens from men.

TI  == evaluation of common organisms causing vaginal discharge.
AB  == background: vaginal discharge is very common problem among females. alteration in balance of normal vaginal organisms can cause the overgrowth of the bacteria that creates vaginal discharge. it is common among sexually active women yet there still remain gaps in our knowledge of this infectious disorder. objective: to evaluate the frequency of bacterial vaginosis (bv), vaginal candidiasis (vc), vaginal trichomoniasis and group b streptococcus in women complaining of vaginal  discharge in our setup. method: a total of 100 women of reproductive age group with the complaint of vaginal discharge were included in the study. after filling proforma patients were examined by speculum examination and two high vaginal swabs (hvs) were collected aseptically from each patient. one swab was used for making wet mount for clue cells, pus cells and for motility of trichomonas vaginalis. the other swab was used to check ph and amine test. the growth was confirmed by gram staining in each case. results: gardnerrella vaginalis were isolated in 28%, group b streptococcus in 5% and t. vaginolis in 4% of women. conclusion: gardnerella vaginalis causing bv is the most common cause of vaginal  discharge in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age group in our setup.

TI  == retinal vasculitis associated with asymptomatic gardnerella vaginalis infection:  a new clinical entity.
AB  == purpose: to report on 3 cases of retinal vasculitis associated with asymptomatic  gardnerella vaginalis (gv) infection. methods: review of 3 consecutive patients who presented with central retinal vasculitis without signs or symptoms of systemic disease. the vasculitis involved the central branches of the retinal vessels bilaterally and was steroid-dependent. results: during treatment, patients developed clinically significant vaginitis, which the gynecologist considered to be exacerbated by the steroid treatment, leading to its withdrawal. all 3 vaginal specimens were positive for gv. antibiotic susceptibility testing led to administration of oral ampicillin (2 g/day for 10 days), which resolved both the vaginal infection and the retinal vasculitis. conclusions: idiopathic retinal vasculitis can be triggered by several agents. in this case series, gv was associated with retinal vasculitis, which was resolved by oral ampicillin. gv infection may be one of a number of triggers of retinal vasculitis. appropriate treatment and full resolution of ocular inflammation requires exclusion of possible underlying infections.

TI  == does progesterone inhibit bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by lower genital tract epithelial cells?
AB  == objective: progesterone (p(4)) has been clinically shown to prevent the recurrence of preterm birth. the mechanism(s) of action is unclear, but may involve modulation of the immunologic inflammatory response of the lower genital  tract. we evaluated the effects of p(4) on interleukin-8 (il-8) production by vaginal and cervical epithelial cells stimulated with bacterial species that are  commonly associated with preterm birth. methods: vaginal and endocervical epithelial cells were incubated with up to 10,000 ng/ml p(4) overnight and stimulated with heat-killed escherichia coli, gardnerella vaginalis, or ureaplasma urealyticum. concentrations of il-8 in conditioned medium were quantified by elisa and viability of the cell cultures was measured by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt. results: e. coli, g. vaginalis and u. urealyticum-stimulated il-8 production for both cell lines. p(4) inhibited basal  and bacteria-stimulated il-8 production for vaginal epithelial cells but enhanced il-8 production by endocervical cells. p(4) reduced the number of viable cells for both cell lines. conclusions: p(4) inhibits il-8 production by vaginal epithelial cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, possibly by reducing the number of viable cells or by inhibiting their proliferation. although p(4) also reduces proliferation of endocervical cells it  also increases their production of il-8.

TI  == effect of sulfasalazine on basal and bacteria-stimulated interleukin-8 production by endocervical epithelial cells.
AB  == problem: sulfasalazine (sasp) inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced nuclear-factor  kappa b activation and interleukin-8 (il-8) production by cultured explants of placenta, amnion and choriodecidua. bacteria-induced il-8 production in the cervix is a potential mechanism for premature cervical ripening that may lead to  preterm birth. our objective was to determine if sasp inhibits il-8 production by endocervical cells stimulated with bacterial pathogens associated with preterm birth. method of study: human endocervical cells were incubated with 0-1.6 mm sasp and then stimulated with ureaplasma parvum, escherichia coli, or gardnerella vaginalis. conditioned medium was then harvested and production of il-8 was quantified by elisa. viability of the cells was ascertained at the end of the experiment with the mtt-assay. results: at the highest concentration tested (1.6  mm), sasp significantly inhibited il-8 production by cultures stimulated with e.  coli (p < 0.001), u. parvum (p < 0.001), and g. vaginalis (p < 0.001). viability  of the cells, however, was significantly reduced by sasp at 0.8 and 1.6 mm in both the presence and absence of bacteria for all experiments. conclusion: although high concentrations of sasp inhibit il-8 production by cultures of endocervical cells stimulated with pathogens associated with preterm birth, this  effect may be because of toxicity of the antibiotic on the cells.

TI  == validation of an immunologic diagnostic kit for infectious vaginitis by trichomonas vaginalis, candida spp., and gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == fempure is a kit for the rapid diagnosis of vaginitis by trichomonas vaginalis, candida spp., and gardnerella vaginalis, based on aggregation of latex particles  joined to specific antibodies. the validation of the method involved the parameters specificity, detection limit, robustness, clinical sensitivity, and clinical specificity. also, samples analyzed in parallel by the validated test and other recognized tests conducted by external laboratory were included. the method was specific for the 3 infectious agents, and no cross-reaction with other microorganisms usually present in vaginal exudates. the detection limit > or =1 x 10(6) cfu/ml for candida albicans and g. vaginalis avoids the detection of concentrations considered normal flora, whereas t. vaginalis was detected until 1 x 10(5) cells/ml. values of clinical sensitivity > or =80% and clinical specificity > or =90% and concordance > or =90% were found between samples evaluated in parallel by different methods. robustness showed that the test can be used in laboratories with different management systems; its simple implementation without equipment allows the use in primary health care areas.

TI  == gene polymorphisms of toll-like and related recognition receptors in relation to  the vaginal carriage of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae.
AB  == host genetic factors have previously been found to act as determinants of differential susceptibility to major infectious diseases. it is less clear whether such polymorphisms may also impose on pathogen recognition in mucosal overgrowth conditions such as bacterial vaginosis, an anaerobic overgrowth condition characterised by the presence of a vaginal biofilm consisting of the gram-positive anaerobes gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae. we selected  34 single nucleotide polymorphisms pertaining to 9 genes involved with toll-like  receptor-mediated pathogen recognition and/or regulation (lbp, cd14, tlr1, tlr2,  tlr4, tlr6, md2, card15 and sigirr) and assessed in a nested case-control study their putative association with bacterial vaginosis, as diagnosed by gram staining, and with the vaginal carriage of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis, as determined by species-specific pcr, among 144 pregnant women. carriage of g. vaginalis during early pregnancy was associated with the -1155a>g substitution in the promoter region of the md2 gene (p=0.041). the presence of a. vaginae during  the first half of the pregnancy was significantly associated with the cd14 intron 2 1342g>t (p=0.039), the tlr1 exon 4 743a>g (p=0.038), and the card15 exon 4 14772a>t (p=0.012) polymorphisms, and marginally significantly associated with the lbp exon13 26842c>t (p=0.056), the cd14 promoter -260c>t (p=0.052), and the tlr1 promoter -7202a>g (p=0.062) polymorphisms. however, no association between gene polymorphisms and bacterial vaginosis as such could be documented. our data  suggest that some degree of genetic susceptibility involving pathogen recognition may occur with the key bacterial vaginosis organism, a. vaginae.

TI  == adhesion of human probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus to cervical and vaginal cells and interaction with vaginosis-associated pathogens.
AB  == objectives: the ability of a probiotic lactobacillus rhamnosus strain (lcr35) to  adhere to cervical and vaginal cells and to affect the viability of two main vaginosis-associated pathogens, prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis, as well  as candida albicans was investigated. methods: adhesion ability was determined in vitro with immortalized epithelial cells from the endocervix, ectocervix, and vagina. coculture experiments were performed to count viable pathogens cells in the presence of lcr35. results: lcr35 was able to specifically and rapidly adhere to the three cell lines. in coculture assays, a decrease in pathogen cell division rate was observed as from 4 hours of incubation and bactericidal activity after a longer period of incubation, mostly with p. bivia. conclusion: the ability of lcr35 to adhere to cervicovaginal cells and its antagonist activities against vaginosis-associated pathogens suggest that this probiotic strain is a promising candidate for use in therapy.

TI  == cervicovaginal cytological abnormalities in patients with human immunodeficiency  virus infection, in relation to disease stage, cd4 cell count and viral load.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to assess infections and cytologic abnormalities in cervicovaginal smears from 153 hiv-positive women and 169 hiv-negative followed up at the uftm school of medicine between may 1999 and may  2002. the medical records and cervicovaginal smears were reviewed and the hiv-positive group was classified according to cd4 cell count, hiv viral load, antiretroviral therapy and hiv subgroups (with or without disease; with or without therapy) and compared to hiv-negative group. we conclude that the frequency of candida sp, trichomonas vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis in cervicovaginal smear, is not different between hiv-positive and hiv-negative women, even if the hiv-group is subdivided according to cd4 cell count, hiv viral load, antiretroviral therapy and hiv subgroups. the frequency of lsil, in cervicovaginal smears, was greater in the hiv-group (17.6%) than in the hiv-negative (4.1%); there was no difference between the two groups according to  frequency of hsil (4.6% versus 1.8%), ascus/agus (7.8% versus 3.5%) and invasive  carcinoma (1.3% versus 0.6%). the frequency of lsil was greater in the hiv positive group with cd4 cell count < 350 cells/mm(3). the viral load, therapeutic regimen and hiv subgroups (hiv-positive without therapy, hiv-positive with therapy, aids by immunological criteria and aids by clinical criteria) have not shown relationship with lsil frequency, until now.

TI  == lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by vaginal lactobacillus rhamnosus, targets  cytoplasmic membranes of the vaginal pathogen, gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a commonly occurring vaginal infection that is associated with a variety of serious risks related to the reproductive health of  women. conventional antibiotic treatment for this condition is frequently ineffective because the antibiotics tend to inhibit healthy vaginal microflora along with the pathogens. lactocin 160, a bacteriocin produced by healthy vaginal lactobacilli, is a promising alternative to antibiotics; this compound specifically inhibits the bv-associated vaginal pathogens such as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia without affecting the healthy microflora. this study investigates the molecular mechanism of action for lactocin 160 and reveals that this compound targets the cytoplasmic membrane of g. vaginalis, causing the  efflux of atp molecules and dissipation of the proton motive force.

TI  == changes in vaginal bacterial concentrations with intravaginal metronidazole therapy for bacterial vaginosis as assessed by quantitative pcr.
AB  == several fastidious bacteria have been associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv) using broad-range bacterial pcr methods such as consensus sequence 16s rrna gene  pcr, but their role in bv remains poorly defined. we describe changes in vaginal  bacterial concentrations following metronidazole therapy for bv. vaginal swabs were collected from women with bv diagnosed using amsel clinical criteria, and vaginal fluid was assessed by gram stain to generate nugent scores. follow-up swabs were collected 1 month after a 5-day course of vaginal 0.75% metronidazole  gel and analyzed for 24 subjects with cured bv and 24 subjects with persistent bv. changes in bacterial concentrations were measured using eight bacterium-specific 16s rrna gene quantitative pcr assays. dna from several fastidious bv-associated bacteria (bvab) were present at high concentrations in the vagina prior to treatment. successful antibiotic therapy resulted in 3- to 4-log reductions in median bacterial loads of bvab1 (p=0.02), bvab2 (p=0.0004), bvab3 (p=0.03), a megasphaera-like bacterium (p<0.0001), atopobium species (p<0.0001), leptotrichia/sneathia species (p=0.0002), and gardnerella vaginalis (p<0.0001). median posttreatment bacterial levels did not change significantly in subjects with persistent bv except for a decline in levels of bvab3. the presence or absence of bv is reflected by vaginal concentrations of bv-associated bacteria such as bvab1, bvab2, leptotrichia/sneathia species, atopobium species, gardnerella vaginalis, and a megasphaera-like bacterium, suggesting that these bacteria play an important role in bv pathogenesis and may be suitable markers of disease and treatment response.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis presence in sexually active women in tuzla canton area.
AB  == the goal of our research was to determine the presence of bacterial vaginosis in  sexually active women in tuzla canton area. diagnosis determination for bacterial vaginosis was conducted on the basis of three out of four internationally accepted criteria according to amsel and isolation and identification of gardnerella vaginalis (g. vaginalis) by standard microbiological procedures. bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 20,5 % (41/200) women who asked for gynaecologist's help due to their personal discomfort, since significantly higher percentage of diagnosed bacterial vaginosis of 48,80% (41/84) was determined in women with personal discomfort typical for this disease. all relevant factors, according to available literature, for genesis of bacterial vaginosis were processed in this research. in respect to the obtained outputs, bacterial vaginosis is significantly more frequent occurrence in women who are not married, since the number of sexual partners, the time of the first sexual intercourse, the use of intrauterine contraceptive device and smoking do not cause the genesis of bacterial vaginosis. according to nugent, an increased vaginal discharge with  unpleasant odour after sexual discourse, its ph>4,5, a positive amino odour test, an occurrence of clue cells in a direct microscopic concoction of vaginal discharge and assessment of the state of vaginal flora for bacterial vaginosis are significantly more frequent occurrences in women with individual discomforts. it was proved that g. vaginalis is a dominant micro organism in 95% of women with clinical signs of vaginosis although it was isolated from vaginal discharge in 40 to 50% of healthy women. in our research, g. vaginalis was isolated in 63,41% of  examined women with all signs of bacterial vaginosis, in 36,59% of examined women with one or more clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis and in 2,58% of examined women of control group without clinical signs.

TI  == preterm labor and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria among urban women.
AB  == aims: bacterial vaginosis (bv) affects millions of women, is extremely prevalent  and is frequently chronic. we recognize numerous microbiologic variations among women with bv and this variability may explain the limited effectiveness of metronidazole in curing bv and/or reducing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth  (sptb) among bv-positive pregnant women. we assessed the independent role of seven common bv-associated bacteria on the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (sptb) among urban pregnant women. methods: this prospective cohort study was conducted within an urban obstetrics practice at temple university hospital in philadelphia, pa. fifty pregnant women with documented singleton pregnancies between 25-36 weeks' gestation from february 2007 through june 2007 who presented to the labor and delivery unit for evaluation of uterine contractions/preterm labor were enrolled. results: we found that high median levels of gardnerella vaginalis and low median levels of lactobacillus crispatus were significantly predictive of sptb. slightly higher levels of megasphaera-like species were also  found among the group of women experiencing a sptb during the follow-up period. conclusions: further identification of the individual attributable risk for separate bv-associated bacteria may be most useful in developing successful treatments to prevent sptb among bv positive women.

TI  == spermicidal activity of the safe natural antimicrobial peptide subtilosin.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv), a condition affecting millions of women each year, is primarily caused by the gram-variable organism gardnerella vaginalis. a number of organisms associated with bv cases have been reported to develop multidrug resistance, leading to the need for alternative therapies. previously, we reported the antimicrobial peptide subtilosin has proven antimicrobial activity against g. vaginalis, but not against the tested healthy vaginal microbiota of lactobacilli. after conducting tissue sensitivity assays using an ectocervical tissue model, we determined that human cells remained viable after prolonged exposures to partially-purified subtilosin, indicating the compound is safe for human use. subtilosin was shown to eliminate the motility and forward progression of human spermatozoa in a dose-dependent manner, and can therefore be considered  a general spermicidal agent. these results suggest subtilosin would be a valuable component in topical personal care products aimed at contraception and bv prophylaxis and treatment.

AB  == objectives: to compare vaginal lipopolysaccharides (lps) concentrations between patients with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv), to evaluate the correlation between prevotella bivia colonization density and lps concentration, and to determine the impact of lps on loss of dopamine neurons (da). methods: vaginal washes obtained from patients with (n=43) and without (n=59) bv were tested for quantity of p. bivia cells using quantitative pcr and for concentrations of lps using the limulus amebocyte lysate gel clot method. prevotella bivia, gardnerella vaginalis and escherichia coli sonicated cell extracts were also tested for lps production. da neuron cells obtained from embryonic day (e) 14.5 pregnant rats were exposed to fluid from eight vaginal washes; tyrosine hydrolase immunoreactive staining was applied for visualization and cell counts. results: the median lps concentrations were dramatically higher among patients who had symptoms of bv compared to those who did not have symptoms (3235.0 vs 46.4 eu/ml, respectively, p<0.001); patients who had bv also had much higher colonization densities of p. bivia (0.06+/-0.36 vs 5.4+/-2.2 log(10) cfu/ml, respectively, p<0.001). prevotella bivia cell lysates resulted in a higher lps concentration (10,713.0+/-306.6 eu/ml) than either e. coli (4679.0+/-585.3 eu/ml) or g. vaginalis (0.07+/-0.01 eu/ml of lps). the loss of da neuron was 20-27% in cultures treated with vaginal washes from bv-negative patients and 58-97% in cultures treated with vaginal washes from patients with bv. conclusion: p. bivia  produces high lps concentration, which may create a toxic vaginal environment that damages da neurons.

TI  == importance of isolation and biotypization of gardnerella vaginalis in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the natural habitat of gardnerella vaginalis is a vagina since it could be located among 69% of women who have no signs of vaginal infection and in the vagina of as many as 13.5% girls. g. vaginalis is almost certainly identified among women diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis as well as in the urethra of their sexual partner. the increase in prevalence and concentration of g. vaginalis among patients diagnosed with this syndrome confirms that g. vaginalis plays a significant role in its pathogenesis. in our research, based on amsel criteria for three or more clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis, it was diagnosed in 20.5% of women with subjective problems of vaginal infection, and in 48.80% of women with subjective symptoms characteristic of this disease. g. vaginalis was isolated from vaginal secretion of women without clinical signs characteristic of bacterial vaginosis. in 2.58% of cases it was solitary, while in 1.28% it was found in combination with other aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and, in 1.28% women combined with candida albicans. the isolation of g. vaginalis was significantly increased (p<0.05) in the group of women with clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis in comparison to the group of women without these signs. frequent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis, which is found in 20-30% of women within a three months treatment, is explained as reinfection with other biotype of g. vaginalis, different from a source biotype or as a consequence of wrong treatment. following piot biotype scheme, biotypes 2., 3. and 7. g. vaginalis are significantly more often isolated from women who suffer from bacterial vaginosis. biotype 7. g. vaginalis, isolated from the group of women without clinical signs  of bacterial vaginosis, accounted for 2.58% cases. following benit biotype scheme, biotypes iva, ivc and iic were identified in 12.90% cases, while biotypes iiia, iia, ia, ivb, iib were found in 6.45% cases. lipase-positive isolates of g. vaginalis were significantly more frequently accompanied by the syndrome of bacterial vaginosis.

AB  == transport media should preserve the viability and stability of microorganisms in  clinical specimens. in this study, the port-a-cul transport system and the copan  transport system without charcoal, both designed to preserve anaerobes, were evaluated. dacron swabs were inoculated with two combinations of facultative and  anaerobic organisms typically found in vaginal swab samples. combination i contained candida albicans, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, lactobacillus crispatus, and staphylococcus aureus. combination ii  contained lactobacillus iners, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, mobiluncus curtisii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis. duplicate swabs were placed into the two transporters and held for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at 4 and 24 degrees c. both transporters maintained the viability of organisms better at 4 degrees c than at 24 degrees c. prevotella bivia and prevotella corporis had a loss of viability in both transporters at both temperatures. however, at 24 degrees c, there was a significantly greater loss of viability for mycoplasma hominis, prevotella bivia, prevotella corporis, and peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus when the organisms were stored in copan transport  medium than when they were stored in port-a-cul transport medium for 96 h (p < 0.002). some organisms proliferated in the transport media, but when transporters were held at 24 degrees c for 96 h, a significantly greater increase in the concentrations of group b streptococci and candida albicans, escherichia coli, and enterococcus spp. organisms in copan medium than in port-a-cul medium was observed (p < 0.002). at room temperature, the port-a-cul system is superior to the copan system with respect to the preservation of fastidious microorganisms and the prevention of the proliferation of facultative organisms.

TI  == cytologically diagnosed gardnerella vaginalis infection and cervical (pre)neoplasia as established in population-based cervical screening.
AB  == objective: cervical inflammation has been proposed as a cofactor in the development of cervical cancer. the purpose of this study was to document the prevalence of cervical (pre)neoplastic changes in asymptomatic women with a cytologically diagnosed gardnerella vaginalis infection. study design: data were  collected from 800,498 dutch asymptomatic women, participating in the dutch national screening program. prevalences of (pre)neoplasia were calculated for g vaginalis smears using a healthy flora as reference. results: the prevalence of g vaginalis infection was 0.6 per thousand. the odds ratio for (pre)neoplasia was significantly higher in smears with g vaginalis infection compared with smears of women with a healthy vaginal flora (odds ratio, 10.3; 95% confidence interval, 6.6-16.1). conclusion: cytologically diagnosed g vaginalis smears show a strong covariation with the presence of cervical (pre)neoplasia. future research should  therefore focus on the exact causal relation between cytologic g vaginalis infection and the presence of (pre)neoplastic changes of the cervix.

TI  == molecular quantification of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. methods: molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by gram stain-based nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for bv; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. a quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 bv-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. the targeted microorganisms were gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus species, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, and candida albicans (which can be identified by gram staining), as well as atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by gram staining). results: with use of the nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as bv, and 44 were classified as intermediate. except for u. urealyticum, m. mulieris, and lactobacillus species,  dna of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating  bv, but the predictive value of such detection was low. the molecular quantification of a. vaginae (dna level, > or = 10(8) copies/ml) and g. vaginalis (dna level, > or = 10(9) copies/ml) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of bv, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a bv profile. when applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. conclusions: we report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of bv.

TI  == frequency of infectious agents for vaginitis in patients with a cytological diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the presence of infectious agents for vaginitis in patients with ascus. methods: 33,388 patients who underwent cervical-vaginal cytology from 08/1993 to 05/2002 were included in the study, and 1,104 (3.4%) presented positive ascus. the appraised infectious agents were coccobacilli, candida sp, trichomonas vaginalis, and clue cells (gardnerella vaginalis). results: in the group with ascus a larger frequency of coccobacilli (22.37%) and trichomonas vaginalis (5.25%) was found when compared with the group with negative ascus (17.79% and 3.98%, respectively; p < 0.05). cytolysis occurred more frequently in patients with ascus (3.8 vs 6.3%, first phase and 4.5 vs 10%, second phase). conclusions: we believe that some diagnoses of ascus can be induced by the presence of infectious agents for vaginitis, mainly cocci and coccoides. ascus occurs more frequently in the first phase of the menstrual cycle, therefore in less acid vaginal ph.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus sp in liquid-based cervical samples in healthy and disturbed vaginal flora using cultivation-independent methods.
AB  == our objective was to determine the morphotype of the adherent bacteria in liquid-based cytology (lbc) in smears with healthy and disturbed vaginal flora. and to use pcr technology on the same fixed cell sample to establish dna patterns of the 16s rna genes of the bacteria in the sample. thirty samples were randomly  selected from a large group of cervical cell samples suspended in a commercial coagulant fixative "(boonfix)." pcr was used to amplify dna of five bacterial species: lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus jensenii, gardnerella vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis. the lbc slides were then analyzed by light microscopy to estimate bacterial adhesion. dna of lactobacilli  was detected in all cell samples. seventeen smears showed colonization with gardnerella vaginalis (range 2.6 x 10(2)-3.0 x 10(5) bacteria/mul boonfix sample). two cases were identified as dysbacteriotic with high dna values for gardnerella vaginalis and low values for lactobacillus crispatus. the sample with the highest concentration for gardnerella vaginalis showed an unequivocal gardnerella infection. this study indicates that the adherence pattern of a disturbed flora in liquid-based cervical samples can be identified unequivocally, and that these samples are suitable for quantitative pcr analysis. this cultivation independent method reveals a strong inverse relationship between gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus crispatus in dysbacteriosis and unequivocal gardnerella infection.

TI  == atopobium vaginae triggers an innate immune response in an in vitro model of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder among women of reproductive age. the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis is poorly understood, but is defined by a transition in the vaginal flora from the predominant lactobacillus species to other bacterial species such as atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis. this change is associated with an increase in vaginal cytokine secretion. we hypothesize that vaginal epithelial cells respond to bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria by triggering an innate immune response.  we observed that vaginal epithelial cells secreted interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 in response to atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis, but not to lactobacillus crispatus. atopobium vaginae induced increased levels of interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 transcripts, as well as increased transcripts for the antimicrobial peptide beta-defensin 4. this innate immune response required live bacteria capable of protein synthesis in direct contact with vaginal epithelial cells. the response of vaginal epithelial cells was mediated by toll-like receptor 2, required the adaptor protein myd88, and involved activation of the nfkappab signaling pathway. these results suggest that atopobium vaginae stimulates an innate immune response from vaginal epithelial cells, leading to localized cytokine and defensin production, and possibly contributes to the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == the polymicrobial hypothesis of bacterial vaginosis causation: a reassessment.
AB  == the cause of bacterial vaginosis remains controversial. the two leading hypotheses are that gardnerella vaginalis is the specific aetiologic agent versus the polymicrobial hypothesis that g. vaginalis acts in concert with other bacteria, principally anaerobes, to produce the disease. here we reassess the prevailing polymicrobial hypothesis, finding it conceptually problematical. no host initiating factors as postulated have been identified, nor is there conclusive evidence that g. vaginalis lacks diagnostic specificity for the disease. the polymicrobial hypothesis, presupposing a unique disruption of vaginal microecology, is inconsistent with the epidemiological profile of the syndrome, which is that of a sexually transmitted disease. the epidemiological and clinical similarities between bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis suggest  a similar pathogenetic process; i.e., primary causation by a specific agent, with secondary anaerobic activation and resultant amine production.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == functional and phylogenetic characterization of vaginolysin, the human-specific cytolysin from gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == pore-forming toxins are essential to the virulence of a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is a bacterial species associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv) and its significant adverse sequelae, including preterm  birth and acquisition of human immunodeficiency virus. g. vaginalis makes a protein toxin that generates host immune responses and has been hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of bv. we demonstrate that g. vaginalis produces  a toxin (vaginolysin [vly]) that is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (cdc) family, most closely related to intermedilysin from streptococcus intermedius. consistent with this predicted relationship, vly lyses target cells  in a species-specific manner, dependent upon the complement regulatory molecule cd59. in addition to causing erythrocyte lysis, vly activates the conserved epithelial p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and induces interleukin-8 production by human epithelial cells. transfection of human cd59 into nonsusceptible cells renders them sensitive to vly-mediated lysis. in addition, a single amino acid substitution in the vly undecapeptide [vly(p480w)] generates a  toxoid that does not form pores, and introduction of the analogous proline residue into another cdc, pneumolysin, significantly decreases its cytolytic activity. further investigation of the mechanism of action of vly may improve understanding of the functions of the cdc family as well as diagnosis and therapy for bv.

TI  == [protease and phospholipase activities of candida albicans isolated from vaginal  secretions with different ph values].
AB  == even though vulvovaginal candidiasis and bacterial vaginosis are seldom simultaneously found, we have detected this association at an above average frequency. thus, we set out to study the activity of proteinases and phospholipases, virulence factors of candida albicans, to assess their role in the above mentioned association. of a total of 70 candida isolates were retrieved from samples of vaginal secretions analyzed at our diagnostic service, 65 were identified as c. albicans (a group of n=26 obtained from clinical samples of ph>4.5 and a group of n=39 from clinical samples of ph=or<4.5). the evaluation of phospholipases activity was performed on malt agar and sabouraud dextrose agar with the addition of egg yolk as substrate. the proteolytic activity was detected on plates of agar base medium with the addition of bovine albumin serum as substrate as sole nitrogen source. phospholipases activity was essentially the same in both groups of samples (p=0.2003). proteolytic activity was detected in 61.5% of the isolates from the group with ph=or<4.5 and in 96.2% in the group with ph>4.5; being the former much higher than the latter (p=0.0001). based on these results we postulate that the simultaneous occurrence of bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis could be related to the proteolytic activity but unrelated to phospholipases activity.

TI  == natural antimicrobials and their role in vaginal health: a short review.
AB  == lactobacillus species maintain the vaginal ecosystem in a healthy condition by production of antimicrobial substances. depletion of lactobacilli in the vagina results in bacterial vaginosis (bv), where the normal flora is replaced by several bacterial pathogens, usually gardnerella vaginalis and obligate anaerobes. bv may cause complications such as premature labor, low birth weight and increased risk of hiv acquisition. the currently recommended antibiotic treatments for bv are not always effective and often lead to reoccurrence of the  infection. in many cases, this is due to the antibiotic-resistant forms of the pathogens. therefore, there is an interest in the development of treatments using antimicrobials derived primarily from lactobacillus spp., such as ribosomally produced antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) and lactic acid. these substances  effectively inhibit pathogenic bacteria, are safe and do not pose any threat to healthy vaginal lactobacillus spp. it may be possible to find an effective treatment against bv while reducing the infection's reoccurrence and the treatment-related complications through hurdle technology. this would be achieved by combining antimicrobials produced by lactobacillus spp. with different natural antimicrobials obtained from plants or other non-pathogenic organisms.

TI  == quantitative determination by real-time pcr of four vaginal lactobacillus species, gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae indicates an inverse relationship between l. gasseri and l. iners.
AB  == background: most studies of the vaginal microflora have been based on culture or  on qualitative molecular techniques. here we applied existing real-time pcr formats for lactobacillus crispatus, l. gasseri and gardnerella vaginalis and developed new formats for atopobium vaginae, l. iners and l. jensenii to obtain a quantitative non culture-based determination of these species in 71 vaginal samples from 32 pregnant and 28 non-pregnant women aged between 18 and 45 years.  results: the 71 vaginal microflora samples of these women were categorized, using the ison and hay criteria, as refined by verhelst et al. (2005), as follows: grade ia: 8 samples, grade iab: 10, grade ib: 13, grade i-like: 10, grade ii: 11, grade iii: 12 and grade iv: 7.l. crispatus was found in all but 5 samples and was the most frequent lactobacillus species detected. a significantly lower concentration of l. crispatus was found in grades ii (p < 0.0001) and iii (p = 0.002) compared to grade i. l. jensenii was found in all grades but showed higher concentration in grade iab than in grade ia (p = 0.024). a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were present in high concentrations in grade iii, with log10 median concentrations (log10 mc), respectively of 9.0 and 9.2 cells/ml. twenty (38.5%) of the 52 g. vaginalis positive samples were also positive for a. vaginae. in grade ii we found almost no l. iners (log10 mc: 0/ml) but a high concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 8.7/ml). by contrast, in grade iii we found a high concentration of l. iners (log10 mc: 8.3/ml) and a low concentration of l. gasseri (log10 mc: 0/ml). these results show a negative association between l. gasseri and l. iners (r = -0.397, p = 0.001) and between l. gasseri and a. vaginae (r = -0.408, p < 0.0001). conclusion: in our study we found a clear negative association between l. iners and l. gasseri and between a. vaginae and l. gasseri. our results do not provide support for the generally held proposition that grade ii is an intermediate stage between grades i and iii, because l. gasseri, abundant in grade ii is not predominant in grade iii, whereas l. iners,  abundant in grade iii is present only in low numbers in grade ii samples.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to explore whether endometrial microbial colonization and plasma cell endometritis are risk factors for adverse pregnancy  outcomes, and whether these outcomes are influenced by interactions between interconceptional antibiotics and the micro-flora. study design: subgroup analyses of data from a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a course of metronidazole plus azithromycin given every 4 months to women with a prior preterm delivery to prevent recurrent preterm delivery. endometrial cultures and histology were obtained at randomization and repeated 2 weeks after  the first treatment. fifty-nine on antibiotics versus 65 on placebo had pregnancy outcomes. prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (pregnancy loss or preterm birth < 37 weeks) was stratified by treatment group and endometrial characteristics. subgroups were assessed and screened for potential interaction (p values for significance set a priori at < .01), prior to formal statistical testing for interaction (p values < .05). results: the prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcome was 62.7% in the presence of endometrial microbial colonization at baseline (any microbe) and 50% in the absence of colonization (rr = 1.25; 99%  ci 0.42-3.7). prevalence of adverse pregnancy outcomes was 61.9% with plasma cell endometritis, and 70.8% without; rr = 0.87 (0.50-1.5). there was a nonsignificant reduction in adverse pregnancy outcome in the absence of gardnerella vaginalis or gram-negative rods with rr (95% ci) = 0.60 (0.3-1.2) and 0.66 (0.4-1.2), respectively. in the presence of these microbes, antibiotics appeared to increase adverse outcomes: rr = 1.5 (1.1-2.0) and 1.5 (1.1-2.1), respectively. this reversal of impact represents a crossover interaction. conclusion: neither baseline endometrial microbial colonization nor plasma cell endometritis were risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcome. however, colonization with specific microbes interacted with antibiotics to increase adverse outcomes.

TI  == bacterial colonization in suspected sexually abused children.
AB  == objective: previous studies concluded that symptomatic prepubertal children with  gardnerella vaginalis infection should be investigated for child sexual abuse. gardnerella vaginalis is only one out of a group of organism that cause bacterial vaginosis. the aim of the study was to report the frequency of bacterial colonization as well as sexually transmitted diseases and to correlate these data with patient characteristics. methods: data were collected from 1996 to 2006. medical records of 180 girls, median age at first sexual abuse 7.44 years (range  1-16, sd 3.937), have been evaluated retrospectively. spss software 12.0 has been used for statistical analysis. results: only 18.3% of patients complained of vaginal discharge or pruritus. sexually transmitted diseases were documented: gonorrhoea 1 (1.8%, 56 tested), chlamydia trachomatis 1 (1.6%, 62 tested), syphilis 0 (0%, 5 tested), trichomonas vaginalis 1 (0.7%, 136 tested) and hiv 0 (0%, 27 tested). bacterial colonization were documented (121 tested): gardnerella vaginalis 29 (24%), enterobacteriaceae 50 (41.3%), haemophilus influenzae 11 (9.1%), streptococcus a haemolyticus 35 (28.9%), streptococcus group b 8 (6.6%),  staphylococcus koag neg. 37 (30.6%), staphylococcus aureus 10 (8.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (4.1%), bacteroides 19 (15.7%), prevotella 24 (19.8%), klebsiella 4  (3.3%), corynebacteria 20 (16.5%) and ureaplasma 9 (7.4%). conclusions: sexually  transmitted diseases are infrequent in children suspected for child sexual abuse. bacterial colonization is common, however, not correlated with clinical symptoms  (except for bacteroides) and hymenal/vaginal injuries.

TI  == symptomatic candidiasis: using self sampled vaginal smears to establish the presence of candida, lactobacilli, and gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == in a prospective cohort study, 10 symptomatic women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis were taught how to prepare vaginal smears of their own vaginal fluids on days 7, 14, 21, and 28. the 40 smears were stained with the pas-method and examined by three different cytopathologists for presence of candida. thereafter, the smears were restained with giemsa-stain to determine presence of lactobacilli, gardnerella vaginalis ("clue cells") and neutrophils. all three cytopathologists unequivocally established candida blastospores and (pseudo)hyphae in 27 out of the 40 pas-stained vaginal smears, whereas in the remaining 13 smears candida was not found. all 10 patients had candida in their smears during the second half of their menstrual cycle.self sampled smears prove  to be reliable for establishing the presence of candida in symptomatic patients with candidiasis. candida is associated with a lactobacillus-predominated vaginal flora, but with the absence of gardnerella vaginalis. further studies may be directed towards the interaction between the various members of the vaginal flora. this study should open molecular methodology for determining the possible  interactions of lactobacilli and candida.

TI  == effect of biofilm phenotype on resistance of gardnerella vaginalis to hydrogen peroxide and lactic acid.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis is the most common vaginal disorder worldwide. certain lactobacilli produce h2o2 and lactic acid, which normally suppress growth of anaerobes; however, in bacterial vaginosis, gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobes proliferate, and the number of lactobacilli decreases. g. vaginalis colonizes the vaginal epithelium as a biofilm, which likely plays a role in colonization and relapsing infection. study design: we developed an in vitro model for g. vaginalis biofilm formation and compared susceptibilities of biofilms vs planktonic cultures to h2o2 and lactic acid. the structure and composition of the biofilm matrix were studied in order to design a method for biofilm dissolution. results: biofilms tolerated 5-fold and 4-8 fold higher concentrations of h2o2 and lactic acid (respectively) than planktonic cultures. proteolytic dissolution of biofilms reduced sensitivity to h2o2 and lactic acid.  conclusion: increased tolerance to h2o2 and lactic acid suggests that biofilm formation contributes to the survival of g. vaginalis in the presence of lactobacilli.

TI  == targeted pcr for detection of vaginal bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == several novel bacterial species have been detected in subjects with bacterial vaginosis (bv) by using broad-range pcr assays, but this approach is insensitive  for detecting minority species. we developed a series of taxon-directed 16s rrna  gene pcr assays for more sensitive detection of key vaginal bacteria. we sought to determine the prevalence of each species in the vagina, its association with bv, and the utility of pcr for the microbiological diagnosis of bv. targeted pcr  assays were developed for 17 vaginal bacterial species and applied to 264 vaginal-fluid samples from 81 subjects with and 183 subjects without bv. the results were compared to those of two widely accepted methods for diagnosing bv,  the use of clinical findings (amsel criteria) and the interpretation of vaginal-fluid gram stains (nugent criteria). leptotrichia/sneathia, atopobium vaginae, an eggerthella-like bacterium, megasphaera species, and three novel bacteria in the order clostridiales are among the bacterial species significantly associated with bv. pcr detection of either a megasphaera species or one of the clostridiales bacteria yielded a sensitivity of 99% and a specificity of 89% for  diagnosis of bv compared to the amsel clinical criteria and a sensitivity of 95.9% and a specificity of 93.7% compared to the nugent criteria (gram stain). pcr detection of one or more fastidious bacterial species is a more reliable indicator of bv than detection of bacteria, such as gardnerella vaginalis, previously linked to bv, highlighting the potential of pcr for the diagnosis of bv.

TI  == probiotics for the treatment of women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this review considers whether probiotics are effective agents for the treatment and/or prevention of bacterial vaginosis (bv). there seems to be an association between the absence of, or low concentrations of, vaginal lactobacilli and the development of bv. many studies have suggested that the presence of h2o2-producing vaginal lactobacilli may protect against bv, although some studies do not support this hypothesis. in-vitro studies have suggested that certain specific strains of lactobacilli are able to inhibit the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to the vaginal epithelium and/or produce h2o2, lactic acid and/or bacteriocins, which inhibit the growth of bacteria causing bv. clinical trials showed that intra-vaginal administration of lactobacillus acidophilus for 6-12 days, or oral administration of l. acidophilus or lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14 for 2 months, resulted in the cure of bv (defined as a 0-1 positive score according to amsel's criteria), and/or reduced the recurrences of bv, and/or caused an increase in vaginal lactobacilli and restoration of a normal vaginal microbiota, significantly more frequently than did a placebo, acetic acid or no treatment. however, several trials have found no significant difference in the cure rate of bv and in the number of vaginal lactobacilli after intra-vaginal instillation of lactobacilli when compared with  the effect of a placebo or oestrogen. thus, although the available results concerning the effectiveness of the administration of lactobacilli for the treatment of bv are mostly positive, it cannot yet be concluded definitively that probiotics are useful for this purpose.

TI  == alloscardovia omnicolens gen. nov., sp. nov., from human clinical samples.
AB  == the taxonomic position of 12 isolates tentatively assigned to the genus bifidobacterium on the basis of a limited phenotypic characterization was examined. the isolates were collected between 1978 and 2005 in belgium, sweden and norway, and originated from various human clinical samples, including urine,  blood, urethra, oral cavity, tonsil, and abscesses of lung and aortic valve. on the basis of band number and clustering analysis, repetitive dna element-based pcr fingerprinting using the boxa1r and (gtg)(5) primers indicated that the clinical isolates represented a taxon probably not belonging to the genus bifidobacterium. analysis of 16s rrna gene sequence similarities revealed that the isolates were most closely affiliated to parascardovia denticolens lmg 18312(t) (93.0-93.2 %), scardovia inopinata lmg 18313(t) (92.9-93.1 %) and other  members of the bifidobacteriaceae, indicating that the isolates belong to a novel genus within that family. this observation was further substantiated by the results of partial sequencing of the heat-shock protein 60 gene (hsp60) and determination of the dna g+c contents (47.3-48.3 mol%). members of the novel taxon can be phenotypically distinguished from s. inopinata, p. denticolens and gardnerella vaginalis by the ability to grow on agar under aerobic conditions and on the basis of positive reactions for acid production from l-arabinose, raffinose, salicin and d-xylose. unambiguous phenotypic differentiation from aeriscardovia aeriphila and bifidobacterium species may be difficult, so phenotypic analyses should be complemented by molecular methods. the values for dna-dna binding among four members of the novel genus were in the range of 89-100 %, indicating that the strains should be considered as a single novel species of  a novel genus, for which the name alloscardovia omnicolens gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain of alloscardovia omnicolens is ccug 31649(t) (=lmg 23792(t)).

TI  == altered expression of adhesion molecules in inflammatory cervical smears.
AB  == objective: the aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of pan-cadherin and beta-catenin in cervical smears with various types of infectious agents. patients and methods: cervical smears obtained from 53 women, aged 21-65  years, with a diagnosis of specific inflammation were examined in our study. eighteen subjects were infected by candida albicans, 18 by gardnerella vaginalis, nine by bacteroides spp. and eight by chlamydia trachomatis. all infectious agents found in the smears were at the same time confirmed by the microbiological laboratory methods. we performed a biotin-streptavidin-peroxidase immunocytochemical method using anti-beta-catenin (clone 12f7) and anti-pan-cadherin (pan, polyclonal) antibodies. results: aberrant expression of pan-cadherin was found in the cytoplasmic membrane of glandular, metaplastic, superficial and intermediate squamous cells in all types of infections. with regard to beta-catenin, this was expressed in majority (90%) of glandular and metaplastic cells in all types of infections and in a small proportion (15%) of superficial and intermediate squamous cells in infections caused by c. albicans and g. vaginalis. conclusion: our data show that infectious agents may cause alterations in the expression and distribution of these adhesive molecules, which can be recognized in cervical smears. additional studies in larger sets of patients should help clarify this issue further.

TI  == rapid characterization of the normal and disturbed vaginal microbiota by application of 16s rrna gene terminal rflp fingerprinting.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a prevalent infection in women of reproductive age associated with numerous sequelae, including preterm delivery, amniotic fluid infections and an increased risk of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases. the  vaginal microbiota in bv patients is characterized by a shift from lactobacilli to a diverse spectrum of mostly anaerobic bacteria. in this study, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) was used to characterize the vaginal bacterial communities from 50 women with bv and 20 healthy subjects. in the bv samples, 23 species or phylotypes from 17 genera could be identified, including atopobium vaginae, megasphaera sp., lactobacillus iners, gardnerella vaginalis and three recently described phylotypes from the order clostridiales. the number of detected species or phylotypes was on average 6.3 per sample (range 2-14). in contrast, in normal samples, only lactobacillus species could be identified. in conclusion, t-rflp provides a rapid and reliable technique to investigate the diversity of the predominant vaginal microbiota and allows differentiation of the flora of bv and healthy women. as such, t-rflp may be helpful both in the diagnosis of bv from vaginal fluids and in a better understanding of the bacterial succession involved in the aetiology of bv.

TI  == [biotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns of gardnerella vaginalis strains isolated from healthy women and women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == as gardnerella vaginalis is accepted as a member of normal vaginal flora, it is one of the dominant species which has been related to bacterial vaginosis (bv). the aim of this study was to determine the isolation rate, biotypes and antibiotic resistance patterns of g.vaginalis from the vaginal swab samples of 408 women who were admitted to the outpatient clinics of family planning center.  hippurate hydrolysis, lipase and beta-galactosidase tests were performed for biotyping the isolates, and agar dilution (for metronidazole) and disk diffusion  (for clindamycin) tests were used for the detection of antibiotic resistance patterns. as a result, by nugent's bv scoring protocol, 122 (29.9%), 20 (29.4%),  137 (33.6%), and 18 (4.4%) of the women were diagnosed as bv, intermediate form,  normal vaginal flora (nvf) and mycotic vaginosis, respectively. the overall isolation rate of g.vaginalis was found as 23% (94/408). of them, 56.4% (53/94) and 8.5% (8/94) were isolated from samples of bv cases and subjects with nvf, respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). the biotyping results showed that the most frequently detected types were biotype 1 (44%), 5 (20%) and 4 (18%). there was no statistically significant difference between the biotype distribution of bv patients and the subjects who have nvf (p=0.687). the results of antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that 70% and  53% of the isolates were resistant to metronidazole and clindamycin, respectively. it was of interest that mic values for metronidazole was > or =128  microg/ml in 57% of resistant strains. the data of this study has emphasized that the metronidazole resistance is very high in our population, and the large scale  studies are needed to clarify the relationship between bv and g.vaginalis biotypes, which can be found in the normal vaginal flora.

AB  == objective: this study was undertaken to examine the influence of coinfections on  vaginal innate and adaptive immunity, and microbial enzyme activities of pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). study design: the population consisted of 265 singleton pregnant women in early gestation (<20 weeks) with bv (nugent 7-10) who had vaginal fluid collected for measurement of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta) and il-8 concentrations, number of neutrophils, immunoglobulin a against gardnerella vaginalis (anti-gvh iga), and activities of microbial sialidase and prolidase. results: among women with bv, median levels of vaginal il-1beta (4-fold, p = .005), il-8 (4-fold, p < .001), and neutrophils (6-fold, p = .013) were greatly increased in women with t vaginalis with respect to women without any coinfection. yeast increased the level of il-8 (5-fold, p < .001), but not il-1beta (p = .239) and neutrophils (p = .060). chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae had no effect on vaginal cytokines. none of the coinfections influenced vaginal anti-gvh iga, sialidase and prolidase activities. conclusion: the strong proinflammatory cytokine induction by t. vaginalis may contribute to the observed increase in preterm birth among bv positive women coinfected with t. vaginalis treated with metronidazole.

TI  == an altered immunity hypothesis for the development of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the hypothesis is advanced that the transition from a lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microflora to a microflora characteristic of bacterial vaginosis (bv), as well as development of the adverse consequences of bv in some women but not in others, are due to alterations in innate immunity. a microbial-induced inhibition of toll-like receptor expression and/or activity may block induction of proinflammatory immunity and lead to the proliferation of atypical vaginal bacteria. a lack of 70-kda heat-shock protein production and release in response  to abnormal flora would compound this failure to activate antimicrobial immune responses. a deficit in vaginal mannose-binding lectin concentrations would further decrease the capacity for microbial killing and increase the likelihood of bacterial migration from the vagina to the upper genital tract.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus challenge on gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infectious condition in women. it is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal ph, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable g. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). they maintained  these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produced the biggest displacement of gardnerella. this was not due to ph, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain l. reuteri rc-14, high amounts by l. crispatus 33820 and not at all by l. rhamnosus gr-1. deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense gardnerella biofilm pods. for the first time, a strain of l. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. it was found to disrupt gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than l. reuteri rc-14. these studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == treatment of urinary tract infection by gardnerella vaginalis: a comparison of oral metronidazole versus ampicillin.
AB  == treatment options for bacterial vaginosis are numerous, however for urinary tract infection (uti) by gardnerella vaginalis have been not reported. our purpose was  to compare the efficacy and treatment complications of oral metronidazole versus  oral ampicillin for treatment of this condition in a prospective randomized, nonblinded study. fifty-seven women who had symptoms of uti and a positive culture for g. vaginalis were enrolled in the study. only forty-five subjects were considered valuable: 25 treated with oral metronidazole 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, and 20 with oral ampicillin 2 g for 10 days. positive culture was defined as the presence of 10(4) or 10(5) ufc/ml of g. vaginalis in pure culture  in hbt media. the clinical and bacteriological cure rates were 92% and 96% respectively for metronidazole and 90% in both for ampicillin. chi-squared analysis reveals no statistical significance between two treatments. adverse events were common in-patients treated with metronidazole whereas relatively few  side effects were experienced in-patients treated with ampicillin. ampicillin is  effective, safe and well-tolerated therapy for uti by g. vaginalis. in contrast oral metronidazole is effective but no safe and bad-tolerated therapy for the same condition.

TI  == lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginal microbiota of healthy women inhibit prevotella bivia and gardnerella vaginalis in coculture and cell culture.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate how human vaginal isolates of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus crispatus inhibit the vaginosis-associated pathogens gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia. results show that all the strains in coculture condition reduced the viability of g. vaginalis and p. bivia, but with differing  degrees of efficacy. the treatment of g. vaginalis- and p. bivia-infected cultured human cervix epithelial hela cells with l. gasseri strain ks120.1 culture or cell-free culture supernatant (cfcs) results in the killing of the pathogens that are adhering to the cells. the mechanism of the killing activity is not attributable to low ph and the presence of lactic acid alone, but rather to the presence of hydrogen peroxide and proteolytic enzyme-resistant compound(s) present in the cfcss. in addition, coculture of g. vaginalis or p. bivia with l.  gasseri ks120.1 culture or ks120.1 bacteria results in inhibition of the adhesion of the pathogens onto hela cells.

TI  == etiologic agents of cervicovaginitis in turkish women.
AB  == objective: to investigate the distribution of microbiologic agents causing cervicovaginitis. methods: we conducted the study between october 2002 and december 2004 in abant izzet baysal university, duzce school of medicine hospital, turkey. the samples were obtained from the posterior vaginal fornix and cervix by swabs in 828 patients. direct microscopic examination, culture and enzyme immune assay (eia) methods were performed in all patients for diagnosis of microbiologic agents. results: gardnerella vaginalis (g. vaginalis) were diagnosed in 254 (30.7%) patients, candida albicans (c. albicans) in 152 (18.4%), candida glabrata (c. glabrata) in 36 (4.3%), candida species in 52 (6.3%), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) in 62 (7.5%), streptococcus group b in 28 (3.4%), escherichia coli (e. coli) in 42 (5.1%), klebsiella species in 24 (2.9%), and streptococcus group d in 8 (1%) patients in culture. less frequent enterobacteria in 30 (3.6%) were: pseudomonas species, proteus species enterobacter species, hafnia alvei and nonfermenter species. neisseria gonorrheae (n. gonorrheae) was detected in one patient (0.1%) in culture. the chlamydia trachomatis (c. trachomatis) antigen was detected by eia methods in 130 (15.7%) patients and trichomonas vaginalis (t. vaginalis) was observed in 8 (1%) patients by direct microscopic examination. conclusion: performing the etiologic diagnosis of cervicovaginitis is necessary in order to take appropriate therapeutic and preventive measures. therefore, we recommend g. vaginalis, c. albicans and c. trachomatis should be investigated in patients having a diagnosis of cervicovaginitis in our population, since these were detected in a considerable number of cases. additionally, c. glabrata and t. vaginalis should be kept in mind as possible pathogens.

TI  == reversible deficiency of antimicrobial polypeptides in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common condition associated with increased risk of sexually transmitted diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus infections. in contrast, vulvovaginal candidiasis has a much weaker association with sexually transmitted diseases. we found that vaginal lavage fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis is deficient in antimicrobial polypeptides and antimicrobial  activity compared to fluid from healthy women or women with vulvovaginal candidiasis. effective treatment normalized the concentrations of antimicrobial polypeptides in both bacterial vaginosis and in vulvovaginal candidiasis, suggesting that the abnormalities were a result of the diseases. unlike in vulvovaginal candidiasis, the neutrophil attractant chemokine interleukin-8 (il-8) was not increased in bacterial vaginosis, accounting for low concentrations of neutrophil-derived defensins in vaginal fluid. in organotypic cultures of human vaginal epithelium containing dendritic cells, treatment with lactobacillus jensenii, a typical vaginal resident, induced the synthesis of il-8 mrna and the epithelial human beta-defensin-2 mrna, but a typical bacterial vaginosis pathogen, gardnerella vaginalis, had no effect. when the two bacteria were combined, gardnerella vaginalis did not interfere with the immunostimulatory effect of lactobacillus jensenii. the loss of normal immunostimulatory flora in bacterial vaginosis is thus associated with a local deficiency of multiple innate immune factors, and this deficiency could predispose individuals to sexually transmitted diseases.

TI  == selection and identification of anaerobic lactobacilli producing inhibitory compounds against vaginal pathogens.
AB  == two strains of lactobacillus crispatus (15l08 and 21l07) and one strain of lactobacillus jensenii (5l08) were selected from amongst 100 isolates from the vaginas of healthy premenopausal women for properties relevant to mucosal colonization and the production of h2o2 and/or bacteriocin-like compound. all three strains self-aggregated and adhered to vaginal epithelial cells, displacing well-known vaginal pathogens, such as gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. lactobacillus crispatus 15l08 was characterized as a potential h2o2 producer. a high level of bacteriocin-like compound was synthesized by l. jensenii 5l08, with a bactericidal mode of action for g. vaginalis, c. albicans and escherichia coli. however, h2o2-dependent activity alone was not sufficient to inhibit the growth of c. albicans. simultaneous actions of h2o2 and bacteriocin-like compound produced by lactobacilli may be important for antagonizing pathogenic bacteria. these strains of lactobacilli may be excellent candidates for eventual use as probiotics to restore the normal microbial communities in the vaginal ecosystem.

TI  == preterm birth due to maternal infection: causative pathogens and modes of prevention.
AB  == preterm birth represents a major problem for modern obstetrics due to its increasing frequency and the accompanying socioeconomic impact. although several  maternal characteristics related to preterm birth have been identified, the etiology in most cases remains inadequately understood. various microorganisms have been linked to the pathogenesis of preterm birth. microbes may reach the amniotic cavity and fetus by ascending from the vagina and cervix, by hematogenous distribution through the placenta, by migration from the abdominal cavity through the fallopian tubes, or through invasive medical procedures. organisms commonly cultured from the amniotic cavity following preterm delivery include ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, bacteroides spp., gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, and group b hemolytic streptococci. several trials have examined the effect of antibiotic administration to patients with preterm labor and intact membranes, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, genital mycoplasmal infection, asymptomatic bacteriuria, and bacterial vaginosis. the results of such studies, which were variable and often conflicting, are discussed here.

TI  == the association of atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis with bacterial vaginosis and recurrence after oral metronidazole therapy.
AB  == background: we investigated associations between atopobium vaginae and bacterial  vaginosis (bv) and the role that a. vaginae plays in recurrent bv after oral metronidazole therapy. methods: women with abnormal vaginal discharge or odor were enrolled in a cross-sectional study (n=358); the proportion of those infected with gardnerella vaginalis and a. vaginae was determined by polymerase chain reaction. women with bv (nugent score [ns] 7-10 or 4-6 with > or =3 amsel criteria; n=139) were treated with oral metronidazole (400 mg twice a day for 7 days) and examined at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months or until they reached an ns of 7-10  and recurrence of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis infection was established. results: a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were highly sensitive for bv--96% (95% confidence interval [ci], 91%-98%) and 99% (95% ci, 97%-100%), respectively. however, a. vaginalis was more specific for bv (77% [95% ci, 71%-82%]) than was g. vaginalis  (35% [95% ci, 29%-42%]). g. vaginalis was detected in 100% and a. vaginae in 75%  of women with recurrent bv; higher organism loads were present in women with recurrent bv. a. vaginae was rarely detected without g. vaginalis, and women in whom both organisms were detected had higher rates of recurrent bv (83%) than women infected with g. vaginalis only (38%) (p<.001). conclusions: infection with a. vaginae is more specific for bv than infection with g. vaginalis. the higher recurrence rates in women in whom both a. vaginae and g. vaginalis were detected  suggest that a. vaginae makes a significant contribution to bv. however, its etiological role remains unclear.

TI  == [sialidase activity in women with bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (vb) is a syndrome characterized by overgrowth of endogenous  gram negative bacterial flora and the lack of the normal flora. within bacterial  enzymes, sialidases have been considered a virulence factor of many pathogenic microorganisms colonizing the different mucous membranes. their presence in vaginal discharges can be correlated with vb. the aim of this study was to detect the activity of this enzyme in women with this syndrome and without clinical evidence of genital infection. out of a total 112 women studied, 51 were patients with vb and the other 61 women presented normal vaginal flora. for the quantification of enzyme activity, the technique based on the enzymatic hydrolysis of a derivative acid of the acetyl metoxifenil muramic acid was used.  in the studied population both groups shared values from 0.5 to 5.1 nmoles of metoxifenol, whereas only 11 out of 52 patients with vb (21.17%), registered more than 5.1 nmoles. the presence of sialidase activity is not enough to confirm vb,  except for values greater than 5.5 nmoles of the metoxifenol produced in the enzymatic reaction.

TI  == prebiotic effects of oligosaccharides on selected vaginal lactobacilli and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to select endogenous human vaginal lactobacilli strains on the basis of the main probiotic properties observed in the vaginal environment in order to use them for the evaluation of the potential prebiotic properties of oligosaccharides. from vaginal samples of 50 women with a normal flora, 17 lactobacilli strains were first isolated because of their high level of hydrogen peroxide production. then six strains were selected mainly for their ability (i) to adhere to vaginal cells, (ii) to produce compounds in sufficient amount, such as lactic acid, having an inhibitory action on pathogens, and less importantly, (iii) to demonstrate arginine deiminase activity. these six strains  were found to belong to three distinct species: lactobacillus crispatus, l. jensenii and l. vaginalis. one strain of each species was chosen as a potential vaginal probiotic strain with regard to our criteria. these three strains were then used to evaluate the prebiotic properties of different oligosaccharide series: two fructooligosaccharide series (fos actilight and fos raftilose) and two glucooligosaccharide series varying by their osidic linkages (alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos and alpha-1,2/alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos). the test was based on the ability of the oligosaccharides to promote the growth of the three beneficial strains selected but not of pathogenic microorganisms often encountered in urogenital infections such as candida albicans, escherichia coli and gardnerella vaginalis. oligosaccharide hydrolysis was followed by hplc analysis. this revealed that two oligosaccharide series (fos actilight dp3 and all alpha-1,6/alpha-1,4 gos dp > or = 4) were used only by the lactobacilli strains, the pathogenic microorganisms being unable to metabolise them. the selected lactobacilli and oligosaccharides are good candidates for incorporation  in a formula to prevent vaginal infections.

AB  == goals: the goals of this research were 2-fold: (1) to determine whether a commercially available probiotic mixture (vsl-3) could survive and grow in a continuous culture system simulating the vaginal environment and (2) to determine whether the probiotic mixture was capable of suppressing the growth of a known vaginal vault pathogen, gardnerella vaginalis. background: an abnormal vaginal microflora, such as that associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv) is an important health issue for women. in addition, the association of this condition with preterm labor and delivery suggests that control of bv may impact the number of preterm births. interventional trials with antibiotics have received mixed reviews and other interventional options, including the use of probiotics, are being considered. study: a well-documented continuous culture system has been used to determine whether vsl-3 can survive and grow in conditions simulating a vaginal environment. in addition, the ability of vsl-3 to inhibit the growth of a known vaginal vault pathogen, g. vaginalis, has been determined. results: the probiotic mixture was shown to survive and maintain itself within the fermentation vessel of the continuous culture system over an extended period of time. this mixture, when challenged with a known pathogen, was also shown to suppress the growth of g. vaginalis. conclusions: it may be feasible to use probiotics as interventional therapy to suppress the growth of pathogens within the vaginal vault associated with bv.

TI  == throwing the dice for the diagnosis of vaginal complaints?
AB  == background: vaginitis is among the most common conditions women are seeking medical care for. although these infections can easily be treated, the relapse rate is high. this may be due to inadequate use of the diagnostic potential. methods: we evaluated the misjudgement rate of the aetiology of vaginal complaints. a total of 220 vaginal samples from women with a vaginal complaint were obtained and analysed for numbers of total lactobacilli, h2o2-producing lactobacilli, total aerobic cell counts and total anaerobic cell counts including bifidobacteria, bacteroides spp., prevotella spp. additionally, the presence of atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, candida spp. and trichomonas vaginalis  was evaluated by dna-hybridisation using the pcr and affirm vpiii microbial identification test, respectively. results: the participating physicians diagnosed bacterial vaginosis (bv) as origin of discomfort in 80 cases, candidiasis in 109 cases and mixed infections in 8 cases. however, a present bv,  defined as lack of h2o2-lactobacilli, presence of marker organisms, such as g. vaginalis, bacteroides spp. or atopobium vaginae, and an elevated ph were identified in only 45 cases of the women examined. candida spp. were detected in  46 cases. interestingly, an elevated ph corresponded solely to the presence of atopobium vaginae, which was detected in 11 cases. conclusion: errors in the diagnosis of bv and candida vulvovaginitis (cv) were high. interestingly, the cases of misjudgement of cv (77%) were more numerous than that of bv (61%). the use of amsel criteria or microscopy did not reduce the number of misinterpretations. the study reveals that the misdiagnosis of vaginal complaints is rather high.

TI  == treatment and management of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy: current and future  perspectives.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis accounts for the majority of cases of vaginal discharge and has been consistently linked to an increased risk of preterm delivery. bacterial  vaginosis is characterized by the reduced number or absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus spp., which promotes the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, including gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, bacteroides spp.,  and mobiluncus spp. black race, higher-risk sexual activity, frequent vaginal douching and the substantial reduction of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus spp. are the main predictors of bacterial vaginosis development. clinical- and laboratory-based bacterial vaginosis diagnostic tests are widely used to screen for bacterial vaginosis but, more recently, office-based bacterial vaginosis screening tools have been developed. although systemic treatment for bacterial vaginosis with metronidazole or clindamycin has been demonstrated to be effective in the short-term cure of bacterial vaginosis, recurrence of bacterial  vaginosis within 3 months of treatment is common, and treatment for bacterial vaginosis using these strategies has not been effective in reducing the risk of preterm delivery.

AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) has been associated with hiv sexual transmission and increased levels of genital tract hiv rna. we postulated that bv induces the appearance of substances in the genital tract that stimulate hiv expression locally. to test this, we measured hiv rna levels in genital mucosal fluid from women with or without bv (defined by nugent score) and compared them with the ability of those fluids to stimulate hiv expression in the chronically hiv-infected monocytic line u1. the u1 activity was significantly higher in women with bv (median = 1320 pg/ml p24) than in women with normal flora (median = 103 pg/ml p24, p = 0.0001). however, levels of the u1 activity were not significantly associated with levels in the genital tract of hiv rna. levels of the u1 activity were also not associated with levels of gardnerella vaginalis or mycoplasma hominis in genital fluids, suggesting these bacteria were not the source of the activity. thus, while these data show a strong association of u1 stimulatory activity with bv, no influence of the u1 activity on genital tract hiv expression was observed.

TI  == the bacteriology of pre-labour rupture of membranes in a nigerian teaching hospital.
AB  == a prospective case control study that was conducted at the university of ilorin teaching hospital, ilorin, nigeria, between 1st january and 31st december 2002. the purpose of this study was to determine the association and the pattern of bacteria/microorganisms in the aetiology of pre-labour premature rupture of membrane (prom) in this centre. a total of 108 cases of prom and 98 control cases that presented between 37 completed weeks' and 40 weeks' gestation were analysed. pathogens were isolated in 48 patients, giving a recovery rate of 44.4%. the common pathogens include gardnerella vaginalis (29.1%), candida (23.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (18.7%). others were streps. pyogenes (16.6%), coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) (6.3%) and klebsiella (6.3%). only candida and s.  aureus were isolated in the controls. ofloxacin and azithromycin were 100% active against all the isolated pathogens, while ampicillin was the least active. g. vaginalis was the most sensitive among the isolates while cons and klebsiella were the least sensitive. it is evident in this study that some pathogens were associated with prom and that g. vaginalis was the most common organism and azithromycin was the only antibiotic with 100% sensitivity. we suggest that metronidazole should be added to azithromycin to cover for anaerobes in cases of  prom, where facilities for screening for anaerobes are not available.

TI  == [the correlation of inflammation and epithelial changes in the pap smears of cervix uteri].
AB  == a modification of the bethesda system classification of cytologic findings of uterine cervix named zagreb 1990 has been accepted in croatia as a unique classification, the use of which has begun after the publication and printing of  the new, uniform method of cytologic examination. aim: the aim of this study was  to assess the number and type of cytologic abnormalities of uterine cervix classified according to zagreb 1990, on routinely examined pap smears during the  6-year period, and to investigate the connection of these abnormalities with lower genital tract infections. material and methods: the retrospective study included pap smears from the city of zagreb and from the town of imotski. a total of 59901 pap smears (patients aged 17-79) were routinely examined: the cytopathologic diagnosis of cin i or higher recorded in 3664 (6.12%) of them. the control group consisted of 401 pap smears of age-matched women referred by the same gynecologists and free from cytologic abnormalities. the most frequently diagnosed epithelial change was cin 1 (84.57% of all epithelial changes, and 5.17% of total study population), followed by cin ii (10.92%; 0.67%), cin iii (3.11%; 0.19%), and invasive squamous carcinoma (1.31%; 0.08%). endocervical adenocarcinoma was cytologically diagnosed in only 0.0055% of all pap smears examined. inflammation was significantly more common in the group with epithelial dysplasia/carcinoma than in the control group (p < 0.01). of specific causative agents hpv and chlamydia trachomatis were significantly more frequently found in  the group with epithelial dysplasia/carcinoma than in the control group (p < 0.05 both), however, gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis or candida yielded no significant differences. it is concluded that inflammation very likely contributes to the development of precancerous lesions of the cervix, hpv and chlamydia showing strongest correlation, at least in a part of our population.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria associated with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis affects millions of women and is associated with  several serious health conditions. the cause of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood despite numerous studies based on cultures. bacteria in microbial communities can be identified without cultivation by characterizing their ribosomal dna (rdna) sequences. methods: we identified bacteria in samples  of vaginal fluid with a combination of broad-range polymerase-chain-reaction (pcr) amplification of 16s rdna with clone analysis, bacterium-specific pcr assay of 16s rdna, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) performed directly on  vaginal fluid from 27 subjects with bacterial vaginosis and 46 without the condition. twenty-one subjects were studied with the use of broad-range pcr of 16s rdna, and 73 subjects were studied with the use of bacterium-specific pcr. results: women without bacterial vaginosis had 1 to 6 vaginal bacterial species (phylotypes) in each sample (mean, 3.3), as detected by broad-range pcr of 16s rdna, and lactobacillus species were the predominant bacteria noted (83 to 100 percent of clones). women with bacterial vaginosis had greater bacterial diversity (p<0.001), with 9 to 17 phylotypes (mean, 12.6) detected per sample and newly recognized species present in 32 to 89 percent of clones per sample library (mean, 58 percent). thirty-five unique bacterial species were detected in the women with bacterial vaginosis, including several species with no close cultivated relatives. bacterium-specific pcr assays showed that several bacteria  that had not been previously described were highly prevalent in subjects with bacterial vaginosis but rare in healthy controls. fish confirmed that newly recognized bacteria detected by pcr corresponded to specific bacterial morphotypes visible in vaginal fluid. conclusions: women with bacterial vaginosis have complex vaginal infections with many newly recognized species, including three bacteria in the clostridiales order that were highly specific for bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == bacterial flora of the low male genital tract in patients consulting for infertility.
AB  == the physiological aerobic bacterial flora of the low male genital tract was determined. this prospective study was performed on 600 semen specimens collected from 543 asymptomatic males consulting for infertility. semen cultures were sterile in 28.8%, with a polymicrobial flora and/or absence or low titres of ureaplasma urealyticum in 49.3%, and with one or two aerobic and facultative bacteria > or =1 x 10(3) cfu ml(-1) and/or u. urealyticum with titres > or =10(4) ccu ml(-1) (colour changing units) in 21.8%. in standard aerobic cultures, gardnerella vaginalis was the most commonly isolated species (26.1%), followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (15.7%) and streptococcus anginosus (14.2%). ureaplasma urealyticum was absent in 84.5% of semen samples, but when recovered,  high (> or =10(4) ccu ml(-1)) and low titres (< or =10(3) ccu ml(-1)) were counted in 7.2% and 8.3% respectively. of 48 patients, the follow-up of semen cultures showed marked variations in time. this study shows that (i) there was no relationship between the bacterial flora and the leucocytospermia; (ii) low titres of u. urealyticum in semen were not associated with a disturbance of the ecosystem; (iii) the critical threshold for u. urealyticum should be raised to >  or =10(4) cfu ml(-1) and (iv) a positive semen culture should be repeated before  any treatment.

TI  == adherent biofilms in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: bacterial vaginosis is a common infectious disorder. although known since ancient times, little progress has occurred in identifying causal factors.  our aims were to study the bacterial community structure and the spatial organization of microbiota on the epithelial surfaces of vaginal biopsy specimens. methods: we investigated the composition and spatial organization of bacteria associated with the vaginal epithelium in biopsy specimens from 20 patients with bacterial vaginosis and 40 normal premenopausal and postmenopausal  controls using a broad range of fluorescent bacterial group-specific rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes. results: bacterial vaginosis was associated with greater occurrence and higher concentrations of a variety of bacterial groups. however, only gardnerella vaginalis developed a characteristic adherent biofilm that was specific for bacterial vaginosis. conclusion: a biofilm comprised of confluent g vaginalis with other bacterial groups incorporated in the adherent layer is a prominent feature of bacterial vaginosis. level of evidence: ii-2.

TI  == comparison between gram stain and culture for the characterization of vaginal microflora: definition of a distinct grade that resembles grade i microflora and  revised categorization of grade i microflora.
AB  == background: the microbiological diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis is usually made  using nugent's criteria, a useful but rather laborious scoring system based on counting bacterial cell types on gram stained slides of vaginal smears. ison and  hay have simplified the score system to three categories and added a fourth category for microflora with a predominance of the streptococcus cell type. because in the nugent system several cell types are not taken into account for a  final score, we carried out a detailed assessment of the composition of the vaginal microflora in relation to standard gram stain in order the improve the diagnostic value of the gram stain. to this purpose we compared gram stain based  categorization of vaginal smears with i) species specific pcr for the detection of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae and with ii) tdna-pcr for the identification of most cultivable species. results: a total of 515 samples were obtained from 197 pregnant women, of which 403 (78.3%) were categorized as grade  i microflora, 46 (8.9%) as grade ii, 22 (4.3%) as grade iii and 8 (1.6%) as grade iv, according to the criteria of ison and hay. another 36 samples (7.0%) were assigned to the new category 'grade i-like', because of the presence of diphtheroid bacilli cell types. we found that 52.7% of the grade i-like samples contained bifidobacterium spp. while l. crispatus was present in only 2.8% of the samples and g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were virtually absent; in addition, the species diversity of this category was similar to that of grade ii specimens.based on the presence of different lactobacillus cell types, grade i specimens were further characterized as grade ia (40.2%), grade iab (14.9%) and grade ib (44.9%). we found that this classification was supported by the finding  that l. crispatus was cultured from respectively 87.0% and 76.7% of grade ia and  iab specimens while this species was present in only 13.3% of grade ib specimens, a category in which l. gasseri and l. iners were predominant. conclusion: further refinement of gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes within grade i smears (ia, iab and ib) and by adding a separate category, designated grade i-like. a strong correlation was found between grade ia and the presence of l. crispatus and between grade i-like  and the presence of bifidobacteria. this refinement of gram stain based scoring of vaginal smears may be helpful to improve the interpretation of the clinical data in future studies, such as the understanding of response to treatment and recurrence of bacterial vaginosis in some women, and the relationship between bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth.

TI  == a preliminary survey of atopobium vaginae in women attending the dunedin gynaecology out-patients clinic: is the contribution of the hard-to-culture microbiota overlooked in gynaecological disorders?
AB  == preliminary studies have indicated that the recently described bacterium atopobium vaginae may have an association with bacterial vaginosis (bv). fifty-five women attending the gynaecology out-patient's clinic were tested for the presence of this micro-organism, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus and bacteroides species by polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based assays. the frequency of detection was 40%. pcr detection of gardnerella vaginalis with a. vaginae, occurred in 50% of a. vaginae-positive cases. due to the high detection  rate of a. vaginae we believe that it is important to determine whether this and  other hard-to-culture microorganisms have a role in gynaecological disorders.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine if clinical findings and sociodemographic variables among bacterial vaginosis (bv)-positive pregnant women are associated with different microbiologic profiles. study design: pregnant women were assessed for bv by nugent criteria. bv+ women were separated into 6 mutually exclusive microbiologic groups. in unadjusted analyses, we compared (1)  sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, and (2) 3 clinical characteristics among bv+ women with and without mobiluncus (m+ vs m-). unadjusted data were analyzed using the chi-square test. multiple logistic regression was used to assess the likelihood of having clinical signs of bv in women with and without mobiluncus spp while controlling for confounders. results: a total of 1756 bv+ pregnant women were followed. the m+ group (n=702) was significantly more likely than the m- group (n=1054) to be non-hispanic black (80.9% vs 66.2%; p < .0001), older than 21 years (61.7% vs 48.7%; p < .0001), and to have had more than 3 lifetime sexual partners (66.4% vs 54.9%; p < .0001). the m+ group was also more likely to have clue cells on wet mount (63.9% vs 47.2%; p  < .0001) and a positive amine odor after addition of koh (57.2% vs 45.0%; p=.001). there was no difference in other demographic variables or physician diagnosis of abnormal vaginal discharge. in the adjusted analyses for each clinical outcome, all findings were consistent with the unadjusted analyses. conclusion: bv+ pregnant women with mobiluncus spp are more likely to have clue cells present on wet mount, a positive amine odor after koh preparation, and to be older, non-hispanic black, and have had more lifetime sexual partners compared to bv+ women without any mobiluncus species.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to use a novel method that was based on  the application of chaperonin-60 sequencing to describe the vaginal microflora of 16 healthy women. study design: asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. total genomic dna was  isolated from the vaginal swabs. degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction  primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic dna and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. presence of chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. results: sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to lactobacillus spp l. crispatus, l. iners, l. gasseri, l. jensenii, and l. buchneri. other sequences that were identified included representatives of gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to porphyromonas spp and megasphaera spp and sequences identical to c psittaci. conclusion: culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of  greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by  standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that  were not previously associated with vaginal flora.

TI  == utility of amsel criteria, nugent score, and quantitative pcr for gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, and lactobacillus spp. for diagnosis of bacterial  vaginosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinical syndrome presenting with a malodorous vaginal discharge and increased vaginal ph. diagnosis has been based on clinical  amsel criteria and direct gram stain of vaginal secretions. human immunodeficiency virus (hiv)-infected participants in the women's interagency hiv study contributed cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) samples. lactobacilli, gardnerella  vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis in cervicovaginal lavage samples were quantified by pcr. gynecologic evaluation included nugent score and amsel criterion assessment. we compared the gold standard nugent score to amsel criteria and quantitative bacterial pcr for diagnosing bv in 203 cvl samples from women with nugent scores of 7 to 10 (bv group) and 203 samples from women with bv nugent scores of 0 to 3 ("no-bv" group). only 75 of the 203 cvl samples from women with nugent scores of 7 to 10 met positive amsel criteria. increasing levels of g. vaginalis and m. hominis and decreasing levels of lactobacilli were  significantly associated with bv by nugent score. of the group with nugent scores of 7 to 10, 83% and 81% had log(10) g. vaginalis counts and log(10) m. hominis counts greater than 6.81 and 4.82, respectively, while only 30% and 31% of the group with nugent scores of 0 to 3 were above these thresholds, respectively. there was significant overlap in the log(10) lactobacillus counts between the two groups. utilizing all three log(10) bacterial counts (g. vaginalis, m. hominis, and lactobacilli) in our model improved the sensitivity and specificity to 83% and 78%, respectively, in comparison with nugent score. in this cohort, amsel criteria were poorly predictive of bv. pcr quantification of g. vaginalis and m.  hominis from cvl is significantly more sensitive than amsel criteria for diagnosing bv.

TI  == a cluster analysis of bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora and pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == controversy surrounds the association between bacterial vaginosis (bv) and pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). women (n = 1,140) were ascertained at five us centers, enrolled (1999-2001), and followed up for a median of 3 years. serial vaginal swabs were obtained for gram's stain and cultures. pid was defined as 1)  histologic endometritis or 2) pelvic pain and tenderness plus oral temperature >38.8 degrees c, leukorrhea or mucopus, erythrocyte sedimentation rate >15 mm/hour, white blood cell count >10,000, or gonococcal/chlamydial lower genital infection. exploratory factor analysis identified two discrete clusters of genital microorganisms. the first correlated with bv by gram's stain and consisted of the absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and, to  a lesser degree, ureaplasma urealyticum. the second, unrelated to bv by gram's stain, consisted of enterococcus species and escherichia coli. being in the highest tertile in terms of growth of bv-associated microorganisms increased pid  risk (adjusted rate ratio = 2.03, 95% confidence interval: 1.16, 3.53). carriage  of non-bv-associated microorganisms did not increase pid risk. women with heavy growth of bv-associated microorganisms and a new sexual partner appeared to be at particularly high risk (adjusted rate ratio = 8.77, 95% confidence interval: 1.11, 69.2). when identified by microbial culture, a combination of bv-related microorganisms significantly elevated the risk of acquiring pid.

TI  == complexity of vaginal microflora as analyzed by pcr denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis in a patient with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: gardnerella vaginalis has long been the most common pathogen associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). we aimed to test our hypothesis that symptoms and signs of bv do not necessarily indicate colonization by this organism, and often will not respond to standard metronidazole or clindamycin treatment. methods: using a relatively new molecular tool, pcr denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), the vaginal microflora of a woman with recalcitrant signs and symptoms of bv was investigated over a 6-week timeframe. results: the vagina was colonized by pathogenic enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and candida albicans. the detection of the yeast by pcr-dgge is particularly novel and enhances the ability of this tool to examine the true nature of the vaginal microflora. the patient had not responded to antifungal treatment, antibiotic therapy targeted at anaerobic gram-negative pathogens such as gardnerella, nor daily oral probiotic intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg. the failure to find the gg strain in the vagina indicated it did not reach the site,  and the low counts of lactobacilli demonstrated that therapy with this probiotic  did not appear to influence the vaginal flora. conclusions: bv is not well understood in terms of its causative organisms, and further studies appear warranted using non-culture, molecular methods. only when the identities of infecting organisms are confirmed can effective therapy be devized. such therapy  may include the use of probiotic lactobacilli, but only using strains which confer a benefit on the vagina of pre- and postmenopausal women.

TI  == frequency of infectious agents for vaginitis in non- and hysterectomized women.
AB  == the frequency of infectious agents for vaginitis has shown varying results. bacterial vaginosis and candidiasis are infections related to vaginal ph alteration. vaginal ph is related to endocervical ph in pre- and post-menopaused  women, and vaginal ph in hysterectomized women is more acidic than in non-hysterectomized women. the aim of this paper is to verify differences in papanicolaou smear diagnoses of infectious agents in hysterectomized women. a retrospective study was conducted at faculdade de medicina do triangulo mineiro (public tertiary referral centre). a total of 1,579 papanicolaou reports for each group (hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized) was analysed. clue cells, candida sp., trichomonas vaginalis, cytolysis, coccobacilli and lactobacilli were diagnosed by cytological criteria (papanicolaou's method), statistical methods: the chi2 test and linear regression (significance level < 0.05). clue cells decrease with the age in both the groups and are more frequent in non-hysterectomized women with > 59 years. there is an increased frequency of coccobacilli and a decrease of lactobacillus as the age of women increases. the frequency of t. vaginalis is not influenced by hysterectomy but there is a decreased frequency between 40 years and 49 years old. cytolysis was more frequent in women below 40 years old and between 50 years and 59 years old in both groups (p < 0.009). candida sp. is a less common finding between 40 years and 49 years old in both groups and more frequent in hysterectomized women with > 60 years old (p = 0.002). our results showed that the presence of infectious agents for vaginitis in papanicolaou findings is associated with age. the frequency of finding of candida sp. in women above 60 years old may be influenced by hysterectomy.

AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is associated with complications of pregnancy and increased susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) sexual transmission. methods: the ability of genital mucosal fluids from women with bv and of microbial flora associated with bv to induce tumor necrosis factor (tnf)- alpha secretion and toll-like receptor (tlr) 2 and tlr4 mrna expression was assessed. results: primary peripheral-blood mononuclear cells and thp-1 monocytic cells secreted tnf- alpha in response to cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) samples from women with bv. mycoplasma hominis and gardnerella vaginalis also stimulated tnf- alpha secretion. strikingly, cvl samples from women with bv induced up to 60-fold increases in tlr4 mrna expression, compared with cvl samples from women without bv and with bacteria not associated with bv. anti-tnf- alpha antibody blocked increases in tlr4 mrna expression induced by cvl samples from women with bv, indicating that tnf- alpha plays a critical role in induction of tlr4. both tlr2 and tlr4 mrna expression were approximately 60-fold higher in  cells isolated from the lumen of the genital tract than in cervical mucosal tissue, but lumen tlr mrna levels did not change significantly after bv treatment. conclusions: these experiments show that genital mucosal fluids and certain bacteria from women with bv stimulate tnf- alpha secretion and tlr4 mrna  expression, suggesting mechanisms whereby bv affects pregnancy and hiv transmission.

TI  == rifaximin, a peculiar rifamycin derivative: established and potential clinical use outside the gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == rifaximin is a poorly absorbed semisynthetic rifamycin derivative with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity including gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, both aerobes and anaerobes. although originally developed for the treatment of infectious diarrhea, the appreciation of the pathogenic role of gut  bacteria in several organic and functional gastrointestinal diseases has increasingly broadened its clinical use. the availability of a topical formulation (a cream containing 5% of the drug) and the lack of transcutaneous absorption pointed out in both animal and human studies has allowed its topical use in skin infections. furthermore, since the spectrum of antibacterial action of rifaximin includes many organisms (e.g. bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi) causing genital infections, including trichomonas vaginalis and chlamydia trachomatis, its local application in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (bv) has been attempted. finally, since periodontal disease, caused by plaque (an aggregate of various bacteria), can be  considered a 'local' infection, intrapocket rifaximin was tried in the treatment  of periodontal infections. while the efficacy in pyogenic infections of the skin  has been confirmed by several investigations, which showed an improvement of both subjective and objective parameters significantly better than that of the reference drug (i.e. chlortetracycline or oxytetracycline), the usefulness of rifaximin in bv and periodontal disease needs to be further studied in well-designed clinical trials.

AB  == 3 liquid culture media: triptose soya broth supplemented with equine serum (tsb-es)/without supplement (tsb) and casman broth (cb) were evaluated under different incubation conditions at 10% of co2 and under aerobic conditions. there were no significant differences in the values of optic density for the tsb-es and cb media. however, on establishing the protein profile by page-sds for the evaluated conditions, the presence of protein of 14 kda and the values of optic density allowed the selection of the cb medium for the culture of gardnerella vaginalis. the sensitivity to different ph in this medium was studied. ph 7.2 proved to be optimum and it was established its growth cynetics. the analysis by  page-sds of the complete cells corresponding to different clinical isolates of g. vaginalis with biochemical variations made possible to characterize the protein profile in this medium and showed similarity between the isolates.

AB  == objective: to determine microbial and behavioural factors contributing to non-gonococcal urethral symptoms in men. methods: case-control study of heterosexual men with non-gonococcal urethral symptoms (cases) and without urethral symptoms (controls) attending melbourne sexual health centre, australia. sexual behaviour and condom use were measured by questionnaire. first stream urine was tested for potential pathogens: chlamydia trachomatis (ligase chain reaction), mycoplasma genitalium (polymerase chain reaction, pcr), ureaplasma urealyticum (culture and pcr), and streptococcus spp, gardnerella vaginalis, and  haemophilus species (culture). urethral smears from cases were examined for polymorphonuclear leucocytes. results: 80 cases and 79 controls were recruited over 4 months in 2002-3. 49 cases (61%) had urethritis by microscopic criteria, 17 (21%) had chlamydia trachomatis (adjusted odds ratio (or) 27 (95% confidence interval (ci): 3.4 to 222)), five (6%) had mycoplasma genitalium (or 6.1 (95% ci: 0.6 to 61)), and 11 (14%) had gardnerella vaginalis (or 9.0 (95% ci: 1.6 to 52)). other organisms were not significantly associated with urethral symptoms. the presence of urethritis on urethral smear did not predict the presence of chlamydia trachomatis (or 1.7 (95% ci: 0.5 to 5.4)). urethral symptoms were significantly associated with unprotected vaginal sex with more than one casual partner (or 9.3 (95% ci: 1.3 to 65)) and unprotected anal sex with a regular partner in the past month (or 3.5 (95% ci: 1.0 to 13)). conclusion: gardnerella vaginalis and unprotected anal sex may cause symptoms of non-gonococcal urethritis. microscopy of the urethral smear to diagnose urethritis in this population does not help to identify which men with urethral symptoms require treatment for chlamydia.

TI  == induction of secretory aspartyl proteinase of candida albicans by hiv-1 but not hsv-2 or some other microorganisms associated with vaginal environment.
AB  == the most common type of candidiasis involves mucosal sites such as the oral cavity, the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. among many of virulence factors, the production of secretory aspartyl proteinase (sap) by candida albicans (c. albicans) has gained much attention, and factors leading to sap induction are thus under intense study. the aim of this study was to examine whether some microorganisms such as lactobacillus, gardnerella vaginalis (g. vaginalis), human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (hiv-1) and human herpes simplex  virus type-2 (hsv-2) had any sap inducing effect on c. albicans. here we showed that among the microorganisms tested in vitro only hiv-1 induced sap production from c. albicans.

TI  == inflammatory smears--is there a correlation between microbiology and cytology findings?
AB  == cervical smear results reporting the presence of inflammation are regularly encountered by smeartakers, yet the significance of this finding is not clear. we wished to evaluate whether the presence of inflammation on smear test was associated with a higher incidence of lower genital tract infection. a retrospective review was carried out on women attending our colposcopy unit for their first visit during 2001. results of 256 women were available for analysis.  evidence of inflammation was found in 9.7% of smears. genital tract infection was found in 29.2% of women overall. infection with more than one micro-organism was  present in 8.9 percent. forty eight percent of women having inflammatory changes  on smear test had genital tract infection. this compared with 27.3% of women whose smear tests showed no evidence of inflammation. prevalence of infection with chlamydia trachomatis, candida, bacteroides and gardnerella vaginalis was higher in the inflammatory smear group. this study shows that women with an inflammatory smear are more likely to harbour genital tract infection than women  whose smear shows no evidence of inflammation. chlamydia infection in particular  has long-term fertility consequences through its potential to cause asymptomatic  tubal damage: it was present in a substantial proportion of women with inflammation on smear (20%). screening for lower genital tract infection via high vaginal swab and either intracervical swab or urinary screening for chlamydia infection should be carried out in all women with smear tests reporting the presence of inflammation.

TI  == [clinical relevance of antibiotic resistance in obstetrics and gynecology].
AB  == antibiotic resistance of microorganisms that cause infections of the urogenital tract is a clinically relevant problem in obstetrics and gynecology. due to methodological difficulties, resistance testing is rarely used for the management of these infections. therefore, solid epidemiological data on resistance rates of most involved pathogens are scarce. antibiotic resistance of several microorganisms appears to be increasing in various areas of the world, mainly trichomonas vaginalis and gardnerella vaginalis (metronidazole),streptococcus agalactiae (macrolides, clindamycin), mycoplasma hominis (tetracyclines, intrinsically macrolide resistant). in addition,isolated cases of clinical infections caused by multi-resistant chlamydia trachomatis have been reported. the presence of antibiotic resistance should therefore be considered in patients  with an unfavorable course despite adequate antibiotic therapy. in light of the growing problem of antibiotic resistance and the large gaps in our knowledge in this particular area, research efforts in the field of anti-biotic resistance in  gynecological infections should be markedly intensified.

AB  == five hundred and seventeen women attending the gynecology and obstetrics clinics  of the korle-bu teaching hospital were examined for sexually transmitted infections (stis). vaginal swabs were examined for trichomonas vaginalis, candida albicans, and gardnerella vaginalis infection. endocervical swabs were examined for neisseria gonorrhoea and chlamydia trachomatis using a recently developed rna detection kit. strain typing was performed to identify serovars of c. trachomatis. sera were analyzed for treponema pallidum with a passive-particle agglutination assay kit. the prevalence of infection with n. gonorrhoea was 0.6%, c. trachomatis 3.0%, and t. pallidum 5.6%. eight samples were pcr-positive for c. trachomatis. five of these were serovar g, and the rest were serovar e. all cases of mixed infections occurred in pregnant women. in conclusion, a high transmissible risk of t. pallidum infection was observed among our study population and in particular among our pregnant women. the absence of association between the presenting symptoms, clinical findings, and specific pathogens has implications for the syndromic approach to sti case management. the low prevalence of c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoea may be due to self medication and  requires further research in primary health institutions in rural areas to compare rates.

TI  == management of vaginitis.
AB  == common infectious forms of vaginitis include bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis. vaginitis also can occur because of atrophic changes. bacterial vaginosis is caused by proliferation of gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes. the diagnosis is based primarily on the amsel  criteria (milky discharge, ph greater than 4.5, positive whiff test, clue cells in a wet-mount preparation). the standard treatment is oral metronidazole in a dosage of 500 mg twice daily for seven days. vulvovaginal candidiasis can be difficult to diagnose because characteristic signs and symptoms (thick, white discharge, dysuria, vulvovaginal pruritus and swelling) are not specific for the  infection. diagnosis should rely on microscopic examination of a sample from the  lateral vaginal wall (10 to 20 percent potassium hydroxide preparation). cultures are helpful in women with recurrent or complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, because species other than candida albicans (e.g., candida glabrata, candida tropicalis) may be present. topical azole and oral fluconazole are equally efficacious in the management of uncomplicated vulvovaginal candidiasis, but a more extensive regimen may be required for complicated infections. trichomoniasis may cause a foul-smelling, frothy discharge and, in most affected women, vaginal  inflammatory changes. culture and dna probe testing are useful in diagnosing the  infection; examinations of wet-mount preparations have a high false-negative rate. the standard treatment for trichomoniasis is a single 2-g oral dose of metronidazole. atrophic vaginitis results from estrogen deficiency. treatment with topical estrogen is effective.

TI  == female genital-tract hiv load correlates inversely with lactobacillus species but positively with bacterial vaginosis and mycoplasma hominis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) acquisition. we examined the association between bv and bv-associated bacteria and expression of hiv in the female genital tract. methods: hiv rna, lactobacilli, gardnerella vaginalis, and mycoplasma hominis in cervicovaginal lavage (cvl) samples were quantified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). gynecologic evaluation included nugent score assessment, amsel criteria assessment, detection of other genital-tract infections, and dysplasia grading. cd4 cell count, plasma hiv rna level, and antiretroviral history were obtained. results: a total of 203 cvl samples from women with nugent scores of 7-10 (bv group) and 203 samples from women with nugent scores of 0-3 (no-bv group) were matched by plasma hiv rna level and analyzed. after controlling for plasma hiv rna level and nugent score in univariate analyses, we found that g. vaginalis and m. hominis bacterial counts, candida vaginitis, and herpes simplex virus (hsv) were positively associated with cvl hiv rna levels. in multivariate analysis, only lactobacilli bacterial counts (p=.006; inverse association), m. hominis bacterial counts (p=.0001; positive association), candida vaginitis (p=.007), and hsv (p=.03) were significantly associated with cvl hiv rna levels. conclusion: bacteria associated with bv increase genital-tract hiv rna levels. quantitative bacterial counts for lactobacilli and m. hominis are better correlates of cvl hiv rna than are nugent score or amsel criteria. since plasma virus and cd4 cell levels did not differ between the bv and no-bv groups, these data suggest that the bacterial flora associated with bv influence genital-tract hiv shedding.

TI  == evolving issues in understanding and treating bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a synergistic polymicrobial syndrome characterized by depletion of lactobacillus spp., especially those that produce hydrogen peroxide, and an intense increase in the quantity of commensal vaginal anaerobic bacteria to 100- to 1000-fold above normal levels. while the bacterial spectrum of these organisms has long been known to include gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella spp.,  anaerobic gram-positive cocci, mobiluncus spp. and mycoplasma hominis, innovative use of molecular diagnostics has identified novel species apparently associated with this syndrome, including atopobium vaginalis. effecting resolution of bacterial vaginosis is important, in particular for the 8 to 23% of women afflicted with symptomatic disease during their reproductive years. bacterial vaginosis has been consistently associated with numerous adverse sequelae related to the upper genital tract, including pelvic inflammatory disease and postsurgical infection in the setting of invasive gynecologic procedures, and may increase women's risk of acquiring hiv infection. pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis experience a higher rate of preterm delivery and low-birth-weight infants. while antibiotics with activity against anaerobes--typically, metronidazole and clindamycin applied vaginally or taken orally--are the mainstays of therapy, bacterial vaginosis frequently recurs. for these reasons, innovative approaches to therapy are urgently required.

TI  == vaginal immunity in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == vaginal immunity in response to microbial perturbation is still poorly understood and may be crucial for protection from adverse outcomes associated with bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is the most prevalent vaginal disorder in adult women worldwide. however, its pathogenesis is still elusive. in bv-positive women, inflammatory signs are scant--approximately 50% of women are asymptomatic. the number of vaginal neutrophils in the bv-positive patient is not increased with respect to healthy women. in contrast, vaginal interleukin (il)-1beta levels are  largely increased. recent findings indicate that microbial hydrolytic enzymes could be responsible for dampening the expected proinflammatory response cascade  after il-1beta increase. in other words, bv causes a large increase of vaginal il-1beta, which is not paralleled by an increase of il-8 levels, suggesting that  bv-associated factors specifically dampen il-8. the impairment of il-8 increase may explain the absence of neutrophil increase in most women exposed to a massive abnormal anaerobic vaginal colonization (bv). among bv-positive women, vaginal innate immunity is strongly correlated to a specific adaptive immune response: the immunoglobulin a (iga) against the hemolysin produced by gardnerella vaginalis (anti-gvh iga), which is the main bacterium present in bv. high anti-gvh iga levels are protective for adverse pregnancy outcomes. however, an exaggerated inflammatory response, mainly attributed to genetic polymorphisms, is also implicated in bv-associated adverse outcomes.

AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis commonly is found in women with pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), but it is unclear whether bacterial vaginosis leads to incident pid. methods: women (n = 1,179) from 5 u.s. centers were evaluated for a median of 3 years. every 6-12 months, vaginal swabs were obtained for gram  stain and culture of microflora. a vaginal microflora gram stain score of 7-10 was categorized as bacterial vaginosis. pelvic inflammatory disease was diagnosed by presence of either histologic endometritis or pelvic pain and tenderness plus  one of the following: oral temperature greater than 38.3 degrees c; sedimentation rate greater than 15 mm/hour; white blood count greater than 10,000; or lower genital tract detection of leukorrhea, mucopus, or neisseria gonorrhoeae or chlamydia trachomatis. results: after adjustment for relevant demographic and lifestyle factors, baseline bacterial vaginosis was not associated with the development of pid (adjusted hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.55-1.45). carriage of bacterial vaginosis in the previous 6 months before a diagnosis (adjusted risk ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.71-2.42) also was  not significantly associated with pid. similarly, neither absence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus nor high levels of gardnerella vaginalis significantly increased the risk of pid. dense growth of pigmented, anaerobic gram-negative rods in the 6 months before diagnosis did significantly increase a  woman's risk of pid (p =.04). one subgroup of women, women with 2 or more recent  sexual partners, demonstrated associations among bacterial vaginosis, gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods, and pid. conclusion: in this cohort of high-risk women, after adjustment for confounding factors, we found no overall increased risk of developing incident pid among women with bacterial vaginosis. level of evidence: ii-2

TI  == relationship between a toll-like receptor-4 gene polymorphism, bacterial vaginosis-related flora and vaginal cytokine responses in pregnant women.
AB  == objective: the relationship between a single nucleotide polymorphism (tlr4 896 a  > g) in the toll-like receptor-4 (tlr4) gene, qualitative and quantitative changes in vaginal micro-flora and vaginal interleukin (il)-1beta and il-1 receptor antagonist (il-1ra) concentrations in pregnant women were evaluated. study design: qualitative and quantitative microbial methods were used to characterize vaginal micro-flora of 238 women at 18-22 weeks gestation. polymerase chain reaction was used to determine tlr4 genotype. il-1beta and il-1ra concentrations in vaginal lavage samples were measured by elisa. results:  the tlr4 variant was identified in 10.3% of women. carriage of this variant was associated with a median increase in vaginal ph (p = 0.05), a greater than 10-fold increase in vaginal gardnerella vaginalis levels (p < 0.0001) and a 10-fold increase in the vaginal concentration of three species of anaerobic gram-negative rods, prevotella, bacteroides, and porphyromonas (p = 0.08 ). colonization with g. vaginalis and/or the anaerobic gram-negative rods resulted in elevated vaginal il-1 (p = 0.01) and il-1ra (p < 0.0002) concentrations in women who were tlr4 896a homozygotes, but not in tlr4 896g carriers. conclusion:  the tlr4 896 a > g polymorphism contributes to inter-individual differences in the vaginal immune defense against g. vaginalis and anaerobic gram-negative rods.

AB  == the authors analyze the results from the clinical and microbiological investigations of gardnerella vaginalis in two female groups: 28 patients with clinical manifestations of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and a control group of 25 females without any complaints. along with the data from the anamnesis and the gynecological examination, the following parameters have been examined: a native  preparation for "clue cells", ph of vaginal content, ratio between polymorphonuclear leukocytes and epithelial cells, specimens for the diagnosis by polymerase-chain reaction (pcr) as well as cultural examination by using hbt agar (human blood two-layer tween agar). the authors discuss five diagnostic criteria  and emphasize that the diagnosis of bv requires the presence of at least four of  them. every criterion possesses a high frequency (between 67.86 and 100 per cent) among the female patients with clinical evidence of bv.

TI  == nucleic acid-based diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and improved management using probiotic lactobacilli.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common condition in women that represents an imbalance of the vaginal microflora, lactobacilli depletion, and excess growth of mainly anaerobic gram-negative pathogens. diagnosis is made using a series of tests or a gram stain of a vaginal smear. treatment with antibiotics is quite effective, but recurrences are common. a study of 55 vaginal samples from 11 postmenopausal women showed the presence of bv by the gram stain-based nugent scoring system, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis showed that bacteroides or prevotella species were the most common isolates recovered (24 of 25), with escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae also found in some samples. in one case, only gardnerella vaginalis was found. these findings illustrate that bv remains common even among otherwise healthy women, but it is not caused solely by either  gardnerella or mobiluncus. use of a femexam system (cooper surgical, shelton, ct), based upon elevated ph and trimethylamine levels, to screen vaginal smears from 59 healthy women showed poor correlation with the gram stain method. a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of these subjects showed that the lactobacilli-dominant microbiota was restored in subjects with bv but not in controls, following 2 months of daily oral intake of lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and lactobacillus fermentum rc-14. these studies show that nucleic acid-based methods are effective at identifying bacteria responsible for bv. if such methods could be used to develop a commercially available, self-use kit, women would be much better placed to take control of their own health, for example, using medicinal food or dietary supplement products such as the clinically proven probiotic strains l. rhamnosus gr-1 and l. fermentum rc-14.

TI  == fenticonazole nitrate for treatment of vulvovaginitis: efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 1-gram ovules, administered as ultra-short 2-day regimen.
AB  == because of its potential as a low cost first-line monotherapy for the most common vulvovaginal infections, we evaluated fenticonazole nitrate in a prospective, open-label, multicenter pilot study with 101 sexually active women (per-protocol; 16 to 61 years of age) with vulvovaginitis involving single or mixed infections with candida albicans, trichomonas vaginalis, and/or gardnerella vaginalis. fenticonazole nitrate (1 g) was administered as vaginal ovules, once daily on days 1 and 3. eradication (direct phase-contrast microscopy of vaginal swabs and/or microbiological culture) on day 8 was 90% (c. albicans, 26/29, p < 0.001), 70% (t. vaginalis, 7/10, p = 0.161), 67% (g. vaginalis, 22/33, p < 0.009), and 45% (mixed infection, 13/29, p = 0.001). after 28 days, relapse was 0% for candidiasis and trichomoniasis, 27% (6/22) for g. vaginalis, and 23% (3/13) for mixed infection. overall, eradication of all offending pathogens was achieved in  67% of the total per-protocol population, with a relapse rate of only 16%. score  sums for symptoms improved from 7.0 (baseline) to 1.7 (day 8), and 0.71 (day 28), (p < 0.001). treatment was safe and well tolerated. the results of our pilot study suggest that application of fenticonazole nitrate 1 g intravaginal ovules on 2 alternate days is a suitable first-line treatment of vulvovaginitis with acceptable broad-spectrum efficacy against the most commonly involved pathogens and with a low rate of early relapse, reserving antibiotics for patients with treatment failure or relapse of infection. our results should encourage further examination of this approach in larger and well controlled clinical trials.

TI  == a disproportionate increase in il-1beta over il-1ra in the cervicovaginal secretions of pregnant women with altered vaginal microflora correlates with preterm birth.
AB  == objective: this purpose of this study was to investigate the association between  vaginal microflora, concentrations of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), and its natural receptor antagonist (il-1ra) in the cervicovaginal discharge, and spontaneous preterm birth. study design vaginal samples collected at 18 to 22 weeks' gestation from 207 women were analyzed to study qualitative and quantitative microbiologic aspects of vaginal microflora and il-1beta and il-1ra  concentrations. results: among women colonized with anaerobic gram-negative rods  and/or gardnerella vaginalis, an elevated il-1beta concentration, or a diminished il-1ra:il-1beta ratio were associated with preterm delivery. a cut-off il-1ra:il-1beta ratio of <8632:1 optimally discriminated the subjects with subsequent spontaneous preterm deliveries from subjects who delivered at term, with a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 51%, positive predictive value of 21%,  and negative predictive value of 95%. conclusion: a disproportionate increase in  il-1beta over il-1ra in response to vaginal colonization with anaerobic gram-negative rods and/or g. vaginalis at 18 to 22 weeks' gestation is associated with spontaneous preterm delivery.

TI  == [prevalence of asymptomatic sexually transmitted infections among high-risk patients attending a free anonymous hiv-screening center].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections among patients attending an anonymous hiv screening center. patients and methods: this prospective study was performed in the hiv screening center of university hospital in reims (france) from may 1997 to december 1997. the inclusion criteria were the asymptomatic clinical presentation and the presence of risk factors for sexually transmitted infections referring to who criteria. the methods included clinical examination after application of acetic acid and urethral and endocervical swabs to identify:neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis in specific culture. treponema pallidum and hiv-1 infection were both detected by enzym linked immuno sorbent assay (elisa). results: one hundred and one patients (62 men and 39 women) were included in the study. their mean age was 27 +/- 4 years. risk factors for sexually transmitted infections were: multiple sexual partners 81 p. 100; homo or bisexuality 16 p. 100; intravenous drug use 3 p. 100. the sexually transmitted infections were: hiv-1 infection 1 p. 100;ureaplasma urealyticum 25 p. 100; genital warts 5 p. 100;chlamydia trachomatis 3 p. 100; gardnerella vaginalis 3 p. 100; mycoplasma hominis 2 p. 100; treponema pallidum 0 p. 100; neisseria gonorrhoeae 0 p. 100; trichomonas vaginalis 0 p. 100. the prevalence of sexually  transmitted infections was significantly higher among women (p<0.05). discussion: classical sexually transmitted infections and hiv infection were rarely detected  in this study; but prevalence of other sexually transmitted infections (genital warts, chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum) was high. ureaplasma urealyticum is considered as a possible pathogenic agent in pregnant women (preterm delivery, decrease of birth weight, chorioamniotitis). these results suggest that other than sexually transmitted infections in high risk patients attending a hiv screening center other sexually transmitted infections should also be systematically screened for.

TI  == cloning of 16s rrna genes amplified from normal and disturbed vaginal microflora  suggests a strong association between atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains largely elusive, although some microorganisms, including gardnerella vaginalis, are suspected of playing a role in the etiology of this disorder. recently culture-independent analysis of microbial ecosystems has proven its efficacy in characterizing the diversity of bacterial populations. here, we report on the results obtained by combining culture and pcr-based methods to characterize the normal and disturbed  vaginal microflora. results: a total of 150 vaginal swab samples from healthy women (115 pregnant and 35 non-pregnant) were categorized on the basis of gram stain of direct smear as grade i (n = 112), grade ii (n = 26), grade iii (n = 9)  or grade iv (n = 3). the composition of the vaginal microbial community of eight  of these vaginal swabs (three grade i, two grade ii and three grade iii), all from non-pregnant women, were studied by culture and by cloning of the 16s rrna genes obtained after direct amplification. forty-six cultured isolates were identified by tdna-pcr, 854 cloned 16s rrna gene fragments were analysed of which 156 by sequencing, yielding a total of 38 species, including 9 presumptively novel species with at least five species that have not been isolated previously from vaginal samples. interestingly, cloning revealed that atopobium vaginae was  abundant in four out of the five non-grade i specimens. finally, species specific pcr for a. vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis pointed to a statistically significant co-occurrence of both species in the bacterial vaginosis samples. conclusions: although historically the literature regarding bacterial vaginosis has largely focused on g. vaginalis in particular, several findings of this study--like the abundance of a. vaginae in disturbed vaginal microflora and the presence of several novel species--indicate that much is to be learned about the  composition of the vaginal microflora and its relation to the etiology of bv.

TI  == culture-independent identification of pathogenic bacteria and polymicrobial infections in the genitourinary tract of renal transplant recipients.
AB  == renal transplant recipients are predisposed to urinary tract infections caused by both common uropathogens and opportunistic bacteria resulting frequently in significant polymicrobial infections. in this study, a culture-independent 16s rrna-based approach was established to identify unusual, fastidious, or anaerobic bacteria and to investigate bacterial diversity in urinary tract specimens. similarly sized amplicons encompassing the v6 to v8 region of the 16s rrna were analyzed with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (dhplc) (wave system). artificial mixtures of single amplicons from commonly encountered uropathogenic bacteria produced distinct peak profiles whose identities were confirmed by sequencing individually collected peak products. we evaluated the application of the method on 109 urinary tract specimens from renal transplant recipients; 100% correlation was found for culture-positive specimens, and dhplc  generated peak profiles. however, for culture-negative specimens, dhplc facilitated the detection of novel peak profiles. dna sequencing of these individual peaks was used to identify the bacteria involved. thus, in pcr-positive but culture-negative samples the method allowed detection of previously known uropathogens such as corynebacterium urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis, but also unusual agents including anaerococcus lactolyticus, bacteroides vulgatus, dialister invisus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus iners, leptotrichia amnionii, prevotella buccalis, prevotella ruminicola, rahnella aquatilis, and streptococcus intermedius were detected as single pathogens or as constituents of polymicrobial infections. the method described is reproducible and rapidly and enables both dhplc-based profiling and sequence-based investigation of microbial communities and polymicrobial infections. a detailed understanding of infections found in recipients of renal transplants will guide antibiotic therapy regimens and provide new perspectives for decreasing the risk of graft rejection.

AB  == very widespread in our clinical setting, early-onset sepsis is due to organisms that commonly colonize or infect the maternal genital tract; identifying such organisms would help improve prevention and treatment. objective: to determine the bacterial ecology and the pathological status of the genital organs during the last trimester of pregnancy, in order to evaluate the risk of materno-fetal infections and to improve the present prophylactic measures based on monitoring bacterial carriage during the first trimester. method: vaginal and endocervical samples, usually taken during the first trimester of pregnancy were delayed and taken during the last trimester of pregnancy, in patients with no signs of sepsis and not taking antibiotics. a macroscopic examination described the aspect of the vagina, the cervix uteri, leukorrhea and possible inflammatory lesions or ulcerations. a microscopic examination searched for parasites, epithelial cells,  clue cells and leukocytes. the appropriate bacteriological cultures were performed after reading the gram stain and scoring the vaginal flora. the clinical and cytobacteriological aspects were used to identify the bacterial ecology and the pathological genital states. results: genital samples were collected from 306 pregnant women. among them 118 were at 29-32 weeks of gestation, 104 at 33-36 and 84 at 37-40. the most frequent germs were c. albicans (33.3%), enterobacteriaceae (20.3%) including e. coli (10.9%), s. aureus (15.4%), gardnerella (13.6%), and trichomonas (10.6%), in monomicrobian (79.2%) or polymicrobian carriage (20.8%). lower genital tract pathological states such as vaginitis (29.4%), bacterial vaginosis (21.5%) or cervicitis (10.4%) and asymptomatic bacterial carriage (23.5%) and normal genital flora (15%) were identified. conclusion: this is the first report of genital bacterial carriage in african women during the last trimester of pregnancy. larger studies are required to evaluate the risk of maternofetal infections and to improve current prophylaxis measures.

TI  == the potential for probiotics to prevent bacterial vaginosis and preterm labor.
AB  == infections of the urogenital tract in women represent a major burden on the quality of life of women and on the health care system of canada and other countries. complications arising from bacterial vaginosis (bv) include increased  risk of sexually transmitted diseases including human immunodeficiency virus and  elevated risk of preterm birth (ptb). pharmaceutical interventions, such as antibiotics, have been suboptimally effective and have failed to reduce the incidence of ptb. the absence of lactobacilli in the vagina, a specific feature of bv, raises the question as to whether restoration of lactobacilli, by probiotic therapy, can restore the normal flora and improve the chances of having a healthy term pregnancy. the rationale for probiotic use in pregnant women is quite strong. certain lactobacilli strains can safely colonize the vagina after oral and vaginal administration, displace and kill pathogens including gardnerella vaginalis and escherichia coli, and modulate the immune response to interfere with the inflammatory cascade that leads to ptb. additional attributes  of probiotics include their potential to degrade lipids and enhance cytokine levels, which promote embryo development. in a society that focuses on disease rather than health and drug therapy rather than natural preventive measures, it will take some effort to get remedies such as probiotics into mainstream care. perhaps the escalating health care budgets and emergence of "superbugs" will provide the incentives to put in place clinical trials designed to evaluate how best to use the commensal organisms that, after all, make up more of our body than human cells, and without which none of us would survive.

TI  == [bacterial vaginitis: general overview].
AB  == bacteria are the most frequently detected agents in women, clinically complaining of vaginal discharge. the studies have shown that the vaginal microflora of women with bacterial vaginitis have altered from lactobacillus spp. to various anaerobic bacteria. gardnerella vaginalis is found in vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginitis as well as in healthy women, while anaerobic bacteria such as mobiluncus and prevotella are the causative agents for bacterial vaginosis. for the laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginitis, direct microscopy is one of the  most commonly used methods, and for this purpose cervicovaginal smears are examined by staining papanicolaou and gram stains. because of the demonstration of bacterial vaginitis in association with the obstetric diseases such as preterm labor and postpartum endometritis, is a risk factor, its importance has increased recently. in this review article, the microorganisms that cause bacterial vaginitis, their biological characteristics, and the diagnostic laboratory methods of infection, have been discussed.

TI  == can known risk factors explain racial differences in the occurrence of bacterial  vaginosis?
AB  == background: black women are more likely to have bacterial vaginosis (bv) than are non-hispanic white women. we examined whether this disparity can be explained by  racial differences in known bv risk factors. methods: nine hundred black and 235  white women were enrolled from five us sites. at baseline, structured interviews  were conducted and vaginal swabs self-collected for gram-stain and culture. results: black women were more likely than white women to have bv/intermediate vaginal flora. they also were more likely to be older, have lower educational attainment and family incomes, have a history of a sexually transmitted disease,  and douche. after adjustment for demographic and lifestyle factors, blacks remained at elevated risk for bv/intermediate flora (or 2.2, 95% ci 1.5-3.1). blacks also were more likely to have specific bv-related vaginal microflora, as well as gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis (or 2.2, 95% ci 1.2-3.8) after adjustment for known bv risk factors. conclusion: risk factor differences did not explain the observed racial disparity in the occurrence of bv, bv-related microflora, or gonococcal or chlamydial cervicitis. these findings highlight our  limited understanding of the factors accounting for the occurrence of bacterial vaginosis and cervicitis among black and white women.

TI  == increased risk of cervical canal infections with intracervical foley catheter.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the effect of intracervical foley catheter insertion, for  the induction of labor, on cervical canal infection. design: a prospective interventional study with paired analysis. place and duration of study: the study was conducted in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the aga khan university, karachi, between june 1 and august 31, 2002. subjects and methods in  45 women undergoing cervical ripening with intracervical foley catheter for the induction of labour at term, cervical swabs were taken for culture and sensitivity before its insertion and again after its spontaneous expulsion or removal. results: intracervical foley catheter was retained for mean duration of  8.1 +/- 1.7 hours. there was a significant change in the pathogenic organisms (0  % v 16.3 %; p 0.016) from pre-foley to post-foley catheter cervical swab cultures. growth of beta-hemolytic streptococcus group-b, candida albicans, candida glabrata and gardnerella vaginalis on cervical swab were considered pathogenic. one woman (2.2 %) developed fever following insertion of intracervical foley catheter. no statistically significant effect of potential confounding factors was observed on change in growth of pathogenic organisms. conclusion: induction of labour at term with foley catheter is associated with a  significant increase in intracervical pathogenic organisms despite undertaking routine aseptic measures. we recommend evaluation of this technique for its potential infectious harm in larger studies. meanwhile, extreme aseptic measures  should be undertaken during its insertion to avoid maternal and possible neonatal infections.

TI  == recurrent bacterial vaginosis in a virgin adolescent: a new method of treatment.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a polymicrobial infection of the vagina and should not be considered an exclusively sexually transmitted disease. we describe the case of a 17-year-old female virgin adolescent with recurrent malodorous vaginal  discharge for 6 months. before referral to us she had been treated unsuccessfully with conservative treatment options. our investigation revealed gardnerella vaginalis as the responsible factor for the vaginal infection. because metronidazole treatment had failed as monotherapy, a new method was applied. repeated vaginal washings with 3% h(2)o(2), 15% nacl and 10% providone iodine were initiated. at the end of each washing, vaginal walls were thoroughly cleaned up with a small gauze. after 10 days of treatment the odor and the vaginal discharge had ceased and 12 months later no relapse had occurred. it seems to be  reasonable to use this kind of treatment in recurrent bv.

TI  == microbiology and management of polymicrobial female genital tract infections in adolescents.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology and management of female genital tract infections in adolescents. these infections include vulvovaginitis, vulvovaginal  pyogenic infections (abscesses of bartholin's and skene's glands, infected labial inclusion cysts, labial abscesses, furunculosis, and hidradenitis), endometritis, pyometritis, salpingitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian and pelvic abscess. anaerobes can be cultured in 50% to 90% of females with a variety of genital infections and are the exclusive isolates in 20% to 50%. obligate anaerobes are particularly common in closed-space infections, such as tubo-ovarian and vulvovaginal abscesses. the most common anaerobes found in these infections are gram-negative bacilli (especially p. bivia and p. disiens) and anaerobic cocci. anaerobes generally are not the only pathogens found, but are usually mixed with aerobes. the most common aerobic pathogens are members of the  enterobacteriaceae family, especially e. coli, and aerobic or microaerophilic streptococci. sexually acquired infections include neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex, and condyloma accuminata. treatment regimens must provide antimicrobial  coverage for n gonorrhoeae, c trachomatis, anaerobes, streptococci, and gram-negative facultative bacteria.

TI  == characterization and selection of vaginal lactobacillus strains for the preparation of vaginal tablets.
AB  == aims: to characterize and select lactobacillus strains for properties that would  make them a good alternative to the use of antibiotics to treat human vaginal infections. methods and results: ten lactobacillus strains belonging to four different lactobacillus species were analysed for properties relating to mucosal  colonization or microbial antagonism (adhesion to human epithelial cells, hydrogen peroxide production, antimicrobial activity towards gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans and coaggregation with pathogens). the involvement of electrostatic interactions and the influence of bacterial metabolic state in the binding of lactobacilli to the cell surface were also studied. adherence to epithelial cells varied greatly among the lactobacillus species and among different strains belonging to the same lactobacillus species. the reduction in surface negative electric charge promoted the binding of several lactobacillus strains to the cell membrane whereas lyophilization reduced the adhesion capacity of many isolates. the antimicrobial activity of lactobacilli culture supernatant  fluids was not directly related to the production of h2o2. conclusions: three strains (lactobacillus brevis cd2, lact. salivarius fv2 and lact. gasseri mb335)  showed optimal properties and were, therefore, selected for the preparation of vaginal tablets. the selected strains adhered to epithelial cells displacing vaginal pathogens; they produced high levels of h2o2, coaggregated with pathogens and inhibited the growth of g. vaginalis. significance and impact of the study: the dosage formulation developed in this study appears to be a good candidate for the probiotic prophylaxis and treatment of human vaginal infections.

AB  == sexually transmitted diseases (std) are quite common and observed more frequently in teens. the adolescents represent a group at particular risk for std due to biological, sociocultural and psychological factors. undectected infections may lead to unwanted sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease, chronic abdominal pain, tubal scarring and increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. this paper deals with infections by candida albicans, chlamidia tracomatis, neisseria  gonorrheae, gardnerella vaginalis, treponema pallidum, tricomonas vaginalis, herpes simplex, papilloma virus. in regard to gonorrhea, chlamydia, syphilis and  papilloma virus, the expectation is that improved detection will decrease sequelae by early diagnosis and treatment. prevention programs (information, use  of hormonal contraception associated with condom use) and improved access to std  diagnosis and treatment services are useful to reduce the incidence of std among  young people.

TI  == safety and tolerability of the new contraceptive sponge protectaid.
AB  == objective: this study was undertaken to assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of two different-dose regimens of the protectaid contraceptive sponge. methods: the toxic effects of two forms of the new vaginal contraceptive  sponge, protectaid, in the cervical and vaginal tissues were studied. both types  were impregnated with f-5 gel containing different doses of nonoxynol-9 (nx9; 0.5% and 0.125%). the sponge was used by 35 women aged 20-35 years (mean 28.7 years) randomly allocated into two groups (group a: 0.5% nx9, n = 20; group b: 0.125% nx9, n = 15). results: during a 12-month period both regimens demonstrated a 91.4% overall contraceptive efficacy. colposcopic examinations showed no significant cervical or vaginal lesions in either group, except for two cases at  the 2-week and 3-month examinations in group a women. in the former, inflammatory changes of little clinical significance were seen and the colposcopic appearance  of the vagina was non-specific. in this case, the focal lesions were accompanied  by dilated capillaries (hyperemia). in the second case, degenerative inflammatory changes, with the inflammatory foci varying in shape and distribution, were observed. cervical cultures taken 6 months after the start of treatment showed the presence of mycoplasma hominis and candida albicans in one and two cases, respectively, in group a. in group b, cervical cultures taken at 3 months showed  gardnerella vaginalis and beta-hemolytic streptococci group b in one and two cases, respectively. conclusion: the potent spermicidal and protective properties of this new contraceptive sponge may be of benefit to the sexually active female. since the sponge was very well accepted by both the study participants and their  sexual partners, it can be considered as a valuable barrier method.

AB  == the microbiota of the lower female genital tract was evaluated from vaginal swabs obtained from 623 healthy pregnant women at gestation periods of 35-40 weeks. isolated and identified microorganisms were expressed as percentages of total samples. as expected, lactobacilli made up the dominant vaginal microbiota (70%). enterobacteriaceae, mainly escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. and proteus, were present in 38% of the samples, which might reflect the possible contamination of  vaginal tract with rectal microorganisms. candida albicans was present in 10% of  healthy pregnant woman assayed. streptoccocci (streptococcus sp. and enterococcus faecalis with 3% and 4%, respectively) and other gram-positive cocci (staphylococcus sp., 5%), along with other microorgansisms such as gardnerella vaginalis (5%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (2%) may represent a potential infection risk. streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococci beta-hemolytic, gbs) was detected in 7% of the samples. gbs infection is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in the developed world. furthermore, gbs was often co-isolated with c. albicans (54.5%) in the samples. a complete and detailed evaluation of the vaginal biota swab, with particular attention to the presence of potential pathogens such as gbs, is a preventive strategy that can provide useful information to obstetricians and gynecologist in managing the last days of pregnancy and delivery.

TI  == improving gram-stained reproducible result by further adding clue cells in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the reproducibility of interpretation in diagnosing bacterial vaginosis may be enhanced by adding pus cells and clue cells into two different criteria, developed by spiegel et al. and nugent et al. the purpose of study was designed to find out which parameter was more reproducible. 100 patients were collected with the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as an experimental group, while the other 100 patients who were with routine papanicolaou smears in gynecologic clinic the collected as a control group. two slides, including the original and reproducible ones, were obtained from vaginal smears for each patient. three technicians read the slides randomly by using two different criteria, plus pus cells and clue cells. this showed the agreement for clue cells is the best method regardless of experimental group or control group (kappa values between 0.708 and 1.000). the intra-observer agreement for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by  the method of nugent et al. is superior to the method of spiegel et al. our data  show the comparison of amsel criteria versus nugent criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with sensitivity of 88.9%, specificity of 55.4%, negative positive value of 62.1%, and positive predictive value of 85.8%. moreover, our data also demonstrate the comparison of amsel criteria versus the diagnosis either based on nugent criteria or the presence of clue cells with sensitivity of 95.7%, specificity of 56.7%, negative positive value of 81.2%, and positive predictive value of 87.1%. the results demonstrate further adding score of the clue cells can enhance the reproducible diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, which is superior to the methods of nugent et al. and spiegel et al.

AB  == problem: mucosal immune system activation may represent a critical determinant of adverse sequelae correlated with bacterial vaginosis, as hiv sexual transmission, upper genital tract infections, cervicitis, endometritis, postsurgical infections, and adverse pregnancy outcomes as preterm delivery (ptd), low birth weight (lbw). method of study: levels of interleukin-1beta (il-1beta), anti-gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin (gvh) iga, ph, nugent score, and number of leukocytes were measured in vaginal fluids of 60 fertile women with bacterial vaginosis and of 64 healthy controls. results: vaginal il-1beta levels were nearly 13-fold higher in women with bacterial vaginosis (bv) and were associated  with anti-gvh iga response. il-1beta was positively correlated with leukocyte counts in the smear both in healthy and bacterial vaginosis positive women. conclusions: induction of the proinflammatory cytokine il-1beta may be a necessary event to elicit an innate immune response to control anaerobic genital  tract infections. high levels of vaginal il-1beta are associated with mounting of an antigen-specific mucosal immune response in women with bacterial vaginosis. parallel induction of innate and adaptive immune response may be associated with  protection from ascent of micro-organisms to the upper genital tract, and from acquiring viral infection through the vaginal tract.

TI  == models of white matter injury: comparison of infectious, hypoxic-ischemic, and excitotoxic insults.
AB  == white matter damage (wmd) in preterm neonates is strongly associated with adverse outcome. the etiology of white matter injury is not known but clinical data suggest that ischemia-reperfusion and/or infection-inflammation are important factors. furthermore, antenatal infection seems to be an important risk factor for brain injury in term infants. in order to explore the pathophysiological mechanisms of wmd and to better understand how infectious agents may affect the vulnerability of the immature brain to injury, numerous novel animal models have  been developed over the past decade. wmd can be induced by antenatal or postnatal administration of microbes (e. coli or gardnerella vaginalis), virus (border disease virus) or bacterial products (lipopolysaccharide, lps). alternatively, various hypoperfusion paradigms or administration of excitatory amino acid receptor agonists (excitotoxicity models) can be used. irrespective of which insult is utilized, the maturational age of the cns and choice of species seem critical. generally, lesions with similarity to human wmd, with respect to distribution and morphological characteristics, are easier to induce in gyrencephalic species (rabbits, dogs, cats and sheep) than in rodents. recently,  however, models have been developed in rats (pnd 1-7), using either bilateral carotid occlusion or combined hypoxia-ischemia, that produce predominantly white  matter lesions. lps is the infectious agent most often used to produce wmd in immature dogs, cats, or fetal sheep. the mechanism whereby lps induces brain injury is not completely understood but involves activation of toll-like receptor 4 on immune cells with initiation of a generalized inflammatory response resulting in systemic hypoglycemia, perturbation of coagulation, cerebral hypoperfusion, and activation of inflammatory cells in the cns. lps and umbilical cord occlusion both produce wmd with quite similar distribution in 65% gestational sheep. the morphological appearance is different, however, with a more pronounced infiltration of inflammatory cells into the brain and focal microglia/macrophage ("inflammatory wmd") in response to lps compared to hypoperfusion evoking a more diffuse microglial response usually devoid of cellular infiltrates ("ischemic wmd"). furthermore, low doses of lps that by themselves have no adverse effects in 7-day-old rats (maturation corresponding to the near term human fetus), dramatically increase brain injury to a subsequent hypoxic-ischemic challenge, implicating that bacterial products can sensitize the immature cns. contrary to this finding, other bacterial agents like lipoteichoic  acid were recently shown to induce tolerance of the immature brain suggesting that the innate immune system may respond differently to various ligands, which needs to be further explored.

TI  == definition of a type of abnormal vaginal flora that is distinct from bacterial vaginosis: aerobic vaginitis.
AB  == objective: to define an entity of abnormal vaginal flora: aerobic vaginitis. design: observational study. setting: university hospital gasthuisberg, leuven, belgium. sample: 631 women attending for routine prenatal care or attending vaginitis clinic. methods: samples were taken for fresh wet mount microscopy of vaginal fluid, vaginal cultures and measurement of lactate, succinate and cytokine levels in vaginal fluid. smears deficient in lactobacilli and positive for clue cells were considered to indicate a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. aerobic vaginitis was diagnosed if smears were deficient in lactobacilli, positive for cocci or coarse bacilli, positive for parabasal epithelial cells, and/or positive for vaginal leucocytes (plus their granular aspect). results: genital complaints include red inflammation, yellow discharge, vaginal dyspareunia. group b streptococci, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and trichomonas vaginalis are frequently cultured. vaginal lactate concentration is severely depressed in women with aerobic vaginitis, as in bacterial vaginosis, but vaginal succinate is not produced. also in contrast to bacterial vaginosis, aerobic vaginitis produces a host immune response that leads to high production of interleukin-6, interleukin-1-beta and leukaemia inhibitory factor in the vaginal fluid. conclusion: aerobic vaginitis is associated with aerobic micro-organisms, mainly group b streptococci and e. coli. its characteristics are different from those of bacterial vaginosis and elicit an important host response. the most severe form of aerobic vaginitis equals desquamative inflammatory vaginitis. in theory, aerobic vaginitis may be a better candidate than bacterial vaginosis as the cause of pregnancy complications, such as ascending chorioamnionitis, preterm rupture of the membranes and preterm delivery.

TI  == vaginal microflora in healthy women with gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == in order to find the vaginal prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis in a normal female population, we determined the incidence of g. vaginalis in relation to that of other bacterial genera and species in the vagina. two-hundred and thirty-nine healthy women were the subjects of this study. vaginal discharge was  collected and bacteriological studies were performed. the mean total aerobe count in the g. vaginalis-positive group was 9.02 log10 colony-forming units (cfu)/g, which was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than that (6.80 log10 cfu/g) in the g. vaginalis-negative group. in contrast, there was no difference in the mean total anaerobe count between the two groups of subjects (8.82 and 8.24 log10 cfu/g, respectively in the case of including lactobacillus species count). also,  the mean ph level of vaginal secretion in the g. vaginalis-positive group was 4.58, which was significantly higher (p < 0.005) than that (4.10) in the g. vaginalis-negative group. aerobes were isolated at equal incidence in the two groups. anaerobes were isolated at a significantly higher rate in the g. vaginalis-positive group (p < 0.005) than in the g. vaginalis-negative group. the mean count of lactobacillus species was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) in the  g. vaginalis-negative group than in the positive counterpart (7.02 vs 8.66). elevation of vaginal ph, an increase in the anaerobe count, and decreases in the  lactobacillus species count could be good predictors of the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis in healthy women.

TI  == bacteriocin susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and metronidazole susceptibility.
AB  == objective: our purpose was to investigate the bacteriocin susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis and its relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole. study design: bacteriocin susceptibility of 36 g vaginalis clinical isolates was tested against a vaginal strain of lactobacillus acidophilus by a growth-inhibition method. the relationship to biotype, genotype, and resistance to metronidazole were analyzed by the chi2 test and fisher exact test. results: eight g vaginalis strains (22%) were bacteriocin-resistant. biotypes 5 and 7 were found to be the most frequent among these resistant strains. eight (42%) of the 19 isolates classified as biotype 5, 6, or 7 were bacteriocin-resistant compared with none of the isolates that were classified as  other biotypes (p <.01). biotype 5 was found in higher prevalence among the isolates resistant to bacteriocin (62%) than among the susceptible isolates (14%) (p =.01). genotype b was found more frequently among the bacteriocin-resistant strains, but this finding was not statistically significant (p =.71). seven (88%) bacteriocin-resistant strains were also resistant to metronidazole. conclusion: an association between biotype and an increased resistance to bacteriocin was found. the ability of g vaginalis to resist the antibacterial activity of lactobacillus bacteriocin may be a pivotal factor in understanding bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == new approach to phylogenetic analysis of the genus bifidobacterium based on partial hsp60 gene sequences.
AB  == the partial 60 kda heat-shock protein (hsp60) genes of 36 bifidobacterium strains representing 30 different bifidobacterium species and subspecies and of the type  strain of gardnerella vaginalis were cloned and sequenced using a pair of universal degenerate hsp60 pcr primers. the hsp60 dna sequence similarities were  determined for the taxa at various ranks as follows: 99.4-100% within the same species, 96% at the subspecies level, and 73-96% (mean 85%) at the interspecies level (and 98% in the case of two groups of closely related species, bifidobacterium animalis and bifidobacterium lactis, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum and bifidobacterium suis, whose 165 rrna sequence similarities are all above 99%). the hsp60 dna sequence similarities between different bifidobacterium species and g. vaginalis, a closely related bacterium according to 16s rrna analysis, ranged from 71 to 79% (mean 75%). although the topology of the phylogenetic tree constructed using the hsp60 sequences determined was basically similar to that for 16s rrna, it seemed to be more clear-cut for species delineation, and the clustering was better correlated with  the dna base composition (mol% g+c) than that of the 16s rrna tree. in the hsp60  phylogenetic tree, all of the high-g+c (55-67 mol%) bifidobacteria were grouped into one cluster, whereas the low-g+c species bifidobacterium inopinatum (45 mol  %) formed a separate cluster with g. vaginalis (42 mol%) and bifidobacterium denticolens (55 mol%); a bifidobacterium species of intermediate g+c content formed another cluster between the two. this study demonstrates that the highly conserved and ubiquitous hsp60 gene is an accurate and convenient tool for phylogenetic analysis of the genus bifidobacterium.

AB  == objective: to investigate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and abnormal bacterial vaginal flora in an infertile population and correlate with cervical cytokine production and in vitro fertilization (ivf) outcome. study design: in a  blinded study, 331 asymptomatic ivf patients were evaluated for bv, abnormal vaginal flora and cervical cytokine production (interleukin 1 beta [il-1 beta] and il-8) on the day of oocyte retrieval. all patients received tetracycline prophylaxis at the time of oocyte retrieval. results: bv was identified in 4.2% (14/331) of the patients. patients with idiopathic infertility were more likely to have bv than were women with other causes of infertility (p = .02 vs. male factor, p = .03 vs. tubal factor and p < .01 vs. endometriosis-associated infertility). patients with abnormal vaginal flora had higher cervical il-1 beta  and il-8 cytokine levels as compared to patients with normal vaginal flora. il-1  beta and il-8 levels in the study subjects correlated highly. no differences were detected in ivf outcome parameters based on the vaginal flora determined at the time of retrieval. conclusion: abnormal vaginal flora, including that causing bv, is associated with elevated cervical levels of il-1 beta and il-8. the induction  of proinflammatory cytokines by an altered vaginal ecosystem may be a previously  unrecognized cause of idiopathic infertility.

TI  == defense factors of vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == objective: to determine the antagonistic relationship between vaginal lactobacilli and endogenous vaginal microflora. study design: twenty-two lactobacillus strains were studied for the production of lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, and bacteriocin. results: under standardized growth conditions, most strains increased their biomass by more than 4 times. lactobacillus species grew  best at a ph > or = 4.5, and growth was retarded at a ph < 4.5. lactic acid levels were 0.68 to 2.518 mg/ml and were not related to the number of cells or the ph of media. the ph of the media was caused by the secretion of lactic and other organic acids. approximately 80% of the strains produced h(2)o(2) and were  graded as 2+ in one third of the strains and 1+ in others. no statistical correlation was found between h(2)o(2) lactic acid and bacteriocin production. bacteriocin activity was tested on 4 strains of gardnerella vaginalis. approximately 80% of the lactobacilli tested produced bacteriocin that inhibited  growth of g vaginalis. six of the strains did not produce bacteriocin. thirteen strains produced all 3 defense factors, whereas the others lacked 1 or 2 properties. conclusions: lactobacillus species grow best at a ph > 4.5. the ph of the media is dependent on the cell mass and on all organic acids produced by lactobacillus species. although all species produce organic acids, not all produce h(2)o(2) and bacteriocin. not all strains of g vaginalis can be inhibited by lactobacilli-producing bacteriocin.

TI  == nugent score related to vaginal culture in pregnant women.
AB  == objective: to relate gram-stained smears, using the nugent criteria, to quantitative and qualitative vaginal cultures in pregnant women. methods: two independent evaluators using the nugent criteria, a standardized method of gram-stain interpretation designed to detect bacterial vaginosis, scored 104 vaginal smears from pregnant women. the quantitative and qualitative vaginal cultures were assessed at the same time and the results expressed as log(10) colony-forming units per gram of vaginal secretion. the nugent scores were compared with the microbiologic findings. results: the prevalence of normal, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis vaginal flora as determined by gram stain was 68%, 21%, and 11%, respectively. a comparison of the mean bacterial counts with the nugent score showed a weak negative correlation for lactobacillus species and a positive correlation for gram-variable and gram-negative rods. additional analysis revealed a strong positive correlation between the mean bacterial counts analyses of peptostreptococcus, a genus not included in the nugent scoring system, and the nugent score. in addition, the prevotella counts correlated strongly with both the nugent score and the peptostreptococcus counts. the quantitative counts for lactobacillus did not vary significantly among the three defined groups of vaginal microflora; however, significant increases in the concentrations of gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella were found as the nugent score increased. conclusion: a strong correlation was found among the gram-variable and gram-negative genera comprised by the nugent score. peptostreptococcus also correlated strongly with the nugent score and with the prevotella counts, suggesting that this genus may play a role in determining vaginal health.

TI  == the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and vaginal flora changes.
AB  == in a population of 956 women, attending for contraceptive advice, 131 (13.7%) were found to have bv acording to amsel's criteria. clue cells were detected in 200 (20.9%) women, a positive amine ('sniff') test in 191 (20.0%), a vaginal ph > or = 4.7 in 243 (25.4%) and a "characteristic" vaginal discharge in 104 (10.9%) women. sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values in relation to bv were calculated for each of these four criteria. the detection of  clue cells, an increased ph and a positive sniff test showed excellent sensitivity (86-100%) values, but had a less satisfactory positive predictive value (52-68%). vaginal discharge was found to be a poor predictor of bv. the vaginal flora in women with clue cells, increased vaginal ph or a positive sniff  test was very similar to that of the women with bv, every after excluding concomitant cases of bv and the three respective criteria. thus, a positive amine test, which is easily performed, strongly suggests bv and a vaginal flora predominated by gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, mobiluncus species and anaerobic species on one hand, and lack of lactobacilli on the other. when there  is a clinical suspicion of bv, the sniff test is positive and differential diagnoses are excluded, one can safely treat a woman for bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == understanding the bacterial flora of the female genital tract.
AB  == the microbiological flora of the lower female genital tract provides a dynamic, complex example of microbial colonization, the regulation of which is not fully understood. when an exogenous bacterial species, with its array of virulence factors, is introduced into the host, disease does not always occur. conversely,  under selected conditions, commensal endogenous bacteria-for example, gardnerella vaginalis and group b streptococci-can participate in disease processes. disease  caused by both exogenous and endogenous bacteria correlates positively with a markedly increased level of bacterial replication. the key question is what determines the quantity of a given bacterium at any given time. for disease to occur, exogenous or endogenous bacteria that possess pathogenic prerequisites must attain replicative dominance. their ability to do so is potentially governed by inhibitory or synergistic interrelationships with other microbes.

AB  == strains of lactobacillus isolated from dairy products and genital tract competed  with candida albicans through a membrane of 12000 dalton cut-off. this inhibition was due to hydrogen peroxide and was trypsin-stable, heat-sensitive and antagonized by catalase. lactobacillus coming from "starters" showed antimicrobial activity against fungus isolated in a yogurt factory. penicillium,  alternaria, phialophora, microsporum and candida spp. were inhibited when 10(2) spores were inoculated in the assay. no inhibition was observed with 10(5) spores. besides, one of 21 lactobacillus strains isolated from the vaginas of healthy women inhibited pathogenic bacteria by means a bacteriocin trypsin-sensitive, heat-stable and retained by dialysis membrane. tablets for future probiotic use were prepared and the viability of bacteria was assayed using media with different compositions. pharmaceutical preparations with polyethyleneglycol was the best formulation for the lactobacillus viability, the  counts remained between 10(7) and 10(6) cfu/tablet for up to 1 year.

TI  == binding of catalase by gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == previous work has demonstrated that gardnerella vaginalis can utilize catalase as a sole source of iron. in this study, the interaction between g. vaginalis cells  and catalase was investigated. g. vaginalis cells were shown to bind digoxigenin  (dig)-labeled catalase using a solid phase dot blot assay. an increase in catalase binding was observed from cells grown under iron-restrictive conditions. western blot analysis of g. vaginalis proteins resulted in the detection of a putative catalase-binding protein with an estimated molecular mass of 128 kda. the 128-kda catalase-binding protein was not detected from intact g. vaginalis cells treated with trypsin prior to western blot analysis suggesting this protein may be surface-exposed.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is the most common cause of vaginitis, affecting over 3 million women in the united states annually. depopulation of lactobacilli from the normal vaginal flora and overgrowth of gardnerella vaginalis and other anaerobic species are the presumed etiology. to date, no scientific evidence shows that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. malodorous vaginal discharge is the most common symptom. differential diagnoses include trichomoniasis, moniliasis, and allergic or chemical dermatitis. the diagnosis is confirmed when at least three of the following four findings are present (amsel's criteria): 1) thin, homogenous discharge, 2) ph greater than 4.5, 3) positive amine test, and 4) presence of clue cells. the sensitivity and positive predictive value are both 90%. vaginal gram stain is also reliable and allows for permanent record. cultures are nonspecific because g. vaginalis resides in normal vaginal flora as well. papanicolaou smears are not particularly sensitive, but their positive predictive value is very high. the centers for disease control and prevention recommend three treatment regimens in nonpregnant patients: oral metronidazole (500 mg twice daily for 7 days), intravaginal 2% clindamycin cream  (one applicatorful at bedtime for 7 days), or intravaginal metronidazole gel (one to two applicatorfuls per day for 5 days). alternative regimens include a single  2-g oral dose of metronidazole or a 7-day course of oral clindamycin, 300 mg twice daily. the association between bacterial vaginosis and adverse pregnancy outcomes has satisfied many criteria for a causal inference. treatment of bacterial vaginosis in women with previous history of preterm labor results in fewer preterm deliveries than in untreated women from the same population.

AB  == we studied the relationships of selected microbes and the role of consorts in the causation of vaginal discharge which may be due to cervicitis or vaginitis. a total of 93 consecutive patients in the reproductive age group with symptoms of vaginal discharge along with their sexual partners were studied. samples were collected from the cervix and posterior fornix of the female patients and from the urethra and sub-prepucial area of the male partner for culture of neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma, candida, aerobic and anaerobic organisms. apart from cultures, koh and gram stain of the discharge were made. predominant pathogen isolated was ureaplasma urealyticum from 40 (43.01%) females and 23 (24.7%) males. the next common pathogenic organisms isolated were candida species from 11 (11.8%) females and 5 (5.4%) males and chlamydia trachomatis in 3 (3.2%) females and 1 (1.1%) male. various organisms were more frequently isolated from the 29 of 43 (67.4%) couples who had had sexual intercourse 7 days prior to the recruitment as compared to 14 of 43 (32.6%) who had had coitus more than 7 days prior to their recruitment. this may  be due to the spontaneous disappearance or decrease in the number of organisms to the level that they could be detected by culture. in our study, 6 (6.5%) of male  partners carrying pathogenic organisms were asymptomatic, indicating that their screening and treatment is vital.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis a "broad overview".
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) was first reported in 1995 by gardner and dukes, who described the unique clinical signs and symptoms and the distinctive nature of the vaginal discharge associated with it. they also described a "new" causative organism, which they named "haemophilus vaginalis", subsequently renamed gardnerella vaginalis. bv is currently the most prevalent cause of infectious vaginitis among women attending for genitourinary diseases. bv has a complex microbiology. lactobacillus populations, which are usually dominant in healthy women, are replaced by a polymicrobial group of organisms that includes g. vaginalis, anaerobic gram-negative rods such as prevotella species, peptostreptococcus species, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and often mobiluncus species. anaerobic bacteria produce enzymes, aminopeptidases, that degrade protein and decarboxylases that convert amino acids and other compounds to amines. those amines contribute to the signs and symptoms associated with the  syndrome, raising the vaginal ph and producing a discharge odor. the excessive amounts of bacteria characteristic of the syndrome attach to epithelial cell surfaces, resulting in "clue cell". nearly half the patients report no noticeable symptoms, but many develop a characteristic copious, malodorous discharge if untreated. results from epidemiologic studies have associated bv with serious upper genital tract infections and adverse pregnancy outcome. in particular, the  presence of bv in pregnant women increases the risk of preterm delivery, and evidence is now compelling that bv is a cause of preterm delivery. the interest in potential invasiveness of g. vaginalis has increased. however, virulence determinants have not been studied enough. the most important therapy includes clindamycin and metronidazole.

TI  == [bacterial vaginosis. epidemiology and risk factors].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a change in vaginal ecosystem where lactobacilli dominate, flora is absent or greatly reduced, and replaced with a mixed, predominantly anaerobic flora, consisting of gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, mobiluncus spp, bacteroides spp, prevotela spp, peptostreptococcus spp,  fusobacterium spp and porphyromonas spp. the concentration of bacteria increases  from 100 to 1000 fold in women with bv compared to healthy women. bv has been formerly known as nonspecific vaginitis, haemophilus vaginitis, corynebacterium vaginitis, gardnerella vaginitis and anaerobic vaginintis. bv is the most prevalent form of vaginal disturbances in reproductive age women. the average incidence of bv varies: 10-35% in patients visiting gynaecological wards, 10-30%  in patients visiting obstetric wards and 20-60% in patients visiting services of  sexually transmitted diseases. a typical clinical symptom of bv is malodorous vaginal discharge. however, more than 50% of all women with bv are asymptomatic.  bv has been associated with many gynaecological and obstetric complications such  as cervicitis, salpingitis, endometritis, postoperative infections, urinary tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, mild abnormal pap smear results and possible link with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, preterm delivery, premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis and postpartum endometritis. factors that increase the risk of bv are multiple partners, exposure to semen, prior trichomoniasis, intrauterine device usage, smoking, indigent population and frequent use of scented soap. diagnosis of bv is established by amsel's criteria  of which three of four are the following: presence of homogeneous discharge, vaginal fluid ph > 4.5, positive amine test and microscopic analysis of gram stained smear of vaginal discharge where "clue" cells (epithelial vaginal cells covered with mass of adherent bacteria, mostly coccobacilli) should be detected.  the treatment of patients with bv consist of metronidazole or clindamycin, per os or intravaginally. the treatment of asymptomatic women and male sex partners of women with bv is controversial. the aim of the study was to establish the occurrence rate of bv in our women and potential factors increasing the risk of bv. we examined 166 women at the institute of microbiology and immunology, university school of medicine, belgrade. diagnosis of bv was established by amsel's criteria. each woman filled in a special questionnaire. pregnant women were excluded. bv was diagnosed in 25% (33/166) of women. bv was more common among women with multiple partners. the most prevalent clinical symptom of bv was malodorous vaginal discharge. vaginal symptoms became more evident after intercourse. taking into consideration the occurrence rate of bv and its connection with numerous gynaecological and obstetric sequelae, and taking into account that the diagnosis of bv is quick, simple and inexpensive, we suggest that the examination of bv in women becomes a usual procedure.

(23.9% versus 13.8%; p <0.001). conclusion: in spite of this study being based solely on cytological criteria, in which specific hpv and gardnerella diagnostic tests were not used, the cytological smear is widely used in clinical practice and the data presented  in this investigation show that there is an association between gardnerella vaginalis and hpv infection. it remains to be established whether the microorganisms favor each other.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == characterisation and selection of a lactobacillus species to re-colonise the vagina of women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == this paper reports the results of characterising and selecting a strain of lactobacillus for potential use as a probiotic in regenerating the vaginal flora  of women with recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis (bv). bv is a condition characterised by a depletion of vaginal lactobacilli accompanied by an overgrowth of a mixed vaginal flora of aerobic, anaerobic and micro-aerophilic species in very large numbers. bv has been associated with various gynaecological and obstetric complications and has an extremely high recurrence rate, due in part to the failure to establish a normal vaginal flora after antimicrobial therapy. a total of 60 vaginal isolates of lactobacilli was assessed for characteristics considered important for vaginal re-colonisation. the characteristics studied were the in-vitro inhibitory activity of the lactobacilli against bacterial species isolated from women with recurrent bv, acid production after growth of the lactobacilli in liquid culture, production of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) and adhesiveness of the lactobacilli to exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells (vec). four strains of lactobacilli, l. acidophilus (61701 and 61880), l. crispatus (55730) and l. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii (65407), demonstrated the greatest  inhibitory activity against the bv-associated bacterial species. two of these isolates (55730 and 61880) produced h2o2. all four isolates produced a highly acidic environment after growth in liquid medium (ph <4). only one of these (strain 61701) was strongly adherent to vec (>100 bacteria/vec). a further isolate (l. acidophilus 48101) did not demonstrate maximum inhibitory activity against bv-associated bacteria, but was found to be a strong producer of h2o2 and was also highly adherent to vec. isolates 61701 and 48101 could be candidates for use as probiotics for vaginal re-colonisation.

AB  == previous studies have shown that gardnerella vaginalis can utilize iron-loaded human lactoferrin as a sole source of iron. in this study, g. vaginalis cells were shown to bind digoxigenin (dig)-labeled human lactoferrin in a dot blot assay. using the dig-labeled human lactoferrin, a 120-kda human lactoferrin-binding protein was detected by western blot analysis of g. vaginalis proteins. the lactoferrin-binding activity of this protein was found to be heat stable. competition studies indicated that this binding activity was specific for human lactoferrin. treatment of g. vaginalis cells with proteases suggested that  this protein was surface exposed. an increase in lactoferrin binding by the 120-kda protein was observed in g. vaginalis cells grown under iron-restrictive conditions, suggesting that this activity may be iron regulated.

TI  == pathogenesis of abnormal vaginal bacterial flora.
AB  == objective: this study was undertaken to determine the relationships between microscopy findings on wet mounts, such as lactobacillary grade or vaginal leukocytosis, and results of vaginal culture, lactate and succinate content of the vagina, and levels of selected cytokines. study design: in a population of 631 unselected women seeking treatment at an obstetrics and gynecology outpatient clinic, vaginal fluid was obtained by wooden ayre spatula for wet mounting and ph measurement, by high vaginal swab for culture, and by standardized vaginal rinsing with 2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride solution for measurements of lactate, succinate, interleukin 1beta, interleukin 8, leukemia inhibitory factor, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations. lactate and succinate levels were measured by gas-liquid chromatography and the cytokine concentrations were measured by specific immunoassays. both univariate analysis (student t test, welch test, chi(2) test, and fisher exact test) and multivariate regression analysis (cox analysis) were used. results: increasing disturbance of the lactobacillary flora (lactobacillary grades i, iia, iib, and iii) was highly correlated with the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis, enterococci, group b streptococci, and escherichia coli. vaginal ph and interleukin 8 and interleukin 1beta concentrations increased linearly with increasing lactobacillary grade, whereas lactate concentrations and the presence  of epithelial cell lysis decreased. a similar pattern of associations with increasing leukocyte count was clear, but in addition there was an increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. multivariate analysis of vaginal leukocytosis, lactobacillary grades, and the presence of positive vaginal culture results showed that interleukin 1beta concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade, leukemia inhibitory factor concentration was most closely related to the lactobacillary grade and positive culture results, interleukin 8 concentration was most closely related to positive culture results, and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentration was most closely related to vaginal leukocytosis and positive culture results. the concentration ratio of interleukin 1beta to interleukin 1 receptor antagonist remained stable, except when vaginal leukocytosis increased. in its most severe form, with >10 leukocytes per epithelial cell present, a decompensation of the vaginal flora with a collapse in interleukin 1beta and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist concentrations was seen, but there was a concurrent sharp increase in leukemia inhibitory factor concentration. this pattern was completely different from the course of the cytokine concentrations associated with a lactobacillary grade increase. conclusion: both disturbed lactobacillary grade and the presence of increasing vaginal leukocytosis were correlated with lactobacillary substrate (lactate) concentration, ph, and the concentrations of a variety of cytokines. there was a remarkably linear increase in these cytokines as either leukocytosis  or lactobacillary grade became more severe. in circumstances in which leukocytosis was extreme, however, interleukin 1beta was no longer produced but leukemia inhibitory factor concentrations increased. we speculate that in extreme inflammation the body tries to limit the damage that can be done by exaggerated cytokine production.

TI  == diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by wet mount identification of bacterial morphotypes in vaginal fluid.
AB  == in order to develop a more practical way of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis (bv),  we evaluated a scoring system, weighting small bacterial morphotypes versus lactobacillary morphotypes in wet mounts, assessed criteria for bv and normalcy from this scoring, and then evaluated their reproducibility and accuracy. we examined 754 women for ph, homogeneous vaginal discharge, amine odour, clue cells and the composite clinical diagnosis. we also examined wet mounts for small bacterial morphotypes and lactobacillary morphotypes, and weighted their quantitative presence as a bacterial morphotype score. the term 'small bacterial  morphotypes' denotes a group of small bacillary forms comprising coccobacilli, tiny rods, and mobile curved rods. the different characteristics of bv were all gradually associated with increased bacterial morphotype scoring. we deemed a score of 0-1 as normal, 2-4 as intermediate phase, grade i, 5-6 as intermediate phase, grade ii, and 7-8 indicative of bv. reproducibility of the interpretation  was high, both for the new grading system (weighted kappa 0.90 in women perceiving and 0.81 in women not perceiving abnormal vaginal discharge) and for the new criterion for bv (non-weighted kappa 0.91 and 0.84 in the 2 groups of women). the new criterion also proved highly concurrent with the composite clinical diagnosis (kappa 0.91 and 0.81 in the 2 groups). in conclusion, the wet  mount bacterial morphotype scoring is valid for grading of the disorder of the vaginal microbial ecosystem, and the new criterion for bv a more practical option than existing diagnostic methods.

AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to determine the relationship of bacterial vaginosis and bacterial vaginosis-associated microorganisms with an hiv-inducing  factor (hif) found in cervicovaginal lavage. design: a total of 26 cervicovaginal lavage specimens collected from 17 women were used in this study to determine if  hif was significantly associated with features consistent with bacterial vaginosis. methods: patients were evaluated for various clinical features including age, hiv status and stage, cd4 cell counts, clinical diagnosis of gynecological infections, vaginal ph, gram stains of vaginal fluid, phase of menstruation, and presence of cervical dysplasia. cervicovaginal lavage specimens were analyzed for the presence of hif by u1 bioassay. the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, and general mycoplasmataceae, and specifically mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, m. fermentans, m. genitalium in cervicovaginal lavage were determined by semiquantitative pcr. results: eleven cervicovaginal lavage samples from seven women were hif-positive and 15 cervicovaginal lavage samples from 11 women were hif-negative (patient no. 8 had two hif-negative cervicovaginal lavage and one hif-positive cervicovaginal lavage). the following  parameters were significantly associated with hif: abnormal vaginal fluid ph (>4.5) (p = 0.006), gram stains indicative of bacterial vaginosis (p = 0.007), normal menstrual cycle (p = 0.0007) and pcr detection and relative quantity of m. hominis (p = 0.0003, p = 0.002). conclusions: this study indicates that hif is closely associated with features of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == acid production by vaginal flora in vitro is consistent with the rate and extent  of vaginal acidification.
AB  == perinatally, and between menarche and menopause, increased levels of estrogen cause large amounts of glycogen to be deposited in the vaginal epithelium. during these times, the anaerobic metabolism of the glycogen, by the epithelial cells themselves and/or by vaginal flora, causes the vagina to become acidic (ph approximately 4). this study was designed to test whether the characteristics of  acid production by vaginal flora in vitro can account for vaginal acidity. eight  vaginal lactobacillus isolates from four species-l. gasseri, l. vaginalis, l. crispatus, and l. jensenii-acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (3.2 to 4.8) that matches the range seen in the lactobacillus-dominated human vagina (ph 3.6 to 4.5 in most women) (b. andersch, l. forssman, k. lincoln, and p. torstensson, gynecol. obstet. investig. 21:19-25, 1986; l. cohen, br. j. vener. dis. 45:241-246, 1969; j. paavonen, scand. j. infect. dis. suppl. 40:31-35, 1983; c. tevi-benissan, l. belec, m. levy, v. schneider-fauveau, a. si mohamed, m.-c. hallouin, m. matta, and g. gresenguet, clin. diagn. lab. immunol. 4:367-374, 1997). during exponential growth, all of these lactobacillus species acidified their growth medium at rates on the order of 10(6) protons/bacterium/s. such rates, combined with an estimate of the total number of lactobacilli in the vagina, suggest that vaginal lactobacilli could reacidify the vagina at the rate  observed postcoitally following neutralization by the male ejaculate (w. h. masters and v. e. johnson, human sexual response, p. 93, 1966). during bacterial  vaginosis (bv), there is a loss of vaginal acidity, and the vaginal ph rises to >4.5. this correlates with a loss of lactobacilli and an overgrowth of diverse bacteria. three bv-associated bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia,  and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, acidified their growth medium to an asymptotic ph (4.7 to 6.0) consistent with the characteristic elevated vaginal ph associated with bv. together, these observations are consistent with vaginal flora, rather than epithelial cells, playing a primary role in creating the acidity of the vagina.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis: a review.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinically definable condition that is frequently diagnosed in the primary care setting. changes in the nomenclature, causative microorganisms, as well as treatment have caused confusion over the last century. bv is currently viewed as a shift in the normal vaginal ecosystem from a predominance of aerobic bacteria to anaerobic bacteria (soper, 1993), resulting in a malodorous discharge. however, more than one half of clinically diagnosed patients are asymptomatic. recent evidence indicates that the anaerobes identified as components of bv have been implicated in obstetric complications, postoperative pelvic infections, and pelvic inflammatory disease. practice issues resulting from this research include the appropriate treatment of asymptomatic women, especially in pregnancy. this article reviews bv from a historical perspective, provides a summary of recent research findings identifying bv as a possible risk factor in various serious medical conditions and their sequelae, and discusses related practice concerns resulting from the implications of these  findings.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora isolated from the female genital tract  activates hiv-1 expression.
AB  == alteration of cervicovaginal microbial flora can lead to vaginosis, which is associated with an increased risk of hiv-1 transmission. we recently characterized a soluble hiv-inducing factor (hif) from the cervicovaginal lavage  (cvl) samples of women. the goals of this study were to determine the effect of cervicovaginal microflora on hiv-1 expression and to elucidate the relationship between hif activity and microflora. physiologically relevant microorganisms, mycoplasma, diphtheroid-like bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus constellatus, cultured from the cvl of a representative woman with a clinical condition of bacterial vaginosis and possessing hif activity, induced hiv-1 expression. the magnitude of virus induction varied widely with the greatest stimulation induced by diphtheroid-like bacteria and mycoplasma. the transcriptional induction by mycoplasma was mediated by activation of the kb enhancer, an activation mechanism shared with hif. also as with hif, mycoplasma induced ap-1 dependent transcription. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based speciation showed that the isolate was m. hominis. our data  indicate that bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora can enhance hiv-1 transcription and replication and identify m. hominis as a potential source for hif activity. the virus-enhancing activities associated with the microflora and hif may increase genital tract viral load, potentially contributing to hiv transmission.

TI  == risk factors for laparoscopically confirmed pelvic inflammatory disease: findings from mumbai (bombay), india.
AB  == objectives: sexually transmitted diseases (stds) are an important cause of pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) but have often not been detected in microbiological studies of indian women admitted to hospital gynaecology wards or private clinics. in this cross sectional study, women living in the inner city of mumbai  (bombay) were investigated for socioeconomic, clinical, and microbiological risk  factors for pid. methods: microbiological tests and laparoscopic examination were carried out on 2736 women aged < or = 35 years who came to a health facility with suspected acute salpingitis or infertility or for laparoscopic sterilisation. 86  women with a clinical diagnosis of pid were not referred for laparoscopy although their characteristics are described. associations between various risk factors and pid status were investigated and logistic regression performed on all factors that remained significant. results: of women with a laparoscopically confirmed evaluation, 26 women had acute and 48 chronic pelvic infection. independent risk  factors for pid were later age at menarche (> or = 14 years), a history of stillbirth and no previous pregnancy, history of tuberculosis, std, dilatation and curettage or previous laparoscopy, and presence of gardnerella vaginalis. conclusions: it is concluded that std related risk factors applied to only a small proportion of pid cases and that other determinants of pid are important, including obstetric complications, invasive surgical procedures such as laparoscopy, and tuberculosis.

TI  == activation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 expression by gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is associated with an increased rate of sexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) type 1, and gardnerella vaginalis is frequently isolated from the genital tracts of women with bv. g. vaginalis lysates were found to significantly stimulate hiv expression in monocytoid cells. stimulation was significantly higher when lysates were heated at 100 degrees c for 5 min but was reduced by treatment with lysozyme or protease. g. vaginalis lysates also activated hiv expression in certain t cell lines. g. vaginalis lysates activated hiv long-terminal repeat transcription in hiv-infected cells and increased nf-kappab binding activity, indicating an effect by g. vaginalis on hiv transcription. the activation of hiv production by g. vaginalis suggests that genital tract infection with g. vaginalis increases the risk of hiv transmission by increasing hiv expression in the genital tract. this  may explain, at least in part, the increased rate of hiv transmission in women with bv.

TI  == assessment of office-based care of sexually transmitted diseases and vaginitis and antibiotic decision-making by obstetrician-gynecologists.
AB  == objective: survey office-based obstetric-gynecologic practitioners regarding their knowledge of infectious disease care and antibiotic use. methods: a survey  questionnaire of multiple-choice questions was mailed to fellows of the american  college of obstetricians and gynecologists about clinical entities for which recommendations have undergone recent changes or about which there was a lack of  consensus in a prior similar survey (gibbs rs, mcgregor ja, mead pb, et al.: obstet gynecol 83:631-636, 1994). results: respondents indicated that oral metronidazole was their most frequent choice to treat bacterial vaginosis. ampicillin (57%) was used more often than penicillin (39%) for intrapartum group  b streptococcus prophylaxis. azithromycin was preferred (61%) over erythromycin-base (38%) for chlamydia treatment during pregnancy. there were several modes of practice that deviated from accepted care: 27% and 29% did not screen for chlamydia and gonorrhea, respectively, in pregnancy; 17% used cultures for gardnerella vaginalis to diagnose bacterial vaginosis; 25% considered quinolones to be safe in pregnancy; 93% felt metronidazole should never be used in pregnancy; and the majority (66%) would send a patient treated successfully for pelvic cellulitis home with an oral antibiotic. conclusion: respondents' infectious disease knowledge and practices in obstetrics and gynecology is appropriate in treating sexually transmitted diseases, bacterial vaginosis, and group b streptococcus. numerous deficiencies still exist in screening for sexually transmitted diseases in pregnancy and diagnosing bacterial vaginosis, as well as in the choice of antibiotics to use or avoid for certain infections.

TI  == [survey of sexually transmitted diseases in the region of rio cuarto].
AB  == sexually transmitted diseases (std) are acquired mainly through sexual intercourse, being one of the most frequent groups of infectious diseases worldwide and consequently an important public health problem. the aim of this paper was to determine the current state of std and to compare different diagnostic methods in the population studied. a total of 1060 samples from vaginal flows, endocervical material and urethral discharge were studied during 3 years. of the total samples, 583 were positive, 493 in women and 90 in men. microorganisms found in women were: gardnerella vaginalis (39.3%), candida albicans (21.1%), trichomonas vaginalis (17.3%), candida trachomatis (11.3%), neisseria gonorrhoeae (3.2%): mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urelyticum (6.5%) and treponema pallidum (1.4%), the associations found were, gardnerella vaginalis with trichomonas vaginalis 5.5%; gardnerella vaginalis with candida albicans 4.9%; trichomonas vaginalis with neisseria gonorrhoeae (2.2%) and gardnerella vaginalis with chlamydia trachomatis (1.9%). in men, gonococcal urethritis (ug) represented 37.7% non ug 55.6% and treponema pallidum 6.7%. these results indicate a decrease in sifilis and in ug when compared to previous studies showing that gonococcal cervicitis had also decreased. we found an important increase in the prevalence of urethritis and non gonococcal cervicitis in agreement with world statistics which consider these diseases as the most common  venereal ones. it is necessary to increase the search for chlamydia trachomatis in pregnant women due to vertical transmission. it should be noted that, in spite of certain fluctuations, the incidence of the std in our area is still unacceptably high.

TI  == gram stain method shows better sensitivity than clinical criteria for detection of bacterial vaginosis in surveillance of pregnant, low-income women in a clinical setting.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the study is to determine whether the gram stain method is superior to the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in  low-income pregnant women seen in a resident clinic setting. the clinical criteria is the current diagnostic method employed to diagnose bacterial vaginosis. study design: in this study, 51 pregnant women with vaginal discharge  were prospectively evaluated. all were screened using the clinical criteria, gram stain method, and culture of the discharge. the modified scoring system instituted by nugent et al. (j clin microbiol 29:297-301, 1991) was employed in reading the gram stain smears. the clinical criteria were then compared with the  gram stain method. isolation of moderate to many gardnerella vaginalis growth by  culture was used as the confirmatory finding. results: sensitivity of the gram stain method (91%) was significantly higher than that of the clinical criteria (46%), (sign test p = 0.0023, < 0.01). the gram stain method also has both a low  false-negative (4%) and high negative predictive value (96%), making it an ideal  diagnostic test. conclusion: the gram stain method is a rapid and cost-effective  test that is also highly reproducible and readily available in many laboratories. these features make the gram stain method a more desirable screening procedure for bacterial vaginosis in a clinic population.

AB  == bacterial vaginosis is the most common lower genital tract infection encountered  among women of reproductive age. this condition can best be considered as a vaginal syndrome associated with an alteration of the normal vaginal flora rather than an infection specific to any one microorganism. bacterial vaginosis is a clinical condition with a complex microbiology that is characterized by a reduced concentration of a normally abundant lactobacillus species along with high concentrations of gram-negative and anaerobic bacteria, particularly, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus, bacteroides, prevotella, and mycoplasma species. the exact make up of the microorganisms and their relative concentration vary among women who have this condition. although it was previously regarded as a harmless  condition, recent work has linked bacterial vaginosis to numerous upper genital tract complications such as preterm labor and preterm delivery, preterm premature rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, and postpartum endometritis. the findings from recent prospective randomized trials suggest that treatment of bacterial vaginosis in certain women who are at high risk for preterm delivery decreases the rate of preterm birth.

TI  == characterization of actinomyces turicensis and actinomyces radingae strains from  human clinical samples.
AB  == whole-organism protein electrophoresis was used to compare and group unidentified coryneform bacteria resembling gardnerella vaginalis and various actinomyces and  arcanobacterium species. the obtained clusters of strains were further characterized by whole-cell fatty acid analysis and a variety of biochemical tests. species-specific oligonucleotide probes based on 16s rrna gene sequences were designed. the results demonstrate that the majority of the isolates belonged to actinomyces turicensis; the other strains belonged to actinomyces radingae. the descriptions of both species are emended.

TI  == preterm birth: associations with genital and possibly oral microflora.
AB  == opportunistic pathogenic microbes are indigenous to the female lower genital tract and etiologic in many types of pelvic infections and, apparently, a portion of preterm birth (ptb) cases. bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a clinical syndrome based on an altered genital microflora in which gardnerella vaginalis; anaerobic  species primarily among prevotella, porphyromonas, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, and mobiluncus; mycoplasma hominis; and ureaplasma urealyticum become predominant in vaginal secretions. this bv complex of microbes, compared to a normal vaginal microflora dominated by facultative lactobacilli, is associated with significantly increased risks for preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, ptb, and other perinatal infectious complications. pathogenetic mechanisms include an ascending route of infection and/or inflammatory process due to microbial products and maternal and/or fetal response(s) with production of prostaglandins and cytokines. in the presence of periodontal disease, oral opportunistic pathogens and/or their inflammatory products also may have a role in prematurity via a hematogenous route. fusobacterium nucleatum, a common oral species, is the most frequently isolated species from amniotic fluid cultures among women with preterm labor and intact membranes. also, the species and subspecies of fusobacteria identified from amniotic fluid most closely match those reported from healthy and diseased subgingival sites, namely f. nucleatum subspecies vincentii and f. nucleatum subspecies nucleatum, compared to strains identified from the lower genital tract. although these fusobacteria also could be acquired through cunnilingus from a partner, new data associating maternal periodontal disease with preterm low birth weight taken with the isolation of f. nucleatum, capnocytophaga, and other oral species from amniotic fluid support further study of a possible additional route, oral-hematogenous, to ptb.

TI  == female genital tract bacterial coisolates with candida albicans in patients without clinical vaginitis.
AB  == objective: in vitro, candida albicans has demonstrated the ability to inhibit replication of selected bacteria. little information exists on the impact of c. albicans on the vaginal bacterial flora in vivo. the purpose of this study is to  identify the coexisting bacterial flora when c. albicans is isolated from vaginal cultures submitted to a hospital-based testing facility for reasons other than vulvovaginitis. methodology: all specimens (240) received from ambulatory care clinics over a six-month period were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria  and candida species. those specimens submitted for cervicitis, vaginitis, or vaginal discharge and those from which yeasts other than c. albicans were isolated were eliminated. to control for sample biases, a subgroup composed of all pregnant women for whom cultures were done as screening procedures was similarly studied. chi-square analyses, comparing the prevalence of individual bacteria isolated with and without the presence of c. albicans, were done for all study populations using spss for windows software (1994). results: two hundred and forty consecutive specimens were bacteriologically analyzed. of the 220 vaginal samples used in the study, c. albicans was isolated in 44 instances (20%). neither the presence of the lactobacilli nor the presence of gardnerella vaginalis markedly influenced the isolation rate of c. albicans. the group b streptococci had a greater probability of coisolation when c. albicans was present (27.3% verses 16%), but this was not statistically significant (p < 0.8). dissociation between the presence of c. albicans and the coisolation of peptostreptococcus species and anaerobic gram-positive cocci and/or bacilli was noted (p < 0.0819), while the incidence of gram-positive aerobic bacilli was reduced in the presence of c. albicans (30/176 [17.1%] versus 6/44 [13.6%]), this reduced incidence was not statistically significant. isolation data of the subgroup of pregnant women supported these observations. conclusion: within the limitations of the study, statistically, the data suggests that an inverse relationship exists between the presence of c. albicans and recovery of peptostreptococcus and anaerobic gram-positive cocci and bacilli.

AB  == objective: to report long-term cytologic findings after treatment of congenital vaginal aplasia or mayer-rokitansky-kuster-hauser syndrome (mrkh) using progressive traction of the vulvar tissues, or vecchietti's technique (vt). study design: in eight women with mrkh, neovaginal smears stained by the harris-schorr  technique were collected 2-12 years after vt. results: eosinophilic superficial cells observed in all cases indicate that the neovaginal epithelium responds to hormonal variations. the presence of doderlein bacilli (seven cases) suggests that the regional environment of the neovagina is almost the same as that of the  normal vagina. gardnerella vaginalis (one case) and human papilloma virus infection (low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) (one case) were also observed. conclusion: neovaginal smears taken after the cicatrization period following construction of a neovagina by vt show a remarkable resemblance to those from normal vaginal mucosa and suggest that these neovaginas are almost the same as normal vaginas.

TI  == chlamydia trachomatis: probable cause of prostatitis.
AB  == seventy-eight men with symptoms of chronic or subacute prostatitis were enrolled. investigations for the presence of chlamydia trachomatis in urethral swabs were carried out. the expressed prostatic secretions were additionally examined for mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, gardnerella vaginalis, other gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, trichomonas vaginalis, yeast-like fungi and leucocyte count. furthermore, all patients were evaluated for the presence of serum anti-chlamydial igg antibodies. signs of inflammation on the basis of the count of leucocytes per hpf in the prostatic secretions were detected in 42 patients (group i). prostatodynia was found in the remaining 36 men (group ii). in group i, chlamydial antigen was detected in the urethra and expressed prostatic secretions (eps) in 6 (14.3%) and 9 (21.4%) patients, respectively. no  evidence of current chlamydial infection was found in group ii. the presence of serum anti-chlamydial igg antibodies was demonstrated in 13/42 (30.9%) patients with prostatitis and in 3/36 (8.3%) patients with prostatodynia (p < 0.01). the results suggest that chlamydia may be one of the causative agents of chronic prostatitis.

TI  == use of a continuous-culture biofilm system to study the antimicrobial susceptibilities of gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus acidophilus have been shown to grow to high titers in a simple biofilm system. this system was used in the present investigation to compare the biofilm-eradicating concentrations (becs) of amoxicillin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole to standard tube mic and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) results. with the lactobacillus, the bec/tube mbc ratio was at least 16:1, while for g. vaginalis the ratio varied from 2:1 to 512:1. the simple continuous-culture system used in the present investigation is ideal for investigating the bec for bacteria involved in complex ecological situations such as bacterial vaginosis and may be useful for the identification of the most effective and selective antibiotic therapy.

TI  == clinical findings in female genital schistosomiasis in madagascar.
AB  == to assess the morbidity of s. haematobium infection in women of reproductive age  (15-49 years) in the western part of madagascar, the village of betalatala with a prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in women of 75.6% (95% confidence limit 69.3 to 81.9%) was compared with a neighbouring village with similar socio-economic characteristics and a prevalence of 5.0% (95% confidence limit 0 to 11.75%). the women were questioned in malagasy about obstetrical history and urogynecological symptoms. they were examined gynaecologically, parasitologically and by ultrasonography. important stds were excluded by appropriate diagnostics.  in betalatala significantly more women reported a history of spontaneous abortion (p < 0.01), complaints of irregular menstruation (p < 0.001), pelvic pain (<0.05), vaginal discharge (p < 0.0001), dysuria (p < 0.05) and haematuria (p < 0.01) than in the control village. biopsies were obtained from the cervix of 36 women with macroscopical lesions, and in 12 cases s. haematobium eggs were found  by histological sectioning (33.3%). in the control village no eggs were detected  in the histological sections of biopsies taken from 14 women. (p < 0.05). infections with candida albicans, trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis and treponema pallidum were found in similar frequencies in both villages. in 9.8% of the women in betalatala abnormalities of the upper reproductive tract were revealed by ultrasonography versus none in the women from the control village (p < 0.05). echographic abnormalities of the urinary tract were present in 24% and 3% of the women in the study village and in the control village, respectively (p < 0.0001). these findings were accompanied by an elevated frequency of haematuria (55% versus 20%) and proteinuria (70.4% versus 25%) in the study population (p < 0.0001). our study indicates that s. haematobium infection in women may not only cause symptoms in the urinary tract, but also frequently in the lower and upper reproductive tract.

TI  == few microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis may constitute the pathologic core: a population-based microbiologic study among 3596 pregnant women.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the association between various microorganisms isolated from the genital tract in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis. study design:  a cross-sectional population-based study among pregnant women addressed at their  first antenatal visit before 24 full gestational weeks from the referring area of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at odense university hospital, denmark, from november 1992 to february 1994. the main outcome measures were prevalence of various microorganisms and statistical estimates of interactions (crude, adjusted, and relative odds ratios) between the microorganisms isolated from the lower genital tract in pregnant women with and without clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. results: three thousand five hundred ninety-six (3596) pregnant women were asked to participate. of the 3596 pregnant women 3174  (88.4%) agreed to participate before 24 full gestational weeks. after controlling for the presence of other microorganisms, strong associations between gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, mycoplasma hominis, and present bacterial vaginosis were found. similarly lactobacillus spp. were found to be associated with the absence of bacterial vaginosis. the combination of g. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria and/or m. hominis was found in 59.6% of the cases with bacterial vaginosis and in 3.9% of the cases without bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio 36.4, 95% confidence interval 27.8 to 47.8). the crude odds ratio was found to be as high as 74.8 (95% confidence interval 32.3 to 174.1) when the combination of g. vaginalis, m. hominis, anaerobic bacteria, and no lactobacillus spp. was associated with bacterial vaginosis. conclusion: there is a microbial foundation for bacterial vaginosis, and it is possibly due to an intermicrobial interaction in which the microorganisms g. vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and m.  hominis are dominating, indicating that these constitute the pathologic core of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == immunoglobulin a response against gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin and sialidase activity in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the correlation between the immunoglobulin a immune response to gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin and sialidase activity in vaginal fluids from patients with bacterial vaginosis. study design:  nonpregnant women who were examined at a gynecologic clinic, in an age range of 18 to 62 years, were enrolled. the study population comprised 131 healthy volunteers, 32 women with bacterial vaginosis that was positive for immunoglobulin a to gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin, 40 women with bacterial vaginosis that was negative for immunoglobulin a to gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin, and 19 women with candida vaginitis. bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed by clinical criteria and gram stain. results: sialidase activity was present in 75% (54/72) of patients with bacterial vaginosis. women having bacterial vaginosis and lacking a specific immunoglobulin a response had a significantly higher level of sialidase activity than patients who had an immune response against gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin. sialidase activity was detected in 87% (35/40) of the former subgroup of patients with bacterial vaginosis and in 59% (19/32) of women of the latter subgroup. no sialidase activity was measured in patients with candidiasis. specificity of the assay for healthy controls was 95%  (124/131 women without sialidase activity). conclusions: sialidases produced by prevotella bivia and other microorganisms present in the microflora of patients with bacterial vaginosis are very likely a virulence factor not only by destroying the mucins and enhancing adherence of bacteria but also by impairing a specific immunoglobulin a immune response against other virulence factors such as cytotoxin from gardnerella vaginalis.

TI  == metronidazole. a therapeutic review and update.
AB  == the nitroimidazole antibiotic metronidazole has a limited spectrum of activity that encompasses various protozoans and most gram-negative and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. metronidazole has activity against protozoans like entamoeba  histolytica, giardia lamblia and trichomonas vaginalis, for which the drug was first approved as an effective treatment. anaerobic bacteria which are typically  sensitive are primarily gram-negative anaerobes belonging to the bacteroides and  fusobacterium spp. gram-positive anaerobes such as peptostreptococci and clostridia spp. are likely to test sensitive to metronidazole, but resistant isolates are probably encountered with greater frequency than with the gram-negative anaerobes. gardnerella vaginalis is a pleomorphic gram-variable bacterial bacillus that is also susceptible to metronidazole. helicobacter pylori has been strongly associated with gastritis and duodenal ulcers. classic regimens for eradicating this pathogen have included metronidazole, usually with acid suppression medication plus bismuth and amoxicillin. the activity of metronidazole against anaerobic bowel flora has been used for prophylaxis and treatment of patients with crohn's disease who might develop an infectious complication. treatment of clostridium difficile-induced pseudomembraneous colitis has usually been with oral metronidazole or vancomycin, but the lower cost and similar efficacy of metronidazole, coupled with the increased concern about imprudent use of vancomycin leading to increased resistance in enterococci, have made metronidazole the preferred agent here. metronidazole has played an important role in anaerobic-related infections. advantages to using metronidazole are the percentage of sensitive gram-negative anaerobes, its availability as oral and intravenous dosage forms, its rapid bacterial killing, its good tissue penetration, its considerably lower chance of inducing c. difficile colitis, and  expense. metronidazole has notable effectiveness in treating anaerobic brain abscesses. metronidazole is a cost-effective agent due to its low acquisition cost, its pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, an acceptable adverse effect profile, and its undiminished antimicrobial activity. while its role as part of a therapeutic regimen for treating mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections has been reduced by newer, more expensive combination therapies, these new combinations have not been shown to have any therapeutic advantage over metronidazole. although the use of metronidazole on a global scale has been curtailed by newer agents for various infections, metronidazole still has a role for these and other therapeutic uses. many clinicians still consider metronidazole to be the 'gold standard' antibiotic against which all other antibiotics with anaerobic activity  should be compared.

AB  == we studied the vaginal microflora of 73 postmenopausal women who had never received estrogen replacement therapy. the median age of these women was 67 years, and none of them had bacterial vaginosis. lactobacilli were detected in 36 (49%) of these women at a mean concentration of 10(5.7) cfu/g of vaginal fluid. h2o2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 38% of the women. some of the other organisms that were recovered, including gardnerella vaginalis (27% of the  women), ureaplasma urealyticum (13%), candida albicans (1%), and prevotella bivia (33%), were less frequently isolated from postmenopausal women than from women of reproductive age, while coliforms (41%) were recovered at higher frequencies. lactobacilli, yeasts, and bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria are less commonly part of the vaginal microflora in postmenopausal women than in women of  reproductive age, which may explain the decrease in the incidence of bacterial vaginosis and yeast vaginitis among these women.

TI  == multiple c-terminal serine phosphorylation accompanies both protein kinase c-dependent and -independent activation of cytosolic 85 kda phospholipase a2 in macrophages.
AB  == exposure of mouse macrophages to either phorbol ester or certain bacteria was previously shown to cause increased phosphorylation of the cytosolic 85 kda phospholipase a2 as well as a stable increase in its catalytic activity. we have  now attempted to map the major phosphorylation sites on the enzyme in such cells. phosphorylation occurred on serine residues without a detectable increase in either phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine. after cnbr cleavage five fragments showed increased 32p labelling. among those the most heavily labelled fragment was identified as the most c-terminal (residues 698-749), containing six serine residues. this was true whether phorbol ester or bacteria, causing protein kinase c-independent phospholipase a2 activation, was used as stimulus. the heavy phosphorylation of the most c-terminal fragment and an analysis of tryptic peptides derived from it suggested that more than one of the six serine residues  became phosphorylated. smaller increases also occurred in other cnbr-cleaved fragments from the c-terminal part of the protein, including that carrying ser-505, a known target of the mitogen-activated protein kinase erk-2 (extracellular-signal regulated kinase). dexamethasone treatment (1-100 nm for 20 h), which was earlier shown to dose-dependently down-regulate the 85 kda phospholipase a2 and its activation by phorbol ester and zymosan, was here shown  also to counteract the protein kinase c-independent activation and arachidonate release elicited by bacteria. it remains to be determined whether all phosphorylation sites are equally affected under those conditions.

AB  == objective: our purpose was to confirm the elevation of vaginal ph expected in patients with bacterial pathogens in premenopausal women and to examine the relationship of serum follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels to vaginal ph in menopausal patients without and with hormone replacement therapy. study design: vaginal ph was determined by phenaphthazine (nitrazine) ph paper in 253 patients seen in a solo private practice for routine speculum examination. none of the patients were pregnant. measurements were made of serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol for 172 patients and vaginal cultures  were taken from 82 patients. vaginal ph was correlated with vaginal cultures and  serum follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol levels by use of statistical analysis. results: vaginal ph was elevated in all premenopausal patients with documented bacterial pathogens. serum estradiol levels showed an inverse and serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels a direct statistical correlation with vaginal ph in menopausal patients. conclusions: measurement of vaginal ph is useful, effective, and inexpensive for screening purposes. a vaginal ph of 4.5 is consistent with a premenopausal serum estradiol level and the absence of bacterial pathogens. an elevated vaginal ph in the 5.0 to 6.5 range suggests a diagnosis of either bacterial pathogens or decreased serum estradiol. in patients with an elevated ph, vaginal culture should establish the diagnosis. in the absence of bacterial pathogens, a vaginal ph of 6.0 to 7.5 is strongly suggestive of menopause. titration of estradiol level by vaginal ph during estrogen replacement therapy may help menopausal women avoid side effects or cessation of  therapy.

AB  == in total 34 strains of gardnerella vaginalis were analyzed with various molecular techniques in order to find the possibility of dividing this single species into  different genotypes. classical ribotyping, pcr-ribotyping and restriction analysis of 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer sequences were all unsuccessful in genotype differentiation of these bacteria. only amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra) was suitable in recognizing different g. vaginalis genotypes. at least 3-4 genotypes were identified with different restriction enzymes, some of which showed a prevalent distribution in certain of the centers  from which they were collected. although in this study no correlation was found between bacterial vaginosis and any of the genotypes identified, the ardra method could prove to be a useful tool for studying the etiopathology and epidemiology of g. vaginalis.

TI  == [a comparison of 2 clinical laboratory methods in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == objective: to determine the sensitivity, the specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of two laboratory methods used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis; gram stain and the gardnerella vaginalis culture, in comparison with the clinical sings of vaginal discharge; homogeneous secretion, ph > 4.7, positive amine test and the presence of clue cells. design: a prospective, comparative and crossover type. setting: this study was carried out in the health center "dr. jose castro villagrana" ssa, situated in tlalpan, mexico city. from january, 1992 to july, 1996. participants: 3,142 women, from 16 to 55 years old with cervicovaginitis diagnosis, without previous treatment and sexual active life history. results: by means of clinical criterion (33.1%), it was diagnosed 1,041 women with bacterial vaginosis. statistical differences were not found between the culture and gram stain in the presence or no-presence of bacterial vaginosis diagnosed by clinical criterion (p = 0.33) the clue cells were the best predictor of bacterial vaginosis. conclusions: the differences between both methods analysed were minimal and they didn't have statistical value so that, it  is proposed the gram stain as diagnostic method of bacterial vaginosis based on factors like speed, reproductiveness and low cost.

TI  == identification and quantification of bifidobacterium species isolated from food with genus-specific 16s rrna-targeted probes by colony hybridization and pcr.
AB  == a bifidobacterium genus-specific target sequence in the v9 variable region of the 16s rrna has been elaborated and was used to develop a hybridization probe. the specificity of this probe, named lm3 (5'-cgggtgcti*cccactttcatg-3'), was used to  identify all known type strains and distinguish them from other bacteria. all of  the 30 type strains of bifidobacterium which are available at the german culture  collection deutsche sammlung von mikroorganismen und zellkulturen, 6 commercially available production strains, and 34 closely related relevant strains (as negative controls) were tested. all tested bifidobacteria showed distinct positive signals by colony hybridization, whereas all negative controls showed no distinct dots except gardnerella vaginalis dsm4944 and propionibacterium freudenreichii subsp. shermanii dsm4902, which gave slight signals. furthermore,  we established a method for isolation and identification of bifidobacteria from food by using a pcr assay without prior isolation of dna but breaking the cells with proteinase k. by this method, all bifidobacterium strains lead to a dna product of the expected size. we also established a quick assay to quantitatively measure bifidobacterium counts in food and feces by dilution plating and colony hybridization. we were able to demonstrate that 2.1 x 10(6) to 2.3 x 10(7) colonies/g of sour milk containing bifidobacteria hybridized with the specific nucleotide probe. with these two methods, genus-specific colony hybridization and genus-specific pcr, it is now possible to readily and accurately detect any bifidobacteria in food and fecal samples and to discriminate between them and members of other genera.

TI  == semisynthetic derivatives of purpuromycin as potential topical agents for vaginal infections.
AB  == purpuromycin (1) is an antibiotic with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity, encompassing bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, particularly those involved in vaginal infections. with the aim of enhancing the solubility and reducing the  serum binding, a chemical program of modifications was undertaken on the natural  compound, and a new interesting series of derivatives at the naphthoquinone system was synthesized and evaluated as potential topical agents for vaginal infections. in particular three semisynthetic derivatives, 7'-amino (8a), 7'-methylamino (8b), 7'-ethylamino (8c), of 7'-demethoxypurpuromycin seemed to be the most promising. they were tested for in vitro activity against three of the most important vaginal pathogens and showed activity similar to that of purpuromycin against candida isolates while they were significantly more active against trichomonas vaginalis and gardnerella vaginalis, which are cultured in media containing blood or serum. this is probably due to the fact that the activity of the derivatives is less antagonized by these supplements than that of purpuromycin.

TI  == [laboratory diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == microbiological analysis of discharge from the genitals in passenger car conductors (5787 women and 1496 men aged 20 to 40) showed gardnerella vaginalis to be the most frequent agent of urogenital infection. it was isolated in 26% cases, whereas trichomonas were isolated in 2.5%, fungi in 1.5%, and gonococci in 0.27% cases. the diagnosis of gardnerellosis is reliable if the key cells are found. monoinfection with g. vaginalis was diagnosed in 80% patients, the overwhelming majority (74%) of carriers of this bacterium had no inflammatory symptoms, and in only 26% the carrier state was associated with the presence of leukocytes and histiocytes, more often in the cervix. in men the carrier state was detected in 0.4% cases. the clinical picture of gardnerella infection is similar to that of infection with mobiluncus, which is little known. this infection occurred 10 times less frequently (2.5%) than gardnerellosis, but in 92% cases it was a component of mixed infection, most frequently in association with g. vaginalis. a little known fungus leptothrix was found in the genital discharge of 4% examinees, mostly women, but sometimes in men as well; it is represented by 3 types of ramifying threads. the practitioners are to know these  infections causing specific diseases, such as bacterial vaginosis, which are often responsible for serious complications in gynecology and obstetrics.

TI  == evidence for a commensal, symbiotic relationship between gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella bivia involving ammonia: potential significance for bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == six strains of prevotella bivia and 4 of gardnerella vaginalis were examined for  nutrient substrate utilization as part of ongoing studies on the pathogenesis of  bacterial vaginosis. addition of single amino acids to vaginal defined medium (vdm) was stimulatory to the growth of p. bivia but not to g. vaginalis. however, peptides significantly promoted the growth of both organisms. growth of p. bivia  in vdm and vdm supplemented with either amino acids or peptone was accompanied by net ammonia production, while growth of g. vaginalis under the same conditions resulted in net ammonia utilization. ammonia-enriched supernatants from the growth of p. bivia in peptone-supplemented vdm were stimulatory to g. vaginalis growth. however, ammonia-reduced supernatants from g. vaginalis growth in peptone-supplemented vdm had a neutral effect on p. bivia growth. a commensal relationship between p. bivia to g. vaginalis is proposed, with ammonia flow as a mechanism to support this hypothesis.

TI  == what is normal vaginal flora?
AB  == objective: to observe the composition of the vaginal flora of healthy women over  time, and in relation to hormonal changes, sexual activity, and hygiene habits. design: a longitudinal surveillance of the vaginal flora over an eight week period. subjects: 26 female health care workers in local genitourinary medicine clinics. methods: the participants were anonymised. they filled in diary cards daily. blind vaginal swabs were self-taken two-seven times weekly. a smear was air-dried for later gram staining. the swabs were also cultured for candida spp,  gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum.  results: of 26 subjects, only four had normal vaginal microbiology throughout. one woman, who was not sexually active, had bacterial vaginosis (bv) throughout and nine (35%) had intermittent bv. candidiasis was found intermittently in eight women (31%), and eight had normal microscopy. u urealyticum was isolated intermittently in 40% of women with bv, 25% with candida, and 50% with normal microscopy. many women were symptomatic, but symptoms correlated poorly with microbiological findings. all but two women were sexually active; however, more women with bv were exposed to semen. bv seemed to be related to frequent use of scented soap, and there appeared to be an additive effect of clothing and hygiene factors. conclusions: our study raises doubts about what should be regarded as normal vaginal flora. it calls into question the significance of finding bv or u  urealyticum on a single occasion in asymptomatic women, or of finding normal flora in symptomatic women. the effect of external factors on the vaginal flora deserve further study.

TI  == interrelationships within the bacterial flora of the female genital tract.
AB  == analysis of 240 consecutive vaginal swabs using the compatibility profile technique revealed that only 2 bacteria have the ability to be a sole isolate and as such a candidate to be a major aerobic regulator of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract (bffgt). compatibility profiles of lactobacillus and gardnerella vaginalis have shown that these organisms shared compatibility profiling for the majority of the normal bacterial constituents of the female genital tract. dominance disruption appears to come from the addition of compatible co-isolates and presumed loss of numerical superiority. these phenomena appear to be the keys to reregulation of bffgt. lactobacillus appears to be the major regulator of both g. vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria. when additional organisms are added to the bacterial flora, they may add to or partially negate the inhibitory influence of lactobacillus on the bffgt. inhibitor interrelationships appear to exist between coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus and the group b streptococci (gbs) and other beta hemolytic streptococci. facilitating interrelationships appear to exist between s. aureus and the gbs and selected enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == objective: the goals of this study were 1) to better define the labial microflora and 2) to evaluate whether extended non-menstrual use of panty liners would increase genital carriage of undesirable bacteria and predispose to infection. methods: healthy female volunteers (224) were prospectively randomized into panty liner wear groups a (always((r)) deodorant) and b (always((r)) non-deodorant) and into a control group c (no panty liner wear) with instructions for non-menstrual  +/- menstrual use >/=5 h daily for 6 months. selected aerobic bacteria were semiquantitatively cultured from the inner labial groove, the posterior fornix of the vagina, and the cervix pre-study and post-study. used panty liners were quantitatively cultured, and vaginal secretions were examined by gas chromatography for fatty acid ratios as a measure of microbial flora shifts. results: at the pre-study, labial microflora in this study population contained significantly higher frequencies of staphylococcus, coliforms, other gram-negative rods, and enterococci, and a decreased frequency of gardnerella vaginalis relative to the vaginal microflora. after 6 months use of panty liners  the frequencies (and densities) of the selected microorganisms in these two sites had not changed compared to controls, and fatty acid analyses of vaginal secretions gave no evidence of shifts in the microbial flora. conclusions: frequencies of selected genital microflora were different for the labia compared  to the vagina. no increased carriage of medically important species was detected  for either site after 6 months of daily (average 7.8 h) panty liner use.

TI  == treatment of gardnerella vaginalis infection.
AB  == this review of the antibiotic sensitivity pattern of gardnerella vaginalis culture isolates shows that the drugs found sensitive to g. vaginalis cultures include the new antimicrobial agents- ciprofloxacin, cefuroxine and ceftazidine,  and some older antibiotics- ceftriaxone, cloxacillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol and metranidazole. streptomycin and augmentin showed intermediate sensitivity while penicillin, ampicillin, tetracycline and gentamycin exhibited resistance to g. vaginalis isolates. metronidazole is currently the first-line drug of choice for the treatment of g. vaginalis and its related infections because of its effectiveness not just against g. vaginalis but also against anaerobes. it can be administered orally, parenterally and intravaginally as gel  or sponge. the advantages and drawbacks to the use of these g. vaginalis - sensitive drugs, and the place of alternative drugs in the management of g. vaginalis - associated infections are discussed.

AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is presently being cited as a probable cause of premature labour, where it is thought that an abnormal excess of phospholipase a2 enzyme (pla2 ), generated by infecting organisms, prematurely liberates prostaglandins, which trigger-off the labour process. pla levels of pregnant and  non-pregnant women, with and without bv infection were compared. the in vitro concentrations of pla2 in broth cultures of infecting organisms were also measured. mean pla2 level in non-infected pregnant women was 777 units per mg but was raised to 1226 u/mg in those with bv ( p= <0.001). mean level in non-infected normal women was 21 u/mg, but was raised to 97 u/mg in those having bv ( p= <0.001). pla2 concentrations in broth cultures of the causative organisms showed  that most bacteroides strains produced the enzyme, having a mean concentration of 95 u/mg, but that it was generated by only 34% of gardnerella vaginalis strains,  their mean concentration being 32 u/mg.

AB  == the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis and other lower genital tract infections were determined in women from a developing community. patients were recruited from four out-patient clinics of a large urban tertiary referral hospital serving the indigent black population of kwazulu/natal, south africa. a total of 208 women attending the sexually transmitted diseases (std) (n = 51), colposcopy (n =50), family planning (n = 52) and antenatal (n = 55) clinics were investigated.  endocervical and vaginal specimens were collected for microbiological investigation of recognised sexually transmitted pathogens. estimation of vaginal ph, amine test and wet smear microscopy were performed at the bedside. peripheral venous blood was obtained for serological tests for syphilis, hepatitis b surface antigen and antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv). vaginal infections were detected in a total of 50% (104) of women, endocervical infections alone in 9% (18) and concurrent vagino-endocervical infections in 20%  (41). bacterial vaginosis (bv) was diagnosed in 35% (73) and its prevalence amongst different clinic populations ranged from 25% to 41% with no significant differences between any groups. trichomoniasis was detected significantly more often in women attending the std and antenatal clinics. endocervical infections were found mainly in women attending the std clinic, though the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis amongst the other clinic attenders ranged from 13% to 20%.  micro-organisms such as gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, anaerobes and  curved gram-negative rods were found in significantly higher number of women with bv. this study confirms the high prevalence of vaginal, endocervical and mixed vagino-endocervical infections in women from developing communities. the high prevalence of bacterial vaginosis as a single infection and its association with  other recognised sexually transmitted pathogens in a large proportion of women, is of significance since such infections not only predispose to ascending upper genital tract infections but are also associated with complications in pregnancy  such as premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour and endometritis.

AB  == vaginal swabs for microbiological culture were taken from 174 pregnant women whose vaginal flora had been evaluated by gram's stain; 50 had grade iii flora (bacterial vaginosis, bv), 50 grade ii (intermediate), 41 had vaginal flora graded as abnormal which then reverted to grade i (revertants) and 33 had normal  flora (controls). the aim was to determine whether bacterial species isolated from women with grade ii flora differed from those with grade iii flora. isolation of lactobacillus spp. decreased from grade i to grade iii and that of other aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species increased. there was little difference in the species isolated from women with grade ii and grade iii flora,  but there was a distinct order in which organisms in different species increased  in numbers. the vaginal flora of revertants was intermediate between that of healthy controls and those with grade ii flora. coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. were isolated from a greater number of revertants than grade i controls but  the incidence did not increase in grade ii or grade iii. bifidobacterium spp. were isolated from a greater number of revertants than grade i controls and increased further in grade ii and grade iii. however, gardnerella vaginalis and mycoplasma hominis were isolated from a much larger number of women with grade iii flora than the other groups. the conclusion is that grade ii is a transitional phase between grade i and grade iii and that some organisms such as  g. vaginalis and m. hominis only reach large numbers in the late stage. the sequence of appearance of the various bacterial species may be a result of the pathophysiological alteration of the vaginal ecosystem associated with bv.

AB  == the history of bacterial vaginosis (bv), now extending over more than 40 years, has been remarkable not only in terms of repeatedly changing the name of the bacterium that we now know as gardnerella vaginalis but also in relation to what  is thought to constitute the condition, what it should be called and how the diagnosis can best be made. the composite clinical criteria are often confusing for the nonspecialist, provide room for inter-observer error, and misinterpretation of just one criterion can lead to considerable over or under diagnosis. there is no doubt that diagnosis should be through a gram-stained vaginal smear, allowing detection not only of 'full blown' bv but also patterns of vaginal flora that while not in this category are nevertheless abnormal. accurate diagnosis is important in view of the ever-growing list of other important conditions that may occur as a consequence of the abnormal flora. in addition to this, we raise the question of whether the name and abbreviation bv is the best either scientifically or from the point of view of the lay public. while recognizing that it now may be too ingrained for further change, is it possible to have a better term, at least for lay use?

TI  == polyphasic approach to the classification and identification of gardnerella vaginalis and unidentified gardnerella vaginalis-like coryneforms present in bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == a taxonomic study of gardnerella vaginalis and g. vaginalis-like coryneforms was  performed in order to clarify the phylogenetic affiliation of these organisms and to improve future identification. we examined 50 strains by performing whole-cell protein and fatty acid analyses, a 16s rrna sequence analysis, and an extensive phenotypic characterization analysis. the results of both chemotaxonomic techniques which we used divided the organisms into two main clusters, and the 16s rrna sequence analysis revealed that the clusters represent different genera, which were easily distinguished by the results of classical phenotypic tests. the cluster i strains were identified as g. vaginalis, which was shown to be a close  relative of the genus bifidobacterium. an improved description of g. vaginalis is presented. the cluster ii strains belong to or are closely related to actinomyces turicensis.

TI  == bacteremia shortly after placental separation during cesarean delivery.
AB  == objective: to assess frequency, risk factors, and microbiology of bacteremia within 15 minutes of placental separation during cesarean delivery. methods: ninety-three women undergoing cesarean delivery after a minimum of 4 hours of labor or ruptured membranes were compared with 26 women not in labor undergoing cesarean. blood cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained within  15 minutes of delivery of the placenta and before prophylactic antibiotic administration. chorioamnionic membranes were also cultured. demographic, labor,  delivery, and postpartum characteristics were abstracted from the medical record. results: bacteremia was detected in 13 (11%) of 119 women. bacteremia occurred in 13 (14%) of 93 women after labor or rupture of membranes compared with zero of 26 women not in labor (p = .02). isolates included group b streptococcus (n = 5), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 5), streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1), peptostreptococcus sp (n = 1), and mixed flora of prevotella bivia, g vaginalis,  and viridans streptococci (n = 1). bacteremia was associated with earlier median  gestational age, lower median birth weight, and a positive chorioamnionic membrane culture. after adjustment for gestational age, intrauterine monitoring was also significantly associated with bacteremia. conclusion: bacteremia was common after labor in this population, especially in preterm deliveries and those with positive chorioamnionic-placental culture. many of the isolates are capable  of causing endocarditis. appraisal of the risk of bacteremia and the risk of bacterial endocarditis should be made in individual patients to assess the need for antibiotic prophylaxis.

TI  == composition of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex isolated from vaginal flora.
AB  == one hundred and fifty human vaginal samples containing a diversity of pathogens or nonpathogens (gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus sp., staphylococcus sp., candida albicans. mycoplasma sp.) were examined for their content in lactobacilli of the lactobacillus acidophilus complex. although all samples contained lactobacilli, strains of the l. acidophilus complex were present in only twenty-nine cases. isolates were further characterized and compared with type strains or reference strains in an attempt to differentiate by phenotypic means the genospecies of the l. acidophilus complex. data regarding specific activities of beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) and of phospho-beta-galactosidase (p-beta-gal) provided no specific information at the species level within the l. acidophilus complex. dna-relatedness differentiates this genospecies. most lactobacilli isolated from the vaginal flora of symptomatic women were genotypically close to  l. gasseri cip 102991t by the technique of dna/dna hybridization.

AB  == objective: to evaluate a new rapid diagnostic test for bacterial vaginosis. design: comparison of a new biochemical diamine test with low technology tests and microbiological culture. setting: general practice, family planning clinic. main outcome measures: comparison of the new diamine test with microbiological culture for gardnerella vaginalis, with clue cells, and with the amine test. results: two hundred and twenty-nine vaginal swabs were assayed quantitatively by the new diamine test. when compared with microbiological culture of gardnerella vaginalis, the sensitivities and specificities were 86% and 81%, respectively. when compared with clue cell findings, the sensitivities and specificities were 97% and 83%, respectively. in the third comparison with the amine test the sensitivity was 94% and the specificity was 84%. since microbiological diagnosis  of organisms related to bacterial vaginosis is difficult, the new test and existing sideroom tests may be more sensitive to the condition and the true frequency of false positives may be less than the specificity in this study suggests. conclusions: the new diamine test is accurate, sensitive and specific,  and provides the basis for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. such a test is needed if bacterial vaginosis is to be diagnosed and managed effectively  in both general and specialist practice.

AB  == metronidazole resistance was produced in susceptible gardnerella vaginalis after  subculture in the presence of metronidazole. metronidazole-resistant gardnerellae were less susceptible to growth inhibition by lactobacillus culture filtrates. a  low ph (+/- 4) and lactic acid accounted for 60 to 95% of inhibitory activity, and h2o2 accounted for only 0 to 30%. however, in the presence of myeloperoxidase, h2o2-producing lactobacilli decreased the viability of metronidazole-susceptible gardnerellae 2,000-fold.

TI  == streptococcus agalactiae: a vaginal pathogen?
AB  == the significance of streptococcus agalactiae as an aetiological agent in vaginitis was evaluated. a total of 6226 samples from women who presented with vaginal symptoms was examined. the presence of >10 leucocytes/high-power field (h.p.f.) was taken to be the criterion of active infection. s. agalactiae was isolated from 10.1% of these samples. the isolation rates of other common pathogens such as candida spp., gardnerella vaginalis and trichomonas spp. were 54.1%, 27.2% and 4.2%, respectively, in the same group of patients. in contrast,  the isolation rates of these micro-organisms in the group of patients who had no  infection (<10 leucocytes/h.p.f.) were 4.2%, 38.3%, 33% and 0.5%, respectively. in the majority of samples from which s. agalactiae was isolated, it was the sole pathogen isolated (83%) and its presence was associated with an inflammatory response in 80% of patients. furthermore, the relative risk of vaginal infection  with s. agalactiae (2.38) in patients with purulent vaginal discharge was greater than that of candida spp. infection (1.41) and lower than that of trichomonas spp. infection (8.32). these data suggest that s. agalactiae in symptomatic women with microscopic evidence of inflammation should be considered a causative agent  of vaginitis.

TI  == office laboratory diagnosis of vaginitis. clinician-performed tests compared with a rapid nucleic acid hybridization test.
AB  == background: the traditional diagnosis of vaginitis incorporates patient symptoms, clinical findings observed during vaginal examination, and laboratory analysis of vaginal fluid. the purpose of this study was to evaluate routine clinician-performed office laboratory diagnostic techniques for women with abnormal vaginal symptoms, and to compare these results with those obtained by a  dna hybridization test for trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, and candida species. methods: the study included 501 symptomatic women who were between the ages of 14 and 67 years. three vaginal specimens were obtained for saline wet mount, potassium hydroxide (koh) prep, amine "sniff", ph, and nucleic  acid hybridization (t vaginalis, g vaginalis, and candida sp) tests. clinicians and medical technicians independently evaluated the wet mount, koh prep, amine, and ph tests. a medical technician processed the dna tests according to manufacturer's protocol. results: of 499 subjects for whom complete data were available, vulvovaginal candidiasis was diagnosed in 20.0%, vaginal trichomoniasis in 7.4%, and bacterial vaginosis in 52.1%. fourteen percent of subjects had multiple vaginal infections. the sensitivity and specificity of clinician microscopically diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis were 39.6% and 90.4%, 75.0% and 96.6%, and 76.5% and 70.8%, respectively. the sensitivity and specificity of the dna probe diagnosis of the same types of vaginitis were 75.0% and 95.7%, 86.5% and 98.5%, and 95.4% and 60.7%, respectively. when only women with multiple vaginal infections were considered, the percentages of correct clinician diagnoses for vulvovaginal candidiasis, vaginal trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis were 49.3%, 83.6%, and 59.7%, respectively. for the dna probe test, the percentages of correct diagnoses were 72.9%, 92.9%, and 90.0%, respectively. conclusions: primary care clinicians demonstrated a high specificity but low sensitivity when  identifying vaginal trichomoniasis and vulvovaginal candidiasis by microscopic techniques. correct microscopic diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis was even more difficult for clinicians, as was the diagnosis of multiple vaginal infections. clinicians were not as accurate as the dna probe test in diagnosing vaginal infections. clinicians need more education in the laboratory diagnosis of vaginitis. clinicians should carefully scrutinize each microscopic slide, systematically examine the slide for each type of vaginitis, and consider specimen ph and the presence of leukocytes, lactobacillus organisms, or amine odor as additional clues to infection.

AB  == the epidemiologic differences between cytology-detected candidial and trichomonal infections were assessed in 15,933 women attending the 12 district health centres in the taipei area and a consecutive 1114 patients, visiting venereal disease clinics, whose smears were screened for cervical cancer between july 1991 and december 1992 in taipei. the pap smears were examined for the presence of specific organisms, such as trichomonas vaginalis, vaginal candida, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, actinomyces, leptothrix, aspergillu, gardnerella and others. more emphasis was placed on the candidial and trichomonal infection in inflammatory pap smears. the overall prevalence of candidial and trichomonal infections was 3.40% and 1.88%, respectively. there were striking differences in the prevalence of trichomoniasis ranging from 1.74% in the district health centre population to 3.77% in the venereal disease clinic patients; however, the prevalence of candidial infection remained the same (3.40%) in these two distinct population groups. indices of socioeconomic status--education and personal hygiene--showed an inverse association with the prevalence of trichomoniasis but a positive correlation with candidiasis. among participants, younger age (< 20 years old) was independently associated with candidial (or = 1.95) and trichomonal (or = 3.87) infections. no sexual behavioural factors were associated with candidial infection in this study; however, having multiple sexual partners (or = 5.07) was associated with a significantly elevated risk of trichomoniasis, while using condoms was associated with a diminished risk (or = 0.38). the presence of candidiasis and trichomoniasis was highly associated with abnormal cytologic findings, particularly those indicative of inflammation. there was little evidence that findings suggestive of cervical cancer could be attributed to either candidial or trichomonal infections. these data suggest that trichomoniasis is consistent with venereal transmission of the disease, but transmission by contaminated objects cannot be ruled out because there is an increased relation between trichomoniasis infection and socioeconomic conditions and personal hygiene. elucidation of such  differences may be helpful in designing different strategies to control these infections. furthermore, the findings can provide a good baseline of prevalence for investigating the relationship between these two pathogens and cervical dysplasia.

AB  == the relationship of genital flora assessed at the end of the second trimester of  pregnancy and intraamniotic infection diagnosed by clinical signs and symptoms during labor was evaluated. women were enrolled at 23-26 weeks of gestation and followed through delivery in the multi-center vaginal infections and prematurity  study (1984-1989). among the cohort of 11,989 followed through delivery, 286 (2.4%) developed intraamniotic infection. the recovery of gardnerella vaginalis (relative risk [rr] = 1.8; 95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.4-2.4), heavy growth  of bacteroides species (rr = 1.5; 95% ci = 1.1-2.1), and isolation of mycoplasma  hominis (rr = 1.7; 95% ci = 1.3-2.1) from the vagina at the end of the second trimester of pregnancy were associated with an increased risk of intraamniotic infection. bacterial vaginosis was also associated with intraamniotic infection (rr = 1.5; 95% ci = 1.1-2.2). these findings extend prior studies by showing that prenatal cultures for microorganisms associated with bacterial vaginosis predicted an increased risk of intraamniotic infection.

TI  == sterility of the uterine cavity.
AB  == in a prospective open study the sterility of the uterine cavity was evaluated in  99 women admitted for hysterectomy. the indications for hysterectomy were in most cases persistent irregular vaginal bleeding and fibromyomas of the uterus. samples for both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, chlamydia trachomatis, yeasts and viruses were taken preoperatively from the apex of the vagina and cervical os. immediately after hysterectomy the uterus was opened under sterile conditions and samples obtained from the isthmus and fundus of the uterine cavity for microbiological examination. wet smears were taken from the same sites. nearly a  quarter of all the patients harbored one or more microorganisms in the uterus, mostly gardnerella vaginalis, enterobacter and streptococcus agalactiae. we found that in a significant number of cases, the uterine cavity is colonized with potentially pathogenic organisms which may play a causative role in endometritis. the results indicate that inflammation of the uterine cavity should be evaluated  by hysteroscopic examination before hysterectomy is undertaken in patients with persistent irregular vaginal bleeding.

TI  == genital ulcer disease in women infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and microbiologic characteristics of genital ulcer disease in a population of human immunodeficiency virus-infected women. study design: a retrospective cohort study was performed in university-affiliated, hospital-based women's human immunodeficiency virus clinics. a total of 307 women with human immunodeficiency  virus infection were followed up during 20 months. there were no interventions. age, race, cd4+ cell counts, bacteriologic and virologic analyses in cases of ulcers, serologic testing for syphilis, and histopathologic examination in selected cases (n = 6). results: among 307 women followed up over a 20-month period, 43 ulcers were detected with a prevalence of 14%. among the ulcer cases the average absolute cd4+ lymphocyte number was 210/mm3. diagnostic evaluation yielded no proven etiologic agent in 26 (60%) of the cases. twelve of the 43 cases (28%) were positive for herpes simplex-2. five cases (12%) yielded unusual  or mixed bacteriologic types. no cases were attributable to primary syphilis infection. one case each of an ulcer infected with cytomegalovirus, chlamydia trachomatis, and gardnerella vaginalis, as well as three unusual presentations of herpetic ulcers, is analyzed in detail. conclusion: these cases exemplify the often dramatic presentation of human immunodeficiency virus-related genital ulcers and the clinical complexity of both diagnosis and management. the frequent lack of an infectious or neoplastic cause in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women with genital ulcer disease suggests that human immunodeficiency virus may play a local role in causation or exacerbation. biopsies of atypical genital ulcers should be considered to aid diagnosis. further studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of genital ulcer disease in human immunodeficiency virus-infected women.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to analyze the ability of septicemic and nonsepticemic isolates of group b streptococci (gbs) to inhibit in vitro the principal bacterial groups found in the normal bacterial flora of the female genital tract. methods: the target groups were composed of 1) 10 strains each of  the following: viridans streptococci, nonhemolytic streptococci (not group b or d), group a streptococci, gbs, peptostreptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, staphylococcus aureus, and gardnerella vaginalis; 2) 9 strains of  enterococci; 3) 9 strains of group c or g streptococci; 4) 7 strains of lactobacilli; and 5) 7 strains of diphtheroids. all target groups were tested for inhibition by a test panel of either a group of 10 or 41 gbs isolates. if the gbs isolates failed to inhibit a target group, that group was tested for its ability  to inhibit the gbs test panel. results: the gbs test panel did not inhibit the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci or s. aureus but uniformly inhibited groups a, b, c, and g streptococci, lactobacilli, and g. vaginalis. one of the 7  strains of diphtheroids was inhibited by 37 of the 41 gbs isolates; the other 6 strains of diphtheroids were uniformly inhibited. variable inhibition by gbs was  observed with viridans streptococci, nonhemolytic (not group b or d) streptococci, peptostreptococci, and enterococci; however, inhibition or noninhibition was uniform for a given target strain against the entire gbs test panel. the 23 gbs isolates obtained from septicemic neonates or adults did not differ from the 18 nonsepticemic isolates in their ability to inhibit other species of streptococci or other gram-positive or gram-variable constituents of the bacterial flora of the female genital tract. when converse testing was done,  all 10 gbs isolates were uniformly inhibited by coagulase-negative staphylococci  and by the majority of enterococci, but were not inhibited by s. aureus. conclusions: these studies suggest that gbs may be significant regulators of other beta-hemolytic streptococci, diphtheroids, lactobacilli, and g. vaginalis within the bacterial flora of the female genital tract. moreover, the absence of  gbs in the vaginal flora may be the result of mediation by coagulase-negative staphylococci and selected strains of enterococci.

AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the st. louis hospital in paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. methods: one hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. all underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. results: candida albicans (ca) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. a pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, streptococcus milleri, group hb5) was found without ca in  28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group d streptococci)  was found without ca in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. discussion: this series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with  and without balanitis (p < 0.9). the role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? the significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. the clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of  any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis: drugs versus alternative treatment.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is one of the most common infectious disorders affecting women. it is caused by several microorganisms, including gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, beta-streptococci and mobiluncus/falcivibrio sp. bacterial vaginosis is thought to occur as a result of a change in vaginal ph mediated by the metabolic activity of anaerobic bacteria. this rise in vaginal ph interferes with the activity of vaginal lactobacilli which maintain vaginal acidity. several types of antibiotics have been used to treat this condition. although metronidazole was found to be the most effective, none was completely successful  in either cure or prevention. several attempts have recently been made to treat bacterial vaginosis using physiological or 'natural' substances, such as lactate  gel and commercial yoghurt, which is acidic and also contains lactobacillus strains. this kind of treatment looks promising and may have a place in certain clinical conditions, including pregnancy, in cases of recurrent inflammation, or  as a prophylactic treatment before invasive gynecological procedures or abdominal surgery in patients known to be affected. this issue should be additionally studied and evaluated in light of the relatively little experience with this modality of treatment for bacterial vaginosis.

AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the main cause of vaginitis. the condition is characterised by an abundant and odorous vaginal loss, but more than half the patients with demonstrable signs of bv do not report symptoms at all. gardnerella vaginalis (gv) is often associated with bv, but it is not the sole factor responsible, as is shown by the fact that it can be isolated in the vagina of women withbv. in 1992 and 1993, 2630 patients, 1460 of them gynaecological and 1170 obstetric, were admitted to the obstetrics and gynaecology clinic of parma university. amsel criteria were adopted for diagnosing bv. cases of bv were treated with 5 mg/die 2% clindamycin vaginal cream for 7 days. in the event of recurrences, 250 mg tablets of metronidazol were added: 8 tablets in 4 administrations in a single day, treatment also being extended to the partner. patients admitted in 1993 received a protocol of hygienic and behavioural standards, stress being laid on prophylaxisa measures even after the end of therapy. bv proved to be present in 12.3% of cases, of whom only half were symptomatic. the situation was practically stationary if the 2 years are considered separately. recurrences of symptomatic bacterial vaginosis were 15% in the absence of protocol application and 8.3% after the protocol. recurrences were less frequent in the asymptomatic forms. compared to the total number od cases of bv, recurrences were significantly low (12.1% p < 0.001).

AB  == in this study the lea's shield was evaluated for its tolerance by women who wore  the device for three consecutive days. ten women who wore the lea's shield for 72 hours completed the tolerance study without adverse effects. examination of the cervix and vagina revealed that the device did not provoke any significant cellular or microbial changes among the wearers. no major changes in the appearance or prevalence of vaginal flora occurred in the women after three days  of wearing the device. a gradient in the ph could be detected between the contents of the vagina, which was more acidic than the contents of the bowl of the device. the range of cervical shapes and vaginal morphology among the study participants has had no influence upon the ability of the device to remain in its proper position. the device "settles in place" as it is pushed in, thereby obviating any special maneuvers for proper positioning. no vaginal nor cervical trauma occurred. we have concluded from these basic clinical evaluations that lea's shield is well tolerated during three days of use. efficacy trials in women at risk recently completed have confirmed the high degree of acceptability and that the device can function adequately as one size fits all.

AB  == g. vaginalis is an important pathogen in the aetiology of bacterial vaginosis. therefore, we investigated the influence of transport systems in isolation, a scoring system for gram stains, and susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. the comparison between a simple (transwab) and a sophisticated (port-a-cul) system showed no differences with regard to for instance enterococcus faecalis or escherichia coli; however, isolation of g. vaginalis, a fastidious microorganism, was significantly higher (alpha < 0.0001) in port-a-cul. there was a strong correlation (97.5%) using the scoring system indicating bacterial vaginosis and isolation of g. vaginalis. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of metronidazole for 60 strains of g. vaginalis were higher than 32 mg/l, some strains showing heteroresistance. this phenomenon may be an explanation for treatment failures. clindamycin and erythromycin were much more active, with mic's between 0.016 and 0.19 mg/l, in-vitro development of resistance being slower for clindamycin than for erythromycin. conclusions: (i) for isolation of g. vaginalis, a sophisticated transport system is mandatory; (ii) a scoring system for gram staining is helpful in diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis; (iii) in patients with metronidazole treatment failures, clindamycin should be used.

AB  == background: this study was done to evaluate pregnant patients with cervical incompetence using an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (eptfe) patch versus the commonly used braided polyester tape, comparing the rate of local tissue reaction or onset of contractions, or both. study design: this study was a prospective clinical trial on 20 patients divided into two groups. patients having tissue reactions or contractions were identified and each material was analyzed using a  new approach by means of scanning electron microscopy (sem) and roentgenogram diffraction studies. results: in the group of pregnant patients sutured with polyester tape there were four failures because of infection and contractions. there were no direct or indirect complications encountered in the eptfe group. bacteriologic evaluations of the failures revealed escherichia coli, gardnerella  vaginalis, bacteroides species, and trichomonas vaginalis in various combinations, in addition to crystal structure degradation and layers of phagocytes. conclusions: our results provide a rationale for understanding the differences in morphologic integrity and the superiority of the eptfe patch over  the polyester tape using a new analytic approach of sem and roentgenographic diffraction studies. because of the small number of patients and because the procedure was performed in a select patient population, we recommend that further trials be undertaken with a larger number of patients in more advanced gestational age and in patients presenting with emergent cervical incompetence.

AB  == background and objectives: a decreased concentration or total disappearance of lactobacillus acidophilus in the vagina constitutes a frequent observation in bacterial vaginosis. goal of the study: cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate has been evaluated in vitro to detect antiadhesive properties at subinhibitory concentrations for gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus curtisii to vaginal epithelial cells (vec). study design: bacterial strains 14c- and or 3h-labeled were tested for adherence and competition to binding sites in vecs before and after treatment at sub-mic with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. results: in control tests of adherence, g. vaginalis and m. curtisii had their maximal adhesion at ph 5.4, l. acidophilus at ph 4.4. preincubation of g. vaginalis and m. curtisii with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate 2.5 mg/ml (subinhibitory concentration) at ph 5.4 reduced adherence to vecs respectively by 48.3% and 34.1%. the same treatment of l. acidophilus showed no statistically significant difference. treatment of vecs alone did not modify adherence. competition tests between l. acidophilus and g. vaginalis and between l. acidophilus and m. curtisii showed that, in small quantities, l. acidophilus could compete with g. vaginalis and m. curtisii for binding sites in vecs at ph 4.4, when pretreated with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate. at a higher ph (4.8 and 5.4), l. acidophilus in higher quantities did not compete for binding sites occupied by g. vaginalis and m. curtisii. conclusions: cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at subinhibitory concentrations modifies the adhesiveness of g. vaginalis and m. curtisii to vecs, reducing it by 48.3% and 34.1%, respectively. adhesion of l. acidophilus to vecs is not impaired by pretreatment with cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate at ph 4.4, even if they are in low number and compete for binding sites against pathogens. at higher ph levels, l. acidophilus did not compete for  binding sites occupied by g. vaginalis and m. curtisii.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis in a district genitourinary medicine department: significance of vaginal microbiology and anaerobes.
AB  == the aim of this study was to correlate the significance of vaginal microbiology,  in particular its anaerobic component, to the presence of bacterial vaginosis (bv), and to review the clinical criteria used in the diagnosis of this condition. ninety-two female patients who received routine std screening were studied. after routine history, presence and character of vaginal discharge and vaginal ph were noted, an amine test performed, and a wet stain observed microscopically. routine gram stain smears and cultures were prepared. bv was diagnosed clinically in 28 (30%) of our sample, and gardnerella vaginalis was cultured in 41 patients (45%). both clue cells and anaerobes were closely associated with each other and both mutually exclusive with the presence of lactobacilli on gram stain (p < 0.001). bv was found to be strongly associated with the presence of clue cells on the wet film, anaerobes and g. vaginalis. in conclusion, bacterial vaginosis is not only strongly associated with the presence of g. vaginalis in the vaginal flora, but more strongly with the presence of anaerobes. the study suggests that the microaerophile g. vaginalis is a commensal organism in a significant proportion of sexually active women. if the aerobic status of the healthy vagina is disrupted, anaerobes (including gardnerella) will flourish, producing the clinical picture of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == changes in vaginal flora during pregnancy and association with preterm birth.
AB  == a prospective study of the vaginal flora changes between midtrimester and labor was undertaken in 560 women; 337 had intact membranes and were in labor when swabs were taken. of these, 45 delivered preterm. gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum (both associated with preterm birth when present in midtrimester), and mycoplasma hominis commonly persisted between midtrimester and labor, particularly in the preterm cohort (24 [65%] of 37 midtrimester isolates), and these organisms were seldom acquired late in pregnancy. a second group, bacteroides species, had both a high persistence (9 [60%] of 15 midtrimester isolates) and high late acquisition rate (10 [53%] of 19 labor isolates) in the preterm cohort. these findings provide a rationale for treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy. a third group, comprising enteropharyngeal bacteria and peptostreptococcus species, were almost all acquired late in the preterm cohort (14 [88%] of 16 labor isolates), and persistence from midtrimester was rare.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and efficacy of short-course oral metronidazole  treatment: a randomized controlled trial.
AB  == objective: to characterize the natural history of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy and to assess the efficacy of short courses of oral metronidazole therapy for long-term suppression of bacterial vaginosis flora. methods: this was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of two 2-day courses of metronidazole (400 mg twice daily) in pregnant women with bacterial vaginosis (by gram stain) and/or heavy growth of gardnerella vaginalis. the first course was given at 24 weeks' gestation and a second course at 29 weeks if the follow-up vaginal swab grew g vaginalis. follow-up swabs were performed at 28, 32, and 36 weeks' gestation. results: on the basis of their g vaginalis colonization, 196 women were enrolled, and 137 were evaluable for efficacy, including 66 with bacterial vaginosis. the microbial ecology of bacterial vaginosis in 36 women in  the placebo group was relatively stable, with 72% persistence at 28 weeks and 57% at 32 weeks' gestation. metronidazole effectively suppressed bacterial vaginosis  for 4 weeks after the first course in 76%, compared with 28% in the placebo group, and had a cumulative efficacy of 87% compared to 44% 4 weeks after the second course (odds ratio 0.12, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.5). conclusions: the microbial ecology of bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women is relatively stable. long-term suppression of bacterial vaginosis flora for 2-3 months can be  achieved by short courses of metronidazole therapy in 87% of women in mid-pregnancy. because bacterial vaginosis has been associated with an increased  risk of preterm labor, these findings provide the foundation for an intervention  study of women with bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy.

TI  == study on treatment of bacterial vaginosis with oral administration of metronidazole or cefdinir.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is considered to be one of the most common vaginal infections in women. fifteen symptomatic women with bv were enrolled in this study. ten patients with the diagnosis of bv were treated with 10 days oral administration of metronidazole (mtn), 500 mg twice a day, and five patients with cefdinir (cfdn), 300 mg three times a day. in the mtn therapy, the rate of abnormal vaginal discharge subjectively decreased from 100 to 60%, the rate of abnormal vaginal discharges objectively decreased from 100 to 20%, the rate of positive amine tests decreased from 100 to 20%, the rate of genital malodor and abnormal ph of vaginal discharges decreased substantially from 100 to 10%, and the rate of the presence of clue cells also decreased notably from 90 to 10%. however, in the cfdn therapy, none of these factors improved. with respect to susceptibility to cfdn and mtn, cfdn demonstrated good antibacterial activity against almost all bacteria isolated except gardnerella vaginalis. on the other hand, mtn demonstrated excellent activity against anaerobic bacteria except peptostreptococcus spp., and had no antibacterial activity against aerobic bacteria. since the therapeutic effect of mtn in bv appeared to be better than that of cfdn, anaerobes may play a major role in causing clinical symptoms in patients with bv.

TI  == genital flora in pregnancy and its association with intrauterine growth retardation.
AB  == a study of risk factors for intrauterine growth retardation (iugr) was conducted  among a cohort of 13,914 pregnant women enrolled in the multicenter vaginal infections and prematurity study. from 23 through 26 weeks of gestational age, cultures of specimens from the vagina and cervix were done for group b streptococci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida albicans, gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and anaerobic gram-negative rods belonging to the genera  bacteroides, porphyromonas, and prevotella. newborns who were small for their gestational age were delivered by 1,251 women, and infants of the appropriate weight for their gestational age were delivered by 10,332 women. when controlling for ethnicity and smoking and excluding women treated with antibiotics, the mantel-haenszel adjusted relative risk of iugr was 1.16 for bacteroides, prevotella, and porphyromonas spp. (95% confidence interval [95% ci], 1.01 to 1.33), 1.16 for m. hominis (95% ci, 1.04 to 1.29), 1.20 for u. urealyticum (95% ci, 1.05 to 1.38), and 1.22 for t. vaginalis (95% ci, 1.05 to 1.42). there was also a strong and significant trend for an increasing risk of iugr with the number of these four microbes recovered. among women colonized with all four isolates, the adjusted odds ratio of iugr was 1.79 (95% ci, 1.27 to 2.52) in comparison with women not colonized with any of these microorganisms. group b streptococci, n. gonorrhoeae, c. trachomatis, and c. albicans were not significantly associated with iugr. these results suggest that infection is associated with some cases of iugr and that specific microorganisms, alone or in  combination, are involved. since genital isolates are highly correlated with each other, the relative contribution of each microbe is difficult to determine.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis is associated with prematurity and vaginal fluid mucinase and sialidase: results of a controlled trial of topical clindamycin cream.
AB  == objective: the pathogenesis of preterm birth and other adverse pregnancy outcomes linked with reproductive tract infection remains poorly understood. mucolytic enzymes, including mucinases and sialidases (neuraminidase), are recognized virulence factors among enteropathogens and bacteria that cause periodontal infection. perturbation of maternal cervicovaginal mucosa membrane host defenses  by such enzyme-producing microorganisms may increase the risk of subclinical intrauterine infection during pregnancy and thus increase risks of preterm birth. study design: we prospectively evaluated vaginal fluid mucinase and sialidase and selected cervicovaginal bacteria along with pregnancy outcomes in 271 women. within this study, women with bacterial vaginosis (16 to 27 week' gestation) were treated with 2% clinadmycin vaginal cream or placebo. enzyme, microbial findings, treatment effects, and pregnancy outcomes were compared among drug- and placebo-treated women and control women without bacterial vaginosis. results: presence of bacterial vaginosis at intake was associated with increased risk of preterm birth (relative risk 3.3, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 9.1, p = 0.02),  premature rupture of membranes (relative risk 3.8, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 9.0, p = 0.002), and preterm premature rupture of membranes. mucinase and sialidase activities were more commonly identified, and they occurred in higher concentrations, if present, in women with bacterial vaginosis (mucinase: 44.3% with bacterial vaginosis vs 27.4% without, p = 0.007; sialidase: 45% with bacterial vaginosis vs 12% without p < 0.001). sialidase activity was associated  with bacterial vaginosis-linked organisms (gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus spp, and mycoplasma hominis) and chlamydia trachomatis and yeast species; mucinase activity was associated only with bacterial vaginosis-linked microorganisms. clindamycin, 2% cream, was effective treatment for bacterial vaginosis and temporarily reduced mucinase and sialidase activities. topical treatment of bacterial vaginosis did not reduce risks of perinatal morbidity. women with persistent or recurrent sialidase 8 weeks after treatment were at increased risk  of preterm birth (15.6% vs 7.4%) premature rupture of membranes (30% vs 15%), and low birth weight (20% vs 3%, relative risk 6.8, 95% confidence interval 1.6 to 28.1). conclusions: persistence of sialidase-producing vaginal microorganisms in  numbers sufficient to increase vaginal fluid sialidase activity may be a risk factor for possibly preventable subclinical intrauterine infection and preterm birth. this study confirms and further informs our understanding of the association of bacterial vaginosis and preterm birth; studies to evaluate whether systemic treatment for bacterial vaginosis can effectively reduce vaginal mucolytic enzymes and risks of prematurity and other morbid outcomes are continuing.

AB  == the vast majority of infections involving female pelvic structures arise from organisms that are members of the normal flora. in addition, exogenous organisms  that invade through the lower genital tract must interact with organisms that are part of the host's flora. in contrast to the concept that the normal flora is entirely innocuous, recent research has begun to identify what appear to be virulence attributes among these ordinarily low-virulence organisms. most of our  understanding of virulence has been derived from highly virulent organisms, of which neisseria gonorrhoeae provides an example of relevance to the female genital tract. a review of the virulence factors of the gonococcus is presented to serve as an example of the variety of virulence properties associated with pathogenic bacteria. molecular biology has begun to clarify one of the important  paradigms of pathogenic bacteriology-that bacteria change their expression of virulence properties in response to their location within a host or to the stage  of infection. thus, infection involves not only the possession of virulence factors, but also the carefully controlled use of those factors. virulence is often controlled by the coordinate expression of many virulence-associated genes  in response to one environmental signal. with regard to low- virulence organisms  present in the female lower genital tract, we are beginning to identify some of their virulence attributes. examples from the work of our laboratory include the  hemolysin of gardnerella vaginalis and an immunosuppressive mycotoxin produced by candida albicans. demonstrating the coordinate expression (or other control mechanisms) of virulence factors in these sometimes innocuous and sometimes inimical organisms represents the next frontier in the study of normal vaginal microbiology.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis and vaginal microorganisms in idiopathic premature labor and  association with pregnancy outcome.
AB  == the vaginal microflora of 49 women in idiopathic preterm labor was compared with  that of 38 term controls to determine whether the presence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and/or specific microorganisms would influence the rate of preterm delivery. demographic factors, pregnancy outcome, and reproductive history were also studied. bv, as defined by the presence of clue cells in a vaginal wet mount and  characteristic microbial findings in a stained vaginal smear and vaginal culture, was more common in women with preterm labor and delivery than in controls (p < 0.01). the condition, diagnosed in 41% of women who had both preterm labor and delivery (n = 22) and in 11% each of women who had preterm labor but term delivery (n = 27) and controls, was associated with a 2.1-fold risk (95% confidence intervals, 1.2 to 3.7) for preterm birth prior to 37 weeks of gestation. bv was associated with low birth weight. of 49 women with preterm labor, 67% (8 of 12) of women with bv were delivered of low-birth-weight neonates (< 2,500 g) compared with 22% (8 of 37) of women without the condition (p < 0.0005). the presence of hydrogen peroxide-producing facultative lactobacillus spp. was strongly negatively associated with both preterm delivery and bv. bv-associated microorganisms, i.e., mobiluncus, prevotella, and peptostreptococcus species, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, fusobacterium nucleatum, mycoplasma hominis, and high numbers of gardnerella vaginalis were significantly associated with preterm delivery; all species also strongly associated with bv (p = 0.0001 for each comparison). mobiluncus curtisii and fusobacterium nucleatum were recovered exclusively from women with preterm delivery. our study clearly indicates that bv and its associated organisms are correlated with idiopathic premature delivery.

TI  == evaluation of affirm vp microbial identification test for gardnerella vaginalis and trichomonas vaginalis.
AB  == a commercial system (affirm vp microbial identification test; microprobe corp.) for detection of vaginal pathogens was evaluated with 176 consecutive women attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic for genital complaints. vaginal swab specimens were used for culture of gardnerella vaginalis and trichomonas vaginalis, preparation of a vaginal smear for gram stain interpretation, and wet  mount evaluation. an additional swab was used to evaluate the 30-min nonisotopic  oligonucleotide probe test. the automated probe system detected g. vaginalis in 69 (95%) of 73 women having > 5 x 10(5) cfu of g. vaginalis per ml by culture, and 20 (43%) of 47 specimens with < or = 5 x 10(5) cfu of g. vaginalis per ml. there were three false positives and four false negatives for the affirm vp test  compared with > 5 x 10(5) cfu of g. vaginalis per ml. the probe system detected g. vaginalis in 57 (90%) of 63 vaginal specimens from women having clue cells on  wet mount examination, and in only 3 (3%) of 113 women without clue cells, suggesting that the affirm probe for g. vaginalis could be used as a surrogate for wet mount examination for clue cells. the t. vaginalis probe was positive for 12 of 12 specimens positive by wet mount and 12 of 15 specimens positive by culture. there were no false positives and three false negatives for the affirm vp test compared with culture and/or wet mount for t. vaginalis. the affirm vp microbial identification system is a rapid, objective, and automated test for the detection of t. vaginalis and clinically significant levels of g. vaginalis that  is comparable to wet mount examination for clue cells and is superior to wet mount examination for the detection of trichomonads.

TI  == determination of gardnerella vaginalis genome size by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
AB  == the chromosomal dna of four strains of gardnerella vaginalis were digested with rare cutting restriction enzymes and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). the four strains studied were two clinical isolates (gvp 004 & gvp 007) and two american type culture collection strains (atcc 14018 & atcc 14019). the restriction enzyme sfii generated two dna fragments of about 0.6 mb and 1.1 mb in all four strains giving a g. vaginalis genome size of about 1.7 mb. a similar genome size was calculated utilizing two more gc-rich sequence specific restriction endonucleases, noti and asci. when digested with asci, the chromosomal dna of all four strains gave rise to 11 to 12 dna fragments ranging between 0.01 mb to 0.43 mb. dna from the two clinical isolates were digested by noti (yielding 7 to 9 fragments), while the dna from the two atcc strains were resistant to noti digestion. in contrast the clinical isolates, dna from the two  atcc strains gave an identical profile for all restriction endonucleases tested.  from double digestion experiments, the two sfii sites could be localized on two asci fragments. from these pfge studies, it is concluded that the g. vaginalis genome is a circular dna that ranges between 1.67 mb and 1.72 mb in size.

TI  == ionic factors regulating the interaction of gardnerella vaginalis hemolysin with  red blood cells.
AB  == we have studied the hemolytic properties of an exotoxin released by gardnerella vaginalis (gvh). we found that hemolysis induced by gvh is modulated by the composition of the isotonic buffer in which the red cells are suspended. in particular, low ph enhances its lytic activity, whereas low ionic strength and divalent cations diminish it. the inhibitory effects of reduced salt concentration and divalent cations occur despite normal binding of the toxin to the cells. this suggests that some post-binding step is impaired. the toxin is also able to damage cholesterol-containing lipid vesicles, and even on these model membranes it is more active at low ph. from this point of view, gvh has some similarity to clostridium perfringens theta-toxin, a membrane-damaging toxin belonging to the family of 'thiol-activated' cytolysins produced by gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == pore-forming and haemolytic properties of the gardnerella vaginalis cytolysin.
AB  == the pleomorphic bacterium gardnerella vaginalis releases in the culture broth a haemolytic exotoxin (gvh) which is probably a virulence determinant of this unique bacterium, implicated in gynaecological and urological disorders. this 59  kda cytolysin was purified to homogeneity in just one chromatographic step directly from the culture supernatant, a final specific activity up to 1.9 x 10(6) hu mg-1 being obtained. the toxin-induced lesion on human erythrocytes results from the formation of a pore whose radius is approximately 2.4 nm. the damage is inhibited by osmotic protectants and shows a sigmoidal dose-response profile suggesting an aggregation process of haemolysin molecules on the target membrane to create the functional lesion. the extent and the kinetics of haemolysis are strongly dependent on temperature and an activation energy of 64.0 kj mol-1 has been derived. lipid membranes can be very efficient inhibitors of gvh-haemolysis, being able to bind the toxin quite avidly. the inhibitory effect  requires the presence of cholesterol and it is stronger when cholesterol is mixed with negatively charged phospholipids rather than with zwitterionic phospholipids, suggesting that a negative surface potential increases the affinity of the toxin for the lipid bilayer. the functional properties of gvh have been compared with those of clostridium perfringens thetatoxin (pfo) and escherichia coli haemolysin (hlya), which are representative of widespread haemolysins produced by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. the toxin shares several features with the family of the so-called 'sulphydryl-activated' cytolysins produced by gram-positive bacteria, although gvh does not truly belong to this family, being deactivated by beta-mercaptoethanol and being antigenically distinct from them. we report here for the first time the detection in the vaginal fluid of infected women of a specific iga response against the toxin.

TI  == diagnostic microbiology of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized microbiologically by replacement of the lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides species, mobiluncus species, and genital mycoplasmas. a standardized, laboratory-based diagnostic test for bacterial vaginosis is desirable in those instances in which a microscope is unavailable in the clinic or when the evaluator of the wet mount examination is inexperienced at recognizing clue cells. vaginal cultures have excellent sensitivity for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, but because the predictive value of a positive g. vaginalis culture is less than 50%, cultures are not recommended. vaginal gram smears are objective and reproducible, have 62% to 100% sensitivity, and have a positive predictive value of 76% to 100%. diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis with use of papanicolaou-stained smears has been reported, but standardized criteria have not been widely adopted. a rapid, office-based oligonucleotide probe test for high concentrations of g. vaginalis has been developed and may be useful when direct microscopy is unavailable or confidence in microscopic examination is low. laboratory tests that detect microbial products unique to the vaginal fluid of women with bacterial vaginosis include detection of amines (putrescine, cadaverine, and trimethylamine), measurement of the relative levels of succinate  and lactate in the vaginal fluid by gas chromatography, detection of proline aminopeptidase by colorimetric assay, or detection of sialidases in the vaginal fluid. although these tests are not yet applicable to routine use, these research tests could be adapted for wider use in office laboratories. vaginal gram stains  are more useful than culture for laboratory confirmation of bacterial vaginosis.

AB  == the activity of fk037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. a fastidious facultative anaerobe, gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. fk037 inhibited 90% of isolates of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, clostridium perfringens, mobiluncus spp., g. vaginalis, and porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. the mics of fk037 for 50 and 90% of bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of fk037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. the activity of fk037  against fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium varium, and bilophila wadsworthia  decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) cfu/ml. little influence of inoculum size on the activity of fk037 was observed for other isolates tested. medium ph affected the activity of fk037 against f. varium (mics at phs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and bacteroides gracilis (mics at phs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. fk037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from b. fragilis gai 0558 and gai 10150.

TI  == prevalence of cervical pathogens in women with and without inflammatory changes on smear testing.
AB  == objective: to assess correlation between nonspecific cervicitis, inflammation, or exudate on cervical smears tests and confirmed presence of known cervical pathogens. design: investigation of women attending a family practice clinic for  smear test by microbiological screening for chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, trichomonas vaginalis, candida species, group b  streptococcus, gardnerella vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. setting: family  practice teaching clinic in a university hospital. patients: 411 women presenting for a smear test. main outcome measures: prevalence of genital infections associated with presence or absence of inflammatory changes on cervical smear. results: of the 132 women with inflammatory changes on cervical smear, 64 (48%) had positive cultures. of the 248 without inflammatory changes, 117 (47%) had positive cultures. subgroup analysis on individual organisms also showed no significant difference between the two groups. conclusion: reports of inflammatory changes on cervical smear testing are a poor indicator of infection.

TI  == the vagina as an ecologic system. current understanding and clinical applications.
AB  == recent advances in understanding the mechanisms of dominance of the healthful microecology by lactobacillus acidophilus through microbicidal enzyme systems has led to renewed interest in ecologic approaches to vaginal health maintenance and  treatment of vaginosis and vaginitis. review of pertinent research suggests that  due to inadequate adherence of lactobacilli from dairy sources, contaminants in commercial sources, and lack of evidence of effectiveness in sparse clinical trials, intravaginal applications of l. acidophilus cannot be recommended. bacterial vaginosis is described in this article as a microecologic shift in the  dominant organism of the microecology from l. acidophilus to gardnerella vaginalis. this results in conditions favorable to vaginal establishment of many  anaerobic organisms. the ability to identify and nurture healthful lactobacilli in the vaginal microflora is suggested as a future direction for health-enhancement-oriented research, practice, and screening.

AB  == the role of potential target enzymes in the protein-kinase-c-independent eicosanoid response triggered by certain bacteria in murine peritoneal macrophages [svensson, u., holst, e. & sundler, r. (1991) eur. j. biochem. 202, 699-705] has been investigated. the eicosanoid response was found to be due to an increase in the mobilization of arachidonate rather than to inhibition of arachidonate esterification or activation of the cyclooxygenase pathway and to be accompanied by a persistent increase in the activity of the arachidonate-mobilizing phospholipase a2 (pla2-85). also, down-regulation of protein-kinase c by prolonged treatment with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate did not reduce the bacterial activation of pla2-85. the increase in activity of pla2-85, like the increase in eicosanoid formation, showed a lag period of approximately 10 min. furthermore, exposure of 32p-labeled macrophages  to either bacteria (gardnerella vaginalis) or the protein-phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid caused an increase in the phosphorylation of pla2-85. okadaic acid (0.5 microm), which itself caused arachidonate mobilization and activation of pla2-85 after a lag period of approximately 45 min, greatly promoted the response to bacteria even at earlier time points. this study provides strong evidence that the eicosanoid response to bacteria in macrophages occurs via a protein-kinase-c-independent activation of pla2-85 and that this activation is due to an increase in the phosphorylation of the enzyme.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of meropenem, imipenem, piperacillin, cefoxitin, ampicillin/sulbactam, clindamycin and metronidazole was determined against 395 strains of strict and facultative anaerobes, including gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp. and mobiluncus spp. the activities of meropenem and imipenem were within one dilution of their mic50 and mic90 values. one isolate of bacteroides fragilis, two of bacteroides distasonis, and two of bacteroides ovatus showed resistance or diminished susceptibility to meropenem and imipenem.  metronidazole was active against almost all obligate anaerobic isolates. some non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli and lactobacilli were resistant. ampicillin/sulbactam inhibited almost all isolates at < or = 16/8 mg/l. the activity of clindamycin and cefoxitin was relatively good, but some strains of non-fragilis b. fragilis group species were resistant. piperacillin was the least active agent tested.

TI  == [recent bacteriologic data: from physiopathology to treatment].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a change in the vaginal ecosystem in which lactobacillus spp, the dominant members of the normal flora, are replaced by an association of various bacterial species including gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes (bacteroides spp, prevotella spp, porphyromonas spp, peptostreptococcus spp and mobiluncus spp) and mycoplasma hominis. the reasons for this imbalance are unknown, although the loss of lactobacilli that produce hydrogen peroxide (which is toxic for g. vaginalis and numerous anaerobes) may be an essential element. the introduction of one or several of these species into the vagina (they can occasionally be isolated in small numbers even in the absence of vaginosis) following intercourse or from the intestinal tract may also play a role. g. vaginalis itself is not considered to cause vaginosis, but is almost always present and multiplies rapidly; in addition, it has a high capacity for adherence to epithelial cells both in vivo and in vitro. it is now agreed that the concomitant growth of one or several anaerobic species is required for bacterial vaginosis to develop. our knowledge of the bacteriology of bacterial vaginosis has implications for diagnosis and treatment. it is now possible to obtain a precise bacteriologic diagnosis, not by culturing g. vaginalis (a costly and low-yield procedure), but by direct examination of the vaginal flora after gram staining, which shows the replacement of lactobacilli by a characteristic polymorphic flora. therapy is based on the use of antibiotics such as the imidazoles, which are active against g. vaginalis and anaerobes, but not against  the commensal lactobacilli.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [the bacteriologic diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis in an urban practice].
AB  == the term "bacterial vaginosis" carries both bacteriologic and clinical connotations. indeed, it implies that the vagina is uninflamed (as shown by the absence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils), but that potential pathogens (particularly gardnerella vaginalis) are present. many studies conducted over the last 10 years have shown that a tentative diagnosis is simple to make, based on the sniff test, the aspect of the vaginal discharge, the presence of clue cells,  and the absence of polymorphonuclear cells and lactobacilli on fresh smears. however, classical treatment with metronidazole can be insufficient given the innumerable microbial associations, and a more thorough bacteriological diagnosis is required. the presence of anaerobes is suggested by a positive sniff test. direct examination reveals small gram-negative rods in clue cells, but cannot differentiate between commensal atypical lactobacilli and gram-positive anaerobes. culture with co2 supplementation or in anaerobic conditions yields bacteroides and mobiluncus spp, frequently associated with gardnerella vaginalis  and pathogenic fusobacterium spp. culture in appropriate conditions will detect metronidazole-resistant propionibacteria and pathogenic anaerobic cocci. antibiotic susceptibility testing of these organisms is costly and time-consuming, but can avoid therapeutic failures. gardnerella vaginalis is also frequently associated in bacterial vaginosis with endogenous (mainly e. coli and  group b streptococci) and ureaplasma. antibiotic susceptibility testing is useful if the predominant members of the flora are gram-negative aerobes, group d streptococci or pathogenic anaerobes. bacterial vaginosis is simple to diagnose but poses a real therapeutic problem since some cases call for a simple readjustment of the commensal flora while others require full chemotherapy.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [clinical and colposcopic aspects of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by an uniform, malodorous, white-grey discharge. the presenting symptom is generally the unpleasant smell of the vaginal discharge, particularly following the menses or intercourse. other functional signs, such as pruritus, dysuria and dyspareunia are rare. inflammatory signs are frequent, and can be revealed by colposcopy with the lugol test: this shows punctuate colpitis with small regular points corresponding histologically to an inflammatory focus in the connective tissue. the term "vaginitis" is avoided because of the absence of polymorphonuclear cells in the vaginal discharge, despite the presence of inflammation. bacterial vaginosis has  been held responsible for prematurity, small birthweight and post-partum infection. nonetheless, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus spp can be recovered from the vaginal flora of women with no signs of inflammation.

TI  == [the definition and epidemiology of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a condition with a flora change in the vaginal where a lactobacilli-dominated flora is exchanged with an abundant complex flora dominated by strict and facultative anaerobic bacteria. the condition seldom occurs in prepubertal girls and post-menopausal women, suggesting an hormonal component in its etiology. recurrent episodes of bacterial vaginosis are frequent. three out of four criteria should be fulfilled for establishing the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, i.e., an increased (often homogeneous) vaginal  discharge, a positive amine test, the presence of a great number of clue cells, a vaginal ph > or = 4.5. there are no hard data supporting that bacterial vaginosis is a sexually transmitted disease. cytological changes (cin i, ii, iii) have been found more often in women with bacterial vaginosis than in those without this condition. it has been proposed that nitrosamines from the abundant vaginal bacterial flora may be oncogenic, a correlation which, however, needs to be proved. the reservoir for one or more of the bacterial vaginosis-associated organism, e.g., some bacteroides and mobiluncus spp., gardnerella vaginalis and mycoplasma hominis, is probably the distal intestinal tract and the mouth. sparse or even a moderate number of clue cells are present in many women who do not have bacterial vaginosis. a vaginal ph of 4.7 seems to be a better cut-off level than  4.5. there is a statistical correlation between bacterial vaginosis and obstetrical complications.

AB  == the presence of cytokines such as the tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf alpha) and interleukin 2 (il2) in human spermatozoa is still to be defined. the aim of this study was to measure the concentration of both soluble factors in seminal fluid. data from normal semen samples (n = 24) confirmed the presence of il2 (258 +/- 84 fmol/ml corresponding to 953 +/- 369 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) and tnf alpha (62.2 +/- 16.4 fmol/ml corresponding to 231.3 +/- 86 fmol/total volume  of ejaculate). a significant positive correlation (r = 0.59; p < 0.01) was observed between the tnf alpha and the il2 concentrations. the concentrations of  these cytokines were not related to sperm parameters. in contrast, il2 concentrations (196.9 +/- 60.4 fmol/ml; 686.2 +/- 236.7 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) evaluated in 16 seminal fluids with identified bacterial agents were lower than in the control group, whereas tnf alpha concentrations (68.6 +/- 12.3  fmol/ml; 241.3 +/- 78.9 fmol/total volume of ejaculate) were not significantly different from the controls. further studies are needed to determine the potential role of these cytokines in the physiology of semen and their usefulness as indicators of reproductive pathology.

TI  == perinatal effects of gardnerella vaginalis deciduitis in the rabbit.
AB  == objective: we determined the effects of intrauterine infection with gardnerella vaginalis on maternal and fetal outcome in the rabbit. study design: both uterine horns of rabbits on day 20 or 21 of gestation (70% of gestation) were inoculated  hysteroscopically with either 0.2 ml of 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml of g. vaginalis or  saline solution. animals were killed on day 4 or earlier if premature delivery occurred. the following outcome parameters were evaluated: febrile morbidity, preterm labor and delivery, maternal cultures, fetal birth weight, and fetal neuropathologic findings. results: g. vaginalis intrauterine inoculation uniformly resulted in amnionitis and deciduitis. animals inoculated with g. vaginalis had no greater incidence of fever and preterm delivery than did saline-treated control animals. however, intrauterine infection with g. vaginalis resulted in a significant decrease in the live birth rate when compared with that of controls (80% vs 95%, p < 0.03). g. vaginalis deciduitis was associated with as 23% reduction in the birth weight of the surviving fetuses. furthermore, animals in the g. vaginalis study group had a 60% incidence of severe brain injury compared with 0% in the saline solution group. conclusion: g. vaginalis amnionitis and deciduitis produced minimal maternal morbidity but were associated with decreased birth weight and brain injury in surviving fetuses; thus it appears that g. vaginalis selectively functions as a fetal, but not maternal, pathogen in the rabbit.

AB  == rifaximin, a rifamycin derivative, was evaluated in vitro to assess its spectrum  and potency against a wide variety of bacteria, yeasts, viruses, and parasites. high concentrations of rifaximin were often used to reflect topically achieved levels since this compound is poorly absorbed by oral route. like rifampin, rifaximin possessed best activity against staphylococcus spp. (mic50 < or = 0.015 microgram/ml), streptococcus spp. (mic50s, < or = 0.03-0.12 microgram/ml), enterococcus spp. (mic50s, 0.25-2 micrograms/ml), bacillus cereus (mic50, 0.06 microgram/ml), moraxella catarrhalis (mic50, < or = 0.03 microgram/ml), and haemophilus influenzae (mic50, 0.25 microgram/ml). rifaximin demonstrated potential use as a topical agent for bacterial vaginosis by inhibiting bacteroides bivius-disiens, gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus spp., and mobiluncus spp. strains (all mics < or = 1 microgram/ml). strains of haemophilus  ducreyi and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mic50s, 0.25 microgram/ml) were also inhibited. however, some organisms associated with genital tract infections were  rifaximin resistant, for example, candida spp., herpes virus, mycoplasmas, trichomonas vaginalis, and ureaplasma urealyticum. clinical trials appear warranted using rifaximin topical concentrations that will minimize mutations to  rifamycin resistance.

AB  == gardnerella vaginalis (gv) infection has been reported as being acquired via sexual contact in adults and as an indicator of sexual contact in female children (dejong, 1985). the purpose of this study was to determine if gv infection was more commonly found in 191 female children who gave a history of sexual contact and/or were infected with neisseria gonorrhoeae (gc) or chlamydia trachomatis (ct) (group 1), compared with 144 female children evaluated for possible sexual abuse and found to have no such history or infection with gc or ct (group 2), or  31 female children (friends of the authors) without such a history or gc or ct infection (group 3). vaginal gv was found in 5.3% of group 1, 4.9% of group 2 and 6.4% of group 3 (p > .05). also, vaginal gv infection was not related to the type of sexual contact or race, but did increase with age in white female children. because vaginal gv infection is not more commonly found in children with a history of sexual contact than those without such a history, the finding of gv in a vaginal culture in an individual case would not be a reliable marker of sexual  contact. routine culturing for gv is not recommended as part of a sexual abuse workup.

TI  == physical characterization of the pore forming cytolysine from gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == the cytolytic toxin (ctox) produced by gardnerella vaginalis is able to form voltage-dependent cationic channels when incorporated in lipid membranes (moran et al. (1991) febs lett. 283, 317-320). osmotic protection experiments show that  toxin incorporated in human erythrocytes forms pores between 18 a and 28 a in diameter. a hypothesis of pore formation as a primary event to produce cytolysis  is proposed. the ctox activity increases when cells are depolarized by increasing the extracellular k+ concentration, probably reflecting the voltage dependent character of ctox formed channels. the cytolytic effect of the toxin was prevented by low temperatures and was a function of the extracellular ca2+ concentration, suggesting a ca2+ influx as part of the lytic mechanism. binding of ctox to erythrocytes was dependent on external ca2+ and was less temperature-dependent. dose-response analysis suggests cooperativity of the toxin for the lytic activity, although no direct evidence of oligomerization has been found.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis: characteristics, clinical considerations, and controversies.
AB  == the clinical significance, gram stain reaction, and genus affiliation of gardnerella vaginalis have been controversial since gardner and dukes described the organism as the cause of "nonspecific vaginitis," a common disease of women which is now called bacterial vaginosis. the organism was named g. vaginalis when taxonomic studies showed that it was unrelated to bacteria in various genera including haemophilus and corynebacterium. electron microscopy and chemical analyses have elucidated the organism's gram-variable reaction. controversy over  the etiology of bacterial vaginosis was largely resolved by (i) studies using improved media and methods for the isolation and identification of bacteria in vaginal fluids and (ii) standardization of criteria for clinical and laboratory diagnosis. besides g. vaginalis, mobiluncus spp., mycoplasma hominis, and certain obligate anaerobes are now acknowledged as participants in bacterial vaginosis. the finding that g. vaginalis, mobiluncus spp., and m. hominis inhabit the rectum indicates a potential source of autoinfection in addition to sexual transmission. extravaginal infections with g. vaginalis are increasingly recognized, especially when the toxic anticoagulant polyanetholesulfonate is omitted from blood cultures and when urine cultures are incubated anaerobically for 48 h. the finding that mares harbor g. vaginalis suggests that an equine model can be developed for studies of gardnerella pathogenesis.

AB  == the in-vitro activity of rp 59500 was determined against 1051 recent clinical bacterial isolates. the susceptibility to rp 59500 was determined with an agar dilution technique for all the isolates, while mics and mbcs were determined for  82 selected strains in broth. isolates of both staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci appeared to be potentially susceptible to rp 59500, independent of susceptibility to methicillin or mls resistance. (s. aureus: methicillin-sensitive, mic90, 1.0 mg/l; methicillin-resistant, mic90 1.0  mg/l; coagulase-negative staphylococci: methicillin-sensitive, mic90 0.5 mg/l). lancefield group a, b, c and g streptococci (mic50 0.5 and mic90 1.0 mg/l) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic50 0.5 and mic90 1.0 mg/l) appeared to be susceptible to rp 59500. some streptococcus spp. and enterococci as well as listeria monocytogenes were inhibited by a higher concentration of rp 59500 (enterococci: mic90 4 mg/l, range 0.125-16 mg/l). comparatively low mics were seen when legionella spp., neisseria gonorrhoeae and gardnerella vaginalis were tested. broth dilution mic/mbc determinations showed no evidence of tolerance, as mic values were within two dilutions of mbc values. rp 59500 might be a useful compound in the treatment of infections caused by a range of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including those resistant to methicillin and/or macrolides.

TI  == involvement of gardnerella vaginalis in urinary tract infections in men.
AB  == fifteen male patients from whose urine samples gardnerella vaginalis was isolated (clinical incidence of 0.1%) were evaluated for clinical signs and symptoms of urinary tract infection and modality of acquisition of the organism. ten of 15 (67%) patients were symptomatic or had signs of inflammation as manifested by an  increased number of urinary neutrophils. one patient had two bouts of infection caused by this organism which required two courses of antibiotic therapy. colonies of diphtheroidlike organisms found in urine cultures should not be ignored as insignificant but should be further investigated to determine whether  g. vaginalis is present.

TI  == comparison of the vaginal flora in sexually abused and nonabused girls.
AB  == the presence of sexually transmitted pathogens in the vagina of the sexually abused girl may provide direct evidence of sexual abuse; the presence of other abnormal vaginal organisms may provide indirect evidence of abuse. to identify abnormal vaginal organisms, we prospectively studied the flora of 209 sexually abused girls (cases) and compared it with that in a concurrent control group of 108 girls. case and control subjects were from the same community, were predominantly white, and 71% of each group were 3 to 10 years of age. the sexually transmitted pathogens (neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex virus) were isolated exclusively from the case group at a low frequency (less than 1%). the isolation of mycoplasma species exclusively in the case group (4%), and of gardnerella vaginalis in 7% of the case group versus 1% of the control group, suggests that both these organisms may be sexually transmitted. other bacteria also were collectively more frequent in the case group (16% vs 6%). there may be an association between sexual activity and colonization of the lower genital tract in young girls.

TI  == [epidemiological factors and vaginal flora changes in vaginal bacteriosis (bacterial vaginosis)].
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to know the modifications of the vaginal bacterial flora that occurs in bacterial vaginosis and to know the involvement of these microorganisms and the influence of several epidemiologic factors in the etiology of this disease. methods: we studied, by using semiquantitative cultures and glc, vaginal washings from 50 healthy women and 50 women with bacterial vaginosis. results: the most remarkable results were the high sensitivity of amsel's criteria and their good correlation with glc. women with bacterial vaginosis showed a great increase of cfus/ml of gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum and several species of anaerobic bacteria, and an important decrease of the amounts of aerobic lactobacilli. the main epidemiologic factor among those that were studied was the use of iuds. conclusions: the appearance of bacterial vaginosis is associated with the increase of the amounts  of g. vaginalis, bacteroides or related genera (prevotella, porphyromonas), and probably m. hominis and u. urealyticum, also being associated to a decrease of the amounts of aerobic lactobacilli. these facts are probably related with alteration in the ecologic relationship lactobacilli/g. vaginalis/anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == the effects of a combined contraceptive vaginal ring releasing ethinyloestradiol  and 3-ketodesogestrel on vaginal flora.
AB  == fifty nine women with documented normal ovulatory cycles and with no symptoms of  vaginal infection were divided into four groups. each group used a combined contraceptive vaginal ring (ccvr) with a mean daily release rate of 0.015 mg of ethinyloestradiol (ee) and 0.120 mg of 3-ketodesogestrel (3-kdg) per day, for one cycle of either 21, 28, 42, or 56 days. cultures from the posterior vaginal fornix and from the endocervical canal were obtained immediately before insertion of the ring and on removal of the ring. changes in the numbers of vaginal cells,  aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, yeasts and trichomonas vaginalis were documented at the end of each treatment. intra- and inter- group changes in the vaginal flora were assessed at the end of  each treatment. the comparison between the number and type of flora showed no significant change between the pre-treatment population and the post-treatment population. the results of this study suggest that the use of this ccvr for 21, 28, 42 and 56 days is not associated with an increase in inflammatory cells or pathogenic bacteria.

AB  == the efficacy and safety of ofloxacin, 200 mg twice daily for 7 days, was compared with metronidazole, 400 mg twice daily for 7 days, for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis (bv). diagnosis of bv was confirmed by at least 3 of the following 4 criteria: the presence of an abnormal vaginal discharge on examination, clue cells on microscopy of vaginal specimens, vaginal ph greater than 5.0 and a positive amine test. vaginal specimens were examined for mobiluncus spp, analysed for the succinate/lactate (s/l) ratio and cultured for trichomonas vaginalis, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides spp. and mycoplasma hominis. patients were reviewed on completion of treatment (visit 2) and 14 days later (visit 3). the diagnosis of bv was accepted in 119 of 149 patients recruited, 60 of whom received treatment with ofloxacin and 59 received metronidazole. sixty-two patients, 31 in each treatment group, completed the study. diagnostic cure at visit 2 was significantly better in the metronidazole group with cure rates of 56% (metronidazole) vs 23% (ofloxacin) (p = 0.001); this was associated with higher eradication rates for g. vaginalis (100% vs 56%) and bacteroides spp. (97% vs 49%). there were no significant differences between the two groups in clinical cure at either visit 2 or 3 or in diagnostic cure at visit 3. both treatments were well tolerated. we conclude that metronidazole is likely to remain the first choice of treatment for bv but ofloxacin offers a safe and effective alternative.

TI  == the relationship of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacilli to bacterial vaginosis and genital microflora in pregnant women.
AB  == lactobacilli provide an important microbial defense against genital colonization  by pathogens. the role of hydrogen peroxide (h2o2) in the control of genital microflora was explored in a cross-sectional study of 275 women in the second trimester of pregnancy. vaginal cultures were obtained for detection of h2o2-positive and h2o2-negative lactobacilli and other members of the genital microflora. compared with women with h2o2-negative lactobacilli, women colonized  by h2o2-positive lactobacilli were less likely to have bacterial vaginosis, symptomatic candidiasis, and vaginal colonization by gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and  viridans streptococci (p less than or equal to .05 for each comparison). in addition to the above organisms, women without vaginal lactobacilli were more likely than those women with h2o2-positive lactobacilli to have chlamydia trachomatis, and less likely to be colonized by enterococcus or coagulase-negative staphylococci (p less than .05 for each comparison). vaginal colonization by group b streptococci or escherichia coli was not related to the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli. these data suggest that the presence of h2o2-positive lactobacilli in the vagina is inversely correlated with infection by some genital pathogens in pregnant women.

TI  == sialidases (neuraminidases) in bacterial vaginosis and bacterial vaginosis-associated microflora.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis, prevotella species, and bacteroides species have been associated with prematurity and upper genital tract infection. prevotella (bacteroides) species and bacteroides fragilis have also been associated with preterm birth. however, the mechanism by which lower genital tract infection causes upper genital tract disease remains poorly understood. sialidases (neuraminidases) are enzymes which enhance the ability of microorganisms to invade and destroy tissue. elevated levels of sialidase activity were detected in 42 (84%) of 50 vaginal fluid specimens from women with bacterial vaginosis and none of 19 vaginal fluids from women without bacterial vaginosis (p less than 0.001). vaginal fluid from women with bacterial vaginosis had a median specific activity of 9.8 u compared to 2.5 u of sialidase in women without bacterial vaginosis (p less than 0.001). in order to determine the probable source of sialidases in vaginal fluid, the microorganisms recovered from women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment were assayed. of 28 specimens from women with bacterial vaginosis, 27 (96%) yielded sialidase-positive bacteria, at  a median concentration of 10(6.5) cfu/ml of vaginal fluid. prevotella and bacteroides species accounted for the sialidase activity in 26 of the vaginal fluids, and gardnerella vaginalis accounted for the sialidase activity in the remaining fluid. after treatment, sialidase was detected in the vaginal fluid of  1 (5%) of 22 women who responded to therapy and in all of 6 women for whom therapy failed. these data suggest that vaginal fluid sialidase is highly correlated with bacterial vaginosis and that the probable sources for this enzyme activity are the bacteroides and prevotella species present in the vagina.

TI  == high levels of gardnerella vaginalis detected with an oligonucleotide probe combined with elevated ph as a diagnostic indicator of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == we have demonstrated a new approach to diagnosing bacterial vaginosis (bv) that is based on measuring the concentration of gardnerella vaginalis in vaginal fluid with dna probes. g. vaginalis is virtually always present at high concentrations  in women who have bv but is also detected frequently in normal women, usually at  concentrations of less than 10(7) cfu/ml of vaginal fluid. elevated vaginal ph is another sensitive indicator of bv, although it can occur in conjunction with other conditions. we have proposed that quantitative measurements of g. vaginalis using specific dna probes can serve as a useful aid in diagnosing bv, provided the vaginal ph is above 4.5. to test this hypothesis, a group of 113 women were first evaluated for bv by the standard set of clinical signs. vaginal washes were collected, and aliquots were analyzed by quantitative culture for the concentration of g. vaginalis. portions of these same samples were immobilized on nylon filters, along with standards for quantitation. the filters were incubated  with a radiolabelled oligonucleotide specific for g. vaginalis 16s rrna, and the  subsequent autoradiographs were examined to determine levels of g. vaginalis in each sample. g. vaginalis at concentrations of greater than or equal to 2 x 10(7) cfu/ml and vaginal ph of greater than 4.5 were then analyzed for concurrence with the diagnoses based on clinical criteria. results of this slot blot analysis gave a sensitivity of 95%, correctly categorizing 41 of 43 bv-positive specimens, and  a specificity of 99%, correctly identifying 69 of 70 bv-negative specimens, compared with diagnosis based on clinical criteria.

AB  == this study was undertaken to define the characteristics and persistence of vaginal flora in 7918 pregnant women at 23 to 26 weeks' gestation. vaginal smears were categorized as normal (predominant lactobacilli), intermediate (reduced lactobacilli), or positive for bacterial vaginosis. the women with normal flora were least likely to have elevated vaginal ph, amine odor, milky discharge, or colonization by gardnerella, bacteroides, or genital mycoplasmas. women with intermediate vaginal flora had intermediate frequencies of these clinical signs and microorganisms. group b streptococci and yeast were associated with normal or intermediate flora, whereas neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis were  recovered more frequently from women with intermediate flora or bacterial vaginosis. trichomonas vaginalis was most associated with intermediate flora. at  follow-up, 81% of the women with normal flora had remained normal. of the women with intermediate flora, 32% acquired bacterial vaginosis and 30% shifted to normal flora. only 12% of the women with bacterial vaginosis had shifted to normal flora. we conclude that there are two primary stable vaginal flora patterns (normal flora or bacterial vaginosis) and a third less distinct transitional flora pattern between these two.

AB  == objectives: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a prevalent vaginal infection that is now regarded as a risk factor in more serious pelvic and obstetric complications. spermicides are known to have antimicrobial activity against other sexually transmitted diseases and the aim of this study was to test whether the causative  organisms of bv were also susceptible to spermicides, in vitro. design: minimal inhibitory concentrations of five spermicidal compounds were determined for the organisms associated with bv, in an agar dilution technique. location: the department of experimental and clinical microbiology, university of sheffield medical school, uk. spermicides and organisms: nonoxynol-9, nonoxynol-11, docusate sodium, benzalkonium chloride and menfegol were tested against 20 strains each of gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides and mobiluncus organisms, isolated from patients with bv who attended the department of genitourinary medicine, the royal hallamshire hospital, sheffield. main outcome measures: the susceptibility of bv-associated organisms to spermicidal compounds, in vitro. results: g vaginalis, mobiluncus spp, bacteroides bivius and bacteroides disiens  were all susceptible to the five spermicides tested, with mics ranging between less than or equal to 19 and 5000 mg/l (0.0019%-0.5%). conclusion: the concentrations of spermicides incorporated in contraceptive preparations are usually between 3% and 8%, which are far in excess of the mics found for bv organisms. their usage could exert a significant antimicrobial effect and be a useful prophylactic in preventing the infection.

TI  == nonoxynol-9: differential antibacterial activity and enhancement of bacterial adherence to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == the antibacterial activity and adherence-enhancing effects of nonoxynol-9 were evaluated against vaginal and uropathogenic bacteria. nonoxynol-9 was markedly less active against the 43 uropathogenic bacterial and yeast strains tested (mic90, greater than 32%) than against the 26 gardnerella vaginalis strains (mic90, less than or equal to 0.015%) and the 53 lactobacillus strains (mic90, 8%) tested. hydrogen peroxide-producing strains of lactobacillus were more susceptible to nonoxynol-9 (mic90, 4%) than nonproducers (mic90, 16%). two escherichia coli strains that expressed type 1 fimbriae and three vaginal strains of lactobacilli adhered in significantly higher numbers to vaginal epithelial cells preincubated with 5% nonoxynol-9 than to control cells preincubated with pbs. spermicides may provide a selective advantage in colonizing the vagina with  nonoxynol-9-resistant uropathogens such as e. coli, perhaps via a reduction in vaginal lactobacilli (especially hydrogen peroxide-producing strains) and through enhancement of adherence of e. coli to epithelial cells.

TI  == the vaginal ecosystem.
AB  == the ecology of vaginal flora is highly susceptible to numerous endogenous and exogenous influences. possible mechanisms that might influence changes in the vaginal flora are microbial antibiosis, adhesion to the vaginal epithelial lining, e.g., availability of receptors, hormonal changes including physiologic alterations, disease states, drug therapy, sexual activity, and to a lesser extent, the immunologic status of the person. the role that these mechanisms may  play in promoting vaginitis, vaginosis, and possibly pelvic inflammatory disease  is explored.

TI  == clinical significance of hyperkeratosis on otherwise normal papanicolaou smears.
AB  == background: although hyperkeratosis is a common cytological finding on papanicolaou smear, its clinical significance is unclear. methods: a profile of patients with hyperkeratosis was constructed by comparing them to an age-matched  control population having normal papanicolaou smears. the clinical significance of hyperkeratosis was evaluated and appropriate follow-up studies were recommended. results: of 2198 papanicolaou smears done in the university of kansas family practice department between october 1, 1988, and october 31, 1989,  there were 184 diagnoses of hyperkeratosis from smears on which no other pathological findings were noted. charts of 183 of these patients with hyperkeratosis were reviewed and compared with an age-matched control population  having normal papanicolaou smears. patients with hyperkeratosis had a statistically higher incidence of infections with gardnerella vaginalis, but a lower incidence of infections with chlamydia trachomatis. diaphragm use was more  prevalent in the group with hyperkeratosis. the incidence of inflammation on papanicolaou smear was similar between the two groups. of the patients with hyperkeratosis, colposcopic examination had been performed on 48% (88 of 183), of which 28% (25 of 88) had evidence of human papillomavirus or dysplasia. conclusions: review of the data obtained suggests that follow-up colposcopy, including endocervical curettage, be performed on all patients with hyperkeratosis in order to screen for accompanying pathological conditions that may necessitate treatment.

TI  == protein-kinase-c-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin e2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  == certain bacterial species, of which we selected fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. the release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin e2. bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. down-regulation of protein kinase c  by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the  case of p. acnes. furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin e2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. it is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the  response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to f. nucleatum (gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while p. anaerobius (gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. in both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred  independently of protein kinase c, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. these results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin e2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase c and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [ca2+].

AB  == on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentrations clarithromycin (6-o-methylerythromycin), a new macrolide, was found to be slightly more active than erythromycin against staphylococcus aureus, enterococci. moraxella catarrhalis, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides fragilis (sensu stricto) and b. ureolyticus and slightly less active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, alpha- and beta-haemolytic streptococci, haemophilus influenzae, campylobacter coli/jejuni and the b. melaninogenicus/oralis groups. there was complete cross-resistance between the two agents. reports of potentiation of the activity  against haemophilus influenzae of clarithromycin by its own metabolite and by human serum appear to operate in vivo, and therefore the new agent shows great promise, especially for the treatment of respiratory tract infections.

TI  == direct gram's stain of vaginal discharge as a means of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis (bv) by direct gram-stained smear of vaginal discharge was evaluated in 90 consecutive patients. vaginal secretions from 20 healthy female volunteers were also examined. all specimens were examined by culture for growth of gardnerella vaginalis and lactobacillus spp. only 35 (38.9%) of the patients with vaginal discharge satisfied the clinical diagnosis of bv. the vaginal gram-stained smear from all these 35 patients contained typical gardnerella morphotypes characteristic of bv and g. vaginalis was isolated from all of them as well as from a further 10 patients who did not satisfy the criteria for diagnosis of bv. the semi-quantitative assessment of gardnerella morphotypes was found to correlate positively with the semi-quantitative assessment of g. vaginalis growth by culture (p less than 0.0001). there was a strong inverse relationship between the quantity of lactobacillus and gardnerella morphotypes. direct gram-staining of smears should  facilitate the diagnosis of bv for clinicians with minimum need for confirmation  by culture, particularly in a third world setting with few or no laboratory facilities.

TI  == antibiosis between bacteria isolated from the vagina of women with and without signs of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == lactobacilli from women with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv) were tested for h2o2 production. thirty-seven (79%) of the 47 strains of lactobacilli isolated from the women without bv produced h2o2, while only nine (23%) of the 39 strains  of lactobacilli obtained from women with bv did so. five of 20 h2o2-producing and two of 26 non-producing strains of lactobacillus exhibited antibiosis against four of 12 strains of peptostreptococci and two of 10 strains of mobiluncus spp.  none of a further 41 different anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial strains were inhibited by any of the isolates of lactobacilli tested. some strains of gardnerella vaginalis, bacteriodes spp., mobiluncus spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. inhibited the growth of three strains of lactobacilli belonging to different species. when the ph of the culture medium was increased from 6.0 to 6.5 this led to a decrease in the number of strains inhibited and/or  the size of the growth-inhibitory zones. different concentrations of h2o2 did not inhibit any of the strains tested. the growth-inhibitory effect of lactobacilli could not be related to their bacteriocin production. increasing the iron content of the medium by adding fecl3 (0.01 mm-1 mm) decreased or completely abolished the antibiosis.

TI  == control of the microbial flora of the vagina by h2o2-generating lactobacilli.
AB  == h2o2-generating lactobacilli (lb+) are present in the vagina of most normal women but are absent from most women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). lb+ at high concentration was toxic to gardnerella vaginalis (the predominant organism in the vagina of women with bv); when the lb+ was lowered to a level where it was ineffective alone, the addition of myeloperoxidase and chloride reinstituted toxicity. toxicity was inhibited by catalase and was not seen when h2o2-negative  lactobacilli were used, implicating h2o2 as the toxic molecule. lb+ could be replaced by h2o2 and chloride by iodide, bromide, or thiocyanate. the optimum ph  for inhibition of g. vaginalis was 5.0-6.0 lb+ also was autoinhibitory when combined with myeloperoxidase and chloride. lb+ alone at low concentrations was toxic to bacteroides bivius through the formation of h2o2. adequate amounts of peroxidase were found in the vagina of 17 of 21 women. these findings suggest that lb+ may contribute to the control of the vaginal flora, particularly in the  presence of peroxidase and a halide.

TI  == the characterization of gardnerella vaginalis dna using non-radioactive dna probes.
AB  == dna restriction profiles of various gardnerella vaginalis isolates, generated by  bamhi, ecori, psti and other restriction enzymes, varied considerably. only a few dna fragments were identified as common in ethidium bromide fluorescence profile  and southern-blot hybridization patterns (employing a digoxigenin-labelled g. vaginalis dna probe and an enzyme-linked immunoassay detection method). while the efficiencies of southern-blot hybridization appeared inconsistent, in dot-blot assays, dna from each isolate hybridized readily, enabling the detection of at least 10 ng dna. a 5.7-kb dna fragment from g. vaginalis atcc 14018 genomic library, cloned in the bamhi site of pbr322, could replace the total genomic dna  probe. this specific dna fragment was present in different sizes in 12 analysed g. vaginalis strains, describing a restriction fragment length polymorphism. in control studies, none of the dna from bacteria other than g. vaginalis (including some genitourinary tract residents) hybridized with the g. vaginalis total or specific dna probes. non-radioactive g. vaginalis dna probes can thus form the basis of a useful detection method for further studies of this organism.

TI  == molecular probe for identification of trichomonas vaginalis dna.
AB  == trichomoniasis is one of the most widespread sexually transmitted diseases in the world. diagnosis can be achieved by several methods, such as direct microscopic observation of vaginal discharge, cell culture, and immunological techniques. a 2.3-kb trichomonas vaginalis dna fragment present in strains from diverse geographic areas was cloned and used as a probe to detect t. vaginalis dna in vaginal discharge by a dot blot hybridization technique. this probe was specific  for t. vaginalis dna. it recognized strains from two regions in italy (sardinia,  piemonte) and from mozambique (africa). in addition, our probe did not cross-react with bacterial (escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., group b streptococci, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, chlamydia trachomatis, and lactobacillus spp.), viral (herpes simplex virus type 2), fungal (candida albicans), protozoan (entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia, plasmodium falciparum, leishmania major, and leishmania infantum), or human nucleic acids. the probe reacted with pentatrichomonas hominis and trichomonas foetus. the limit signal recognized by our probe corresponded to the dna of 200 t. vaginalis isolates. the 2.3-kb probe was used in a clinical analysis of 98 samples. of these, 20 samples were found to be positive both with the probe and by cell culture, and only 14 of these were positive by a standard wet mount method.

AB  == media from bacterial cultures have been tested for actions on prostaglandin biosynthesis by human amnion and decidual cells. the bacterial species, which are commonly associated with intrauterine infections, were group b streptococcus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, gardnerella vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhea, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum. overall, low doses of bacterial products were stimulatory of amnion prostaglandin production, whereas high doses were inhibitory. a similar pattern of results was  obtained for effects on decidual prostaglandin production, although stimulatory actions at low doses were less pronounced. in all experiments interleukin 1 beta  consistently induced a stimulation of prostaglandin production that greatly exceeded that caused by any bacterial product. it is possible that the inhibitory action of high doses of bacterial products on prostaglandin biosynthesis may contribute to the poor course of labor experienced by women with chorioamnionitis. furthermore, these data lend credence to the view that the host response to infection (i.e. cytokine secretion) is the major mediator of subsequent preterm labor.

TI  == phospholipase c activity in microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  == phospholipase c (lecithinase or phosphatidylcholine phosphorylase) catalyzes the  hydrolysis of lecithin into phosphorylcholine and 1,2-diglyceride. bacterial production of phospholipase c may damage reproductive tract tissues by both direct and indirect mechanisms. use of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phospholipase c activity was determined in 204 isolates representative of those found in female genital tract. multiple aerobic  (28%) and anaerobic (28%) reproductive tract microorganisms showed phospholipase  c activity. phospholipase c-producing isolates included strains of bacteroides fragilis, b. bivius, b. thetaiotaomicron, gardnerella vaginalis, and group b streptococcus. phospholipase c activity was heterogenous; not all isolates that belong to a particular species showed activity. phospholipase c production may be a possible virulence factor produced by a number of microflora commonly implicated in various reproductive tract infections or conditions, as well as in  some instances of preterm birth.

TI  == survival of gardnerella vaginalis in human urine.
AB  == the authors studied the survival of gardnerella vaginalis in human urine and determined conditions for optimum recovery on agar media. gardnerella counts declined by greater than 99.9% in urine held at 37 degrees c for 24 hours, whereas the falloff was negligible at 4 degrees c. viability was lost after 6 hours in urine with ph of 5, and only 0.01% cells survived in urine with ph of 7. in contrast, greater than 90% cells survived exposure at ph of 6. dialysis to remove small molecular weight (less than 14,000) inhibitors did not enhance survival. co-cultivation with ureaplasma urealyticum and the addition of glycogen improved survival. maximum recovery from urine required anaerobic incubation on enriched agar medium (ph 6.5-7.5) for at least 48 hours. gardnerella vaginalis survives poorly in human urine at 37 degrees c. culture for these bacteria requires prolonged anaerobic incubation.

TI  == microbiological, epidemiological and clinical correlates of vaginal colonisation  by mobiluncus species.
AB  == the microbiological and epidemiological correlates of vaginal colonisation by mobiluncus species were examined among randomly selected women attending a sexually transmitted disease (std) clinic. women positive for trichomonas vaginalis were excluded. mobiluncus spp. were detected by gram stained vaginal smear in 21% of 633 std clinic patients, including 53% of those with and 4% of those without bacterial vaginosis (bv), as diagnosed by clinical criteria. gardnerella vaginalis and mycoplasma hominis detected by vaginal culture and mobiluncus detected by vaginal gram stain were each independently associated with bv after adjusting by logistic regression for the presence of sexually transmitted disease pathogens, gravidity, parity and number of lifetime sexual partners (p less than 0.001 for each organism). bacterial vaginosis was negatively correlated with isolation of lactobacilli, yeast and herpes simplex virus. after adjusting for presence or absence of bv, women with mobiluncus were  more likely to harbour g vaginalis (odds ratio 5.6, 95% confidence interval 1.6-19.5), m hominis (or 3.7, 95% ci 2.0-7.0) and neisseria gonorrhoeae (or 2.9,  95% ci 1.4-6.0) and less likely to harbour vaginal yeast (or 0.4, 95% ci 0.2-1.0); were more likely to be black (or 2.7, 95% ci 1.5-4.6), and to have been pregnant (or 1.8, 95% ci 1.1-3.1); but after the adjustment for bv, vaginal colonisation by mobiluncus was not associated with symptoms of odour, abdominal pain, menstrual irregularities, or with adnexal tenderness. in summary, mobiluncus, gardnerella vaginalis and mycoplasma hominis were independently associated with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, and mobiluncus was further associated with the presence of bv-associated microorganisms (m hominis and g vaginalis), n gonorrhoeae, black race, and gravidity.

TI  == reliability of diagnosing bacterial vaginosis is improved by a standardized method of gram stain interpretation.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to examine intercenter variability in the interpretation of gram-stained vaginal smears from pregnant women. the intercenter reliability of individual morphotypes identified on the vaginal smear was evaluated by comparing them with those obtained at a standard center. a new scoring system that uses the most reliable morphotypes from the vaginal smear was proposed for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. this scoring system was compared with the spiegel criteria for diagnosing bacterial vaginosis. the scoring system  (0 to 10) was described as a weighted combination of the following morphotypes: lactobacilli, gardnerella vaginalis or bacteroides (small gram-variable rods or gram-negative rods), and curved gram-variable rods. by using the spearman rank correlation to determine intercenter variability, gram-positive cocci had poor agreement (0.23); lactobacilli (0.65), g. vaginalis (0.69), and bacteroides (0.57) had moderate agreement; and small (0.74) and curved (0.85) gram-variable rods had good agreement. the reliability of the 0 to 10 scoring system was maximized by not using gram-positive cocci, combining g. vaginalis and bacteroides morphotypes, and weighting more heavily curved gram-variable rods. for comparison with the spiegel criteria, a score of 7 or higher was considered indicative of bacterial vaginosis. the standardized score had improved intercenter reliability (r = 0.82) compared with the spiegel criteria (r = 0.61). the standardized score also facilitates future research concerning bacterial vaginosis because it provides gradations of the disturbance of vaginal flora which may be associated with different levels of risk for pregnancy complications.

TI  == microbiology of specialized skin: the vulva.
AB  == human vulvar skin is an example of specialized skin. this is not only true for its gross and microscopic anatomy and physiology, but also for its microbiology.  to the microbiologist, the vulva consists of several distinct ecotopes. these are defined by the physical factors, especially occlusion, nutrient factors, and by the close proximity to the vagina, the urethra, and the anus, which may result in contamination with the flora typical for those sites. of the vulva ecotopes, only the labia majora have been seriously studied. the microbial flora of the labia majora is characterized by a high density of microorganisms, as is typical for occluded areas of the body, by the presence of organisms common for intertriginous skin such as gram-negative rods, and by the carriage of organisms  unique for the vulva and probably related to urethral and vaginal flora such as the nonpathogenic neisseria, lactobacilli, and gardnerella vaginalis. finally, the labia majora skin is a preferred site of staphylococcus aureus carriage that  can be of clinical and epidemiological relevance.

TI  == longitudinal study of the biotypes of gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis is the predominant vaginal microorganism in women with bacterial vaginosis. however, this organism is also frequently isolated from women without signs or symptoms of vaginitis. earlier studies have not revealed whether certain biotypes of g. vaginalis are more often associated with bacterial vaginosis or are more common in women who acquire bacterial vaginosis. we used a  typing scheme based on tests for beta-galactosidase, hippurate hydrolysis, and lipase, using oleate as a substrate. of 261 strains tested, the distribution of biotypes observed was as follows: 1, 13%; 2, 9%; 3, 5%; 4, 7%; 5, 41%; 6, 15%; and 8, 10%. biotype 7 was not observed. the distributions of biotypes from women  with and without bacterial vaginosis were found to be significantly different, with the lipase-positive biotypes (biotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4) being more predominant in women with vaginosis (41 versus 23%, p = 0.003). of 40 women with  normal vaginal flora at the index visit who remained normal at follow-up, 23 (57%) acquired a new biotype of g. vaginalis. by comparison, 90% of the 30 women  who developed bacterial vaginosis acquired a new biotype of g. vaginalis (p = 0.003). women with bacterial vaginosis at the index visit who were not treated were no more likely than normal women to have a shift in g. vaginalis biotype. however, 86% of the 30 women with bacterial vaginosis who were treated with an antibiotic at the index visit acquired a different biotype (p = 0.04 compared with the value for untreated women) regardless of treatment success. a trend toward the acquisition of a new biotype was observed among women who had contact  with a new sexual partner (81 versus 65%, p = 0.15). these data demonstrate that  the lipase-positive isolates of g. vaginalis are associated with bacterial vaginosis. women who acquire bacterial vaginosis are more likely to have a shift  in biotype than women who had normal flora at he follow-up, suggesting that the g. vaginalis isolates recovered from women who develop bacterial vaginosis represent newly acquired strains rather than overgrowth of previously colonizing  biotypes.

AB  == bacterial vaginosis is characterized by replacement of the normal lactobacillus-predominant vaginal flora with gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasma hominis. the present study evaluated the vaginal flora of women with bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin cream. sixty-seven nonpregnant women with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis, and without other genital tract infections, were randomly assigned to receive placebo cream or 0.1, 1, or 2% clindamycin cream. quantitative vaginal cultures for facultative and anaerobic bacteria and genital  mycoplasmas were performed at enrollment and at 4-7 days and 4-5 weeks after completion of therapy. at enrollment, g vaginalis was recovered from 99%, bacteroides sp from 94%, peptostreptococcus sp from 81%, and m hominis from 58% of the 67 women with bacterial vaginosis. the vaginal cultures yielded a median of 12 isolates per specimen, with equal numbers of aerobic and anaerobic species. the mean log concentration was 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/ml for aerobic and 2.6 x 10(8) cfu/ml for anaerobic bacteria. after treatment, the frequency and concentration of bacteria per milliliter of vaginal fluid decreased for g vaginalis, bacteroides sp, peptostreptococcus sp, and m hominis. the 2% clindamycin cream had the greatest effect on the bacterial vaginosis-associated flora and resulted  in clinical resolution of bacterial vaginosis in 15 (94%) of 16 women. treatment  with lower concentrations of clindamycin cream had less effect on the vaginal flora and resulted in clinical cure in 25 (71%) of 35 women. therapy was associated with an increase in the frequency and concentration of lactobacillus,  and a probably transient increase in the frequency of escherichia coli and enterococcus.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == reservoir of four organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis suggests lack of  sexual transmission.
AB  == this study consisted of a search for the possible reservoir and mode of spread of the four bacterial vaginosis-associated organisms mobiluncus mulieris, mobiluncus curtisii, mycoplasma hominis, and gardnerella vaginalis. their occurrence in rectal, oral, and pharyngeal specimens from women with and without bacterial vaginosis, their male sexual consorts, four homosexual men, and children (altogether, 374 people) was studied. genital samples were also obtained from all adults. all four organisms were isolated from the rectums of 45 to 62% of women with bacterial vaginosis and 10 to 14% of women without bacterial vaginosis. they also occurred in the rectums of males and children. m. hominis was recovered from the oropharynxes of 12 adults whose sexual consorts had genital occurrences of the organism. mobiluncus spp. occurred only in the vaginas of women with bacterial vaginosis (97%). the organisms were only infrequently recovered from genital samples from 135 males. organisms were recovered from the urethras and/or coronal sulci of 10 of 44 male consorts of women with bacterial vaginosis. however, after 2 weeks of condom use during sexual intercourse, only m. hominis remained in the urethra of one man. these findings suggest that the organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis are not spread sexually but colonize the vagina from an endogenous intestinal tract site. the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to bacterial vaginosis in a subpopulation of all women are still unknown.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == in the western world, bacterial vaginosis is now being recognised as the commonest cause of vaginitis. bacterial vaginosis represents a major disturbance  in vaginal microbiology with the massive overgrowth of predominantly anaerobic bacteria normally found in the vagina. accordingly, high population levels of non-fragilis bacteroides sp., peptostreptococci, gardnerella vaginalis and mobiluncus sp. are found, with a corresponding decline in lactobacillus sp. excessive polyamine production by anaerobes is responsible for the offensive vaginal discharge, and g. vaginalis adherent to epithelial cells produces pathognomonic clue cells, which together with elevated vaginal ph constitute the  hallmark of diagnosis. the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis remains poorly understood and the role of sexual transmission is controversial. bacterial vaginosis may cause symptoms but is frequently asymptomatic. it is more than a nuisance vaginal infection in that (a) many patients have recurrent episodes, and (b) it has recently been associated with post-partum and post-operative fever, upper genital tract infection, amnionitis and prematurity. therapy for symptomatic bacterial vaginosis is currently dominated by metronidazole; however, clindamycin and a host of new agents may enjoy similar success. women with recurrent bacterial vaginosis constitute a major therapeutic problem, as do pregnant women. the cause of frequently recurring bacterial vaginosis remains obscure. new data are presented here indicating that early recurrences are due to relapse and not reinfection. no evidence has emerged that suggests that relapse is due to antimicrobial resistance.

AB  == we examined subjective and objective correlates among 67 women with symptomatic bacterial vaginosis before and after treatment with intravaginal clindamycin or placebo. we found no preponderance of any sexual practices among these patients.  nine patients (13.4%) had had hysterectomy. whereas odor and discharge were the most common symptoms, 30 patients (44.8%) also complained of vulvovaginal irritation. symptoms correlated poorly with objective therapeutic outcome. on examination the diagnosis would have been missed in seven patients (10.4%) if the clinician relied on presence of an abnormal vaginal discharge to suggest bacterial vaginosis. vaginal ph greater than 4.5 was found immediately after curative therapy in 59.6% of patients. mobiluncus spp. morphotypes were 99.0% specific and 52.1% sensitive and proline aminopeptidase activity in vaginal fluid was 84.4% sensitive and 70.2% specific for diagnosis. our gram stain criteria yielded no false-negative results, 6.1% false-positive, and frequent indeterminate results after therapy. we found little evidence for sexual transmission of bacterial vaginosis. recurrence after effective therapy was not predicted by vaginal ph elevation, positive or indeterminate gram stain result, or positive proline aminopeptidase test.

TI  == a follow-up study of methods of contraception, sexual activity, and rates of trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == a randomized, clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the spermicidal agent nonoxynol 9 as prophylaxis for sexually transmitted diseases. eight hundred eighteen women using birth control who attended a sexually transmitted disease clinic were evaluated monthly for trichomoniasis, candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis for 6 months. women using the active spermicide experienced a somewhat  lower incidence rate of trichomoniasis (relative rate 0.83; 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 1.12) and bacterial vaginosis (relative rate 0.86; 95% confidence interval 0.69 to 1.12) as compared with placebo users. the rate of candidiasis was nearly identical for spermicide and placebo users (relative rate  1.02; 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 1.35). the number of sexual partners during the preceding month was related directly to the occurrence of trichomoniasis (p = 0.047) and bacterial vaginosis (p = 0.009) but not candidiasis (p = 0.99). subjects using oral contraceptives experienced a statistically significant lower  rate of trichomoniasis than did women using an intrauterine contraceptive device  or who had had a tubal ligation (relative rate 0.56; 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.81).

TI  == bacteriological state of the urine in symptom-free adult males.
AB  == mid-stream urine specimens from 120 symptom-free males aged between 15 and 60 years were examined for cells and bacteria. only 3 specimens showed pyuria, all of which yielded fastidious organisms. no specimen yielded a pure growth of an aerobe. fastidious organisms in pure or mixed growth were isolated from 26% of the specimens, none in a count greater than 10(8)/l and the majority in counts less than 10(7)/l. it was concluded that pure growths of aerobes in any count in  patients with symptoms are indicative of infection. fastidious organisms should be sought in the urine of patients with symptoms or pyuria before more intensive  and expensive investigations are pursued.

TI  == is candidiasis the true cause of vulvovaginal irritation in women with diabetes mellitus?
AB  == vulvovaginitis is common in diabetic women and is often treated with antifungal agents on the assumption that the causative organism is candida albicans. in a survey of 100 consecutive diabetic women attending a diabetes clinic 36 had complained to their general practitioner about vulvovaginal irritation during the past three years and 26 were treated with antifungal agents without a vaginal examination or swabs being taken. in a separate study 27 post-menopausal women with non-insulin dependent diabetes and symptoms of vulvovaginitis were investigated. the organisms cultured were: candida albicans (n = 6), beta haemolytic streptococci (n = 14), gardnerella vaginalis (n = 2), staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), streptococcus milleri (n = 1), streptococcus faecalis (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), no organisms (n = 3). where a bacterial organism was  isolated symptoms resolved in all but one case with appropriate antibiotic treatment. it is recommended that the practice of initiating antifungal treatment without taking high vaginal swabs should be reviewed and treatment should be given specifically rather than empirically.

TI  == the inflammatory cervical smear: a study in general practice.
AB  == this study set out to determine whether the term 'inflammatory' in a cervical smear report implies underlying infection or whether it could be masking cancerous or precancerous changes. of 826 smears taken in one practice over one year, 42 demonstrated some degree of inflammatory change. thirty four of these women presented for swabs and almost half (47%) had a microbiologically proven infection. this group was further subdivided, and of those whose smears were reported as simple 'inflammation', just over one third (35%) were infected but of those whose smears were reported as 'severe inflammation', over two thirds were infected (73%). the commonest organisms isolated were gardnerella vaginalis and candida albicans. it would therefore appear to be worthwhile to treat patients who report severe inflammation with metronidazole and with anti-fungal pessaries  before the smear is repeated. following treatment two women went on to show dyskaryosis within five months. on colposcopy one of these women was found to have invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma. it is concluded that whether women with inflammatory smears are treated or not, it is mandatory to repeat the  smear, ideally within five months.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == routine screening for sexually transmitted diseases in new patients attending the genitourinary clinic in stoke-on-trent includes a culture for mycoplasma hominis  (mh) and ureaplasma urealyticum (uu). a retrospective study was carried out on 400 female patients to ascertain whether there were any significant differences between the group positive for mh and uu and the negative control group. the positive group were found to be younger on average, but to have similar sexual histories to the negative control group. an association was found between the presence of genital mycoplasmas and gardnerella vaginalis. an odourous vaginal discharge was more common in the positive group. erythromycin was ineffective in  eradicating the organisms in 62.5% of patients with mh, and 70% of those with uu. continuing work is required to identify those women in whom the presence of mh or uu could have pathogenic effects. treatment regimens for this group of women need to be carefully reassessed, in the light of increasing antibiotic resistance.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis in posthysterectomy infection.
AB  == eighty-six women were admitted for abdominal hysterectomy. preoperatively, 43 women were culture-positive for gardnerella vaginalis from the cervical os, and 43 women were culture-negative. postoperatively, 18 patients developed inflammation; among those 14 patients from the culture-positive group were infected, whereas only 4 patients from the culture-negative group developed inflammation. the difference between occurrence of g. vaginalis and the absence of the bacteria in patients with postoperative infection is highly significant. no such increased risk of postoperative infection was correlated to the isolation of any other microorganism looked for viz. aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, yeasts, viruses or chlamydiae. g. vaginalis may play a causative role in the development of posthysterectomy infection.

TI  == the role and prevalence of gardnerella vaginalis in anaerobic vaginosis.
AB  == 310 cases of anaerobic vaginosis and 80 asymptomatic females were studied for the detection of various organisms from their genital specimens. the main complaint of the symptomatic cases was vaginal discharge. neisseria gonorrhoeae, candida albicans, trichomonas vaginalis. bacteroides species, anaerobic cocci and gardnerella vaginalis were detected. the frequency of detection of all except c.  albicans was less in pregnant than non-pregnant women. however, the prevalence of anaerobes and g. vaginalis was significantly lower in both the symptomatic and asymptomatic pregnant than the non-pregnant women. g. vaginalis showed mutualism  with anaerobic bacteria and was not isolated as a pure culture in any of the cases. it appears that g. vaginalis, like anaerobes, has variable prevalence rates and is under the influence of local physiological and hormonal factors. this organism does not appear to have a primary pathogenic role, but assumes a secondary role in association with non-sporing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of anaerobic vaginosis.

AB  == to describe the microbiologic etiology of post-cesarean endometritis developing after perioperative cephalosporin prophylaxis, endometrial samples were obtained  from 27 women with a triple-lumen catheter. the women were assigned in a double-blind, randomized fashion to receive either ticarcillin/clavulanate, 3.1 g, or cefoxitin, 2 g, administered every six hours, until the clinical signs of infection resolved. a total of 149 microorganisms (84 facultative and 65 obligate anaerobes) were recovered from 26 women, for a mean of 5.5 isolates per specimen. one endometrial specimen was sterile. bacteroides and peptostreptococcus species  were the most frequent isolates, followed by gardnerella vaginalis, enterococcus, facultative gram-negative rods and mycoplasma hominis. each of the isolates was tested for beta-lactamase activity. at least one beta-lactamase-producing isolate was recovered from 56% of the specimens. susceptibility testing of endometrial isolates demonstrated that 96% of 118 potential pathogens (gardnerella, bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, enterococci and streptococci) were susceptible to ticarcillin/clavulanate. by comparison, 86% of these isolates were susceptible to cefoxitin in vitro. women who were treated with ticarcillin/clavulanate were less likely to have a temperature greater than 38 degrees c for two or more days  (8% vs. 57%, p = .01). also, there was a trend toward a decreased duration of uterine tenderness in the ticarcillin/clavulanate group, but it did not attain statistical significance (60% vs. 86%, p = .4). however, the overall clinical success rate with these single-agent treatments was not different for the two groups (77% vs. 79%, p = 1.0).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == ramoplanin is a novel lipoglycopeptide antimicrobial complex, isolated from the fermentation products of a strain of actinoplanes sp. (atcc 33076), which comprises three closely related polypeptides, each containing chlorinated phenyl  moieties and d-mannose. the in-vitro activity of ramoplanin was compared with those of vancomycin and teicoplanin. ramoplanin was very active against staphylococcus spp., irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, with all isolates inhibited by 1 mg/l or less. concentrations of vancomycin and teicoplanin required to inhibit the same population of bacteria were 4 and 16 mg/l, respectively. ramoplanin was also very active against streptococcus spp. (alpha- and beta-haemolytic species, str. pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis, corynebacterium spp. (including cory. jeikeium), listeria monocytogenes, gardnerella vaginalis, propionibacterium acnes and gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, with all isolates inhibited by 2 mg/l, or less. in general, the activity of ramoplanin against these species was either equal to or only slightly less than teicoplanin and equal to or somewhat greater than vancomycin. with the  exception of bacteroides melaninogenicus and bact. bivius, ramoplanin was not active against gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis as a risk factor for post-cesarean endometritis.
AB  == bacterial species associated with bacterial vaginosis have been isolated more frequently from endometrial cultures of patients with postpartum endometritis than expected from the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis among pregnant women. to further assess the association between bacterial vaginosis and postpartum endometritis, vaginal gram smears were obtained from women admitted for delivery. vaginal smears of women delivered by cesarean were scored as normal or as indicating bacterial vaginosis. factors related independently to postpartum endometritis by multiple logistic regression analysis included maternal age less  than 25 years, any duration of membrane rupture, and bacterial vaginosis. the unadjusted odds ratio for the development of postpartum endometritis associated with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio = 6.1, 95% confidence interval 3.3-15.9) was not appreciably changed in the multivariable analysis (odds ratio = 5.8, 95% confidence interval 3.0-10.9) after adjusting for maternal age, duration of labor, and duration of membrane rupture. at the time of endometritis, bacteroides sp, peptostreptococcus sp, and gardnerella vaginalis were isolated more frequently from the endometrium using a triple lumen endometrial sampling method  among patients with bacterial vaginosis than among those with a normal gram stain. bacterial vaginosis appears to be an important risk factor for postpartum  endometritis after cesarean delivery.

AB  == haemophilus ducreyi has traditionally been difficult to identify. we have utilized simple test methods to identify 19 fresh isolates obtained during a recent outbreak of chancroid in houston and six strains of h. ducreyi from other  outbreaks. tests were performed from growth on chocolate agar after 48 h of incubation at 35 degrees c with increased humidity and co2. all isolates exhibited typical colonial morphology and gram stain. isolates were catalase negative and oxidase and nitrate positive (in enriched broth). the rapid nh system failed to identify these strains because of negative reactions with alkaline phosphatase and nitrate reductase. however, by using the rapid-ana system, all strains were positive for alkaline phosphatase and arginine, glycine, and serine aminopeptidases. their biochemical profiles were distinct from those obtained with 66 strains representing 13 species similar to h. ducreyi. we also investigated the use of sodium polyanetholesulfonate (sps) disk susceptibility to identify and differentiate h. ducreyi from other species. all h. ducreyi isolates were susceptible, as evidenced by the presence of a zone of inhibition with an average size of 15 mm around the sps disk. with the exceptions of neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, and capnocytophaga spp., no other strain showed any evidence of inhibition. the latter three organisms can be easily differentiated from h. ducreyi by various features including reactions in the rapid-ana. we conclude that, by considering simple growth and biochemical characteristics, sps susceptibilities, and reactions in rapid-ana, it is possible for more clinical laboratories to definitively identify this organism.

AB  == seven hundred and ninety three women were investigated, aged between 16 and 78 years, to evaluate the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (bv) and some associated micro-organisms, and to discuss the significance of laboratory indices correlated to this pathology. bv was diagnosed on the basis of four distinct criteria: a positive result of the test for amines with 10% koh (odour-test), the presence of clue cells on fresh microscopic examination, a ph greater than 4.5 and direct gram stain positive (the presence of more than 40 gram negative or gram variable  coccobacilli per microscopic field by 1000 magnifications under oil immersion). the total prevalence of bv was 20.5% (163); similar percentages were found in both fertile and pregnant women, whereas a lower percentage (12.7%) was found in  menopausal women. gardnerella vaginalis was present in 235 (29.6%) of the 793 women, in 144 (88.3%) of the 163 with bv and in 91 (14.4%) of the 630 women without bv. mobiluncus species was present in 8.2% (65) of the total population,  in 38.6% (63) of the women with bv and only in two (0.3%) of the women without bv. in the women with bv lower percentages were found for trichomonas vaginalis,  yeasts, chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the absence of a definite relationship between bv and cultural isolation of g vaginalis is confirmed whereas the role played by mobiluncus spp still has to be clarified. it is concluded that it is not necessary to screen with all four laboratory indices. two positive indices from a panel of three (excluding ph greater than 4.5 and direct gram stain positive in the same panel) allows the correct diagnosis of bv  in almost all cases.

AB  == vaginitis is one of the most frequent infections of the female genital system and, in the united states, represents the main reason for gynecological consultation. candida albicans, trichomonas vaginalis and gardnerella vaginalis are responsible for 90% of cases of vaginal phlogosis. it has been calculated that a percentage varying between 5% and 40% of the female population will suffer, at least once in their lifetime, from an episode of vaginal candidosis. the re-appearance of symptoms after suspension of the antimycotic therapy still represents an unsolved and obscure problem from the etiopathogenetic point of view. the incidence of recurrences in women suffering from various forms of vaginal candidosis, according to the authors, is between 5% and 25%. considering  the uncertainties existing regarding the clinical and etiopathogenetic definition of recurrent vaginitis we carried out a perspective study, at the general out-patient department of the ii obstetrical and gynecological clinic of "la sapienza" rome university in collaboration with the bacteriological laboratory of the iii medical clinic of "la sapienza" rome university, on a group of 60 women suffering from recurrent vaginitis. we included in the study in the period 1 october 1987 - 30 september 1988 60 women reporting to the general out-patient department of the ii obstetrical and gynecological clinic of the "la sapienza" rome university. these patients complained about the appearance of a leukorrhea or a leukoxanthorrhea in combination with at least one of the following symptoms: burning sensation; itch; dyspareunia; dysuria; recurring cystitis. all the women  reported in their case histories having suffered from at least three episodes of  recurrent vaginal candidosis in the previous twelve months. diagnosis had been established on the basis of fresh microscopic examination with determination of the vaginal ph on the occasion of the first episode only; whereas clinical examination only was undertaken on the occasion of the subsequent ones. in 30% of patients (or 18 cases) the diagnosis of the subsequent episodes was "telephonic". in all cases, at each episode, a local therapy with antimycotic drugs had been prescribed. following the introduction of a sterile speculum sterile swabs were used to remove 2 samples of the fluid present at the level of the posterior vaginal fornix. the first swab was placed in a test-tube containing 2 ml of prereduced transport broth (brain-heart infusion broth oxoid) for the successive  aerobe and anaerobe cultures.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == vaginal microbial flora in women with and without vaginal discharge registered in general practice.
AB  == to compare the microbiological findings for patients with and without vaginal discharge, 29 general practitioners registered 361 women with and 229 women without complaints of vaginal discharge in a multi-practice study in the county of aarhus, denmark. in five of the patients (1.4%) with vaginal discharge, neisseria gonorrhoeae was isolated compared with one (0.4%) in women without vaginal discharge. chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 30 (8.3%) and nine (3.9) respectively, candida in 113 (31.3%) and 44 (19.2%), gardnerella vaginalis in 187 (51.8%) and 93 (40.6%), and trichomonas vaginalis in 10 (2.8%) and one (0.4%). the criteria of bacterial vaginosis were fulfilled by 129 (35.7%) women with vaginal discharge, and by 19 (8.3%) without symptoms. except for t. vaginalis and n. gonorrhoeae, the microorganisms were significantly (p less than 0.05) more frequent among patients with than without vaginal discharge. c. trachomatis was found in 25 (11%) women under the age of 25, compared to 14 (4%) aged 25 years or older (p less than 0.01). the isolation rates of the other microorganisms were not related to age. g. vaginalis was found in high concentrations in 73% of those harbouring this bacterium. no difference in concentration was found between women with and without vaginal discharge (p less than 0.05).

TI  == comparative in-vitro activity of meropenem on clinical isolates from the united kingdom.
AB  == mics of meropenem were determined for a wide range of common bacteria of clinical importance. for enterobacteriaceae, aeromonas spp., haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, campylobacter coli/jejuni, beta-haemolytic streptococci and anaerobes other than  clostridium difficile, mics were almost always within the range 0.002-0.5 mg/l. the activity of meropenem for these organisms was always greater than that of imipenem and piperacillin, and was similar to that of ceftazidime and cefotaxime  except that strains resistant to these latter, and to piperacillin, were usually  sensitive to imipenem and meropenem. meropenem was also active against most non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, with mics in the range 0.12-4 mg/l but pseudomonas (xanthomonas) maltophilia was often resistant, as it was to all the other drugs tested. staphylococci, strreptococcus pneumoniae and other alpha-haemolytic streptococci were usually more sensitive to imipenem than to meropenem, but even methicillin-resistant staphylococci were sensitive to both drugs (mics less than 4 mg/l). enterococci were also less sensitive to meropenem  than to imipenem, and enterococcus faecium was invariably highly resistant to all the drugs tested except ciprofloxacin, which had marginal activity. results for ps. maltophilia and haem. influenzae were affected by media used for sensitivity  testing.

TI  == evidence relating bacterial vaginosis to intraamniotic infection.
AB  == we performed a two-part study to determine relationships of bacterial vaginosis and intraamniotic infection. in the first part of the study, we determined whether bacterial vaginosis organisms (gardnerella vaginalis, mycoplasma hominis, and anaerobes) were associated with each other in the amniotic fluid of 408 cases of intraamniotic infection. in the second part, we determined the association of  bacterial vaginosis itself with intraamniotic infection in 125 cases at high risk for intraamniotic infection. strong associations were observed among the bacterial vaginosis organisms in amniotic fluid (p less than 0.01 to p less than  0.001). women with bacterial vaginosis were more likely to develop intraamniotic  infection than those without bacterial vaginosis (69% vs. 46%, p = 0.03). women with bacterial vaginosis were more likely to have g. vaginalis and m. hominis in  the amniotic fluid (p less than 0.01 and 0.04, respectively). these observations  implicate bacterial vaginosis as a cause of intraamniotic infection.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a common, non-inflammatory infection of the vagina. it is  characterised by the presence of a thin, homogenous, greyish-white discharge. the differential diagnosis includes infection with trichomonas vaginalis and candida  albicans. a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis may be made by the detection of three of the following: characteristic discharge, ph of 5 or greater, clue cells  and a positive koh amine test. culture of vaginal discharge is not necessary to effect a diagnosis. bacterial vaginosis responds readily to treatment with metronidazole at a dosage of 400 mg twice daily for seven days, although a proportion of patients suffer a recurrence of symptoms. treatment of sexual partners may be necessary in such cases. bacterial vaginosis results from the synergistic interaction of gardnerella vaginalis and obligate anaerobes, including bacteroides and mobiluncus species. the pathogenesis, laboratory diagnosis, treatment, and the mechanisms by which these organisms produce the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis are discussed.

TI  == clue cells in bacterial vaginosis: immunofluorescent identification of the adherent gram-negative bacteria as gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == clue cells are epithelial cells covered by adherent gram-negative rods, observed  in vaginal smears from women with bacterial vaginosis. immunofluorescence studies were used to identify the gram-negative bacteria adhering to clue cells. specific antisera to four common gram-negative vaginal bacteria (gardnerella, bacteroides, fusobacterium, and mobiluncus) were prepared by long-term, multiple, small-inoculum immunization of rabbits. cross-reactivity with heterologous common vaginal bacteria was removed by absorption against whole cells of heterologous bacteria and by serial dilution. gardnerella vaginalis was most often observed adhering to the surface of clue cells and was detected on the surface of exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells significantly more frequently and in higher numbers than were mobiluncus, bacteroides, and fusobacterium, suggesting that this species of gram-negative bacteria is responsible for clue cell formation.

TI  == should male consorts of women with bacterial vaginosis be treated?
AB  == nitroimidazoles have been shown to be the drugs of choice to treat women with bacterial vaginosis, but the recurrence rate is high. some workers have suggested that the recurrence of symptoms may in fact be reinfection by male consorts, but  no controlled studies have been undertaken to confirm this. in an international,  multicentre, randomised, double blind trial, the recurrence rate was studied in 241 women with a clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. all women were treated with 2 g metronidazole twice at an interval of two days. the patients were randomly allocated to two groups, one contained 123 women, whose consorts were given the same dose of metronidazole, the other consisted of 118 women whose consorts were given inert but identical placebo tablets. the women were evaluated at weeks 1, 4, and 12 after treatment. at week 1, the cure rate was 97% (115/119) in women whose consorts had been treated and 98% (111/113) in the others. at week 4 bacterial vaginosis had recurred in 17% (19/112) of women whose consorts had been treated and in 13% (14/106) of those whose consorts had received placebo. at week 12 the recurrence rates were 21% (20/95) in women with treated consorts, and 16% (15/95) in the others. the differences in recurrence rates between the two groups of women were not significant. in conclusion, treating the sexual partners of women with bacterial vaginosis does not seem to increase the cure rate.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis: etiology, association with preterm labor, diagnosis, and management.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is a polymicrobial condition (anaerobes, gardnerella vaginalis) that is associated with symptomatic vaginal discharge. bacterial vaginosis can be reliably diagnosed through clinical indicators such as clue cells on wet preparation of vaginal discharge, an increased ph of vaginal discharge, a fishy, amine odor emitted when a sample of vaginal discharge is placed in potassium hydroxide, and cultures that isolate g. vaginalis. the vaginal discharge is often heavy and foul smelling, and usually resolves when treated with metronidazole, 500 mg twice a day for seven days. it is unclear whether bacterial vaginosis is caused by g. vaginalis or whether g. vaginalis is  simply associated with the condition and its development is related to other factors. more importantly, the association of bacterial vaginosis with preterm labor (whether merely a risk factor or a causal factor) needs to be clarified, and the question of whether treatment of bacterial vaginosis in pregnancy will improve fetal outcome by decreasing prematurity needs to be addressed.

TI  == interstitial cystitis and the urethral syndrome: a possible answer.
AB  == a study was made of 20 patients fulfilling the criteria customarily used for the  diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. a possible infective aetiology was sought by  culture of bladder tissue, catheter and midstream specimens of urine, and urethral swabs by methods capable of detecting fastidious bacteria as well as aerobic pathogens. all bladder biopsies showed the histological appearances usually associated with interstitial cystitis, and bacteria were isolated from the catheter specimens and/or bladder biopsies of 12 patients. eight of these isolates were fastidious bacteria, gardnerella vaginalis (6) and lactobacillus sp. (2). fastidious bacteria were isolated from the midstream specimen of urine (msu) and/or urethral swab of 6 other patients. the correlation of the histological and bacteriological findings supports the hypothesis of an infective aetiology and suggests that the so-called urethral syndrome and interstitial cystitis may be the earlier and later stages of the same disease process. the importance of early diagnosis of infection in these patients is emphasised.

AB  == the haemophilus-neisseria identification (hnid) panel (american microscan, sacramento, calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of haemophilus and neisseria spp., branhamella (moraxella) catarrhalis, and gardnerella vaginalis. the hnid panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and hnid identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. in addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the hnid data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. the hnid panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 g. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28  neisseria lactamica strains and 48 b. catarrhalis strains. only 64.7% of 68 neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. among the haemophilus  spp., 98.8% of 83 h. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 h. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 h. aphrophilus and h. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. eight strains of neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for b. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae. isolates of other species not included in the data base, including eikenella corrodens, kingella spp., and cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique  biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species,  and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and  utility of the hnid panel.

TI  == chemotaxis inhibition by gardnerella vaginalis and succinate producing vaginal anaerobes: composition of vaginal discharge associated with g vaginalis.
AB  == the influence of six succinate producing vaginal anaerobes and gardnerella vaginalis on the chemotactic activity of granulocytes was studied by the under agarose method. g vaginalis, mobiluncus species, and three gram negative anaerobes elicited hardly any response, but peptostreptococcus productus showed clear positive chemotaxis, as did the escherichia coli strain used as a control.  inhibition of the chemotactic response of white blood cells was found with all strains, but the high succinate producers from the genus bacteroides showed the most pronounced effect. the inhibition of chemotaxis by succinate producing anaerobes in the pathogenesis of non-specific vaginitis (nsv) is postulated, and  b ureolyticus or mobiluncus spp, rather than g vaginalis, are suggested as possible causes of nsv.

TI  == evaluation and management of vaginitis. an update for primary care practitioners.
AB  == there are three major causes of vaginitis symptoms that primary care practitioners should be able to diagnose and treat expertly. recent investigations have shown that bacterial vaginosis, the most common cause of vaginitis symptoms in patients not seen in sexually transmitted disease clinics,  has a multifactorial etiology: gardnerella vaginalis is universally present but is not, per se, the etiologic agent. diagnosis and treatment are based, therefore, on evidence of a disturbed bacterial ecology as well as the presence of "clue" cells that indicate the presence of gardnerella. trichomonas vaginitis  is usually easy to diagnose, but treatment failures occasionally occur. some strains of trichomonas vaginalis may be relatively resistant to metronidazole, and short-course therapy may lead to reinfection from sexual partners. candida vulvovaginitis, the third major type of vaginitis, is not a sexually transmitted  disease and should be viewed as vaginal "thrush." earlier treatment regimens have been simplified by the introduction of more potent antifungals.

TI  == electron microscopy of adhesive interactions between gardnerella vaginalis and vaginal epithelial cells, mccoy cells and human red blood cells.
AB  == exfoliated vaginal epithelial cells with attached bacteria, termed 'clue cells',  which were procured from a patient with non-specific vaginitis, were stained with ruthenium red and examined by transmission electron microscopy. the attached bacteria appeared to adhere by means of an outer fibrillar coat. an epithelial tissue culture cell line (mccoy) and human red blood cells to which strains of gardnerella vaginalis attached were similarly examined. the adherence of g. vaginalis to the epithelial cell line appeared to be mediated by an outer fibrillar coat while adherence to red cells appeared to be mediated by fimbriae.  transmission electron microscopy was performed on the gardnerella strains used. thin sections of tissue-culture-adherent strains revealed a dense outer fibrillar coat whereas the surface of the haemagglutinating strains showed fine fimbriae. negative staining of haemagglutinating strains demonstrated fimbriae on a minority of organisms.

TI  == prevalence of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus species in normal women and women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == a predominance of lactobacillus species in the vaginal flora is considered normal. in women with bacterial vaginosis, the prevalence and concentrations of intravaginal gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobes are increased, whereas the prevalence of intravaginal lactobacillus species is decreased. because some lactobacilli are known to produce hydrogen peroxide (h2o2), which can be toxic to organisms that produce little or no h2o2-scavenging enzymes (e.g., catalase), we  postulated that an absence of h2o2-producing lactobacillus species could allow an overgrowth of catalase-negative organisms, such as those found among women with bacterial vaginosis. in this study, h2o2-producing facultative lactobacillus species were found in the vaginas of 27 (96%) of 28 normal women and 4 (6%) of 67 women with bacterial vaginosis (p less than 0.001). anaerobic lactobacillus species (which do not produce hydrogen peroxide) were isolated from 24 (36%) of 67 women with bacterial vaginosis and 1 (4%) of 28 normal women (p less than 0.001). the production of h2o2 by lactobacillus species may represent a nonspecific antimicrobial defense mechanism of the normal vaginal ecosystem.

TI  == effect of low-dose oral contraceptives on natural killer cell activity.
AB  == several reports indicate an association between oral contraceptives and increased infection rates. one mechanism that could explain this increased infection rate is a decrease in immune function. a study comparing t cell subsets showed no differences in numbers between oral contraceptive users and controls. in this study, natural killer cell activity was compared in women before and 3 and 6 months after oral contraceptive use. there was a statistically significant decrease in nk cell activity after three months. there was no further decrease by six months and the differences were no longer significant due to greater variability. no infections were reported during the study period. thus, the observed reduction in nk activity was either physiologically insignificant or the previously reported increase in infections may be the result of non-immunological factors.

TI  == roxithromycin. a review of its antibacterial activity, pharmacokinetic properties and clinical efficacy.
AB  == roxithromycin is an acid-stable orally administered antibacterial macrolide structurally related to erythromycin. it has an in vitro antibacterial profile similar to that of erythromycin, with activity against staphylococcus aureus, s.  epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, branhamella catarrhalis, mycoplasma pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, chlamydia trachomatis, gardnerella vaginalis, haemophilus ducreyi, some anaerobes and other less common pathogens. roxithromycin has a pharmacokinetic profile that is characterised by excellent enteral absorption achieving high concentrations in most tissues and body fluids. the results of clinical studies with roxithromycin have confirmed the potential for its use in a variety of infections, which was suggested by its antibacterial  activity in vitro and pharmacokinetic profile. clinical efficacy has been confirmed in the treatment of respiratory tract infections, including community-acquired and atypical pneumonias, ear, nose and throat infections, genitourinary tract infections, and skin and soft tissue infections. in a relatively small number of patients roxithromycin has generally been shown to be  as effective as erythromycin and other appropriate antibacterial drugs in some of the above indications. roxithromycin is well tolerated and has less potential than erythromycin to produce clinically significant drug interactions. thus, roxithromycin is an orally active drug which should prove a useful alternative when selecting antibacterial therapy for indications where macrolides are appropriate.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis is not a simple ecological disorder.
AB  == eighty-four patients with bacterial vaginosis were examined in an open randomized trial, the aim of which was to define clinical results and the microbiological panorama after topical treatment for 1 week with either an acetic acid jelly (a), an estrogen cream (b), a fermented milk product (c) or metronidazole (d). after exclusion because of chlamydia infection (15 cases) or for other reasons, 61 cases remained for complete evaluation 4 weeks after the start of treatment. clinical cure was obtained in 3 cases out of 17 on regimen a, in 1 out of 16 on regimen b, in 1 of 14 on regimen c, and in 13 out of 14 on regimen d. the patients were conclusively either symptomless or symptomatic when examined on 113 occasions. statistically significant reduction after treatment resulting in relief of symptoms was observed in the numbers of corynebacteria and anaerobic cocci, whereas lactobacilli increased in numbers. the instillation of high numbers of lactobacillus acidophilus (c) into the vagina cured only 1 patient and did not influence the predominance of lactobacilli in the vagina at the follow-up examination. the difference in microbiological profile of women in symptomatic and asymptomatic conditions becomes still more apparent when the results of the present and previously published studies on the subject by the present group of investigators are combined. the symptomatic woman is significantly more often harboring corynebacteria, gardnerella vaginalis, peptostreptococci, peptococci, eubacteria and bacteroides species. lactobacilli are significantly reduced in numbers. however, only 51% of our previously symptomatic, but now symptomless women show predominant growth of lactobacilli, which is less than expected for healthy women.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a case-control study of chorioamnionic infection and histologic chorioamnionitis  in prematurity.
AB  == to study the role of infection in prematurity, we studied the demographic and obstetrical characteristics, chorioamnionic cultures, and placental histologic features of women who delivered prematurely and compared these findings with those in women who delivered at term. microorganisms were isolated from the area  between the chorion and the amnion (chorioamnion) in 23 of 38 placentas (61 percent) from women with preterm labor who delivered before 37 weeks' gestation and in 12 (21 percent) of 56 placentas from women without preterm labor who delivered at term (odds ratio, 5.6; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.1 to 15.6). the most frequent isolates from the placentas of those whose infants were delivered prematurely were ureaplasma urealyticum (47 percent) and gardnerella vaginalis (26 percent). the recovery of any organism from the chorioamnion was strongly associated with histologic chorioamnionitis (odds ratio, 7.2; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.7 to 19.5) and with bacterial vaginosis (odds ratio, 3.2;  95 percent confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.6). when multiple logistic regression was used to control for demographic and obstetrical variables, premature delivery was still related to the recovery of organisms from the chorioamnion (odds ratio, 3.8; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.5 to 9.9) and with chorioamnionitis (odds  ratio, 5.0; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.6 to 15.3). the proportion of placentas with evidence of infection was highest among those who delivered at the lowest gestational age. we conclude that infection of the chorioamnion is strongly related to histologic chorioamnionitis and may be a cause of premature birth.

AB  == one thousand consecutive women who attended the richmond family planning association clinic and who were to undergo a vaginal examination were asked to participate in a large prospective microbiological study. participants were questioned about their sexual activity during the previous 12 months and any apparent signs of sexually transmitted disease. on examination the cervix was inspected for evidence of inflammation, ectopy or discharge and cervical swabs were taken microbiological assessment. chlamydia trachomatis was isolated in 5.1% of women tested while ureaplasma urealyticum and mycoplasma hominis were found in 48.8% and 16.4% of women respectively. significant associations were found between the number of sexual partners during the previous 12 months and the incidence of all 3 organisms. the carriage rate of the genital mycoplasmas was significantly affected by the type of contraception. in addition the association  between the presence of the genital mycoplasmas and pelvic and cervical abnormalities was determined.

AB  == the in vitro activity of the new macrolide azithromycin and erythromycin against  haemophilus ducreyi, gardnerella vaginalis, bacteroides spp. and mobiluncus spp.  was compared. gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus spp. and haemophilus ducreyi were highly susceptible to both agents but azithromycin was more effective overall against all three groups of organisms. the activity of both antibiotics against bacteroides spp. varied greatly, but azithromycin was again more active. collectively, 62% of all bacteroides strains were susceptible to erythromycin (mic 1 mg/1) and 74% were susceptible to azithromycin.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (nonspecific vaginitis) is a polymicrobial, superficial vaginal infection caused by an increase in anaerobic organisms and a concomitant  decrease in lactobacilli. gardnerella vaginalis, once thought to be the sole etiologic agent, is probably one of several endogenous members of the vaginal flora that overgrow in women with bacterial vaginosis. whether the growth of anaerobes or a primary decrease in lactobacilli is the initial pathogenic event remains unclear. epidemiological studies have revealed that current or previous infections caused by trichomonas organisms, increased sexual activity, and intrauterine device use are risk factors for this condition. studies have indicated that bacterial vaginosis, previously thought to be a benign illness, is associated with some morbidity in pregnant women. symptoms remain unreliable in the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis. diagnostic efficacy is best achieved by utilizing clinical signs. assessment of cure is best accomplished by gram stain,  not clinical criteria. metronidazole, 500 mg orally for seven days, remains the treatment of choice; however, a 2-g single dose of metronidazole represents a reasonable alternative if cost and compliance issues predominate in a clinical situation. although a recent study supports the contention that treatment of the  male sexual partner of women with bacterial vaginosis is effective, a general recommendation cannot be made with confidence on the issue of sexual partner treatment until other supporting work is done.

TI  == [genital infections and the course of pregnancy: a prospective study].
AB  == the reported study investigates the relationship of genital infections, pathobiochemical findings and demographic data to preterm labor, premature rupture of membranes (prom) and premature delivery. the predictability of chorioamnionitis, puerperal and neonatal infections by these parameters was evaluated concurrently. 301 patients were included in this study between july 1985 and june 1986. 147 of these patients were studied longitudinally during pregnancy, delivery and puerperium (longitudinal group). a second group consisted of 154 women who presented themselves on start of labor to the labor and delivery unit of our department (peripartal group). the incidence of preterm labor and of  prom was 26%. the incidence of premature delivery, chorioamnionitis, puerperal and neonatal infection was 11.4%, 5.5%, 7.6% and 3% respectively. cervical colonization with mycoplasma hominis correlated positively with prom (relative risk 2.2), premature delivery (3.9) and neonatal infection (6.9). chorioamnionitis, premature delivery and puerperal infection were also significantly increased in patients with positive vaginal ureaplasma urealyticum  cultures during pregnancy and delivery. premature delivery (2.8) and puerperal infection (4.0) were associated with a vaginal group b-streptococci (gbs) colonization during pregnancy, as was a positive gbs culture during delivery associated with puerperal infection. bacterial vaginosis also correlated positively with premature delivery (5.6) and puerperal infection. preterm labor correlated negatively with the socioeconomic level, prom correlated negatively with the marital status, positively with age, a history of cervical cerclage, conization or prom during former pregnancies. sexual intercourse more often than  once weekly during the last month of pregnancy was also associated with an increased number of prom. gardnerella vaginalis, candida and trichomoniasis during pregnancy and delivery were associated with preterm labor and puerperal infections. levels of maternal plasma fibrinogen concentrations in patients with  prom were elevated 48 hours after delivery in accordance to the characteristics of acute phase proteins. in contrast, the maternal pmn-granulocyte-elastase concentration was significantly elevated at time of delivery and 24 hours thereafter in those patients who developed puerperal infections. the derived positive predictive value was 26%, the negative 94.7%, respectively. the overall  accuracy of the prediction was 83.1%. six out of seven mothers with neonates treated because of neonatal infection showed significantly elevated plasma concentration of pmn-granulocyte-elastase.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis is associated with other sexually transmittable microorganisms in the male urethra.
AB  == in a prospective study, urethral swabs were taken from 544 men presented to an std clinic, 118 with and 426 without urethritis, and examined by microscope and/or culture for g. vaginalis, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, candida species and trichomonas vaginalis. g. vaginalis was isolated from 4.2% of the males with urethritis and from 6.3% of those without urethritis. using loglinear analysis, the following associations were significant (p less than 0.05): three-way: g. vaginalis, u. urealyticum, c. trachomatis; two-way: g. vaginalis, u. urealyticum and g. vaginalis, m. hominis and u. urealyticum, m. hominis. it is concluded that g. vaginalis is associated with genital mycoplasmas not only in the female, but also in the male urogenital tract.

AB  == midstream urine samples from 106 patients presenting to the casualty department of the royal melbourne hospital with frequency or dysuria were cultured for gardnerella vaginalis and conventional uropathogens. urine samples collected via  an open-end catheter from 70 healthy pregnant women were examined similarly. midstream urine and other samples, including the seminal fluids and swabs of the  mouths, throats, rectums, and vaginas of 33 healthy subjects, were cultured for g. vaginalis. another 15 female patients with proven g. vaginalis bacteriuria were given a bladder washout localization test to determine the site of infection in the urinary tract. g. vaginalis in counts greater than 10(3) cfu/ml was recovered from the midstream urine of 27 of 106 patients (25%), 7 of whom also harbored conventional pathogens in counts greater than 10(4) cfu/ml. another 11 patients with cultures negative for g. vaginalis yielded greater than 10(4) cfu of conventional pathogens per ml. g. vaginalis was cultured (greater than 10(3) cfu/ml) from catheter samples of 19 of 70 healthy pregnant women (27%), 6 of whom also harbored greater than 10(3) cfu of conventional uropathogens per ml. two women yielded growths of conventional pathogens only. midstream urine samples from 13 of 13 healthy males were free of g. vaginalis, whereas 5 of 20 healthy nonpregnant females yielded greater than 10(3) cfu of g. vaginalis per ml from midstream urine samples. g. vaginalis was recovered from 4 of 12 semen samples and from urethral samples from four of seven males and four of eight females. all four culture-positive females also harbored g. vaginalis in their vaginas. there  was no evidence of oral or rectal carriage of g. vaginalis in 15 healthy subjects. localization studies with 15 female patients having underlying renal disease showed that 11 patients harbored g. vaginalis in their kidneys. the result suggest that colonization or infection of the bladder and upper urinary tract by g. vaginalis is very largely a phenomenon of females, with the highest frequency in pregnant women. the prevalence of g. vaginalis in the urinary tracts of healthy females is similar to that of symptomatic subjects. however, g. vaginalis in counts greater than 10(5) cfu/ml is more likely to be associated with urinary tract symptoms. in males, this bacterial species infects the genital tract rather than the urinary tract.

TI  == a 24 hour plastic envelope method for isolating and identifying gardnerella vaginalis (pem-gva)
AB  == a new plastic envelope culture test that is selective for gardnerella vaginalis was compared with a conventional method. vaginal specimens from 92 women were cultured. results from both methods were compared with the results of pelvic examinations and clinic screening tests used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis (bv). g vaginalis was isolated more often in the envelope than by the conventional method from patients with bv and those without, though the difference was not significant. isolation and identification of g vaginalis was completed in 18-24 hours by the envelope method; the conventional method took a mean of 72 hours (range two to six days). polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmnls) occurred significantly more in specimens from the patients without bv than from those with bv. both clue cells and a positive amine test reaction were found significantly more in specimens from patients with bv than from those without bv. clue cells and g vaginalis isolation correlated best with bv (in 47 women), followed by clue cells and positive amine test results (in 39). adherence of g vaginalis in the envelope also correlated more with bv, clue cells, and positive  amine test results (32) than with patients without bv (14). when there were no clue cells and amine test results were negative the results correlated totally with a prediction of no bv. the use of the rapid envelope culture test would have confirmed bv in 20% of the cases where clue cell and amine test results were discordant.

TI  == clinical and laboratory findings in women with bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis versus controls.
AB  == we report comprehensively on the clinical and laboratory findings in 30 women with bacterial vaginosis (bv), 30 with vaginal trichomoniasis and 30 with normal  secretions. women with trichomoniasis were more often divorced (chi 2 test, p much less than 0.001), more often complained of dyspareunia (chi 2 test, p less than 0.05), frequently had discharge present in the vaginal vestibule, and showed one or more signs of vaginitis in half the cases. a 'moth-eaten' cervix was seen  in only four women (13%) with trichomoniasis, but can be considered pathognomonic of the condition. while the main characteristics of vaginal secretions, i.e. amount, consistency, colour, absence or presence of gas and odour, are only poorly discriminative between bv and trichomoniasis, they can be of much help in  distinguishing between 'abnormal' and--probably--normal secretions. parabasal cells were found in the wet mount of 19 women (73%) with trichomoniasis. epithelial cell clusters were a prominent finding in controls but were virtually  absent in the other two groups. we detected curved rods in 15 women (50%) with bv, but in none of the women with trichomoniasis or normal secretions. there were only minor differences in the results of bacterial cultures in cases of bv and trichomoniasis. bacteroides and peptostreptococcus species were the predominant anaerobes in both groups. gardnerella vaginalis was significantly more often isolated from women with bv than from controls (chi 2 test for trend, p less than 0.001). gas-liquid chromatography showed the presence of succinate in only two cases of bv. lactate was found in all controls but one. ethylation of vaginal samples probably reduces the risk of over-emphasizing the presence of succinate and lactate. it is concluded that bv and trichomoniasis are both characterized by the overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and that there is a considerable overlap in  clinical and laboratory findings. microscopy of the wet mount should be considered the most powerful diagnostic tool.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis in virginal and sexually active adolescent females: evidence  against exclusive sexual transmission.
AB  == sixty-eight sexually active and 52 virginal asymptomatic adolescent girls were evaluated for bacterial vaginosis and various laboratory indicators of bacterial  vaginosis in a 3-month observational noninterventive study. sixteen of 120 (13%)  subjects had bacterial vaginosis during the study. there was no significant difference in the prevalence of bacterial vaginosis or in the prevalence of isolation of gardnerella vaginalis between the sexually active and virginal groups. only a few cases of bacterial vaginosis (one of eight), wet mount clue cells (four of 11), sniff tests (two of eight), and abnormal vaginal fluid succinate/lactate ratios (none of 6) persisted for 3 months in the absence of therapy. these results are discussed in light of several recent reports that suggest using the isolation of g. vaginalis or the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis as evidence of sexual abuse in children. it is concluded that bacterial vaginosis should not be considered an exclusively sexually transmitted disease. the presence of the condition is neither proof of sexual activity nor warrants male sexual partner therapy. in addition, therapy seems unwarranted for the incidental finding of bacterial vaginosis in the patient without symptoms.

TI  == diagnosis and clinical manifestations of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == among 640 randomly selected women who were attending a sexually transmitted disease clinic and did not have trichomoniasis, 33% had bacterial vaginosis as defined by a composite of four clinical criteria: (1) vaginal discharge was homogeneous; (2) vaginal discharge had a ph greater than or equal to 4.7; (3) vaginal discharge had an amine-like odor when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide; (4) vaginal discharge contained clue cells representing greater than or equal to  20% of vaginal epithelial cells. previously published gram stain criteria for bacterial vaginosis correlated better than results of semiquantitative cultures for gardnerella vaginalis with presence or absence of clue cells and with composite clinical criteria. of 293 women with bacterial vaginosis by gram stain  criteria, 65% had symptoms of increased vaginal discharge and/or vaginal malodor, while 74% had signs of characteristic homogeneous vaginal discharge or amine-like odor. elevated vaginal ph was the least specific and amine-like odor the least sensitive sign of bacterial vaginosis. gram stain criteria for bacterial vaginosis were not associated with the concentrations of endocervical or vaginal  inflammatory cells but were significantly associated with a clinical diagnosis of pelvic inflammatory disease. after adjusting for coinfection, sexual behavior, and other variables, bacterial vaginosis remained associated with adnexal tenderness (odds ratio = 9.2, p = 0.04). bacterial vaginosis, previously implicated as a risk factor for obstetric infections, may be a risk factor for pelvic inflammatory disease.

AB  == a prospective study was performed involving 101 women who consecutively attended  a primary health care unit for complaints of genital malodour and/or abnormal vaginal discharge. bacterial vaginosis was diagnosed in 34 women on the basis of  four diagnostic criteria: vaginal ph greater than 4.7, homogeneous vaginal discharge, a positive amine test and clue cells. the sensitivity of these criteria was greater than 90% except for homogeneous discharge (82%). their specificity was greater than 90% except for vaginal ph greater than 4.7 (46%); a  specificity of 87% could have been achieved by using the criterion for vaginal ph greater than or equal to 5.0. there was a strong association between diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis and the concomitant occurrence of gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus spp. and bacteroides spp. there was no difference between women with or without bacterial vaginosis as regards contraception methods (except for use of an intrauterine device), age at first intercourse, or earlier episodes of vaginal discharge. sexual transmission of the predominant bacteria was not supported by data collected from the male consorts.

TI  == isolation of gardnerella vaginalis in pure culture from the uterine cavity of patients with irregular bleedings.
AB  == hysterectomy was performed in three patients because of persistent irregular vaginal bleeding. before the operation samples were taken from the cervical os for cultivation of gardnerella vaginalis, yeasts, viruses, chlamydia trachomatis, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. immediately after the operation, the uterus was opened under sterile conditions and samples obtained from the isthmus and fundus of the uterine cavity were examined microbiologically. in all three patients g. vaginalis was grown in pure culture from the fundus. serum antibody titres against g. vaginalis were significantly raised in all three patients, and  histology revealed mononuclear cells in the endometrium. the isolation of g. vaginalis from the endometrium of patients with clinical and histological signs of inflammation and with antibodies to g. vaginalis in serum indicates that the organism may play a causative role in endometritis.

TI  == cervical mosaic and an integrated pathophysiological approach to early cervical neoplasia.
AB  == the increasing concern for the early detection and treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) set up the basis for this study, which also considers some epidemiological factors which seem to be related to the genesis of an abnormal uterine cervical colposcopic pattern, the mosaic pattern. we have observed that women with a mosaic pattern show an increasing frequency of premalignant and/or malignant histologic changes up to 40 years of age which then falls abruptly. sterility and hirsutism were frequent associations, these features suggesting an abnormal hormonal status. an association with infection by gardnerella vaginalis (15.3%) was noted, and dysplasia increased in frequency to  53% when g. vaginalis was associated with mosaic. also, 67.25% of women with mosaic showed other concomitant diseases of allergic, immunologic, or infectious  type. based upon these observations, and in an attempt to explain further interrelationships among several factors in the pathogenesis of cin, an integrated hypothesis which may lead to new therapeutic avenues, both in the prevention and treatment of early cervical cancer, is advanced.

TI  == controlled evaluation of trypticase soy broth with and without gelatin and yeast  extract in the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == the addition of gelatin to blood culture media has been suggested to prevent the  inhibition of neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, gardnerella vaginalis, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius that is caused by sodium polyanetholsulfonate. to determine the effect of such supplementation on the overall yield of microorganisms, we compared the yield and speed of detection of  clinically important microorganisms from 5422 paired 10-ml samples of blood cultured in trypticase soy broth (tsb) containing 0.03% sodium polyanetholesulfonate (sps) and tsb/sps containing 1.2% gelatin and 1.0% yeast extract (mtsb). the atmosphere of incubation (open venting unit) and ratio of blood to broth (1:5) were the same for both samples. only cultures with adequate  blood sample (greater than or equal to 80% of stated volume) were compared statistically. addition of gelatin and yeast extract resulted in inhibited growth of enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001), pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.01), fungi (p less than 0.05), and the overall set of microorganisms encountered (p less than 0.001). it delayed growth of enterobacteriaceae (p less  than 0.001) but reduced the time to recover staphylococci (p less than 0.02). of  12 isolates of species usually inhibited by sps, seven grew only with the addition of gelatin and yeast extract, none grew only without supplementation, and five grew in both media. although gelatin and yeast extract may improve the yield of some specific bacteria, the routine use of these additives cannot be recommended for all blood culture media.

TI  == controlled evaluation of modified radiometric blood culture medium supplemented with gelatin for detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  == although the addition of 1.2% gelatin to broth blood culture media containing sodium polyanetholesulfonate has been shown to enhance detection of certain bacteria, including neisseria meningitidis, n. gonorrhoeae, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and gardnerella vaginalis, the effect of such supplementation on the  detection of other microorganisms causing bacteremia and fungemia is not known. therefore, we studied bactec 6b medium with and without gelatin in 6,833 paired comparisons to examine the effects of supplementation on both the yield and the speed of detection of sepsis. more aerobic and facultative bacteria grew in the 6b than in the 6b-gelatin medium (p less than 0.001), especially staphylococci (p less than 0.01), escherichia coli (p less than 0.01), other members of the family enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.05), and acinetobacter spp. (p less than 0.05). when microorganisms grew in both bottles, they did so earlier in 6b than in 6b-gelatin (p less than 0.001). we conclude that the 6b medium in its present formulation is superior to 6b medium supplemented with 1.2% gelatin.

TI  == haemagglutination and tissue culture adhesion of gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == six strains of gardnerella vaginalis were studied to examine the adhesin-receptor mechanism involved in their attachment to human red blood cells and an epithelial tissue culture cell line (mccoy). the adhesins involved in the attachment of the  bacteria to each of these cells were proteinaceous but showed marked differences  after various chemical or physical treatments, indicating that separate adhesins  were present. haemagglutinating strains were more hydrophobic than tissue-culture-adherent strains. haemagglutination of human red blood cells by strains of g. vaginalis was inhibited by galactose, lactose, n-acetylneuraminic acid and phosphatidylserine. in contrast, the tissue-culture adherence of strains was not inhibited by these substances.

TI  == microbiologic and serologic studies of gardnerella vaginalis in intra-amniotic infection.
AB  == our objective was to investigate the role of gardnerella vaginalis in intra-amniotic infection by use of comparative, quantitative cultures on selective media and by detection of maternal antibody response. amniotic fluid was collected from patients with intra-amniotic infection and from matched control women. in addition to media for aerobes, anaerobes, and mycoplasmas, we used v agar-selective (remel, lenexa, ks) to isolate g vaginalis. acute and convalescent maternal sera were collected and assayed for antibodies by a microenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) prepared against whole cells of g  vaginalis. gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in the amniotic fluid of 24 (28%) of the 86 patients with intra-amniotic infection, but this was not significantly  different from the isolation rate in amniotic fluid of 86 matched controls (21%). no patient exhibited g vaginalis bacteremia. the elisa performed on paired sera of selected patients showed that 25 had intra-amniotic infection (eight g vaginalis-positive, 17 negative), and 18 were asymptomatic (seven g vaginalis-positive, 11 negative). the amount of g vaginalis antibodies detected by elisa in acute sera was similar in all four groups. mean changes during convalescence were small (.053-.084 optical density units) and not significantly  different. although g vaginalis is found commonly in amniotic fluid of patients with intra-amniotic infection, the data do not support a pathogenic role for this organism; however, a facilitating role in polymicrobial infection cannot be excluded.

AB  == non-specific vaginitis is a commonly diagnosed condition defined in a similar manner by most authors. although assumed to be of infective aetiology, no single  organism has yet been accepted as the primary agent. this syndrome was studied in two groups of women presenting to general practitioners or attending a family planning clinic. the two groups were of similar ages and had similar markers of sexual activity. of the 173 women studied, 90 had symptoms. of the symptomatic women 9.5% could be categorized as having non-specific vaginitis and 36.7% as having an alternative cause for their discharge. gardnerella vaginalis were found to be associated with anaerobes, clue cells and staphylococci more frequently than by chance.the isolation of g. vaginalis or anaerobes was assessed for their  ability to help confirm the diagnosis of non-specific vaginitis and to distinguish this from other possible pathology. in patients with clinical non-specific vaginitis, the isolation of g. vaginalis proved the most sensitive (100%) though not a very specific (77.4%) indicator, whereas anaerobes were more  specific (93.2%). the presence of anaerobes was a better predictor of non-specific vaginitis (30.8%) than g. vaginalis (18.9%). it was concluded that providing laboratory facilities specifically for the isolation of g. vaginalis would be of little benefit to the general practitioner in diagnosing non-specific vaginitis since it would add to the cost of processing specimens, whereas reporting the presence of heavy growths of anaerobes provides some confirmation and adds little to the cost.

TI  == in vitro adhesiveness and biotype of gardnerella vaginalis strains in relation to the occurrence of clue cells in vaginal discharges.
AB  == haemagglutination and tissue culture adherence tests using a mccoy cell line were used to examine the adherence characteristics of 105 strains of gardnerella vaginalis. each strain represented one isolate per patient. for each patient, a direct smear of vaginal discharge was examined for clue cells. the relation between in vitro adherence and the presence of clue cells was examined. there seemed to be no appreciable relation between the presence of clue cells in smears and the haemagglutinating activity of strains. in contrast, adherence as judged by the mccoy tissue culture system showed a significant relation to the presence  of clue cells (p less than 0.001). though both adhesive characteristics were not  inhibited by mannose, the mechanism of haemagglutination of human red cells appeared to differ from that of adherence of tissue culture cells. the findings imply that the clue cell phenomenon is due to attachment of adherent strains of g vaginalis to epithelial cells. adherent strains of g vaginalis may play a part in the pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin in the treatment of soft tissue pelvic infections.
AB  == the clinical efficacy and safety of ampicillin/sulbactam versus metronidazole-gentamicin were evaluated in a comparative, randomized, prospective study. forty-four patients were enrolled: 22 received the ampicillin/sulbactam regimen, and 22 received the metronidazole-gentamicin combination. there were 33  cases of severe acute pelvic inflammatory disease, two tuboovarian abscesses, five cases of endomyometritis, and two cases of posthysterectomy pelvic cellulitis. aerobic and anaerobic cultures from the infection sites yielded 447 microorganisms from 44 patients (an average of 10 bacteria per infection; 6.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). the most frequent isolates were bacteroides sp., 54;  bacteroides bivius, 17; black-pigmented bacteroides, 12; bacteroides disiens, 11; fusobacterium, 13; peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 24; peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, 21; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 34; gardnerella vaginalis, 29; neisseria gonorrhoeae, 17; alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 15; and escherichia  coli, five. clinical cure was noted in 19 of 20 patients treated with ampicillin/sulbactam and 18 of 21 patients treated with metronidazole-gentamicin. one treatment failure occurred in the ampicillin/sulbactam group in a patient who required antichlamydial therapy and had a complex left adnexal mass consistent with an abscess. the cases of metronidazole-gentamicin failure included two patients initially diagnosed as having tuboovarian abscesses who required a change in antibiotic therapy to control the infections. the third patient had postabortion endomyometritis that did not respond to metronidazole-gentamicin therapy within 48 hours, and required a change of medication. no adverse hematologic, renal, or hepatic effects were noted in either group of patients.

AB  == a clinical evaluation of the vitek neisseria-haemophilus identification (nhi) card (vitek systems, inc., hazelwood, mo.) was performed with 480 clinical isolates and stock strains of neisseria spp., haemophilus spp., and other fastidious microorganisms included in the data base of the system. identifications obtained with the nhi card were compared with those determined by conventional methods. the card identified 83.2% of 244 neisseria spp. and branhamella catarrhalis, 54.9% of 164 haemophilus spp., and 84.7% of 72 fastidious gram-negative species with no further testing required. some isolates  produced good confidence-marginal separation identifications, in which the correct identification was listed with one or two other possible identifications  and extra tests were required and suggested. when isolates producing good confidence-marginal separation identifications were included, correct identifications of these organism groups increased to 97.1, 92.7, and 94.4%, respectively. among the commonly isolated microorganisms, the nhi card identified 99.1% of 110 n. gonorrhoeae, 98.5% of 68 n. meningitidis, 93.9% of 98 h. influenzae, and 95.6% of 46 h. parainfluenzae strains. all of these organisms produced excellent to very good confidence level identifications except for h. influenzae biotypes ii, iii, and vii, for which hemolytic reactions were required for differentiation from h. haemolyticus. the nhi card reliably identified other  fastidious gram-negative species, including h. aphrophilus, eikenella corrodens,  gardnerella vaginalis, and kingella denitrificans.

TI  == the role of vaginal secretory immunoglobulin a, gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, and chlamydia trachomatis in postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease.
AB  == in a prospective study of 129 women undergoing induced first-trimester abortion,  14 (10.9%) contracted postabortal pelvic inflammatory disease (pid). samples of vaginal secretion for quantitation of secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) as well as isolates from cervix/urethra for the culture of anaerobes and aerobes, including bacteroides fragilis et melaninogenicus and gardnerella vaginalis, were obtained at the preoperative visit. two blood samples from each woman with postabortal pid were analysed for antibodies against g. vaginalis. twenty-five per cent of women with a history of pid developed postabortal pid, and 25% with vaginitis contracted postabortal infection (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.005). twenty-five per cent of women harboring c. trachomatis at the time of abortion developed infection. the presence of anaerobes or g. vaginalis was not associated with the frequency of postabortal pid (all p-values greater than 0.1). one woman with postabortal pid produced a culture positive for g. vaginalis and a rise in specific antibody titer. the levels of vaginal siga were not significantly associated with a positive history of pid (p greater than 0.6), with postabortal pid (p greater than 0.4) or with the presence of anaerobes or g. vaginalis at the time of abortion (p greater than 0.3). however, significantly elevated levels of siga were found in women harboring c. trachomatis (p less than 0.05). thus, the study could not demonstrate any correlation between vaginal siga and pid, but increased siga in chlamydia-positive women. a history of pid and vaginitis entailed a significant risk of contracting postabortal pid.

TI  == non-specific vaginitis or vaginitis of undetermined aetiology.
AB  == vaginitis is a complex syndrome that is probably the most common outpatient disease seen by the gynaecologist. the specific aetiologies of vaginitis are many. one of the most common entities, however, is "non-specific vaginitis" which can be subdivided into: gardnerella vaginitis, anaerobic vaginosis, and vaginitis of undetermined aetiology. the role of gardnerella as a causative agent for vaginitis has been studied in depth but its specific role remains controversial.  anaerobic vaginosis can be diagnosed by noting on microscopic examination the presence of clue cells, free-floating bacteria and numerous white blood cells (wbc's). culturing an aliquot of the vaginal discharge reveals a high number of anaerobes. in addition, this condition responds to antibiotics effective against  anaerobes, e.g., metronidazole. vaginitis of undetermined aetiology is more complex and is characterized by a purulent vaginal discharge, a ph of 4.0-4.6, numerous wbc's, and a high concentration of bacteria. the microbiology of this vaginitis includes many facultative gram-negative rods and gram-positive cocci. anaerobes may be present but do not make up a large component of the endogenous microflora. this condition does not respond to the usual antibiotic therapies employed in treating bacterial vaginitis. since this condition appears to be primarily an inflammatory reaction, it may be responsive to topical antiinflammatory agents such as benzydamine.

AB  == the authors report the preliminary results of their investigation of the efficacy of benzydamine in the treatment of the so-called non-specific vaginitis. an initial in vitro study to test its bacteriostatic and/or bactericidal activity on gardnerella vaginalis showed that the drug has high activity even at the lowest concentrations, and completely inhibits this micro-organism at 1000 micrograms/ml which is the usual concentration employed in therapy. the first pilot study performed in vivo on 14 selected vaginitis cases which were found positive for g. vaginalis by culture test appears to confirm the therapeutic efficacy of benzydamine; however, this confirmation must await the results of a double-blind  clinical trial which is still in progress.

AB  == a study was made of the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin in comparison with that of erythromycin on selected recent clinical isolates of a wide range of organisms. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by an agar dilution method with an inoculum of 10(4) cfu. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) and the effect of ph were determined by a broth dilution method on selected strains. in general the in-vitro activity of roxithromycin mirrored that of erythromycin, but it was slightly less active. most strains of streptococci, with the exception of enterococci, were highly sensitive to roxithromycin, as were isolates of gardnerella vaginalis. branhamella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. staphylococci and enterococci were only moderately sensitive to both agents as was haemophilus influenzae. most anaerobic bacteria were sensitive although bacteroides fragilis, fusobacteria and some strains of some clostridial species were moderately resistant. the mbcs were usually at least 16-fold higher than mics for most staphylococci, enterococci, alpha-haemolytic streptococci and b. fragilis; but for beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci, h. influenzae and b. catarrhalis the mbcs were usually only 2- to 4-fold higher than mics. roxithromycin was most active at ph 8 and generally for each unit fall in ph there was a 4-fold diminution of activity. however, the effect was less marked for pneumococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci and h. influenzae.

TI  == new developments in the etiology and pathogenesis of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is unlike the "classic" sexually transmitted diseases. unlike cervical infection with chlamydia or salpingitis caused by n. gonorrhoeae, no single etiologic agent has been identified, and the organisms which are associated with infection have all been found as members of endogenous vaginal flora, with the possible exception of mobiluncus species. if, as we suspect, bv is due to interactions among various organisms found in the vagina during vaginal health, we must determine what changes in the microbial or chemical ecology determine the development of bv. if, for instance, bv is simply due to an inversion in the concentrations of various organisms such that the anaerobes which are usually present in low numbers become predominant and the lactobacilli  which usually predominate become few in number, we must determine which causes what. that is, does some organism or environmental change allow the anaerobes to  overgrow and thereby inhibit the lactobacilli, or does some change inhibit the lactobacilli, thereby, allowing the other flora to overgrow? answers to questions such as these await further research.

TI  == [bacteriologic studies in premature rupture of fetal membranes and correlation with the clinical aspects of chorioamnionitis and the amnion infection syndrome].
AB  == one of the major complications following premature rupture of the membranes (prom) is ascending infection. in this aspect the bacteria of the vaginal flora play a major part. bacterial spectra of a group with prom and another control group with punctual rupture of the membranes are comparatively analysed. this analysis is based on swabs taken from vagina and newborns. data are interpreted in correlation to clinical picture of chorioamnionitis and amnion infection syndrome (ais). twelve newborns clinical suspected to have a neonatal infection are retrospectively judged. in the group with pregnant women with prom potential  pathological germs such as group b streptococci and e. coli are found more often, whereas physiological flora, specially lactobacillus species, are clearly reduced. in newborns with ais even germs can be detected, which so far have seemed to be more apathogenic, such as gardnerella vaginalis. bacteriological findings are discussed in connection with clinical parameters, specially group b  streptococci are looked at more precisely. in newborns with ais microbiological results are demonstrated including course of pregnancy and delivery. for the management of prom alternatives are shown and advice for prophylaxis is given.

TI  == metronidazole-containing vaginal sponges for the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == currently, there is no fda approved treatment for bacterial vaginosis (bv), although various oral dosages of metronidazole are used to treat this condition.  a vaginal therapeutic sponge (vli corporation) that releases metronidazole over a 24 h use period has been developed for the treatment of bv. each sponge contains  250 mg of metronidazole. the safety and effectiveness of using one or three metronidazole-containing vaginal sponges for the treatment of bv was evaluated in 40 patients. use of a single sponge resulted in a cure rate of 38.9%. with three  sponges the cure rate was 94.4%. cure was defined as the absence of signs and symptoms (vaginal discharge, elevated ph, koh prep odor, and 'clue' cells) at the one and four week follow-up visits. the sexual partners of most women were also treated with metronidazole (2 g po in one dose). none of the women were discontinued from treatment because of any adverse effects. side-effects were minimal and required no treatment. the cure rate with the three vaginal sponge dosage appears to be similar to that associated with oral dosages of metronidazole.

AB  == to assess the sensitivity of gardnerella vaginalis to the complement mediated bactericidal activity of serum, six laboratory strains were incubated with normal human serum and two strains freshly isolated from women with non-specific vaginitis (nsv) were each incubated with homologous patient serum. there was no significant difference between the number of organisms recovered from unheated or heat inactivated serum after incubation at 37 degrees c for one hour with any of  the strains tested. a suspension of g vaginalis incubated at 37 degrees c for one hour in heat inactivated homologous mouse antiserum with unheated normal human serum as a source of complement did not show any less viability than the control  mixture using heat inactivated human serum. in contrast, a serum resistant strain of neisseria gonorrhoeae incubated in heat inactivated homologous mouse antiserum with unheated normal human serum showed noticeably less viability than the control. g vaginalis therefore seems to be resistant to the bactericidal activity of both normal and immune serum.

AB  == when urine, which has been collected by suprapubic bladder aspiration, is appropriately cultured, asymptomatic bacteriuria due to fastidious organisms can  be detected quite commonly in apparently healthy pregnant women; ureaplasma urealyticum and gardnerella vaginalis can each be isolated from the bladder urine of 10 to 15% of subjects, other bacteria less frequently. both organisms are often present together, sometimes in addition to "conventional" urinary pathogens. overall bacteriuria occurs in about 25% of healthy pregnant women, including 6% with "conventional" asymptomatic bacteriuria. pyuria occurs in about one-third of patients with fastidious bacteriuria. bacteriuria due to fastidious  bacteria occurs significantly more commonly in selected groups of pregnant women. u. urealyticum or g. vaginalis or both can be isolated, generally in relatively high numbers from more than 70% of pregnant women with renal disease and 20 to 30% of those with preeclampsia. in a prospective study in which urine was collected using an open ended catheter, ureaplasmas were isolated 3 times more frequently from women less than 25 years of age than from older women. women with ureaplasma bacteriuria at the first antenatal visit were 3 times more likely to develop preeclampsia than those without, but the mean birth weights of the infants born to the two groups of women were not significantly different. further studies are required to determine the importance of these preliminary findings.

TI  == high-level tetracycline resistance in neisseria gonorrhoeae is result of acquisition of streptococcal tetm determinant.
AB  == recently, strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated which are highly resistant to tetracycline (mics of 16 to 64 micrograms/ml). this resistance was due to the acquisition of the resistance determinant tetm, a transposon-borne determinant initially found in the genus streptococcus and more recently in mycoplasma hominis, ureaplasma urealyticum, and gardnerella vaginalis. in n. gonorrhoeae, the tetm determinant was located on a 25.2-megadalton plasmid. this  plasmid arose from the insertion of tetm into the 24.5-megadalton gonococcal conjugative plasmid. the tetm determinant could be transferred to suitable recipient strains of n. gonorrhoeae by both genetic transformation and conjugation.

AB  == management of sexually transmitted diseases is facilitated by having antimicrobial agents with activity against all of the major genital pathogens. newer quinolones show promise of being active against neisseria gonorrhoeae and chlamydia trachomatis. two quinolones, difloxacin (a-56619) and a-56620, and an oral cephalosporin, cefixime (cl 284,635; fk 027), were evaluated in vitro. all three were highly active against 400 isolates of n. gonorrhoeae, including penicillinase-producing n. gonorrhoeae, n. gonorrhoeae with chromosomally mediated resistance, and isolates with penicillin mics of less than 1 microgram/ml. susceptibilities to one antimicrobial agent were usually strongly correlated with susceptibilities to the other antimicrobial agents evaluated, but isolates with increasing resistance to beta-lactams were least likely to show increasing resistance to quinolones. difloxacin and, to a lesser extent, a-56620  were active against all 10 strains of c. trachomatis, and both had moderate activity against over 200 strains of gardnerella vaginalis. based on in vitro activity, difloxacin and a-56620 merit in vivo assessment for management of both  c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae infections, and cefixime shows considerable promise for treatment of n. gonorrhoeae infections.

AB  == the in vitro activity of tetracycline, ciprofloxacin and two recently developed 1-aryl-fluoroquinolones, a56610 and a56620, was tested against 65 beta-lactamase-negative and 35 beta-lactamase-positive neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 12 chlamydia trachomatis, 50 mycoplasma hominis, 28 ureaplasma urealyticum and 50 gardnerella vaginalis strains. in the case of chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma hominis both the mic and the mbc were determined. the  mic90 of ciprofloxacin for neisseria gonorrhoeae was 0.008 microgram/ml and of a56619 and a56620 less than or equal to 0.03 microgram/ml. no difference was observed between the activity against beta-lactamase-negative and beta-lactamase-positive strains. the mic90 values of of ciprofloxacin and a56620  for chlamydia trachomatis, mycoplasma hominis and ureaplasma urealyticum were identical, the values being 2 micrograms/ml, 1 micrograms/ml and 4 micrograms/ml  respectively. the mic90 of a56619 for chlamydia trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum was 0.5 micrograms/ml and 1 microgram/ml respectively. the mbc90 values of the three quinolones for chlamydia trachomatis and mycoplasma hominis were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml. the activity of the quinolones against gardnerella vaginalis was rather low, the mic90 being greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. it is concluded that a56619 and a56620 might be useful  for single-dose therapy of gonococcal infections.

TI  == significance of gardnerella vaginalis in urine cultures.
AB  == during a 15-month period, 12,343 consecutive routine urine cultures from female patients were screened for the presence of gardnerella vaginalis. of the positive urine cultures, escherichia coli was found in 1,256 (57%) and presumptive g. vaginalis in 163 (5%). of the 163 presumptive g. vaginalis isolates, 115 were present in quantitative categories sufficient to suggest the diagnosis of probable urinary tract infection. of these 115 isolates, 92 were available for specific identification, of which 69 (75%) proved to be g. vaginalis. comparison  of clinical urinary tract diagnoses for the 69 g. vaginalis patients and a matched cohort of e. coli patients showed a significant correlation of e. coli recovery with the diagnosis of urinary tract infection and a significant correlation of g. vaginalis recovery with no urinary tract infection. g. vaginalis was frequently recovered from nonsymptomatic pregnant patients. g. vaginalis appeared at best to be an uncommon urinary tract pathogen.

AB  == in a 2-month prospective study of streptococci isolated from urine specimens in the laboratory, 242 strains of catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccobacilli were isolated in substantial numbers from 11,725 specimens. these comprised 10% of the important isolates. species identification of all isolates was undertaken. 74 (30%) of the isolates were of species other than streptococcus faecalis and s agalactiae. 79 (33%) were not detected on cysteine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient agar after overnight incubation in a carbon dioxide incubator. 20 of the 24 isolates of coccobacilli were gardnerella  vaginalis. many of the isolates of fastidious species were accompanied by pyuria. an isolation protocol practicable in busy laboratories is proposed.

TI  == quantitative studies of vaginal bacteria.
AB  == a quantitative method of culture, based on a weighed sample and with results expressed as colony forming units (cfu)/g was assessed and used to investigate the vaginal flora of normal women and that of women with vaginal disease. samples were collected by means of disposable plastic loops into modified proteose peptone water transport medium in preweighed bottles. counts expressed as cfu/g of secretion were consistent, whereas counts expressed as cfu/ml were inconsistent. results obtained with specimens manipulated on the open bench were  the same as those from duplicate samples processed in an anaerobic chamber. the normal vaginal flora was predominantly aerobic--lactobacilli, coryneforms, and coagulase negative staphylococci--with counts of greater than or equal to 10(8) cfu/g for lactobacilli. these were also present in patients with candidosis, but  the flora in patients with trichomoniasis, bacterial vaginosis, gonorrhoea, or chlamydial infection was predominantly anaerobic. the commonest anaerobes were bacteroides spp, particularly b bivius; they were found in 55% of controls but at counts of 10(2) cfu/g lower than in the patients, most of whom had high counts of anaerobes (greater than 10(8) cfu/g). the isolation rate of gardnerella vaginalis was not appreciably greater from patients with bacterial vaginosis, and the quantitative cultures on controls and patients who were g vaginalis positive were the same (approximately equal to 10(7) cfu/g). quantitative studies show greater  differences than qualitative cultures between normal controls and patients with vaginal infections, indicating that some symptoms and signs of such infections may be related to quantitative polymicrobial changes.

TI  == contribution of gardnerella vaginalis to vaginitis in a general practice.
AB  == in a study of 154 adult women who presented to their general practitioner with vaginal symptoms 30 (20%) had gardnerella vaginalis on its own and 51 (33%) had g vaginalis in combination with anaerobes or known pathogens. thirty one (20%) patients were culture negative. those who were culture negative had fewer symptoms and signs of vaginitis than those with g vaginalis alone or g vaginalis  plus anaerobes. those with known pathogens had more symptoms and signs than those with g vaginalis alone or g vaginalis plus anaerobes. those with known pathogens  plus g vaginalis had the most severe signs and symptoms of vaginitis. it is concluded that g vaginalis can cause vaginitis on its own, and it makes vaginitis worse when present with other organisms. g vaginalis was also found in 30 (21%) of the 138 control patients who, although they presented "asymptomatically," had  worse signs than control patients without g vaginalis. it seems that g vaginalis  can occur in a spectrum ranging from the uncomplaining patient to those with severe vaginitis.

AB  == transfundal endometrial cultures obtained from afebrile women who delivered vaginally were uniformly free of bacteria and contained ureaplasma urealyticum in only 2 of 14 women. a protected triple-lumen transcervical method to obtain an endometrial culture recovered organisms from 6 (43%) of the 14 women. compared with cultures from afebrile women, organisms were recovered from 51 (93%) of 55 febrile postpartum women by using the triple-lumen transcervical culture method (p less than .001). among febrile women there was a correlation between the recovery of group b streptococcus, enterococcus, gardnerella vaginalis, staphylococcus aureus, and anaerobic bacteria from the cervix and their recovery  from the endometrium. protected transcervical methods used to obtain postpartum endometrial cultures reduce cervical contamination, but semiquantitation of the culture is useful to further increase culture specificity.

AB  == sixty-eight sexually active and 52 virginal adolescent girls were evaluated for six sexually transmissible infectious agents: gardnerella vaginalis, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma hominis, chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae. there were significant differences between sexually active and virginal girls with respect to the prevalence of isolation of u urealyticum (75% v 33%, p less than .005), m hominis (27% v 10%, p less than .05), and c trachomatis (19% v 2%, p less than .025) but not for g vaginalis (34% v 17%, p = .09). n gonorrhoeae and t vaginalis were isolated exclusively from sexually active girls, but their low prevalence (6% and 9%, respectively) made the difference statistically insignificant (p = .2 and .06, respectively). race,  current v previous sexual activity, multiple sexual partners, oral contraceptive  use, and concurrent isolation of another organism did not identify those at increased risk for chlamydial isolation. such girls were significantly more likely to have inflammatory papanicolaou smears (36% v 10%, p less than .05) and  excessive wbc in their vaginal secretions (50% v 19%, p = .05). the data support  the contention that c trachomatis, n gonorrhoeae, and t vaginalis are organisms that are predominantly acquired via sexual routes. significant nonsexual modes of transmission are supported by the data for the genital mycoplasmas and g vaginalis. finally, a history of sexual activity in an adolescent female warrants specific diagnostic testing for chlamydia.

TI  == vaginitis: current microbiologic and clinical concepts.
AB  == infectious vaginitis occurs when the normal vaginal flora is disrupted; it may arise when saprophytes overwhelm the host immune response, when pathogenic organisms are introduced into the vagina or when changes in substrate allow an imbalance of microorganisms to develop. examples of these types of vaginitis include the presence of chronic fungal infection in women with an inadequate cellular immune response to the yeast, the introduction of trichomonads into vaginal epithelium that has a sufficient supply of glycogen, and the alteration in bacterial flora, normally dominated by lactobacillus spp., and its metabolites that is characteristic of "nonspecific vaginitis". the authors review microbiologic and clinical aspects of the fungal, protozoal and bacterial infections, including the interactions of bacteria thought to produce nonspecific vaginitis, that are now recognized as causing vaginitis. other causes of vaginitis are also discussed.

AB  == maternal genital infection, particularly subclinical amniotic fluid infection, may cause preterm labor and a premature delivery. the prevalence of subclinical amniotic fluid infection was studied in 54 consecutive afebrile women in preterm  labor with singleton gestations and intact fetal membranes. microorganisms were recovered from the amniotic fluid by transabdominal amniocentesis in 13 (24%) of  54 patients. bacteria or candida albicans were recovered from six (11%), and genital mycoplasmas from seven (13%). compared with women with sterile amniotic fluid, patients whose amniotic fluid contained bacteria or candida organisms had  a shorter interval from onset of preterm labor until delivery (0.6 versus 34.3 days, p less than .01), were less responsive to tocolytic therapy (0 versus 81% success rate, p less than .005), and more frequently developed subsequent intrapartum fever (83 versus 2.4%, p less than .005). in contrast, women whose amniotic fluid contained genital mycoplasmas did not differ in these parameters from those with sterile fluid. also compared was cervical-vaginal infection among these patients in preterm labor with matched control subjects without preterm labor. in this analysis, bacterial vaginosis was identified in 43% of patients with and 14% of women without preterm labor (p = .02), yielding a relative risk of preterm labor for patients with bacterial vaginosis of 3.8. these data underscore the importance of amniotic fluid bacterial infections in preterm labor and premature delivery, and suggest that bacterial vaginosis is associated with prematurity.

AB  == a prospective, randomized, nonblind study was performed to compare the efficacy of a 7-day vaginal regimen with 500 mg metronidazole (flagyl) once a day and that of oral treatment with 400 mg metronidazole twice daily for 7 days in the treatment of nonspecific bacterial vaginosis. no treatment was given to the sexual partners and there was no restriction of sexual intercourse. 38 women completed the study and at follow-up after 4 weeks, women receiving vaginal therapy had a cure rate of 79% compared with 74% in the women on oral therapy. cure rates were lower among users of an intrauterine contraceptive device (57 versus 88% among nonusers). the occurrence of lactate-producing bacteria (lactobacilli and aerobic streptococci) in the vagina was significantly higher in women after vaginal compared with oral therapy. gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 58% of the women after vaginal and in 44% of the women after oral treatment. it is concluded that vaginal application of 500 mg metronidazole daily for 7 days is equally effective as oral administration in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography for the specific detection of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms.
AB  == glycine, one of the end products of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms, was detected by a rapid, specific technique utilizing two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. a loopful of growth of each organism from its suitable agar medium was washed, suspended, and incubated with 0.1% sodium hippurate for 30 min at 37 degrees c. the supernatant of the incubated suspension from each organism was then dansylated, and the dansyl derivatives were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyamide sheets. glycine, a product of hippurate hydrolysis, was detected under uv light. this technique does not require prolonged incubation and was found to be more specific and reliable than the standard ninhydrin reaction. in addition, it is inexpensive and can be easily conducted in a clinical microbiological reference laboratory. by this method, 100% (22/22) of campylobacter jejuni and 0% (0/9) of campylobacter coli reference strains were positive. in addition, 100% (13/13) of group b streptococci, 100% (24/24) of group d streptococci, and 90% (18/20) of gardenerella vaginalis clinical isolates were positive for hippurate hydrolysis. this method is useful for the identification to the species level of campylobacter organisms and the biotyping of gardnerella organisms and for the detection of hippurate hydrolysis  by unknown microorganisms.

AB  == we made a retrospective study of the flora found in the vaginal smears of sexually active women who presented with a mosaic colposcopic pattern of the uterine cervix in an attempt to study some of its epidemiologic factors. of the 195 cervicovaginal cytologies of patients with mosaic, 61 revealed an abnormal flora (31.2%) while of the 9,856 patients without mosaic, only 2,234 cytologies had an abnormal flora (22.7%) demonstrating a statistically significant higher frequency (p less than 0.0001) of an abnormal flora in women with a mosaic pattern on the cervix. a statistically significant association (p less than 0.02) was encountered between the presence of gardnerella vaginalis and the mosaic colposcopic pattern, and surprisingly a statistically greater frequency (p less than 0.05) of biopsied dysplasias in the same group. at the moment we can interpret these observations as nothing more than interesting initial findings.

AB  == bacteriological isolation of anaerobes, gardnerella and lactobacilli was carried  out in a group of 62 women with the diagnosis bacterial vaginosis and 42 control  women. lactobacilli were the predominant organisms in the control group whereas anaerobes dominated the flora in bacterial vaginosis patients. lactate-gel (ph 3.5, 5 ml) inserted into the vagina daily for 7 days is as effective as oral metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days. the women in both groups became symptom-free and objectively improved. anaerobes were significantly reduced (p less than 0.0001) in both groups after 1-week treatment but gardnerella was not significantly reduced. as bacterial vaginosis is generally looked upon as a mild  noninflammatory condition lactate-gel seems to be an ideal treatment for this disease.

TI  == prevalence of nonspecific vaginitis and other cervicovaginal infections during the third trimester of pregnancy.
AB  == nonspecific vaginitis (nsv) is a clinical syndrome characterized by a decreased concentration of normal acidophilic doderlein flora in the vagina and increased concentration of nonacidophilic microorganisms, such as gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and mycoplasmas. since several nsv-associated organisms are associated with complications of pregnancy, we studied the prevalence of nsv among 104 consecutive women during the third trimester of pregnancy. overall, 14  women (14%) had nsv by clinical and/or biochemical criteria, two women had chlamydia trachomatis isolated from the cervix, and 24 women (23%) had yeast isolated from the vagina. none had neisseria gonorrhoeae or trichomonas vaginalis isolated. there was a correlation between an abnormal succinate to lactate ratio  (on gas-liquid chromatography) and cytologic atypia detected by cervicovaginal papanicolaou smears. more extensive studies are needed to correlate nsv with prematurity.

TI  == adhesion of gardnerella vaginalis to vaginal epithelial cells: variables affecting adhesion and inhibition by metronidazole.
AB  == variables affecting the adherence of gardnerella vaginalis to human vaginal epithelial cells were examined in vitro. adherence depended on ph, with maximum attachment occurring between ph 5 and ph 6. preincubation of the bacteria at 56 degrees c for 30 minutes and ultraviolet irradiation resulted in a noticeable decrease in adherence. in contrast, adherence was not altered by preincubating the epithelial cells under these conditions. periodate oxidation of the vaginal cells caused an appreciable reduction in subsequent adherence of g vaginalis. none of the 19 single carbohydrates tested inhibited adherence completely. metronidazole at subinhibitory concentrations for g vaginalis, appreciably reduced the adhesive capacity of g vaginalis, whereas subinhibitory concentrations of ampicillin did not.

TI  == microbiology of the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls: differences by sexual activity, contraception, and presence of nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  == the prevalence of selected microorganisms in the lower genital tract in postmenarchal adolescent girls was assessed, including vaginal gardnerella vaginalis, group b streptococcus, lactobacillus, mycoplasma species, ureaplasma urealyticum, staphylococcus aureus, and yeast, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, chlamydia trachomatis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and trichomonas vaginalis. specific attention was focused on important sexually transmitted disease organisms, and differences in isolations by age, sexual activity, ethnicity, contraception, and the diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis were measured. sexually active subjects had a mean of 6.05 organisms (sd = 3.16), compared with 3.12 organisms (sd = 3.92) in non-sexually active subjects (p = 0.001). sexually active subjects had significantly more vaginal g. vaginalis, lactobacilli, mycoplasma species, and u. urealyticum, as well as endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, compared with non-sexually active subjects; c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoea, and t. vaginalis were isolated exclusively from the sexually active group. significant differences in isolation  rates by ethnicity were found in vaginal mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum, and endocervical mycoplasma species, u. urealyticum, c. trachomatis, n. gonorrhoeae, and t. vaginalis. in general, organisms were isolated from blacks most frequently; n. gonorrhoea was isolated from blacks exclusively. differences  were found in microbiologic isolations by the presence or absence of nonspecific  vaginitis. vaginal g. vaginalis and mycoplasma species and endocervical mycoplasma species and u. urealyticum were found significantly more often in isolates from the group with nonspecific vaginitis. it is important to define the microbial flora of the lower genital tract in adolescent girls in order to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis.

TI  == [detection of gardnerella vaginalis in the pathogen spectrum of sexually transmissible diseases in vulvovaginitis].
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis, a sexually transmittable organism, is regarded as the indicator of the so-called "non-specific vaginitis". the isolation rate of g. vaginalis from 72 women attending our out-patient department during one year because of urogenital complaints was higher in pretreated than in untreated patients. in genital swabs taken from untreated patients, g. vaginalis could be isolated only in 17%, whereas this was observed in 38% of the specimens from women pretreated with various antimicrobial agents. in 9% of the women without vaginal discharge g. vaginalis was isolated. in specimens obtained from 53% of the women positive for g. vaginalis further organisms such as chlamydia trachomatis, trichomonas vaginalis, candida albicans, ureaplasma urealyticum, mycoplasma spp. and b-streptococci could be isolated. asymptomatic infections with neisseria gonorrhoeae (1) and c. trachomatis (4) were also observed. the present study clearly demonstrates that a broad microbiological examination is essential for specific therapy in vaginitis. even if unspecific vaginitis is diagnosed by the presence of clue-cells, increased vaginal ph and fishy odour, a  combined infection by further sexually transmittable organisms, especially n. gonorrhoeae, is to be excluded.

TI  == predictive value of the "clue cells" investigation and the amine volatilization test in vaginal infections caused by gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == although still controversial, an etiologic role of gardnerella vaginalis is imputed in vaginitis. besides isolation of the organism by culture, two alternative diagnostic procedures have been claimed to be useful: the investigation of "clue cells" in clinical specimens and the amine volatilization  test or fishy odor perception in genital secretions. herein we report on the findings of the simultaneous use of g. vaginalis isolation, the clue cell test and amine volatilization perception in specimens from 1,263 consecutive female patients referred to our clinic. our results show that the simultaneous use of both alternative tests is very useful as a screening procedure. a negative result of both tests predicts a negative culture result in 99% of the cases. however, a  positive result of either or both should be considered as an indication to proceed to culture and not as diagnostic of infection.

AB  == a double-blind, randomized, therapeutic study was carried out in 289 patients with vaginal discharge and growth of gardnerella vaginalis (gv) and no growth of  neisseria gonorrhoeae, trichomonas vaginalis or candida. treatment consisted of either pivampicillin (pondocillin), 700 mg twice daily for seven days, or metronidazole, 500 mg twice daily for seven days. the effect was evaluated on the basis of the patient's statement and on the result of culture for gv immediately  after end of treatment. evaluated from the culture results metronidazole was significantly more effective than pivampicillin in eradicating gv. the efficacy of the two medications was 69% and 54%, respectively. the evaluations by the patients in the two groups, on the other hand, did not differ significantly, although there was a tendency to consider metronidazole as the most effective. metronidazole must be considered the most potent drug today, and we recommend it  as the medication of choice, provided that the diagnosis is confirmed by the clinical picture and microscopy and not only by culture.

TI  == diagnostic value of clinical examination, direct microscopy, and culture in the gardnerella vaginalis syndrome.
AB  == in a general practice 467 women aged 15-49 years with vaginal discharge were consecutively examined in order to compare the diagnostic value in the gardnerella vaginalis syndrome of the clinical examination, direct microscopy of  the vaginal secretion, and culture. we found significant correlations between all relevant combinations of the diagnostic methods. the predictive value of a positive test for the clinical examination, the microscopy, and the clinical examination combined with microscopy, respectively, was 0.75, 0.89 and 0.90, whereas the predictive values of the negative test were 0.59, 0.72 and 0.61, respectively. because even small numbers of gardnerella vaginalis may yield growth on selective culture media, the clinical examination and the microscopy are often negative despite positive culture. to avoid overtreatment of a benign condition we therefore conclude that the presence of a characteristic clinical picture and positive microscopy constitute a safe basis for the diagnosis of the  gardnerella vaginalis syndrome, and that the diagnosis should be based on this combination or on the fulfilment of three of the following four criteria: 1) characteristic vaginal secretion; 2) vaginal ph greater than 4.5; 3) positive potassium hydroxide test or characteristic herring-brine smell, and 4) clue cells at microscopy. with the present methods culture for gardnerella vaginalis should  not routinely be performed, until the value of quantitated methods has been proved. coexistence of other microorganisms rendered the diagnosis difficult. we  recommend to treat the most predominant infection first.

TI  == importance of differential diagnosis in acute vaginitis.
AB  == acute vaginitis is one of the most common diseases seen in the practice of office gynecology. large survey studies of women with lower genital tract symptoms suggestive of vaginitis have demonstrated the presence of three major etiologic categories in acute vaginitis: (1) nonspecific vaginosis (gardnerella vaginalis), (2) vulvovaginal candidiasis (candida albicans), and (3) trichomoniasis (trichomonas vaginalis). effective treatment of acute vaginitis requires that an  accurate diagnosis be established and etiologic microorganism(s) be identified. in general, the differential diagnosis of acute vaginitis does not rely on elaborate technology but, rather, requires inexpensive and readily available office equipment and supplies, a detailed history, and an adequate examination of the external genitalia, vagina, and cervix. only after the etiology of vaginitis  has been identified can appropriate therapeutic intervention(s) be utilized.

AB  == nonspecific vaginitis, one of the most common causes of vaginitis in adults, is a polymicrobial infection in which vaginal anaerobes act synergistically with gardnerella vaginalis. the diagnosis is made by examination of the vaginal secretions for clue cells, the development of a fishy odor after the addition of  10% koh to vaginal secretions, and a vaginal ph greater than 4.5. to determine whether nonspecific vaginitis occurs in sexually abused children, we obtained vaginal washes from 31 abused and 23 nonabused children, 21/2 to 13 years of age. a child was considered to have definite nonspecific vaginitis if her wash contained both clue cells and odor; she was considered to have possible nonspecific vaginitis if her wash contained either clue cells or odor. we did not use vaginal ph as a diagnostic criterion because the normal range has not been standardized in prepubertal girls. possible nonspecific vaginitis (odor only) was found in only 1/23 (4%) of nonabused children. this girl was asymptomatic and findings from her examination were normal. only one of the 31 abused children had possible nonspecific vaginitis (odor) detected at the initial examination, less than 48 hours after the episode of abuse, whereas 4/31 (13%) developed definite,  and 4/31 (13%) possible nonspecific vaginitis at the follow-up visit more than seven days after the episode of abuse or rape. five of these eight girls developed either a new vaginal discharge or dysuria; three were treated with metronidazole with resolution of their symptoms and reversion of the vaginal wash to normal.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [isolation and identification of gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  == thirty-four strains of gardnerella vaginalis were studied. they were isolated from non specific vaginitis. a presumptive identification can be based on colonial morphology, gram stain characteristics, negative catalase and oxidase test. the differentiation of gardnerella vaginalis from other negative catalase coccobacilli is based on the acid formation of carbohydrates, enzymatic test, analysis of short chain volatile and non volatile end products of fermentation in glc. all gardnerella strains produce acid from glucose, maltose, starch and are hippurate and alpha glucosidase positive. they are sulfonamide resistant, acetic, lactic and succinic acids are detected by gas liquid chromatography.

TI  == vaginitis.
AB  == vaginitis is one of the most common complaints of women in the united states today. about 90% of patients with this problem suffer from infection of the vagina caused by candida, gardnerella, or trichomonas. the diagnosis and effective treatment of these common infections depend on accurate identification  of the entity, effective specific therapy, and restoration of the normal ecosystem of the vagina. at the same time women should be made aware that not all discharge means infection and that any attempts at self-treatment may only worsen their condition. proper hygiene habits, dietary control, and management of stress are all helpful factors in the control of recurrent vaginal infections.

AB  == the roche septi-chek biphasic blood culture system with tryptic soy broth was compared with a conventional blood culture bottle with supplemented peptone broth in 6,956 paired blood cultures from adult patients. both systems were inoculated  with equal volumes of blood (5 ml) and incubated aerobically (vented) for 2 weeks. more clinically important bacteria and fungi, including staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, escherichia coli and other enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans and c. tropicalis were recovered from the biphasic system (p less than 0.001). in contrast, more clinically important anaerobic bacteria (p less than 0.001) and gardnerella vaginalis (p less than 0.05) were recovered in conventional supplemented peptone broth. staphylococci (p less than 0.01), enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli (p less than 0.05), and fungi (p less than 0.001) were detected 1 or more days earlier in the biphasic system, whereas streptococci (p less than 0.001) were detected earlier in the conventional bottle. the overall superiority of the agar slide blood culture system compared with conventional blood culture bottles was confirmed by this evaluation. for optimal detection of anaerobic bacteremia, however, the agar slide bottle should be paired with an anaerobic bottle.

TI  == evaluation of gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infection: a preliminary report.
AB  == gas-liquid chromatography has been proposed as a possible tool in the rapid diagnosis of amniotic fluid infections. the analysis is based on the identification of specific organic acids derived from bacterial metabolism when organisms are present within the amniotic fluid. we retrospectively subjected 69  samples of amniotic fluid which had been obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis to analysis by gas-liquid chromatography. forty-seven samples were derived from patients who either were in premature labor or had premature rupture of membranes with associated premature labor. twenty-two specimens which served as a comparison group were obtained from patients who underwent amniocentesis for assessment of fetal maturity. the results obtained from chromatographic analysis  are presented, and the possible applications of this technique to the clinical situation are discussed.

TI  == the in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin compared with that of ciprofloxacin.
AB  == the in-vitro activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin were compared with that of the  other new 4-quinolone, ciprofloxacin. all three compounds were highly active against enterobacteriaceae, haemophilus influenzae and neisseria gonorrhoeae (mics mostly less than 1 mg/l). the other gram-negative aerobes tested were in general less susceptible, though for acinetobacter and pseudomonas species (including aeruginosa) mics seldom exceeded 8 mg/l. ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active against gardnerella vaginalis (mics 0.5-2 mg/l) than was enoxacin (mics 8-32 mg/l). staphylococci were susceptible to ofloxacin (mics 0.12-1 mg/l) and enoxacin (mics 0.5-2 mg/l) as well as to ciprofloxacin. streptococci also were mostly sensitive to the compounds though the mics of enoxacin (4-64 mg/l) were noticeably higher than those of ofloxacin (1-4 mg/l). anaerobes were in general susceptible though, as with streptococci, ofloxacin, with activity similar to that of ciprofloxacin, was more active than enoxacin. variants of enterobacteriaceae with reduced susceptibility were readily selected  in the laboratory with either enoxacin or ofloxacin as the selective agent. the mics of all the 4-quinolones were usually increased four- to 16-fold for these strains; they could therefore be regarded as remaining susceptible to the newer compounds.

TI  == effect of sodium polyanetholesulfonate and gelatin on the recovery of gardnerella vaginalis from blood culture media.
AB  == sodium polyanetholesulfonate (sps) is used as a routine supplement to blood culture media to enhance recovery of microorganisms, but it inhibits the growth of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, neisseria meningitidis, neisseria gonorrhoeae,  and streptobacillus moniliformis. comparative clinical blood culture studies at the university of colorado hospital suggested that sps also inhibits the growth of gardnerella vaginalis. we inoculated 16 blood culture isolates of g. vaginalis into 11 blood culture media containing sps or sodium amylosulfate, with and without gelatin. in the absence of gelatin, only brain heart infusion and thiol broths with sps supported the growth of more than five strains of g. vaginalis, whereas all media except bactec 6b and 7c and brucella broths recovered most isolates with sps and gelatin or with sodium amylosulfate alone. we conclude that sps inhibits the growth of g. vaginalis in blood culture media but that this inhibition is medium dependent and can be overcome by supplementation of most media with gelatin.

TI  == anaerobes and gardnerella vaginalis in non-specific vaginitis.
AB  == clinical evidence of bacterial vaginosis was present in 25 (35%) of 72 patients attending a london venereology clinic and correlated significantly with abnormal  organic acids in vaginal secretions (24/25), with gardnerella vaginalis on culture (17/25), with complaints of vaginal malodour (15/25), and with a relative scarcity of white blood cells in vaginal secretions. anaerobic vaginal flora were presumptively identified by gas-liquid chromatographic analysis of organic acids  found in vaginal secretions. the clinical criteria used to diagnose bacterial vaginosis included the presence of at least three of the four following characteristics: (a) a vaginal ph greater than or equal to 4.5, vaginal secretions that (b) were homogeneous, (c) contained "clue" cells, and (d) released a "fishy" amine odour when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide. because 17 of the 25 patients with clinical bacterial vaginosis had both chromatographic  bacterial vaginosis and g vaginalis, causative organisms were difficult to identify. none of the six patients who had g vaginalis but not chromatographic bacterial vaginosis had clinical bacterial vaginosis, but seven of the 10 women with chromatographic bacterial vaginosis but not g vaginalis had clinical bacterial vaginosis (p less than 0.02, chi 2 with yates's correction). this finding supports the recent suggestions that anaerobes are important in the production of clinical signs of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == use of a sodium polyanetholesulfonate disk for the identification of gardnerella  vaginalis.
AB  == several methods have been previously suggested for the presumptive identification of gardnerella vaginalis in clinical laboratories, but none is entirely satisfactory. we previously found that sodium polyanetholesulfonate (sps) inhibits g. vaginalis in blood culture media. we compared susceptibility to an sps-containing paper disk with beta-hemolysis on human blood agar, hippurate hydrolysis, and inhibition by alpha-hemolytic streptococci for identification of  62 previously confirmed g. vaginalis strains. all strains were positive by sps disk and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus inhibition, 78% were positive by beta-hemolysis, and 81% were positive by hippurate hydrolysis. although positive  reactions occurred with sps disk and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus tests for 5 and 9 of 84 other bacteria tested, respectively, none of these bacteria were positive for both tests. we conclude that a combination of sps disk susceptibility and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus inhibition provides excellent identification of g. vaginalis when performed by the methods suggested.

AB  == a sialidase (neuraminidase, acylneuraminosyl hydrolase, ec 3.2.1.18) has been discovered and isolated from gardnerella vaginalis (ex. haemophilus vaginalis), a possibly pathogenic inhabitant of the female genital tract. bacteria were grown in peptone-yeast-extract medium with 2.0 mm n-acetylmannosamine as enzyme inductor under co2 atmosphere. sialidase activity was found in the bacterial sediment and in the culture medium. the enzyme was liberated from the cells by ultrasonic treatment. purification was performed by 60-80% ammonium sulfate precipitation and by column chromatography on sepharose cl-6b and sephadex g 200. the enzyme revealed a molecular weight in the range of mr 75 000 and a ph optimum at 5.5. among the different types of neuac-containing glycoconjugates, the enzyme exhibits its highest activities towards the globular glycoproteins alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and fetuin. taking their cleavage rate as 100, it is around 55 for ii3neuac-lac, 45 for bovine submaxillary mucin, 35 for ii6neuac-lac and iv3, iii6neuac2-lcose4. the rates for iii8,ii3neuac2-lac, gangliosides and colominic acid are below 20. due to its specificity pattern, the enzyme may play a role in  the pathogenic process of g. vaginalis infections.

TI  == microbiology of vaginitis associated with the intrauterine contraceptive device.
AB  == a malodorous, homogeneous, grey, thin and non-purulent discharge, which resembles non-specific vaginitis occurs in 20% of women with an intrauterine contraceptive  device (iucd); four times more common than in non-users. the aim of this investigation was to study the bacteriological aetiology of this iucd-associated  vaginal discharge, and to assess whether the infection was ascendent. no specific microbiological aetiology was found, but the normal, lactobacillus-dominated microbial vaginal flora was replaced by gardnerella vaginalis and certain anaerobic species in iucd-users with the discharge. clue cells, pepper-salt phenomenon and curved rods and/or fusiform-shaped rods demonstrated by microscopy, were typical of symptomatic patients. the endometrium and the iucd were infected with these species in the symptomatic group more often than in iucd-users who had no symptoms or in the control women who did not use the iucd.

TI  == a study of the susceptibility of three species of primate to vaginal colonization with gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == in an attempt to develop an animal model of gardnerella-associated vaginitis, several strains of gardnerella vaginalis were inoculated into the lower genital tract of female pig-tailed macaques, tamarins and chimpanzees. g. vaginalis was not recovered from either tamarins or chimpanzees, but was recovered from each of 1o pig-tailed macaques inoculated with either of two freshly isolated gardnerella strains, colonization persisting for 11-39 days. examination of gram-stained vaginal smears obtained from infected pig-tailed macaques failed to demonstrate clue cells, a feature which is pathognomonic of gardnerella-associated vaginitis  in humans. other features characteristic of non-specific vaginitis, namely an increase in vaginal ph, and an increase in the ratio of succinate to lactate (s/l ratio) in vaginal fluid were not found. however, the physiology of the macaque vagina was found to be different from that of the human, the vaginal ph and s/l ratio of uninfected macaques both being higher than that seen in humans. the physiological differences between the macaque and human vagina may be due, in part, to a difference in their anaerobic vaginal flora. while these inter-species differences in vaginal physiology and microbiology limit the relevance of the pig-tailed macaque as a model of gardnerella-associated vaginitis, the ease with  which macaques are colonized with g. vaginalis may prove useful in studying bacterial adhesion and local immunity.

AB  == in a large multicentre study of 429 patients with the usual signs and symptoms of non-specific vaginitis (nsv), we studied the effect of different doses of metronidazole. the patients were divided into five treatment groups as follows: group a was given 400 mg metronidazole three times daily for seven days, group b  2000 mg as a single dose, group c 2000 mg on days 1 and 2, group d 2000 mg on days 1 and 3, and group e was given 1200 mg metronidazole once daily for five days. at follow up examination four weeks from the start of treatment, patients in groups d and e showed the best clinical results with cure rates of 94.0% and 93.6% respectively. in addition the rate of reisolation of gardnerella vaginalis  was lowest in group d. we therefore recommend metronidazole 2000 mg on days 1 and 3 as routine treatment for non-specific or vaginitis associated with gardnerella.

AB  == representative strains of gardnerella vaginalis were degraded using both an alkaline and an acid methanolysis and the fatty acid methyl esters released examined by thin-layer and gas chromatography. the profiles obtained were both qualitatively and quantitatively similar and were comprised of straight chain saturated and unsaturated non-hydroxylated fatty acids with hexadecanoic acid (16:0) and octadecenoic acid (18:1) the major components. all of the strains contained very characteristic polar lipid patterns consisting of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, five partially identified glycolipids and an uncharacterised phospholipid. analyses of wall amino acid preparations using gas chromatography showed that gardnerella vaginalis strains contain major amounts of alanine, glycine, glutamic acid and lysine. the chemical data support the integrity of the genus gardnerella.

AB  == routine screening of 2374 high vaginal swabs yielded 132 cultures (5.6 per cent)  which were positive for gardnerella vaginalis. thirty-four of the strains were isolated together with candida albicans and 46 with trichomonas vaginalis. one hundred and twenty (90.9 per cent) of the isolates were from females between the  ages of 16 and 40 years. one hundred and nineteen (90 per cent) patients sought medical advice because of a history of discharge (88) or inflammation (31). the other 13 (10 per cent) had some other complaint or underlying disease. all 132 strains hydrolysed hippurate and fermented starch. ninety-three (70.5 per cent) were isolated from swabs without clue cells. seventy-seven were from nonpurulent  samples; the remainder were from samples with varying numbers of pus cells. all but two strains appeared sensitive to metronidazole when tested with discs containing 50 micrograms, but none when discs contained 5 micrograms of the drug. during the study c. albicans was isolated from 571 swabs (24 per cent) and t. vaginalis was found in 112 (4.7 per cent); in 19 (0.8 per cent) swabs both were detected. five of 71 (7 per cent) specimens of uncentrifuged urine with more than 100 pus cells/microliter and two of 30 (6.6 per cent) seminal fluids with moderate numbers of pus cells yielded moderate to profuse growth of g. vaginalis. the patients concerned were not receiving antibiotics and other significant organisms had not been found by conventional cultural techniques.

TI  == gardnerella-associated vaginitis and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == 12 patients with mild or moderate symptoms of gardnerella-associated vaginitis were examined clinically and microbiologically on 52 different occasions, 27 of which were asymptomatic. the symptomatic state was defined by fulfilling at least three of the following criteria: (1) subjective symptoms; (2) ph above 4.5; (3) positive amine test, and (4) clue cells in wet smear. variation of the vaginal microflora was considerable. no causative bacterial species could be identified.  microorganisms of the genus bacteroides were significantly (p less than 0.02) more often found in the symptomatic condition. the presence of either peptococci  , peptostreptococci or anaerobic streptococci was similarly related to symptoms (p less than 0.01). lactobacilli were significantly more often present when the patient was free of symptoms (p less than 0.05). gardnerella vaginalis was a common isolate whether the patient suffered from symptoms or not. it is concluded that the presence of this microorganism indicates a disturbed ecologic situation  within the vagina, resulting in loss of predominance of lactobacilli and hence liability to develop symptoms.

TI  == measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.
AB  == the detection of alpha-amylase is commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories to aid in differentiating streptococcus bovis from other streptococci. it is also useful in identifying eikenella corrodens and the gravis subspecies of corynebacterium diphtheriae and in separating species of the genera bacteroides, clostridium, actinomyces, and bacillus. currently, the most frequently used procedure utilizes starch as the substrate and iodine as the indicator. starch is incorporated into a agar medium, the isolate is inoculated on the surface, and the medium is incubated for 24 to 48 h. a 15-min test containing p-nitrophenyl polyglycosides as the substrate complex was developed to yield results comparable with the agar-based starch test. the reagent was made in liquid form, 0.20 ml per tube, and could be incubated either in ambient air or at 35 degrees c. when dried, the p-nitrophenyl polyglycoside reagent could be stored at 0 degrees c for 4 weeks.

TI  == the bacteriology of gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == even 70 years ago gram-negative coccobacilli had been recognized in vaginal discharge and were cultured 30 years ago. the need to have blood in agar medium for cultivation suggested that the organisms might be a haemophilus species. later, however, growth characteristics and other features resulted in their being placed in the genus corynebacterium, before it was realized that this was inappropriate and they were transferred to a new genus and species gardnerella vaginalis. the organisms are gram-variable, non-sporing, non-flagellate, non-motile coccobacilli of average size 0.4 x 1-1.5 microns. the cell wall is laminated and some strains possess pili. g. vaginalis is fermentative and dextrose, fructose, galactose, glucose, maltose, mannose, ribose and starch are most likely to be metabolized. however, published patterns of the sugars fermented vary widely and most workers do not rely on such tests as a means of identification. of many other features exhibited by g. vaginalis, the following are outstanding: it does not produce catalase, cytochrome oxidase, hydrogen sulphide, indole, or urease. nor does it degrade aesculin, liquefy gelatin, reduce nitrate, or decarboxylate arginine, lysine or ornithine. on the other hand, it is sensitive to hydrogen peroxide, often causes beta-haemolysis and usually hydrolyses hippurate and starch. g. vaginalis is serologically heterogeneous and causes haemagglutination which is mannose resistant. it is resistant to several antibiotics, including amphotericin, colistin, nalidixic acid and gentamicin, which may be incorporated in selective media.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteriology of the vagina.
AB  == interest in the microflora of the vagina and cervix has stemmed from the recognition of its significant association with vaginal and upper genital tract infections. yet a clear understanding of the range of microbial types which are consistent with a normal genital tract and the factors which control the flora are elusive. different methods and study populations in the various studies of the vaginal flora often have produced divergent conclusions. studies using improved bacteriologic culture techniques, however, indicate that the previously  held assumptions (i) that lactobacilli are the only bacteria present in healthy women, and (ii) that gardnerella vaginalis is the only species associated with bacterial vaginosis, were oversimplifications. although the aerobic and anaerobic species isolated are similar, qualitatively speaking, there are marked quantitative differences in the flora between these two groups of women. lactobacilli in high concentrations are the most prevalent species in the vagina  of women without bacterial vaginosis, whereas lactobacilli are less prevalent, and anaerobes, mycoplasma, and g. vaginalis are more prevalent, and in higher concentrations, in the vagina of women with bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == anaerobic curved rods in genital samples of women. performance of different selective media, comparison of detection by microscopy and culture studies, and recovery from different sampling sites.
AB  == anaerobic curved rods (cr) frequently occur in the vaginal flora of women with non-specific vaginitis, more recently referred to as bacterial vaginosis (bv). the reasons for difficulties in culturing cr include their anaerobic nature, slow rate of growth and presence in a highly mixed flora. the present study concerns the efficiency of three culture media--blood agar, a gonococcal medium, and columbia agar--for recovery of cr. the possibility of improving selectivity by adding various antibiotics (e.g. nalidixic acid, colistin and tinidazole) to the  media was also explored. the mics for 157 cr strains and for 80 strains of anaerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria isolated from vaginal samples from  women with bv were therefore determined. columbia agar containing 1 micrograms/ml tinidazole in combination with either colistin (10 micrograms/ml) or nalidixic acid (15 micrograms/ml) proved the most efficient medium for recovery of cr. these antibiotic combinations effectively suppressed growth of gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic cocci and species of bacteroides.--in 291 women, comparison  was made of the detection of cr morphotype bacteria in methylene-blue-stained smears and the results of vaginal cultures for cr. a long variant (2-4 micron) was found in 42% by direct microscopy and 43% by culture. a short variant (approx 1 micron), which, with two exceptions, was always concomitant with the long variant, was demonstrable in only 3% of vaginal smears and in 14% of the cultures.--vaginal samples were approximately four times more often culture-positive for cr than were cervical samples from the same women.

TI  == bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy. an association with prematurity and postpartum complications.
AB  == although bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common disorder associated with high concentrations of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms, bv has not yet been linked to infections outside the vagina. to investigate the association of bv with adverse outcomes during or following pregnancy, we analysed the prevalence of bv among women with and without premature labor, and early-onset postpartum endometritis. bacterial vaginosis was identified by gas-liquid chromatographic criteria in 28 (49%) of 57 women giving birth at less than or equal to 37 weeks gestation or with birthweight less than 2500 g and in 27 (24%) of 114 women bearing an infant at term (p = 0.001). organisms associated with bv, such as gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria, and/or genital mycoplasmas, were recovered from the endometrium of 61 of 101 women with clinical signs of endometritis. g. vaginalis was the most frequent isolate from both the endometrium (38 patients) and the blood (8 patients) of women with postpartum endometritis. bacteroides bivius was the most frequent anaerobic isolate from the endometrium (11 cases) and blood (4 cases). patients with both g. vaginalis and anaerobes isolated remained febrile significantly longer after beginning antibiotic therapy than did other patients (57.1 hours. vs. 36.3 hours, p = 0.02). these data suggest that bv may be associated with prematurity and that bv  may contribute to postpartum maternal infectious morbidity.

AB  == in the vaginal washings of 100 women with symptomatic non-specific vaginitis a succinate/lactate ratio of greater than or equal to 0.4 had a diagnostic sensitivity of 80%, a specificity of 83% for this condition. the predictive value of a positive test was 94%, but that of a negative test was only 55%. a strong association between the presence of gardnerella vaginalis, anaerobes, a vaginal ph of above 4.5, and amines was found not only in non-specific vaginitis, but also in trichomonal and gonococcal infection. a variety of primary changes may encourage the multiplication of both gardnerellae and anaerobes and their presence in non-specific vaginitis may be a secondary rather than a primary event.

AB  == the prevalence of nonspecific vaginitis was 24% among 98 randomly selected women  examined at a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases and 32% among 135 women with suspected cervicitis at the same clinic. mycoplasma hominis was isolated more often and serum antibody levels to m. hominis were higher in women with nonspecific vaginitis than in women without nonspecific vaginitis. similarly, the rate of isolation of gardnerella vaginalis and the quantitative growth of g. vaginalis were higher for women with nonspecific vaginitis. abnormal results of gasliquid chromatographic analysis of vaginal fluid and the presence of abnormal  diamines in the vaginal fluid also were associated with nonspecific vaginitis and with the isolation of m. hominis, whether or not g. vaginalis was isolated. further studies of the ecologic interactions among m. hominis, g. vaginalis, and  anaerobes in nonspecific vaginitis are needed for a better understanding of the pathogenesis of this syndrome.

AB  == certain fastidious organisms such as u urealyticum and g vaginalis can be isolated from the aspirated bladder urine of pregnant women more frequently than  conventional urinary pathogens such as escherichia coli [1]. they can be isolated even more often from the aspirated bladder urine of patients with renal disease,  but rarely from that of healthy men or nonpregnant women [2]. we investigated the incidence of bacteriuria due to these two organisms--particularly u urealyticum--in patients with preeclampsia. u urealyticum was isolated more frequently (rate, 20%), and usually in higher colony counts, from the urine of patients with preeclampsia than from that of healthy pregnant women (rate, 7%). g vaginalis was isolated with approximately the same frequency as u urealyticum from specimens of bladder urine; both organisms were isolated from the urine of 11 patients (eight healthy women and three with preeclampsia). high colony counts of g vaginalis were also found more frequently in patients with preeclampsia. in  both groups other fastidious organisms were isolated in a total of only five patients, and in four of these five cases u urealyticum and/or g vaginalis were also isolated from the same specimen. urine cultures were more frequently positive in patients with moderately severe hypertension (blood pressure, greater than 160/100 mm hg) than in those with mild hypertension (blood pressure, 140/90-160/100 mm hg, occurring in nine (53%) of 17 patients and in nine (26.5%)  of 34 patients, respectively. this difference was not statistically significant.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == semiquantitative culture of gardnerella vaginalis in laboratory determination of  nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  == to evaluate the usefulness of quantitative cultures of gardnerella vaginalis in the laboratory determination of nonspecific vaginitis, the actual and relative numbers of g. vaginalis in genital cultures of a general patient population were  assessed semiquantitatively, and the laboratory results were then correlated with the clinical findings. of the 1,585 women studied, 417 (26.3%) yielded g. vaginalis in culture. of these, only 113 (27.1%) were found to have symptoms and  signs consistent with nonspecific vaginitis. g. vaginalis was obtained in pure or predominant growth from 87 of 100 consecutive cases with nonspecific vaginitis and 32 of 100 consecutive cases without the symptoms or signs of vaginitis (p less than 0.001). hence, the positive predictive value of isolation of g. vaginalis in pure and predominant growths was determined to be 73% (87 of 119). conversely, g. vaginalis was isolated in mixed or light growth significantly more often from asymptomatic women than from symptomatic patients, i.e., 68 versus 13  cases. therefore, the negative predictive value of isolation of g. vaginalis in mixed and light growths was found to be 84% (68 of 81). quantitation of the relative amount of g. vaginalis growth had higher predictive values as compared with the assessment of g. vaginalis growth alone. we conclude that quantitative culture of g. vaginalis is essential to obtain maximum reliability of culture results in the laboratory determination of nonspecific vaginitis. although quantitated cultures of g. vaginalis have high predictive values, laboratory results must be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical findings.

TI  == diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis by direct gram stain of vaginal fluid.
AB  == to determine whether bacterial vaginosis (bv), also known as nonspecific vaginitis, could be diagnosed by evaluating a gram stain of vaginal fluid, we examined samples from 60 women of whom 25 had clinical evidence of bv and 35 had  candidal vaginitis or normal examinations. an inverse relationship between the quantity of the lactobacillus morphotype (large gram-positive rods) and of the gardnerella morphotype (small gram-variable rods) was noted on gram stain (p less than 0.001). when gram stain showed a predominance (3 to 4+) of the lactobacillus morphotype with or without the gardnerella morphotype, it was interpreted as normal. when gram stain showed mixed flora consisting of gram-positive, gram-negative, or gram-variable bacteria and the lactobacillus morphotype was decreased or absent (0 to 2+), the gram stain was interpreted as consistent with  bv. gram stain was consistent with bv in 25 of 25 women given a clinical diagnosis of bv and in none of 35 women with candidal vaginitis or normal examinations. duplicate slides prepared from 20 additional specimens of vaginal fluid were stained by two methods and examined by three evaluators. interevaluator interpretations and intraevaluator interpretations of duplicate slides were in agreement with one another and with the clinical diagnosis greater than or equal to 90% of the time. we concluded that a microscopically detectable  change in vaginal microflora from the lactobacillus morphotype, with or without the gardnerella morphotype (normal), to a mixed flora with few or no lactobacillus morphotypes (bv) can be used in the diagnosis of bv.

AB  == bladder aspirate urine samples (n = 190) were cultured for the presence of fastidious microorganisms. these samples were obtained from patients with urinary tract disease in whom standard bacteriologic investigation had failed to indicate infection. gardnerella vaginalis was recovered alone, or in association with ureaplasma urealyticum from the bladder urine of 33% of patients with reflux scarring. g. vaginalis was localized to the upper urinary tract in 75% of these patients with bladder counts greater than 10(3) colony-forming units per milliliter. the results show that two fastidious microbial species, not conventionally associated with urinary tract infection, are recoverable from the  upper urinary tracts of patients with so-called sterile pyelonephritis.

AB  == this study briefly reviews gardnerella vaginalis as a primary vaginal pathogen and assesses the efficacy and safety of therapy with a single, 2-g oral dose of metronidazole. over a period of 20 months, 882 symptomatic adolescent girls had positive cultures for g. vaginalis. all were post-menarcheal. no other vaginal pathogen was isolated in 609. the total group had a second culture 5-7 days after treatment. cultures taken after treatment were negative in 95% of those treated with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole. symptoms abated with therapy and culture negativity. side effects were limited to infrequent, minor gastric distress. our  results suggest the utility of a simplified, one-dose regimen with high efficacy, insignificant side effects, and a lower cost per patient than the current dosage  schedule of 500 mg b.i.d. for 7 days.

AB  == vaginal swabs were examined for the presence of gardnerella vaginalis. of 294 isolates with appropriate colonial and cellular morphology subjected to an identification procedure, 203 (69%) were identified as g vaginalis. the 91 isolates not identified as g vaginalis were differentiated by their inability to  ferment starch, cause diffuse beta haemolysis on human blood agar or hydrolyse hippurate. other tests, often used in the identification of g vaginalis, were found to be insufficiently specific. failure to ferment starch coexisted with failure to cause beta haemolysis and/or hydrolyse hippurate. the starch fermentation test may therefore be omitted. the tests for beta haemolysis and hippurate hydrolysis, being relatively simple to perform and interpret, are considered indispensable for the accurate identification of g vaginalis in the service laboratory.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in genital disease.
AB  == in a study of gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in non-specific vaginitis (nsv) and other genital disease 89 patients attending a genital medicine clinic had vaginal samples examined for conventional pathogens and for quantitative analysis of g vaginalis and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora. the overall incidence of g vaginalis was 20%; g vaginalis (mean concentration 7.0 log10/g of secretion) occurred predominantly in patients with nsv (57%) but also  in sexual contacts of non-specific urethritis (nsu) (37.5%) and in patients with  other conditions (11.8%). g vaginalis is therefore a relatively common isolate in patients with vaginal discharge. the concentration of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria ranged from 4.9-11.0 log10/g of secretion with an anaerobe-to-aerobe ratio of 10:1. anaerobic bacteria, particularly anaerobic gram-positive cocci (mean concentrations 7.7 log10/g), were present in patients with nsv and in association with g vaginalis, but they also occurred in other clinical groups and with other pathogens, particularly trichomonas vaginalis. anaerobic bacteria may  therefore play an important role in the pathogenesis of vaginal infections.

AB  == metronidazole, a nitroimidazole derivative, is a unique antimicrobial agent that  is active against both bacterial and parasitic organisms, although only the anaerobic members of these groups are susceptible. it has been used for the treatment of trichomoniasis for about 20 years and is also effective against amebiasis and giardiasis. more recently, metronidazole has emerged as a principal agent for the treatment of anaerobic bacterial infections. it is highly effective against all species of anaerobes except certain non-spore-forming gram-positive bacilli and cocci and is the only agent rapidly bactericidal against the bacteroides fragilis group. clinical studies have proved its efficacy in prophylaxis for elective colorectal surgical procedures and in the treatment of deep abdominal sepsis (usually in combination with another agent, such as an aminoglycoside). metronidazole is the treatment of choice for nonspecific vaginitis that seems to be a mixed infection due to anaerobes and gardnerella vaginalis. adequate concentrations in the blood are produced after both oral and  intravenous administration, and the side effects are infrequent and minimal.

TI  == the clinical signs and symptoms of gardnerella-associated vaginosis.
AB  == gardnerella-associated vaginosis (hemophilus vaginalis vaginitis, nonspecific vaginitis) is the most common cause of vaginal discharge and odor. the clinical spectrum of this infection varies from total lack of symptoms to obvious odor and profuse vaginal discharge. the diagnosis of this syndrome can be made when a woman presents with a homogenous grey-white discharge that emits a fishy odor when a drop of 10% potassium hydroxide is mixed with a drop of vaginal discharge  on a glass slide. the ph of this secretion is typically in the range of 5.0-5.5 as determined by indicator paper. the diagnosis is further confirmed when a microscopic examination of the discharge mixed with normal saline shows a virtual pure culture of tiny bacteria many of which are found clinging to vaginal epithelial cells forming the so-called "clue cells". cultures to isolate gardnerella vaginalis are unnecessary in clinical practice.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis and anaerobic bacteria in the etiology of bacterial (nonspecific) vaginosis.
AB  == g. vaginalis was originally described as the etiologic agent of bacterial vaginosis (nonspecific vaginitis) because it was recovered only from women with signs and symptoms of "bacterial vaginitis" and not from normal controls. recent  data have shown that g. vaginalis is present in normal women but at concentrations lower than the limit of sensitivity of the media formerly used. detection of low concentrations of g. vaginalis in normal controls has been made  possible by development of a selective and differential medium (hbt). anaerobically performed studies of the vaginal flora have indicated that while lactobacilli predominate in the normal vagina with or without g. vaginalis, anaerobic bacteria including bacteroides spp., peptococcus spp., eubacterium spp. and curved rods as well as g. vaginalis predominate in bacterial vaginosis. anaerobic bacteria and g. vaginalis are decreased after appropriate therapy. after treatment with metronidazole, lactobacilli again predominate. lactobacilli  are less prevalent after treatment with ampicillin or amoxicillin. these data suggest that as in infections at other mucous membrane sites, bacterial vaginosis is a mixed infection involving a finite number of facultative and anaerobic species. the data also suggest an important role for facultative lactobacilli.

TI  == comparative antimicrobial activity of metronidazole and the hydroxy metabolite against gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == metronidazole (m) (1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) undergoes oxidative metabolism with the formation of several metabolites, the most important quantitatively in serum and urine being the "hydroxy" metabolite (hm) (1-(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-hydroxymethyl-5-nitroimidazole). the antimicrobial activity of hm was compared with m against strains of g. vaginalis using minimal inhibitory (mic) and bactericidal (mbc) concentration determinations and time-kill curve studies. at an inoculum of 10(6) colony forming units per ml (cfu/ml), and anaerobic incubation for 48 hours, the median mic and mbc of hm were 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, compared to 4 and 16 micrograms/ml for  m. hm also demonstrated a more rapid bactericidal effect than m in time-kill curves against exponential (10(6) cfu/ml) and stationary phase (10(10-13) cfu/ml) organisms. however, the cidal effect of hm against g. vaginalis was slower than that previously shown for m against obligate anaerobes such as b. fragilis. the degree of inactivation of both hm and m, determined by high pressure liquid chromatography, was similar during the time-kill studies and averaged less than 10% with exponential phase organisms and approximately 40% against stationary phase organisms after 48 hours' incubation. pharmacokinetic studies have shown that on usual dosage regimens of m used for non-specific vaginitis the serum levels of hm would likely exceed the mic/mbc for most strains of g. vaginalis. therefore, hm likely contributes a significant antimicrobial effect against this  organism.

TI  == metronidazole in treatment of non-specific vaginitis. clinical and microbiological findings in ten patients given 2 grams of metronidazole.
AB  == a 2 gram single dose of metronidazole was given to ten patients suffering from nonspecific vaginitis. at follow-up a week later seven of these patients were clinically and microbiologically free from infection. the remaining three patients had persisting symptoms and both clinical and microbiological findings confirmed treatment failure. despite the small numbers entered into the trial to  date, a cure rate of only seven out of ten patients suggests that a 2 gram single dose of metronidazole is inadequate treatment for non-specific vaginitis.

TI  == treatment of the gardnerella vaginalis syndrome with a single 2 gram oral dosage  of metronidazole.
AB  == the gardnerella vaginalis syndrome (gvs) is characterized by a smelly vaginal discharge of ph greater than 5.2. the microscopic appearance of the discharge is  diagnostic. the gram stain shows masses of small gram variable bacilli which have a 'pepper and salt' pattern, and the wet film 'clue cells' and 'rafts' (floating  clumps of small bacilli). the amine test is an additional diagnostic aid. 30 patients with this syndrome were treated with 2 g of metronidazole in a single oral dosage. 29 patients were cured at one week and 2 patients had a recurrence four weeks later.

TI  == nonspecific vaginitis. diagnostic criteria and microbial and epidemiologic associations.
AB  == numerous previous studies of nonspecific vaginitis have yielded contradictory results regarding its cause and clinical manifestations, due to a lack of uniform case definition and laboratory methods. we studied 397 consecutive unselected female university students and applied sets of well defined criteria to distinguish nonspecific vaginitis from other forms of vaginitis and from normal findings. using such criteria, we diagnosed nonspecific vaginitis in up to 25 percent of our study population; asymptomatic disease was recognized in more than 50 percent of those with nonspecific vaginitis. a clinical diagnosis of nonspecific vaginitis, based on simple office procedures, was correlated with both the presence and the concentration of gardnerella vaginalis (hemophilus vaginalis) in vaginal discharge, and with characteristic biochemical findings in  vaginal discharge. nonspecific vaginitis was also correlated with a history of sexual activity, a history of previous trichomoniasis, current use of nonbarrier  contraceptive methods, and, particularly, use of an intrauterine device. g. vaginalis was isolated from 51.3 percent of the total population using a highly selective medium that detected the organism in lower concentration in vaginal discharge than did previously used media. practical diagnostic criteria for standard clinical use are proposed. application of such criteria should assist in clinical management of nonspecific vaginitis and in further study of the microbiologic and biochemical correlates and the pathogenesis of this mild but quite prevalent disease.

AB  == 25 patients with symptoms of non-specific vaginitis have been treated with metronidazole either 2000 mg in a single dose or 400 mg three times daily for 5 days. diagnosis was settled by 1) identification of g. vaginalis in culture of vaginal secretion, 2) the observation of clue cells in wet smear, 3) a positive amine test on application of potassium hydroxide, and 4) increased ph in the vaginal secretion. most patients' symptoms and complaints disappeared and at the  same time most of the tests used changed from abnormal to normal findings. no side effects were recorded. it is concluded, that metronidazole in either dose was a useful treatment of non-specific vaginitis.

AB  == nonspecific vaginitis causes diagnostic as well as therapeutic difficulties in gynecological private practice. in a study in 63 patients with "nonspecific" vaginitis, clinical parameters were related to the bacteriological isolation of g. vaginalis in order to try to find criteria which can help to make a correct diagnosis of "nonspecific vaginitis". these patients were treated with three different regimens of metronidazole, either 2000 mg as a single dose, or two single doses of 2000 mg each taken the first and the third day, or 400 mg 2 times daily for 7 days. patients with candida or trichomonas infections were excluded.  partners were treated at the same time, with the same regimen as the patient. the patients were controlled 14 and 28 days after the beginning of the treatment. the preliminary results showed that all regimens give good clinical effect, but the treatment with 2000 mg given as a single dose the first and the third days seems  to lead to fewer failures.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria as cause of infections in female genital organs.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria constitute a substantial component of the normal vaginal flora and of the outer cervical canal. consequently, one would expect infections emanating from the vaginal flora to be caused to a substantial degree by anaerobic bacteria. the anaerobes may contribute in colpitis, but their role is difficult to prove in this situation, since sampling only yields normal flora components. one clue that anaerobes may contribute to colpitis is the circumstance that the flora under those conditions differ from the normal situations. another is the circumstance that metronidazole, which only inhibits anaerobes, does reduce symptoms e.g. of colpitis in the presence of the microaerophilic gardnerella vaginalis, which is resistant to metronidazole (but sensitive to the metabolite hydroxymetronidazole). in the us, pelvic inflammatory disease (pid) is to a substantial degree apparently caused by anaerobic bacteria. our experience in scandinavia indicates that anaerobes are of neglible importance in this condition, since we rarely isolate anaerobes in spite of adequate sampling, transport and processing of specimens. we mostly find anaerobes in post-operative pid when the vaginal wall has been passed, or as a complication of pregnancy (puerperal fever, early rupture of membranes, abortion), and in connection with intrauterine devices. the role of anaerobes in bartholinitis is established. pid may be associated with appendicitis or colonic diverticulosis. anaerobes are regularly isolated from abscesses developing in the pelvic organs.  this also applies to tuboovarial and vulvovaginal abscesses. the most important anaerobic bacteria in infections of the female genital organs are bacteroides fragilis and other species of the fragilis group, b. melaninogenicus and related  species, other bacteroides, peptococci and peptostreptococci. clostridium perfringens rarely cause infections of female genital organs, although such conditions have a dramatic course.

TI  == detection of gardnerella vaginalis on vaginal smears by immunofluorescence.
AB  == an indirect fluorescence antibody (ifa) test was developed for the detection of gardnerella vaginalis. antisera were prepared in rabbits by using five strains of g. vaginalis. a pool of the antisera was tested for specificity with a variety of isolates known to colonize the human vagina and (or) morphologically resemble g.  vaginalis. six heterologous bacterial isolates reacted with the pooled antiserum  at dilutions of 1:10, but none reacted at the working dilution of 1:200. vaginal  swab specimens were collected from symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in order to further evaluate the ifa procedure. the presence of g. vaginalis in the specimens was determined both by culture and by the ifa procedure. absorbed antisera reacted with all isolates of g. vaginalis tested. in a clinical trial the ifa procedure detected the presence of g. vaginalis in smears from 23 (24.2%) of the patients with nonspecific vaginitis (nsv), from 22 (29.8%) of the asymptomatic individuals tested, and from 3 patients with vaginitis other than nsv. the presence of g. vaginalis in smears as detected by the ifa procedure was  confirmed by cultures in all cases using vaginalis agar supplemented with colistin and nalidixic acid (v-cna). it is suggested that the ifa procedure may be of use in conjunction with v-cna in epidemiological studies of the carriage and transmission of g. vaginalis in human populations. it appears that the ifa procedure, at least in our hands, is a useful test for the rapid detection of g.  vaginalis even when this microorganism is not the predominant colonizer of the human vagina.

TI  == comparison of mid catheter collection and suprapubic aspiration of urine for diagnosing bacteriuria due to fastidious micro-organisms.
AB  == we examined 40 female patients for the presence of fastidious bacteria in the bladder by culture of mid catheter and suprapubic aspiration urine specimens. gardnerella vaginalis and ureaplasma urealyticum were the most frequently isolated fastidious species. the suprapubic aspirate was positive in 3 patients with more than 10(5) colony-forming units per ml. gardnerella vaginalis and 7 with more than 10(2) colony-forming units per ml. ureaplasma urealyticum in the mid catheter urine specimen, while it was negative for bacteria in 6 patients with less than 10(4) colony-forming units per ml. coryneform bacilli or lactobacilli in the mid catheter urine specimen. the results show that culture of mid catheter urine samples provides a reasonable guide to the presence of bacteriuria owing to fastidious micro-organisms and can be used when a suprapubic aspiration specimen cannot be obtained easily.

TI  == pharmacokinetics of metronidazole and its principal metabolites and their activity against gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == the hydroxy metabolite of metronidazole was found to be more active against 21 strains of gardnerella vaginalis than the parent compound and less affected by culture in carbon dioxide. after 400 mg oral metronidazole (flagyl) plasma concentrations of the two agents were below the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) for most g vaginalis strains tested. with 2 g metronidazole the plasma concentrations exceeded the mics of the more sensitive strains. even with the lower dose of metronidazole clinically useful concentration of metronidazole and  its hydroxy metabolite were present in the urine. urinary excretion of these compounds may contribute to the efficacy of metronidazole in the treatment of vaginitis associated with g vaginalis.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of gardnerella vaginalis and bacteroides organisms, associated with nonspecific vaginitis, to sulfonamide preparations.
AB  == recent reports suggest that anaerobic bacteroides organisms are frequently found  with gardnerella vaginalis in nonspecific vaginitis. specimens taken from 96 women with vaginal discharge were tested simultaneously for these organisms. g. vaginalis was found in 73% of the specimens, bacteroides was found in 53%, and both organisms were found in 47%. sulfonamides have been widely used in the successful treatment of vaginitis. paradoxically, g. vaginalis is reported to be  resistant, and it has been suggested that it could be the vehicle of the drugs which effects the cure. little is known of the susceptibility of vaginal anaerobes to the sulfonamides. g. vaginalis and bacteroides isolates were therefore tested in vitro against the individual excipients of sulfonamide tablets, and minimal inhibitory concentration tests were also performed against the three active drugs. the excipients had no effect on g. vaginalis, but bacteroides strains were susceptible to the urea component. all strains of both organisms were susceptible to at least two of the three sulfonamides at high concentrations.

AB  == a comparison was made between human blood agar containing amphotericin b, nalidixic acid and either gentamicin or colistin for the isolation of gardnerella vaginalis from cases of non-specific vaginitis seen in a clinic for sexually transmitted diseases. the medium containing gentamicin was more inhibitory for non-gardnerella species, but not sufficiently inhibitory to allow direct plating  in the clinic without spreading for single colonies. the diffuse beta haemolysis  produced by g vaginalis on human, but not on horse blood agar, proved very useful in differentiating it from other vaginal organisms and was not affected by the antibiotics used. this characteristic, together with gram stain morphology, oxidase and catalase, provides a simple, reliable methods of identifying g vaginalis. sixty women with symptoms of vaginitis, in whom no other pathogen was  isolated, were examined by culture and microscopy. gardnerella vaginalis was grown from 45 whereas only 31 had positive microscopy (clue cells or gram-variable bacilli). there was no significant difference between the rate of isolation of g vaginalis in the group with positive microscopy (25/31) and that with negative microscopy (20/31).

AB  == in a study of 100 women with non-specific vaginitis, characterised by a vaginal discharge which was malodorous and pruritic in most cases and caused dyspareunia  and dysuria in some, gardnerella vaginalis was isolated in 46% of patients. when  present, g vaginalis was significantly associated with mycoplasma hominis and bacteroides species. isolation of g vaginalis was unrelated to the presenting symptoms. treatment with povidone-iodine pessaries for two weeks produced no pronounced benefit, either clinically or microbiologically, compared with a placebo. nevertheless, 68% of all patients followed reported improvement four weeks after the start of treatment. the findings suggest that g vaginalis is one  cause of non-specific vaginitis, which is more likely to be seen in women using oral contraceptives and is usually cured spontaneously.

TI  == gardnerella vaginalis (hemophilus vaginalis), an unusual cause of peritonitis in  c.a.p.d.
AB  == gardnerella vaginalis is usually associated with nonspecific bacterial vaginitis. this paper presents a capd patient with peritonitis due to g. vaginalis. the infection route remained speculative. treatment with gentamicin was not successful while the clinical signs of peritonitis disappeared within 24 hours after starting cefazolin.

TI  == identification of gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis.
AB  == different tests for the identification of gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis and for its differentiation from catalase-negative unclassified coryneforms from the  vagina were evaluated on over 200 bacterial strains, with special emphasis on optimal test conditions. a presumptive identification of g. vaginalis in the clinical laboratory can be made on the basis of colonial morphology, clear beta-hemolysis with diffuse edges on human blood bilayer-tween agar, a negative catalase test, and typical cell morphology in the gram stain. this procedure will correctly identify 90 to 98% of suspect colonies of g. vaginalis with human blood bilayer-tween agar as primary isolation medium. useful additional reactions for the confirmation of g. vaginalis include positive hippurate and starch hydrolysis, positive alpha-glucosidase but negative beta-glucosidase tests, the production of acid from glucose and maltose but not from mannitol, and susceptibility to disks containing metronidazole, nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides, and bile.

TI  == selective differential human blood bilayer media for isolation of gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis.
AB  == new selective and differential human blood bilayer agar media with tween 80 (hbt  medium) or without tween 80 (hb medium), developed for the isolation of gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis, permitted significantly higher g. vaginalis  isolation rates than have been obtained for other media used for this purpose. hb medium consists of a basal layer of columbia agar base containing colistin and naladixic acid with added amphotericin b and an overlayer of the same composition plus 5% human blood. hbt agar also contains proteose peptone no. 3 (difco laboratories) and tween 80 in the basal layer and the overlayer. both tween 80 and the bilayer composition enhanced g. vaginalis production of human blood hemolysis, permitting detection of this organism even in the presence of heavy growth of other vaginal flora. the use of hb or hbt medium thus permitted the demonstration that g. vaginalis was present in vaginal fluid from a large percentage (up to 68%) of normal women. however, the concentration of g. vaginalis was found by semiquantitative analysis to be significantly higher in vaginal fluid from women with nonspecific vaginitis than in fluid from normal women.

TI  == current therapy of vulvovaginitis.
AB  == trichomoniasis is reliably treated with a single 2-g dose of metronidazole; however, with this regimen simultaneous treatment of sexual partners is particularly important. trichomoniasis in pregnant women, who should not receive  metronidazole, might be treated initially with clotrimazole vaginal suppositories, which appear to cure about 50% of cases. topical antifungal agents of the imidazole class are superior to polyenes in treating vulvovaginal candidiasis. boric acid powder applied intravaginally in gelatin capsules for 14  days appears as effective as imidazoles. nonspecific vaginitis is now recognized  as involving infection with anaerobic bacteria of the vaginal flora as well as gardnerella vaginalis. the condition is most successfully treated with a seven-day course of metronidazole, which probably acts by eradicating the anaerobes. in addition, metabolites of metronidazole may act directly on g. vaginalis. sulfanilamide-aminacrine-allantoin preparations are much less effective than specific therapies and have no role in the treatment of vulvovaginitis.

AB  == in two general practices in perth, western australia, the most common microbiological causes of vaginal discomfort in 368 patients were candida albicans. gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis, trichomonas vaginalis and bacteroides fragilis. amongst patients with abnormal vaginal odour, with or without vaginitis, the most common cause of odour was g. vaginalis. the writers advocate that heavy growths of group b streptococci, escherichia coli, and enterococci should be considered to be the possible cause of vaginal discomfort.  this reinforces the need for care in collection, transportation, and microbiological examination of swabs of the female genital tract. as well as in the clinical interpretation of these reports.

TI  == nonspecific vaginosis.
AB  == nonspecific vaginosis (nsv) is a very common clinical syndrome with characteristic clinical, biochemical, and microbiologic features. there is a thin, malodorous homogeneous, grey, nonpurulent vaginal discharge. the discharge  usually has a ph greater than 4.5, contains "clue cells" on wet mount examination, and produces a "fishy" odor when mixed with 10% potassium hydroxide. the discharge contains an increased concentration of at least seven amines which  are presumably produced by bacterial decarboxylases; and several volatile and non-volatile organic acid metabolites of anaerobic bacteria. although the pathogenesis of nsv is not understood, the normal, lactobacillus-dominated microbial flora is replaced by gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis and certain anaerobic species. treatment with sulfonamide creams or oral tetracycline is usually ineffective. ampicillin is often effective, but metronidazole appears to  be the most effective antimicrobial for this condition. the optimal dose of metronidazole, and the need for treatment of sex partners, require further study.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria in nonspecific vaginitis.
AB  == to study the cause of nonspecific vaginitis, we analyzed vaginal fluid from normal women and from 53 women with nonspecific vaginitis, using quantitative anaerobic cultures and gas-liquid chromatography for short-chained organic-acid metabolites of the microbial flora. in normal vaginal fluid, lactate was the predominant acid, and the predominant organisms were lactobacillus and streptococcus species (lactate producers). in nonspecific vaginitis, lactate was  decreased, whereas succinate, acetate, butyrate, and propionate were increased, the predominant flora included gardnerella (haemophilus) vaginalis (acetate producer), and anaerobes, which included bacteroides species (succinate producers) and peptococcus species (butyrate and acetate producers). after metronidazole therapy, symptoms and signs of nonspecific vaginitis cleared, butyrate and propionate disappeared, and lactate and lactate-producing organisms  became predominant. we conclude that certain anaerobes act with g. vaginalis as causes of nonspecific vaginitis, and that a high ratio of succinate to lactate in vaginal fluid is a useful indicator in the diagnosis of this condition.

AB  == fifty-five strains received as haemophilus vaginalis or as catalase-negative coryneform bacteria from the vagina together with 61 marker cultures were subjected to numerical phenetic analyses using 149 unit characters. the data were examined using the simple matching (ssm), jaccard (sj) and pattern (dp) coefficients and clustering was achieved using the average linkage algorithm. cluster composition was not markedly affected by the coefficient used or by test  error, estimated at 6 . 5%. the h. vaginalis strains formed a tight cluster which was only distantly related to representatives of the genera arthrobacter, cellulomonas, corynebacterium sensu stricto, erysipelothrix, haemophilus, kurthia, lactobacillus, listeria and propionibacterium but shared a high overall  affinity to unclassified catalase-negative coryneforms which formed a discrete taxon, cluster 9. the h. vaginalis strains could be distinguished from the related strains in cluster 9 by several unrelated phenotypic characters. using the s1 endonuclease assay, dna-dna hybridizations were performed with representative strains from the numerical as well as with reference strains of bifidobacterium and actinomyces. haemophilus vaginalis was found to be a genotypically legitimate group and its dna showed little homology with dna from the marker strains tested. the dna base composition of h. vaginalis was 42 to 44  mol % guanine plus cytosine. a new genus should be created to incorporate strains known as h. vaginalis or corynebacterium vaginale. the name gardnerella vaginalis proposed by greenwood & pickett (1979) is supported.

TI  == metronidazole in treatment against haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the rate of bactericidal activity and inactivation of metronidazole was studied in time-kill curves with haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale). the minimum inhibitory concentrations of metronidazole for the eight strains tested ranged from 4 to 16 micrograms/ml. at a concentration of 20 micrograms/ml, metronidazole demonstrated a slow cidal effect against exponential-phase organisms, requiring 24 to 48 h for completion. inactivation of metronidazole during the time-kill curve was quite variable and averaged 28% of the starting concentration after 48 h. against stationary-phase organisms (inoculum, 10(10) to 10(11) colony-forming units per ml), a slow cidal effect was also seen, with an average inactivation of metronidazole of 38% after 48 h. at a subinhibitory concentration of 5 micrograms/ml, metronidazole was inactivated to the greatest degree (57% after 48 h). therefore, in contrast to earlier studies in which metronidazole was rapidly and consistently cidal within 4 h against obligate anaerobes and was almost completely inactivated by 8 h, the bactericidal effect of metronidazole againsts h. vaginalis in this study was much slower and was associated with a variable and slower rate of inactivation.

AB  == a total of 56 strains of haemophilus vaginalis were tested for their in vitro susceptibility to 21 antimicrobial agents by an agar dilution method. all strains were inhibited by 1 mug or less of penicillin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, and vancomycin per ml. the cephalosporins were less active; 4 mug of cefazolin per ml, 16 mug of cephalothin per ml, or 128 mug of cephalexin per ml was required to inhibit all strains. kanamycin, gentamicin, tobramycin, and neomycin were relatively inactive against h. vaginalis. all strains were inhibited by 4 mug of  streptomycin per ml and 2 mug of chloramphenicol per ml. only 57% of the strains  were inhibited by 4 mug of tetracycline per ml, whereas 43% were inhibited by 16  to 64 mug/ml. the combination sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim was relatively inactive against h. vaginalis. all strains tested exhibited minimal inhibitory concentrations of >/=128 mug when tested against colistin, nalidixic acid, and sulfadiazine. erythromycin and clindamycin were the most active of the antibiotics tested; for all strains the minimal inhibitory concentrations were </=0.06 mug/ml.

TI  == inhibition of haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale) by metronidazole,  tetracycline, and ampicillin.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ampicillin, tetracycline, and metronidazole for 71 strains of haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale)  were compared by use of an agar-dilution method and an inoculum of 10(6) organisms/ml. all strains were sensitive to 1 microgram of ampicillin/ml, 70% to  4 micrograms of tetracycline/ml, and only 13% of the strains to 8 micrograms of metronidazole/ml. under anaerobic conditions the susceptibility to metronidazole  increased markedly, and 48% of the strains were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml. in  determinations of mics in broth cultures, reduction of the inoculum size to 10(4) organisms/ml increased susceptibilities to metronidazole and tetracycline, whereas incubation of 48 hr instead of 24 hr decreased susceptibilities to these  two drugs. minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were generally two- to fourfold greater than the mics for the three drugs. the results demonstrate that  anaerobic conditions, inoculum size, and duration of incubation influence the susceptibility of h. vaginalis to antibiotics in vitro.

TI  == salient features of haemophilus vaginalis.
AB  == a total of 78 strains of haemophilus vaginalis were examined for 104 features. all strains fermented dextrin, maltose, and starch. additionally, more than 90% of the strains fermented galactose, glucose, and ribose. arbutin, cellobiose, melibiose, rhamnose, and salicin were not fermented by any of these strains. none of the strains acidified any of 14 alcohols or alkalinized any of 25 organic salts and amides. more than 90% of the strains hemolyzed human blood agar and hydrolyzed hippurate. no strain hemolyzed sheep blood agar. a recommendation is included for those minimal features that best differentiate h. vaginalis from other oxidase- and catalase-negative, gram-negative organisms.

TI  == factors affecting isolation and identification of haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the rate of isolation of organisms resembling haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale) from vaginal specimens was not significantly affected  by anaerobic versus carbon dioxide incubation atmospheres or whether specimens were inoculated on isolation media immediately after collection or after a delay  of 6 h. forty-one clinically isolated strains were provisionally divided into 30  h. vaginalis strains and 11 h. vaginalis-like (hvl) strains based on morphological and growth characteristics. the h. vaginalis strains were less reactive in api-20a identification test strips, (analytab products, inc.) using lombard-dowell broth, than in a modified basal medium that contained proteose peptone no. 3 (difco). the numbers and kinds of substrates fermented by 30 clinical and 2 reference strains of h. vaginalis varied among conventional, api,  minitek (baltimore biological laboratory), and rapid buffered substrate fermentation systems. a greater number and variety of carbohydrates were fermented by the 11 hvl strains more consistently in all four test systems. analysis of volatile and nonvolatile fermentation end products by gas-liquid chromatography did not reveal significant differences between the h. vaginalis and hvl strains. however, the latter group grew in peptone-yeast extract-glucose  broth, whereas the h. vaginalis strains did not grow without the addition of starch to peptone-yeast extract-glucose. all of the reference and clinical strains were similar in their susceptibilities to a variety of antimicrobial compounds except sulfonamides, which inhibited the hvl strains and bifidobacteria but not the h. vaginalis strains. sulfonamide susceptibility or resistance corresponded in part to the h. vaginalis and hvl-bifidobacteria strain reactions  on selected conventional fermentation substrates. susceptibility or resistance to sulfonamides and metronidazole in conjunction with fermentation tests is described to aid in the separation of h. vaginalis from other possibly unrecognized biotypes of h. vaginalis or other vaginal bacteria that presumptively resemble the organism. a human blood medium known as v agar was also of considerable value in distinguishing h. vaginalis from hvl strains, because only the h. vaginalis strains produced diffuse beta-hemolysis on v agar.

TI  == nonspecific vaginitis: role of haemophilus vaginalis and treatment with metronidazole.
AB  == to assess the cause of nonspecific vaginitis, we performed a prospective case-control study of vaginal flora and a randomized unblinded trial of different therapies. haemophilus vaginalis was isolated from 17 to 18 women with signs of vaginitis but only one of 18 normal matched controls (p less than 0.002). the concentration of anaerobic bacteria in vaginal washings also was increased in patients. clinical improvement and eradication of h. vaginalis occurred in one of seven patients given sulfonamide vaginal cream, two of 15 given oral doxycycline, nine of 27 given oral ampicillin, and 80 of 81 given oral metronidazole. on the seventh day of therapy signs of nonspecific vaginitis persisted in 31 of 31 with, and in two of 92 without, persistent h. vaginalis infection (p less than 0.001).  these data suggest the causal role of h. vaginalis in nonspecific vaginitis, possibly in concert with vaginal anaerobes. the widespread use of sulfonamide creams is inappropriate. metronidazole is effective, but its efficacy must be weighed against its possible toxicity.

AB  == haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale) was isolated from genital specimens from 150 women who came to a public health venereal disease clinic. forty-six patients returned to the clinic for at least one follow-up examination. of the returnees, 22 of 24 who initially had received adequate therapy (14 g ampicillin in seven days) were cured, compared with three of 22 who did not received adequate therapy (x2 = 25.11; p less than 0.00005). these data included  significant cure rates with adequate therapy among the 46 returnees, of whom 25 had vaginitis due to h. vaginalis only (x2 = 16.67; p less than 0.00005) and 21 had vaginitis caused by a mixture of pathogens (x2 = 5.86; p less than 0.0156). specimens obtained from 24 of the 46 returnees were cultured for h. vaginalis on  the second visit; 19 were negative, and only five were positive. clinical responses of the patients correlated closely with the results of culture in both  treated and untreated groups (x2 = 14.23; p less than 0.00016).

TI  == etiology of nongonococcal urethritis. evidence for chlamydia trachomatis and ureaplasma urealyticum.
AB  == chlamydia trachomatis, ureaplasma urealyticum (t-mycoplasma), and hemophilus vaginalis have previously been considered possible etiological agents in nongonococcal urethritis (ngu). in this study, current c. trachomatis infection was confirmed by culture and (or) micro-immunofluorescence serology in 26 of 69 men experiencing afirst episode of ngu, and 1 of 39 with no urethritis. serum igm immunofluorescent antibody to chlamydia was demonstrated in 16 of 20 men with chlamydia culture positive ngu, and 3 of 39 with chlamydia culture negative ng, and none of 34 with no urethritis. 9 of 10 culture positive men with less than or equal to 10 days symptoms developed immunofluorescent antibody seroconversion in  paired sera. u. realyticum was isolated significantly more often and in significantly higher concentration from first voided urine from chlamydia-negative cases of ngu than from chlamydia-positive ngu. ureaplasmacidal antibody titers increased fourfold in six men, four of whom had negative cultures for for unreaplasma. h. vaginalis was isolated from c9 of 33 men with no urethritis and 2 of 69 with ngu. c. trachomatis is susceptible, and u. urealyticum is resistant to sulfonamides. a 10-day course of sulfisoxazole therapy produced improvement in 13 of 13 chlamydia-positive, unreaplasma-negative, and only 14 of 29 chlamydia-negative, unreaplasma-positive  ngu cases (p less than 0.002). thus, culture, serology, and response to therapy support the etiologic role of chlamydia in ngu. quantitative culture and response to therapy suggest u. unrealyticum may cause many cases of chlamydia-netative ngu.

TI  == corynebacterium vaginale.
AB  == corynebacterium vaginale is a sexually transmitted organism which was first recognized in 1953. it appears to utilize glycogen stored in vaginal epithelial cells, causing a malodorous vaginal discharge characterized by an abnormally high ph (5.0 to 5.5) and composed mainly of epithelial cells and hordes of bacilli. infected men are asymptomatic, carry the organism for an unknown period of time,  and transmit it through intercourse. the organism requires five b-vitamins, purines, pyrimidines, and a fermentable carbohydrate; neither factors x nor v are required. it is not a member of genus haemophilus and is not likely to be a corynebacterium. appearing mainly gram-negative, it has many characteristics of gram-positive organisms including its pattern of sensitivity to antibiotics and the possession of certain enzyme systems. as the cause of bacterial vaginitis, c. vaginale may be the most prevalent sexually-transmitted organism.

TI  == importance of the so-called 'other' sexually-transmitted diseases.
AB  == (1) some data are presented concerning the frequency and potential morbidity of sexually-transmitted organisms other than t. pallidum or n. gonorrhoeae. (2) most of the diseases with which these organisms are associated are more prevalent than syphilis and some, at least in one sex, are as common as gonorrhoea. a number appear to carry considerable morbidity, which in the case of type ii herpes virus--if it is responsible for cervical cancer--may ultimately cause more fatalities than syphilis. (3) it is concluded: (a) that, if syphilis and gonorrhoea were reduced to the point of representing no public health concern, many other sexually-transmitted conditions would still remain to pose significant problems: and (b) that health education and other methods of prevention should, where possible, be designed to take into consideration the epidemiological implications of the other organisms listed.
