TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of phosphoric acid solution compared to other root canal irrigants.
AB  - Phosphoric acid has been suggested as an irrigant due to its effectiveness in removing the smear layer. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to compare the antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of a 37% phosphoric acid solution to other irrigants commonly used in endodontics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The substances 37% phosphoric acid, 17% EDTA, 10% citric acid, 2% chlorhexidine (solution and gel), and 5.25% NaOCl were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity was tested against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Actinomyces meyeri, Parvimonas micra, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella nigrescens according to the agar diffusion method. The cytotoxicity of the irrigants was determined by using the MTT assay. RESULTS: Phosphoric acid presented higher antimicrobial activity compared to the other tested irrigants. With regard to the cell viability, this solution showed results similar to those with 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution), whereas 17% EDTA and 10% citric acid showed higher cell viability compared to other irrigants. CONCLUSION: Phosphoric acid demonstrated higher antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity similar to that of 5.25% NaOCl and 2% chlorhexidine (gel and solution).
TI  - Chemical Constituents and Evaluation of Antimicrobial and Cytotoxic Activities of Kielmeyera coriacea Mart. & Zucc. Essential Oils.
AB  - Many essential oils (EOs) of different plant species possess interesting antimicrobial effects on buccal microorganisms and cytotoxic properties. EOs of Kielmeyera coriacea Mart. & Zucc. were analyzed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The EO from leaves is rich in sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and oxygenated sesquiterpenes. The three major compounds identified were germacrene-D (24.2%), (E)-caryophyllene (15.5%), and bicyclogermacrene (11.6%). The inner bark EO is composed mainly of sesquiterpenes hydrocarbons and the major components are alpha-copaene (14.9%) and alpha-(E)-bergamotene (13.0%). The outer bark EO is composed mainly of oxygenated sesquiterpenes and long-chain alkanes, and the major components are alpha-eudesmol (4.2%) and nonacosane (5.8%). The wood EO is mainly composed of long-chain alkanes and fatty acids, and the major components are nonacosane (9.7%) and palmitic acid (16.2%). The inner bark EO showed the strongest antimicrobial activity against the anaerobic bacteria Prevotella nigrescens (minimum inhibitory concentration-MIC of 50 microg mL(-1)). The outer bark and wood EOs showed MICs of 100 microg mL(-1) for all aerobic microorganisms tested. The EOs presented low toxicity to Vero cells. These results suggest that K. coriacea, a Brazilian plant, provide initial evidence of a new and alternative source of substances with medicinal interest.
TI  - Salivary Microbiota Associated with Immunoglobulin A Nephropathy.
AB  - This study aimed at investigating the salivary microbiota of 28 patients affected by immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN). Fourteen healthy volunteers (HC) were used as control. Compared to HC, the number of some cultivable bacteria groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in the salivary samples of IgAN patients. Total bacteria from salivary samples of IgAN patients and HC subjects were analyzed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene. Paired t test showed no significant (P > 0.05) differences of alpha-diversity parameters (OTU, ACE, Chao1, and Shannon index) between the salivary samples of HC and IgAN patients. The difference for the community structure was further analyzed using three phylogeny-based beta-diversity measures. Compared to HC, the ratio between Firmicutes/Proteobacteria markedly decreased in IgAN patients. Gemella haemolysins, Granulicatella adiacens, and Veillonella parvula were positively associated (P < 0.05) with HC. Within the phylum Bacteroidetes, Prevotella species (Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella pallens, and Prevotella salivae) were the highest in HC. The only exception was for Prevotella aurantiaca. Compared to HC, the percentage of abundance of some species, belonging to Pasteurellaceae family (e.g., Haemophylus parainfluenzae), increased in IgAN patients. Fusobacteriaceae (Fusobacterium) and Corynebacterium sp. also differed between the salivary samples of HC and IgAN patients.
TI  - Microbial diversity of the supra- and subgingival biofilm of healthy individuals  after brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles.
AB  - Nanoparticulate silver has recently been reported as an effective antimicrobial agent. The aim of this clinical study was to investigate the potential changes on the oral microbiota of healthy individuals after controlled brushing with chlorhexidine- or silver-coated toothbrush bristles. Twenty-four healthy participants were enrolled in this investigation and randomly submitted to 3 interventions. All the participants received, in a crossover format, the following toothbrushing interventions: (i) chlorhexidine-coated bristles, (ii) silver-coated bristles, and (iii) conventional toothbrush (Control). All the interventions had a duration of 30 days. The DNA checkerboard hybridization method was used to identify and quantify up to 43 microbial species colonizing the supra- and subgingival biofilm. The supragingival samples presented higher genome counts than the subgingival samples (p < 0.0001). The total genome counts from the Control group showed the highest values, followed by the silver and chlorhexidine groups (p < 0.0001). After 4 weeks of brushing, the silver-coated and chlorhexidine-coated bristles were capable of reducing or maintaining lower levels of the bacterial counts of the putative periodontal pathogens Tanerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Other major periodontal pathogens, such as Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Parvimonas micra, were also detected at lower levels. The toothbrush bristles impregnated with silver nanoparticles reduced the total and individual genome count in the supra- and subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. Chlorhexidine was not effective in reducing the total genome counts in both supra- or subgingival biofilm after 4 weeks of brushing. Chlorhexidine reduced the individual genome counts in the supragingival biofilm for most of the target species, including putative periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Intraindividual variation in core microbiota in peri-implantitis and periodontitis.
AB  - The oral microbiota change dramatically with each part of the oral cavity, even within the same mouth. Nevertheless, the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis and periodontitis have been considered the same. To improve our knowledge of the different communities of complex oral microbiota, we compared the microbial features between peri-implantitis and periodontitis in 20 patients with both diseases. Although the clinical symptoms of peri-implantitis were similar to those of periodontitis, the core microbiota of the diseases differed. Correlation analysis revealed the specific microbial co-occurrence patterns and found some of the species were associated with the clinical parameters in a disease-specific manner. The proportion of Prevotella nigrescens was significantly higher in peri-implantitis than in periodontitis, while the proportions of Peptostreptococcaceae sp. and Desulfomicrobium orale were significantly higher in periodontitis than in peri-implantitis. The severity of the peri-implantitis was also species-associated, including with an uncultured Treponema sp. that correlated to 4 clinical parameters. These results indicate that peri-implantitis and periodontitis are both polymicrobial infections with different causative pathogens. Our study provides a framework for the ecologically different bacterial communities between peri-implantitis and periodontitis, and it will be useful for further studies to understand the complex microbiota and pathogenic mechanisms of oral polymicrobial diseases.
TI  - Microbial profile of root canals of primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion.
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to assess the microbial content of root canals of human primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion. METHODS: Microbial samples were collected from 24 canals of children treated at a pediatric dentistry clinic. Microbiological identification was performed using checker-board DNA-DNA hybridization for 40 different bacteria. Data were analyzed per canal based on the mean count and frequency of each bacterial species. RESULTS: Detectable levels of bacterial species were observed for 35 probes (88%). The most frequent bacteria were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum, Fusobacterium periodonticum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella nigrescens, and Prevotella intermedia. Facultative species were identified in 20 root canals (83%), anaerobic species were identified in 24 root canals (100%), and aerobic species in 18 root canals (75%). Black-pigmented bacilli were found in 23 samples (96%). The number of different bacterial species detected per canal ranged from five to 33. CONCLUSION: Endodontic infection in primary teeth with pulp necrosis and periradicular lesion is multimicrobial, including aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic micro-organisms.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of necrotic pulp and fistulae in primary teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Primary teeth work as guides for the eruption of permanent dentition, contribute for the development of the jaws, chewing process, preparing food for digestion, and nutrient assimilation. Treatment of pulp necrosis in primary teeth is complex due to anatomical and physiological characteristics and high number of bacterial species present in endodontic infections. The bacterial presence alone or in association in necrotic pulp and fistula samples from primary teeth of boys and girls was evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Necrotic pulp (103) and fistula (7) samples from deciduous teeth with deep caries of 110 children were evaluated. Bacterial morphotypes and species from all clinical samples were determined. RESULTS: A predominance of gram-positive cocci (81.8%) and gram-negative coccobacilli (49.1%) was observed. In 88 out of 103 pulp samples, a high prevalence of Enterococcus spp. (50%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (49%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (25%) and Prevotella nigrescens (11.4%) was observed. Porphyromonas gingivalis was detected in three out of seven fistula samples, Enterococcus spp. in two out of seven samples, and F. nucleatum, P. nigrescens and D. pneumosintes in one out of seven samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Enterococcus spp. and P. gingivalis were prevalent in necrotic pulp from deciduous teeth in boys from 2 to 5 years old, and that care of the oral cavity of children up to five years of age is important.
TI  - Comparison of endotoxin levels found in primary and secondary endodontic infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: This clinical study was conducted to compare the levels of endotoxins (lipopolysaccharides [LPSs]) found in primary and secondary endodontic infections with apical periodontitis by correlating LPS contents with clinical/radiographic findings. In addition, the presence of target gram-negative anaerobic bacteria was also investigated. METHODS: Samples were taken from 15 root canals with primary infections and 15 with secondary infections by using paper points. The limulus amebocyte lysate assay was used to quantify endotoxins, and the polymerase chain reaction technique (16S rDNA) was used for bacterial investigation. RESULTS: Endotoxins were detected in 100% of the root canal samples collected from primary (15/15) and secondary (15/15) infections with median values of 7.49 EU/mL and 3.96 EU/mL, respectively (P < .05). The median value of endotoxins found in the presence of clinical symptoms was significantly higher than in asymptomatic teeth with primary infections (P < .05). A positive correlation was found between endotoxin contents and a larger size of the radiolucent area (>3 mm) (P < .05). Prevotella nigrescens (10/15, 4/15), Fusobacterium nucleatum (5/15, 1/15), Treponema denticola (3/15, 1/15), and Treponema socranskii (5/15, 1/15) were detected in teeth with primary and secondary infections, respectively. P. endodontalis was present only in teeth with primary infections (5/15). CONCLUSIONS: Teeth with primary endodontic infections had higher contents of endotoxins and a more complex gram-negative bacterial community than teeth with secondary infections. Moreover, the levels of endotoxins were related to the severity of bone destruction in periapical tissues as well as the development of clinical features in teeth with primary infections.
TI  - Subgingival microbiota from Cebus apella (capuchin monkey) with different periodontal conditions.
AB  - This present study evaluated the subgingival microbiota of the Cebus apella with  different periodontal conditions kept by the Tufted Capuchin Monkey Procreation Center (Sao Paulo State University - UNESP) or free-ranging monkeys. For this purpose, clinical specimens of subgingival biofilm were collected from 52 monkeys, of both genders, 40 kept in captivity and 12 free-ranging monkeys. The primates were submitted to periodontal evaluation and biofilm samples were transferred to VMGA III transport medium and ultrapure water. The microbiota was cultivated in selective and non-selective culture media and microbial DNA was extracted and the presence of periodontal pathogens was evaluated using PCR and real-time PCR. The actinomycetes, fusobacteria, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, black-pigmented Gram-negative anaerobic rods, Tannerella forsythia, staphylococci and streptococci represent the predominantly detected microorganisms. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Dialister pneumosintes and Prevotella nigrescens were rarely observed, whereas Treponema denticola was not found. Populations of C. rectus, E. corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, T. forsythia and the total microbial load were significantly higher in animals with bone loss and, in smaller extension, in animals with gingival bleeding.
TI  - Quantification of cultivable bacteria and endotoxin in post-treatment apical periodontitis before and after chemo-mechanical preparation.
AB  - This clinical study was conducted to quantify cultivable bacteria and endotoxin in root canals with post-treatment apical periodontitis by correlating their levels with clinical features and to evaluate the effect of chemo-mechanical preparation (CMP) with 2 % chlorhexidine gel + 17 % EDTA on bacterial and endotoxin removal/elimination. Moreover, target strict Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fifteen teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis were sampled before (s1) and after (s2) CMP. Culture techniques determined the number of colony-forming units (CFU). PCR (16S rDNA) and limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay were used for bacterial and endotoxin detection, respectively. Prevotella nigrescens (4/15), Prevotella intermedia (2/15), and Tannerella forsythia (2/15) were the most frequently detected species. Endotoxin was recovered in 100 % of the samples. At s1, bacteria and endotoxin were detected at a median value of 5.14 x 10(3) CFU/mL and 3.96 EU/mL, respectively. Higher levels of endotoxin were related to a larger size of radiolucent area (>5 mm) (p < 0.05). CMP was more effective in reducing bacteria (99.61 %) than endotoxin (60.6 %) (both p < 0.05). Our findings indicated that the levels of endotoxin found in infected root canals were related to a larger size of radiolucent area in the periapical region. Moreover, CMP was effective in reducing both bacterial and endotoxin contents in post-treatment apical periodontitis.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - The effect of a single episode of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy in the treatment of experimental periodontitis. Microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in the dog mandible.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a single application of antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT) on microbiological profile and cytokine pattern in dogs. Periodontal disease was induced by placing 3.0 silk ligatures around the mandibular pre-molars bilaterally during 8 weeks. The dogs were randomly treated with aPDT using a dye/laser system, scaling and root planning (SRP), or with the association of treatments (SRP + aPDT). Plaque samples were collected at baseline, 1, 3, and 4 weeks, and the mean counts of 40 species were determined using DNA-DNA hybridization. Gingival biopsies were removed and the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1), interleukin (IL) 6, IL-10 and total bacterial load by analysis of 16 S rRNA gene were evaluated through real-time PCR. The results shows that the levels of the majority of the species were reduced 1 week post-therapy for all treatments, however, an increase in counts of Prevotella intermedia (p = 0.00), Prevotella. nigrescens (p = 0.00) and Tannerella forsythia (p = 0.00) was observed for aPDT and SRP + aPDT. After 4 weeks, a regrowth of Porphyromonas gingivalis (p = 0.00) and Treponema denticola (p = 0.00), was observed for all treatments. Also, a strikingly reduction of counts on counts of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was observed for the aPDT (p = 0.00). For the cytokine pattern, the results were similar for all treatments, and a reduction in the expression of cytokines and bacterial load was observed throughout the study. Our results suggest that SRP, aPDT in a single application, and SRP + aPDT affects different bacterial species and have similar effects on the expression of cytokines evaluated during the treatment of ligature-induced periodontitis.
TI  - Microbiota of deciduous endodontic infections analysed by MDA and Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate the microbiota of endodontic infections in deciduous teeth by Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization after uniform amplification of DNA in samples by multiple displacement amplification (MDA). METHODOLOGY: Forty samples from the root canal system of deciduous teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis with or without radiographically detectable periradicular/interradicular bone resorption were collected and 32 were analysed, with three individuals contributing two samples; these were MDA-amplified and analysed by Checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization for levels of 83 bacterial taxa. Two outcome measures were used: the percentage of teeth colonized by each species and the mean proportion of each bacterial taxon present across all samples. RESULTS: The mean amount of DNA in the samples prior to amplification was 5.2 (+/-4.7) ng and 6.1 (+/-2.3) mug after MDA. The mean number of species detected per sample was 19 (+/-4) (range: 3-66) to the nearest whole number. The most prevalent taxa were Prevotella intermedia (96.9%), Neisseria mucosa (65.6%), Prevotella nigrescens (56.2%) and Tannerella forsythia (56.2%). Aggregatibacter (Haemophilus) aphrophilus and Helicobacter pylori were not detected. P. intermedia (10%), Prevotella tannerae (7%) and Prevotella nigrescens (4.3%) presented the highest mean proportions of the target species averaged across the positive samples. CONCLUSION: Root canals of infected deciduous teeth had a diverse bacterial population. Prevotella sp. were commonly found with P. intermedia, Prevotella tannerae and Prevotella nigrescens amongst the most prominent species detected.
TI  - Detection of periodontopathogenic bacteria in pregnant women by traditional anaerobic culture method and by a commercial molecular genetic method.
AB  - To culture facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria is a well-established method for analyzing subgingival plaque samples. Micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus (HAIN Lifescience GmbH, Nehren, Germany) tests are two commercially available rapid PCR-based methods for the identification and quantification of putative periodontopathogen bacteria. In this study, we compared these commercial PCR-based hybridization methods with conventional anaerobic culture technique. A total of 36 subgingival plaque samples were collected from periodontal pockets of pregnant women with chronic localized periodontitis. Aliquots of these samples were evaluated with species-specific probes provided by micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests simultaneously, and from the same samples anaerobic and capnophylic bacteria were cultured on selective media. The overall agreement between both methods was excellent for Eubacterium nodatum, Tannerella forsythia and Porphyromonas gingivalis (97-92%), fair for Capnocytophaga sp, Eikenella corrodens, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia (91-89%) and poor for Fusobacterium nucleatum, Parvimonas micra (Micromonas micros), and Campylobacter rectus (86-78%). Discrepancies in the results may be explained by inability of culture method to distinguish between closely related taxa (e.i P. intermedia/Prevotella. nigrescens), and problems of keeping periodontopathogen bacteria viable, which is required for successful detection by standard culture method. Nucleic acid-based methods may replace cultivation method as frequently used methods in microbiological diagnosis of progressive periodontitis, thus micro-IDent and micro-IDent Plus tests can be recommended where culture of periodontopathogenic bacteria is not performed in routine microbiology laboratories to analyze subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria in atherosclerotic plaques from coronary arteries.
AB  - Oral pathogens, including periodontopathic bacteria, are thought to be aetiological factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. In this study, the presence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens and Tannerella forsythia in atheromatous plaques from coronary arteries was determined by real-time PCR. Forty-four patients displaying cardiovascular disease were submitted to periodontal examination and endarterectomy of coronary arteries. Approximately 60-100 mg atherosclerotic tissue was removed surgically and DNA was obtained. Quantitative detection of periodontopathic bacteria was performed using universal and species-specific TaqMan probe/primer sets. Total bacterial and periodontopathic bacterial DNA were found in 94.9 and 92.3 %, respectively, of the atheromatous plaques from periodontitis patients, and in 80.0 and 20.0 %, respectively, of atherosclerotic tissues from periodontally healthy subjects. All periodontal bacteria except for the F. nucleatum-periodonticum-simiae group were detected, and their DNA represented 47.3 % of the total bacterial DNA obtained from periodontitis patients. Porphyromonas gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans and Prevotella intermedia were detected most often. The presence of two or more periodontal species could be observed in 64.1 % of the samples. In addition, even in samples in which a single periodontal species was detected, additional unidentified microbial DNA could be observed. The significant number of periodontopathic bacterial DNA species in atherosclerotic tissue samples from patients with periodontitis suggests that the presence of these micro-organisms in coronary lesions is not coincidental and that they may in fact contribute to the development of vascular diseases.
TI  - Prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., isolated from the human oral cavity.
AB  - Two anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped strains isolated from the human oral cavity, OMA31(T) and OMA130, were characterized by determining their phenotypic and biochemical features, cellular fatty acid profiles and phylogenetic positions based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the new isolates belonged to a single species of the genus Prevotella. The two isolates showed 100 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with each other and were most closely related to Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611(T) with 96.4 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity; the next most closely related strains to the isolates were Prevotella pallens AHN 10371(T) (96.1 %) and Prevotella falsenii JCM 15124(T) (95.3 %). Phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of P. intermedia JCM 12248(T), P. falsenii JCM 15124(T) and Prevotella nigrescens JCM 12250(T). The isolates could be differentiated from P. pallens JCM 11140( T) by mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. Conventional biochemical tests were unable to differentiate the new isolates from P. intermedia, P. falsenii and P. nigrescens. However, hsp60 gene sequence analysis suggested that strain OMA31(T) was not a representative of P. intermedia, P. pallens, P. falsenii or P. nigrescens. Based on these data, a novel species of the genus Prevotella, Prevotella aurantiaca sp. nov., is proposed, with OMA31(T) (=JCM 15754(T)=CCUG 57723(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Prevotella falsenii sp. nov., a Prevotella intermedia-like organism isolated from monkey dental plaque.
AB  - Eight anaerobic, pigmented, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative, rod-shaped strains  isolated from monkey oral cavities were characterized phenotypically and chemotaxonomically and their phylogenetic positions were determined using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that these isolates represent a single species of the genus Prevotella. These strains were most closely related to Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611(T), with 95.0 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity. The next most closely related species were Prevotella pallens and Prevotella nigrescens (92.7 and 92.1 % similarity to the respective type strains). The phenotypic and biochemical characteristics of the isolates were the same as those of P. intermedia JCM 12248(T) and P. nigrescens JCM 12250(T). The isolates could be differentiated from P. pallens JCM 11140(T) on the basis of mannose fermentation and alpha-fucosidase activity. The isolates could not be distinguished from P. intermedia or P. nigrescens using conventional biochemical tests. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed the genomic distinctiveness of these eight strains with respect to P. pallens JCM 11140(T), P. intermedia JCM 12248(T) and P. nigrescens JCM 12250(T). On the basis of these data, strains 04013, 04021, 04043, 04052(T), 0406, 04113, 04111 and 04161 represent a novel Prevotella species, for which the name Prevotella falsenii sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 04052(T) (=JCM 15124(T) =CCUG 56137(T)).
TI  - Microbial analysis of canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the presence of nine bacterial species in root-filled teeth associated with periapical lesions using a polymerase chain reaction analysis and to correlate these species with clinical features of the cases. DNA was extracted from 45 canal samples of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions. A PCR assay using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region was used for microbial detection. Enterococcus faecalis was the most prevalent species, detected in 77.8% of the study teeth, followed by Peptostreptococcus micros, detected in 51.1%. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Prevotella nigrescens were detected in 35.6%, 22.2%, 11.1%, and 11.1% of the sampled teeth, respectively. Moreover, PCR detected Filifactor alocis in 26.7%, Treponema denticola in 24.4%, and Tannerella forsythia in 4.4% of the samples. T. denticola and P. micros were statistically associated with tenderness to percussion (p < 0.05). P. nigrescens was associated with the presence of spontaneous pain and abscess (p < 0.05). P. endodontalis and P. nigrescens were associated with purulent exudates (p < 0.05). Synergistic relationship was also observed between some species. The results of this study indicated that E. faecalis was the most frequently identified test species by PCR in teeth with failing endodontic treatment.
TI  - An examination of 'unidentified' Prevotella (formerly PINLO) using RAPD-PCR and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing.
AB  - Prevotella intermedia- and Prevotella nigrescens-like organisms (PINLO) have been described as organisms which are phenotypically and biochemically similar to P. intermedia and P. nigrescens and the species P. pallens was created to include some of them. Other PINLO groups which do not fit the definition of P. pallens exist, and in this study these 'unidentified' Prevotella sp. were compared with P. corporis, P. intermedia, P. nigrescens and P. pallens using commercial identification kits, GLC, RAPD-PCR and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The Rapid ID 32 A and the RapID ANA II system both identified all 'unidentified' Prevotella as P. intermedia. Similarly they gave this identification to all the species tested (with the exception of P. corporis using the RapID ANA II system) clearly demonstrating biochemical similarities. Gas liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis of the volatile end-products of fermentation could not distinguish between strains. RAPD-PCR using arbitrary primer L10 demonstrated intra-species homogeneity within PINLO strains with amplification profiles which differed from other Prevotella species tested. Cluster analysis of the amplification profiles confirmed species divisions and yielded a distinct 'unidentified' Prevotella cluster. Comparison of partial 16S rDNA sequences displayed 98% sequence similarity between the 'unidentified' Prevotella strains, although 2 strains, HST 1156 and HST 2160 displayed 100% identity. The highest similarity between groups was seen between 'unidentified' Prevotella strains and P. corporis (approximately 94% similarity). The DNA techniques used here confirm that 'unidentified' Prevotella strains are distinct from the other species of Prevotella tested, including P. pallens. Partial 16S rDNA sequence comparisons suggested a close relationship with P. corporis.
TI  - Prevalence of periodontopathic bacteria in aggressive periodontitis patients in a Chilean population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is considered a major etiologic  agent of aggressive periodontitis (AgP). Other periodontopathic bacteria such as Porphyromonas gingivalis are also suspected of participating in aggressive periodontitis although the evidence to support this is controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of eight periodontopathic bacteria in Chilean patients with AgP. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected from 36 aggressive, 30 localized, and six generalized periodontitis patients. Samples from 17 advanced chronic periodontitis (CP) patients were taken as controls. Samples collected from the four deepest periodontal pockets in each patient were pooled in prereduced transport fluid (RTF) and cultured. Periodontal bacteria were primarily identified by colony morphology under stereoscopic microscope and rapid biochemical tests. The identity of some bacterial isolates was confirmed by colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: AgP showed a significatively higher prevalence of C. rectus than CP (P = 0.036). The only statistical difference found was for C. rectus. Patients with AgP showed a higher, but not statistically significant, prevalence of P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. A similar prevalence in both groups of patients was observed for F. nucleatum and P. intermedia/nigrescens, and A. actinomycetemcomitans was less prevalent in AgP than CP patients. In localized AgP, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, F. nucleatum, and P. micros were the more prevalent pathogens in contrast to generalized AgP patients who harbored A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, and Capnocytophaga sp. as the most prevalent bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: C. rectus, P. gingivalis, E. corrodens, P. micros, and Capnocytophaga sp. were the most predominant periodontopathic bacteria of AgP in this Chilean population, but the only statistical difference found here between AgP and CP was for C. rectus, suggesting that the differences in clinical appearance may be caused by factors other than the microbiological composition of the subgingival plaque of these patients. In this study, the prevalence of A. actinomycetemcomitans was much lower than that of P. gingivalis.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens in endodontic lesions detected by culture and by PCR.
AB  - he aim of this study was to investigate the presence of four black-pigmented bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia and Prevotella nigrescens, in endodontic infections by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses. Microbial samples were obtained from 50 teeth with untreated necrotic pulps (primary infection) and from 50 teeth with failing endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Microbiological strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation, and identification. For PCR detection, the samples were analyzed using species-specific primers of 16S rDNA and the downstream intergenic spacer region. Culture and PCR detected the test species in 13/100 and 50/100 of the study teeth, respectively. The organisms were cultured from 11/50 (22%) of primarily infected root canal samples and from 2/50 (4%) of secondary root canal samples. PCR detection identified the target species in 32/50 (64%) and 18/50 (36%) of primary and secondary infections, respectively. P. gingivalis was rarely isolated by culture methods (1%), but was the most frequently identified test species by PCR (38%). Similarly, P. endodontalis was not recovered by culture from any tooth studied, but was detected by PCR in 25% of the sampled teeth. PCR-based identification also showed higher detection rates of P. intermedia (33%) and P. nigrescens (22%) than culture (13%). In conclusion, P. gingivalis, P. endodontalis, P. intermedia, and P. nigrescens were identified more frequently in teeth with necrotic pulp than in teeth with failing endodontic treatment. Also, a higher frequency of black-pigmented species was detected by PCR than by culture.
TI  - Microbiological examination of infected dental root canals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the root canal microbiota of primary and secondary root-infected canals and the association of constituent species with specific endodontic signs and symptoms. METHODS: Microbial samples were taken from 60 root canals, 41 with necrotic pulp tissues (primary infection) and 19 with failed endodontic treatment (secondary infection). Strict anaerobic techniques were used for serial dilution, plating, incubation and identification. RESULTS: A total of 224 cultivable isolates were recovered belonging to 56 different bacterial species. Individual root canals yielded a maximum of 10 bacterial species. Of the bacterial isolates, 70% were either strict anaerobes or microphilic. The anaerobes most frequently isolated were: Peptostreptococcus micros (35%), Fusobacterium necrophorum (23.3%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (11.7%), Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (16.7%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6.7%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (5%). The root canal microflora of untreated teeth with apical periodontitis was found to be mixed, comprising gram-negative and gram-positive and mostly anaerobic microorganisms and usually containing more than 3 species per canal. On the other hand, facultative anaerobic and gram-positive bacteria predominated in canals with failed endodontic treatment, which harbored 1-2 species per canal. Suggested relationships were found between anaerobes, especially gram-negatives, and the presence or history of pain, tenderness to percussion and swelling (P<0.05). In particular, associations were found between: a) pain (n=29) and P. micros (P<0.01), P. intermedia/nigrescens and Eubacterium spp. (both P<0.05); b) history of pain (n=31) and P. micros (P<0.01) Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); c) tenderness to percussion (n=29) and Porphyromonas spp. (P<0.01), Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.001); d) swelling (n=20) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P<0.01), Porphyromonas and Enterococcus spp. (P<0.05); e) wet canals (n=33) and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); f) purulent exudate (n=20) and Porphyromonas, Peptostreptococcus and Fusobacterium spp. (P<0.05); previous endodontic treatment and Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus spp., P. micros, F. necrophorum (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate potential complex interactions of species resulting in characteristic clinical pictures which cannot be achieved by individual species alone. They also indicate that the microbiota of primary infected canals with apical periodontitis differs in number and in species from the secondary infected canals by using the culture technique.
TI  - Gingival crevice microbiota from Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing  ulcerative gingivitis.
AB  - The objective of this study was to quantitatively compare the bacterial population structure in plaque from the gingival margin of two groups of 21 Chinese patients with gingivitis or necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG). Subjects were recruited in four dental clinics in Eastern China. Samples were quantitatively assessed by immunofluorescence and fluorescent in situ hybridization for taxa known to be associated with periodontal diseases. The analyses showed that the fusiform taxa (Fusobacterium nucleatum/Fusobacterium periodonticum, Leptotrichia buccalis, Tannerella forsythensis, and Capnocytophaga sp.), Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella nigrescens, Selenomonas sputigena, and treponemes were present in both groups with high prevalence. Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinomyces gerencseriae were much more prevalent in the NUG group. Quantitatively, most taxa, including P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum and the treponemes, accounted, on average, for < 3% of the total bacterial cell number. Only P. intermedia/P. nigrescens, P. gingivalis, S. sputigena, A. gerencseriae, and the sum of all monitored suspected periodontal pathogens were significantly increased in the NUG group. The present study demonstrates for both groups a highly diverse plaque composition and suggests that, etiologically, the overall concentration and the concerted effects of the entire group of opportunistic pathogens thriving in NUG-associated plaque are of prime importance.
TI  - Effects of triclosan-containing rinse on the dynamics and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro plaque ecosystems.
AB  - Dental plaque microcosms were established under a feast-famine regimen within constant-depth film fermentors and exposed four times daily postfeeding to a triclosan (TR)-containing rinse (dentifrice) (TRD). This was diluted so that the antimicrobial content was 0.6 mg/ml. Microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) with primers specific for the V2-V3 region of the eubacterial 16S rRNA gene (rDNA). Dominant isolates and PCR amplicons were identified by partial sequencing of 16S rDNA. TRD caused considerable decreases in the counts of both gram-negative organisms and total anaerobic cells, transiently lowered the numbers of streptococci and actinomycetes, and markedly increased the proportion of lactobacilli. DGGE indicated the presence of putatively unculturable bacteria and showed that a Porphyromonas sp. and Selenomonas infelix had been inhibited by TRD. Pure culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Neisseria subflava, Prevotella nigrescens, and Porphyromonas gingivalis were highly susceptible to TR, while the lactobacilli and streptococci were the least susceptible. Clonal expansion of the lactobacilli in the pulsed microcosm could be explained on the basis of TR activity. The mean MICs of TR, chlorhexidine, erythromycin, penicillin V, and vancomycin for the population before and after 5 days of exposure to TRD showed few significant changes. In conclusion, changes in plaque microcosm populations following repeated exposure to TRD showed inhibition of the most susceptible flora and clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - Localized aggressive periodontitis in primary dentition: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 5-year-old Japanese boy presented with persistent gingival inflammation and severe mobility of the right lower primary incisors. Due to severe alveolar bone loss and a deep periodontal pocket (5 mm), the incisors were extracted at the second visit. METHODS: Clinical, radiographic, histological, and microbiological examinations were carried out. Then, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was employed to detect specific periodontal pathogens. The chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was also measured. RESULTS: Tannerella, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, and Eikenella sp. were recovered from the subgingival microflora around the right lower incisors, while A. actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus), Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected using the PCR method. Further chemotaxis assay revealed that neutrophil function was depressed compared with that of healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Although inflammation remained around the right primary second molars, the bone loss was controlled by periodic professional mechanical teeth cleaning (PMTC), subgingival irrigation, and local antibiotic application. The probing depths of all teeth, including permanent incisors and molars, were within 2.5 mm.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of infected root canals from symptomatic and asymptomatic teeth with periapical periodontitis and the antimicrobial susceptibility of some isolated anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to investigate the correlation between the composition of the bacterial flora isolated from infected root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis with the presence of clinical signs and symptoms, and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of five anaerobic bacteria mostly commonly found in the root canals of symptomatic teeth against various substances using the E-test. Microbial samples were taken from 48 root canals, 29 symptomatic and 19 asymptomatic, using adequate techniques. A total of 218 cultivable isolates were recovered from 48 different microbial species and 19 different genera. Root canals from symptomatic teeth harbored more obligate anaerobes and a bigger number of bacterial species than the asymptomatic teeth. More than 70% of the bacterial isolates were strict anaerobes. Statistical analysis used a Pearson Chi-squared test or a one-sided Fisher's Exact test as appropriate. Suggested relationships were found between specific microorganisms, especially gram-negative anaerobes, and the presence of spontaneous or previous pain, tenderness to percussion, pain on palpation and swelling amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanate and cephaclor were effective against all the strains tested. The lowest susceptibility rate was presented by Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens against Penicillin G. Our results suggested that specific bacteria are associated with endodontic symptoms of infected teeth with periapical periodontitis and the majority of the anaerobic bacterial species tested were susceptible to all antibiotics studied.
TI  - Effects of a chlorhexidine gluconate-containing mouthwash on the vitality and antimicrobial susceptibility of in vitro oral bacterial ecosystems.
AB  - Oral bacterial microcosms, established using saliva inocula from three individuals, were maintained under a feast-famine regime within constant-depth film fermenters. Steady-state communities were exposed four times daily, postfeeding, to a chlorhexidine (CHX) gluconate-containing mouthwash (CHXM) diluted to 0.06% (wt/vol) antimicrobial content. The microcosms were characterized by heterotrophic plate counts and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). CHXM caused significant decreases in both total anaerobe and total aerobe/facultative anaerobe counts (P < 0.05), together with lesser decreases in gram-negative anaerobes. The degree of streptococcal and actinomycete inhibition varied considerably among individuals. DGGE showed that CHXM exposure caused considerable decreases in microbial diversity, including marked reductions in Prevotella sp. and Selenomonas infelix. Pure-culture studies of 10 oral bacteria (eight genera) showed that Actinomyces naeslundii, Veillonella dispar, Prevotella nigrescens, and the streptococci were highly susceptible to CHX, while Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Neisseria subflava were the least susceptible. Determination of the MICs of triclosan, CHX, erythromycin, penicillin V, vancomycin, and metronidazole for microcosm isolates, before and after 5 days of CHXM exposure, showed that CHXM exposure altered the distribution of isolates toward those that were less susceptible to CHX (P < 0.05). Changes in susceptibility distributions for the other test agents were not statistically significant. In conclusion, population changes in plaque microcosms following repeated exposure to CHXM represented an inhibition of the most susceptible flora with a clonal expansion of less susceptible species.
TI  - Lethal photosensitization in microbiological treatment of ligature-induced peri-implantitis: a preliminary study in dogs.
AB  - This pilot study evaluated, by culture testing, the effectiveness of lethal photosensitization for the microbiological treatment of peri-implantitis in dogs. Experimental peri-implantitis was induced by ligature placement for 2 months. Following ligature removal, plaque control was instituted by scrubbing with 0.12% chlorhexidine daily for 12 months. Subsequently, mucoperiosteal flaps were elevated for scaling the implant surface. Microbial samples were obtained with paper points before and after treatment of implant surfaces by means of 100 microg/ml toluidine blue O (TBO,) and were exposed, for 80 s, to light with a wavelength of 685 nm from a 50 mW GaAlAs diode laser. The mean initial and final bacterial counts were 7.22 +/- 0.20 and 6.84 +/- 0.44 CFU/ml, respectively for TVC (P < 0.0001); 6.19 +/- 0.45 and 3.14 +/- 3.29 CFU/ml for P. intermedia/nigrescens (P = 0.001); 5.98 +/- 0.38 and 1.69 +/- 2.90 CFU/ml for Fusobacterium spp. (P = 0.001); and 6.07 +/- 0.22 to 1.69 +/- 2.94 CFU/ml for beta-hemolytic Streptococcus (P = 0.0039). It may be concluded that lethal photosensitization resulted in a reduction of the bacterial count. Complete elimination of bacteria was achieved in some samples.
TI  - Microbiologic and radiographic analysis of ligature-induced peri-implantitis with different dental implant surfaces.
AB  - PURPOSE: The goal of this study was to evaluate microbiota and radiographic peri-implant bone loss associated with ligature-induced peri-implantitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six dental implants with 4 different surfaces (9 commercially pure titanium, 9 titanium plasma-sprayed, 9 hydroxyapatite, and 9 acid-etched) were placed in the edentulous mandibles of 6 dogs. After 3 months with optimal plaque control, abutment connection was performed. On days 0, 20, 40, and 60 after placement of cotton ligatures, both microbiologic samples and periapical radiographs were obtained. The presence of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Campylobacter spp, Capnocytophaga spp, Fusobacterium spp, beta-hemolytic Streptococcus, and Candida spp were evaluated culturally. RESULTS: P intermedia/nigrescens was detected in 13.89% of implants at baseline and 100% of implants at other periods. P gingivalis was not detected at baseline, but after 20 and 40 days it was detected in 33.34% of implants and at 60 days it was detected in 29.03% of dental implants. Fusobacterium spp was detected in all periods. Streptococci were detected in 16.67% of implants at baseline and in 83.34%, 72.22%, and 77.42% of implants at 20, 40, and 60 days, respectively. Campylobacter spp and Candida spp were detected in low proportions. The total viable count analysis showed no significant differences among surfaces (P = .831), although a significant difference was observed after ligature placement (P < .0014). However, there was no significant qualitative difference, in spite of the difference among the periods. The peri-implant bone loss was not significantly different between all the dental implant surfaces (P = .908). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that with ligature-induced peri-implantitis, both time and periodontal pathogens affect all surfaces equally after 60 days.
TI  - Microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  - AIM: The objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. METHODOLOGY: Sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. During nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was removed and the canals were sampled. Microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. The association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. RESULTS: Microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth. In most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. Of the microbial species isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% Gram-positive microorganisms. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. Obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was Peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (P < 0.01). Significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (P < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and Prevotella intermedia/P. nigrescens (P < 0.05); (c) sinus and Streptococcus spp. (P < 0.001) or Actinomyces spp. (P < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and Streptococcus spp. or Candida spp. (both with P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly Gram-positive microbial species. Facultative anaerobes, especially E. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.
TI  - [Clinical and microbiological study of adult periodontal disease].
AB  - The aim of this study was to carry out a microbiological evaluation of sites with and without clinical evidence of moderate and severe periodontitis and their correlation with clinical parameters. A total of 52 disease sites and 10 healthy sites were selected according to clinical criteria. The following clinical indexes were measured for all the sites: plaque index, gingival index, blood on probing, depth on probing and insertion level. Samples of subgingival plaque were collected for culture and for differential counts of microbial morphotypes. In disease sites the most frequently isolated were: Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens (65%), Porphyromonas gingivalis (23%), Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (23%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (10%) and Peptostreptococcus sp. (31%). The aerobic gram-positive microflora was predominant in healthy sites. Significant differences were observed in microbial morphotypes between healthy and disease sites: cocci 18.71% and 78.90%, motile rods 46.12% and 16.70%, total spirochetes 26.48% and 2.80%, respectively. The presence of motile rods, spirochetes and P. intermedia/nigrescens were the parameters with most sensitivity to suspect periodontal disease. There were significant differences in the subgingival microflora between healthy and disease sites in patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.
TI  - Treatment of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline. Clinical, microbiological and radiological results.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, microbiological and radiological effects of peri-implantitis therapy by local delivery of tetracycline. In 25 partially edentulous patients, 30 implants with radiographic evidence of circumferential bone loss, and peri-implant probing depths > or =5 mm were treated with polymeric tetracycline HCl-containing fibers. Clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (M) after treatment. Standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline, M3, and one year after treatment. Two patients were discontinued from the study after 180 days because of persisting active peri-implantitis with pus formation. The remaining subjects showed a significant decrease of mean peri-implant probing depth from 6.0 to 4.1 mm (M1, P<0.001), which was maintained over 12 months. In comparison to baseline, the bleeding tendency was significantly reduced after one month, and thereafter (P<0.001). No significant recession of the mucosal margin was noted. The radiologically determined distance from the shoulder of the implant to the bottom of the bony defect decreased slightly, but not significantly, from 5.2 to 4.9 mm. At M1, M3 and M6, mean total anaerobic cultivable bacterial counts were significantly lower than at baseline (P<0.001). A significant decrease in frequency of detection was noted for Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium sp., Bacteroides forsythus, and Campylobacter rectus (P<0.01). Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Eikenella corrodens had very low baseline frequencies that could not be significantly suppressed further. In conclusion, therapy of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline had a positive effect on clinical and microbiological parameters.
TI  - Comparative microbiological characteristics of failing implants and periodontally diseased teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this report was to compare the distribution of periodontal pathogens recovered from failing implants and teeth with adult and recurrent forms of periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 41 consecutive microbial samples from patients with failing implants (IMP) were received at the Microbiology Testing Laboratory (MTL) of the University of Pennsylvania over a 2-year period. Paired control samples were selected from samples received concurrently by MTL from 41 patients with a diagnosis of adult periodontitis (AP) and 41 with a diagnosis of recurrent or refractory periodontitis (RP). Patients' mean ages for the 3 categories were 59, 47, and 53 years, respectively. Samples were collected with paper points or scalers and shipped in prereduced medium by express mail to the laboratory where they were processed within 48 hours from the time of collection. Culture was used for detection of A. actinomycetemcomitans, C. rectus, P. intermedia/nigrescens, E. corrodens, P. micros, Capnocytophaga and Fusobacterium sp., enteric Gram-negative rods, Enterococcus and Staphylococcus sp., and yeast. P. gingivalis and B. forsythus were detected by indirect immunofluorescence. Morphotypes were enumerated by dark-field microscopy. RESULTS: The most frequently detected microorganisms from IMP were B. forsythus (59%), spirochetes (54%), Fusobacterium (41%), P. micros (39%), and P. gingivalis (27%). Recovery levels (mean +/- SD) were 1+/-1, 4+/-5, 4+/-5, 9+/-11, 1+/-2, respectively. The most frequently detected organisms for AP were B. forsythus (83%), Fusobacterium (80%), spirochetes (79%), P. gingivalis (59%), P. micros (51%), and E. corrodens (37%), at levels 2+/-2, 5+/-4, 9+/-6, 4+/-5, and 6+/-7, respectively. Corresponding data for RP were B. forsythus (85%), Fusobacterium (83%), P. gingivalis (60%), spirochetes (59%), C. rectus (56%), and P. micros (56%), at levels of 3+/-2, 8+/-8, 4+/-4, 2+/-2, 1+/-1, and 9+/-10, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens in failing implants are significantly different from that of teeth with periodontitis; however, the detection frequency and levels of recovery are similar in teeth affected by adult and refractory (recurrent) forms of periodontitis.
TI  - Phylogenetic characterization and proposal of a new pigmented species to the genus Prevotella: Prevotella pallens sp. nov.
AB  - Complete 16S rRNA gene sequences of three representative strains of anaerobic, Gram-negative, pigmented, moderately saccharolytic, indole-positive bacteria isolated from the oral cavity of humans were determined. According to comparative analyses of the rRNA sequence data, this organism represents a previously unknown species within the genus Prevotella. In addition, 22 representative strains and 21 reference strains (including 11 Prevotella intermedia and 10 Prevotella nigrescens strains) were subjected to multilocus enzyme electrophoretic analysis. The strains were consistently separated into three clearly distinct groups, corresponding to their previous entities. On the basis of the present phylogenetic results that confirmed our biochemical and genetic data, we propose a new species, Prevotella pallens. The type strain is NCTC 13042 (= AHN 10371).
TI  - Proposal of a new species Prevotella nigrescens sp. nov. among strains previously classified as Pr. intermedia.
TI  - Biochemical and chemical studies on strains designated Prevotella intermedia and  proposal of a new pigmented species, Prevotella nigrescens sp. nov.
AB  - A total of 31 strains of Prevotella intermedia were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridization and were characterized by performing physiological tests and by performing a multilocus enzyme analysis, using malate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase. All of the strains assigned to P. intermedia fermented glucose and sucrose, hydrolyzed starch but not esculin, and produced indole, acetic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and succinic acids as metabolic end products. The results of DNA reassociation experiments performed with the reference probe permitted separation of the strains into two well-defined homology groups. In addition, strains with DNAs that hybridized with DNA from strain ATCC 25611T (T = type strain) had high levels of peptidase activity and cleaved lipid substrates (4-methylumbelliferyl laurate and 4-methylumbellifelyl elaidate). Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis revealed two electromorphic profiles, one characteristic of strain ATCC 25611T and the other characteristic of strain ATCC 33563T. We propose that a new species, Prevotella nigrescens, should be created for the genetically distinct group of strains that hybridized with strain ATCC 33563T. Strain ATCC 33563 is designated the type strain of P. nigrescens.
