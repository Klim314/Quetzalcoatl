TI  == in vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  == lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. recent studies have indicated that streptococcus mutans, clostridium perfringens, and faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. however, the previous studies mainly focused  on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. this study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. the prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. the screening assays identified 35 species with  the ability to utilize lactulose, of which cronobacter sakazakii, enterococcus faecium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. in addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found.  thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.

TI  == dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides increases short-chain fatty acids but decreases protein-derived catabolites in the intestinal luminal content of weaned huanjiang mini-piglets.
AB  == the improvement of gut health and function with prebiotic supplements after weaning is an active area of research in pig nutrition. the present study was conducted to test the working hypothesis that medium-term dietary supplementation with soybean oligosaccharides (sbos) can affect the gut ecosystem in terms of microbiota composition, luminal bacterial short-chain fatty acid and ammonia concentrations, and intestinal expression of genes related to intestinal immunity and barrier function. ten huanjiang mini-piglets, weaned at 21 days of age, were  randomly assigned to 2 groups. each group received a standard diet containing either dietary supplementation with 0.5% corn starch (control group) or 0.5% sbos (experimental group). the results showed that dietary supplementation with sbos increased the diversity of intestinal microflora and elevated (p < .05) the numbers of some presumably beneficial intestinal bacteria (e.g., bifidobacterium  sp, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, fusobacterium prausnitzii, and roseburia). soybean oligosaccharide supplementation also increased the concentration of short-chain fatty acid in the intestinal lumen, and it reduced (p < .05) the numbers of bacteria with pathogenic potential (e.g., escherichia coli, clostridium, and streptococcus) and the concentration of several protein-derived  catabolites (e.g., isobutyrate, isovalerate, and ammonia). in addition, sbos supplementation increased (p < .05) expression of zonula occludens 1 messenger rna, and it decreased (p < .05) expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 1beta, and interleukin 8 messenger rna in the ileum and colon. these  findings suggest that sbos supplementation modifies the intestinal ecosystem in weaned huanjiang mini-piglets and has potentially beneficial effects on the gut.

TI  == molecular-phylogenetic characterization of the microbiota in ulcerated and non-ulcerated regions in the patients with crohn's disease.
AB  == background: the dysbiosis of intestinal microbiota has been established in crohn's disease (cd), but the molecular characterization of this dysbiosis in chinese subjects with cd remains unclear. this study aims to investigate the predominant bacterial composition of the faecal and mucosal-associated microbiota in chinese cd patients using culture-independent techniques. methods/principal findings: eighteen patients with cd and 9 healthy controls were included in this  study. the faeces and the intestinal mucosal tissues from the ulcerated and nonulcerated sites were subjected to bacterial community fingerprinting using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). the predominant bacterial composition in the faeces and mucosa was determined with dna sequencing and blast. we showed that the bacterial diversity in the faeces of cd patients was reduced compared with that in healthy controls (p<0.01). the faecal bacterial dysbiosis of the patients was characterized by an elevated abundance of gamma-proteobacteria (especially escherichia coli and shigella flexneri) and a reduced proportion of bacteroidetes and firmicutes. five bacterial species defined the microbiota imbalance of the ulcerated mucosa in cd, including an increase in escherichia coli, a decrease in faecalibacterium prausnitzii, lactobacillus coleohominis, bacteroides sp and streptococcus gallolyticus in the  bacterial community as compared with the nonulcerated (p<0.01). conclusions/significance: this is the first description of intestinal microbiota  dysbiosis in chinese cd patients. these results allow a better understanding of the faecal and mucosal microbiota in cd, showing a predominance of some opportunistic pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in beneficial bacterial species. the findings may provide novel insights into the pathogenesis of cd in chinese population.

TI  == numerical ecology validates a biogeographical distribution and gender-based effect on mucosa-associated bacteria along the human colon.
AB  == we applied constrained ordination numerical ecology methods to data produced with a human intestinal tract-specific phylogenetic microarray (the aus-hit chip) to examine the microbial diversity associated with matched biopsy tissue samples taken from the caecum, transverse colon, sigmoid colon and rectum of 10 healthy patients. consistent with previous studies, the profiles revealed a marked intersubject variability; however, the numerical ecology methods of analysis allowed the subtraction of the subject effect from the data and revealed, for the first time, evidence of a longitudinal gradient for specific microbes along the colorectum. in particular, probes targeting streptococcus and enterococcus spp. produced strongest signals with caecal and transverse colon samples, with a gradual decline through to the rectum. conversely, the analyses suggest that several members of the enterobacteriaceae increase in relative abundance towards  the rectum. these collective differences were substantiated by the multivariate analysis of quantitative pcr data. we were also able to identify differences in the microarray profiles, especially for the streptococci and faecalibacterium prausnitzii, on the basis of gender. the results derived by these multivariate analyses are biologically intuitive and suggest that the biogeography of the colonic mucosa can be monitored for changes through cross-sectional and/or inception cohort studies.

TI  == the microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease in different age groups.
AB  == background: many efforts were made in the past decades to assess the role of gut  microbiota in inflammatory bowel diseases (ibd), leading to the hypothesis that an altered microbial composition, other than the presence of a specific pathogen, could be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. on the other hand, existing differences in gut microbial community between distinct classes of age make sense of an increasing research in microbial shifts in ibd. methods: cultural, molecular, metabolomic and metagenomic approaches are trying to define the human  gut microbiota in different age groups. results and conclusion: an increase in anaerobic bacteria (bacteroidesvulgatus, streptococcus faecalis) was observed in  adult ibd, whereas an increase in aerobic and facultative-anaerobic (escherichia  coli) was found in pediatric ibd. overall higher bacterial cell counts were observed in ibd, jointly with a general loss of biodiversity and a preponderance  of bacteroidetes and a parallel decrease of firmicutes phylum: a predominance of  potential harmful members of proteobacteria (e. coli) and low abundance of beneficial species (faecalibacterium prausnitzii) was also reported in pediatric  and adult age groups, respectively. microbial community of elderly subjects contains a wider range of different species than those of children and adults, both in healthy and ibd status.

TI  == application of 16s rrna gene-targetted fluorescence in situ hybridization and restriction fragment length polymorphism to study porcine microbiota along the gastrointestinal tract in response to different sources of dietary fibre.
AB  == a total of 32 pigs of 15+/-0.38 kg body weight were fed for 6 weeks one of four diets differing in their source of dietary fibre. fish was used to quantify the main bacterial groups in the pig gut using the following probes: eub338, bac303,  rfla729, rbro730, erec482, fprau645, prop853, str493 and lab158. fish counts revealed important differences at four sites along the pig gastrointestinal tract, but we were unable to show differences related to diets. stomach and jejunal samples gave total bacterial counts of 0.1-5.3 x 10(8) g(-1) of contents. in the stomach, streptococci and lactobacilli were predominant, and the clostridial cluster ix group was abundant (14-41% of total bacterial count). clostridial cluster ix bacteria were present elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract at 1-8%. the other groups were generally more abundant in the proximal colon and rectum: bacteroides/prevotella (5-10%), clostridial cluster xiva (10-19%), and cluster iv relatives of faecalibacterium prausnitzii (1-4%) and ruminococcus (4-10%). restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles showed changes related to diet, with pigs fed wheat bran having the lowest richness of all diets (p=0.008).
