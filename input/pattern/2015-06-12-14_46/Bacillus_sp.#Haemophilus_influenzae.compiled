TI  - [Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in immunocompetent adults].
AB  - In an ideal clinical setting, empiric antimicrobial treatment prescribed in adult community acquired pneumonia (CAP) should be based on national etiological surveillance and in vitro susceptibility assays. Available information about etiology in ambulatory patients and intensive care unit (ICU) patients is scarce, compared to information obtained in hospitalized patients. In studies designed to explore the etiology of pneumonia, no microorganism is detected in 40-50% of patients, a fact that represents limited yields in diagnostic methods. In all settings, Streptococcus pneumoniae is the main respiratory pathogen recovered in adults CAP, being responsible of about 16% of cases among ambulatory patients and about 22% of those admitted to hospital and ICU. About one third of cases are caused by a small group of microorganisms: Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, respiratory viruses, Staphylococcus aureus, gramnegative bacillus, Legionella sp; each one is isolated in less than 10% of cases. In general, microorganism distribution varies scarcely in the following attending settings: ambulatory patients, common wards and ICU. An exception is represented by a higher frequency of gram negative bacillus, S. aureus and Legionella sp in ICU, and of C. pneumoniae in the ambulatory setting. In Chile, CAP etiology in hospitalized adult patients is similar to foreign reports; no systematic information has been collected about the etiology in neither ambulatory patients nor in severe CAP.
TI  - A global approach to identify novel broad-spectrum antibacterial targets among proteins of unknown function.
AB  - Attempted allelic replacement of 144 Streptococcus pneumoniae open reading frames of previously uncharacterized function led to the identification of 36 genes essential for growth under laboratory conditions. Of these, 14 genes (obg, spoIIIJ2, trmU, yacA, yacM, ydiC, ydiE, yjbN, yneS, yphC, ysxC, ytaG, yloI and yxeH4) were also essential in Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae or Escherichia coli, 2 genes (yrrK and ydiB) were only essential in H. influenzae as well as S. pneumoniae and 8 genes were necessary for growth of S.pneumoniae and S. aureus and did not have a homolog in H. influenzae(murD2, ykqC, ylqF, yqeH, ytgP, yybQ) or were not essential in that organism (yqeL, yhcT). The proteins encoded by these genes could represent good targets for novel antibiotics covering different therapeutic profiles. The putative functions of some of these essential proteins, inferred by bioinformatic analysis, are presented. Four mutants, with deletions of loci not essential for in vitro growth, were found to be severely attenuated in a murine respiratory tract infection model, suggesting that not all targets for antibacterial therapeutics are revealed by simple in vitro essentiality testing. The results of our experiments together with those collated from previously reported studies including Bacillus subtilis, E. coli and Mycoplasma sp. demonstrate that gene conservation amongst bacteria does not necessarily indicate that essentiality in one organism can be extrapolated to others. Moreover, this study demonstrates that different experimental procedures can produce apparently contradictory results.
TI  - Sequence analysis of the aminoacylase-1 family. A new proposed signature for metalloexopeptidases.
AB  - The amino acid sequence analysis of the human and porcine aminoacylases-1, the carboxypeptidase S precursor from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase from Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae and Corynebacterium glutamicum, the acetylornithine deacetylase from Escherichia coli and Dictyostelium discoideum and the carboxypeptidase G(2) precursor from Pseudomonas strain, using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) and the Position-Specific Iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST), allowed us to suggest that all these enzymes, which share common functional and biochemical features, belong to the same structural family. The three amino acid blocks which were found to be highly conserved, using the CLUSTAL W program, could be assigned to the catalytic active site, based on the general three-dimensional structure of the carboxypeptidase G(2) from the Pseudomonas strain precursor. Six additional proteins with the same signature have been retrieved after performing two successive PSI-BLAST iterations using the sequence of the conserved motif, namely Lactobacillus delbrueckii aminoacyl-histidine dipeptidase, Streptomyces griseus aminopeptidase, Saccharomyces cerevisiae aminopeptidase Y precursor, two Bacillus stearothermophilus N-carbamyl-L-amino acid amidohydrolases and Pseudomonas sp. hydantoin utilization protein C. The three conserved amino acid motifs corresponded to the following blocks: (i) [S, G, A]-H-x-D-x-V; (ii) G-x-x-D; and (iii) x-E-E. This new sequence signature is clearly different from that commonly reported in the literature for proteins belonging to the ArgE/DapE/CPG2/YscS family.
TI  - Production and characterization of a new monoclonal antibody against Neisseria meningitidis: study of the cross-reactivity with different bacterial genera.
AB  - We have generated a hybridoma cell line which produces an 8C7Br1 clone of the IgM antibody isotype. It recognizes the 50-, 65-, and 60-kDa antigens and is reactive with strains of N. meningitidis in the 98% of local Neisseria genera by Dot-ELISA assays. Two percent of the strains of N. meningitidis B do not present reactivity with the 8C7Br1 monoclonal antibody (MAb). The antibody reacted against N. meningitidis of serogroups A, B, C, X, Y, Z, and different serotypes and subtypes of N. meningitidis B and C by means of Dot-ELISA and Immunoblot. It cross-reacted with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria lactamica, Haemophilus influenzae type b, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella typhi, Shigella flexneri, Bordetella pertussis, and Bacillus subtilis. The 8C7Br1 MAb reacted with the 65-kDa protein present in the prototype meningococcal strains B:16:B6(B2a:P1.5.2) and 2996 (B2b:P1.5.2). In H. influenzae type b, E. coli and B. subtilis, the MAb recognized the protein of 60, 65, and 70 kDa, respectively. FACS analysis showed that 8C7Brl MAb could recognize the 50-kDa protein on the surface of N. meningitidis homologous (B:4:P1.9) strain. These results, together with the bactericidal activity of 8C7Br1, and an experiment of passive protection in mice, demonstrated the potential importance of the cross-reactive protein as a candidate antigen for N. meningitidis B vaccine composition.
TI  - Genomic Analysis of the Genes Encoding Ribosomal Proteins in Eight Eubacterial Species and Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB  - The complete genomic nucleotide sequence data of more than 10 unicellular organisms have become available. During the past years, we have been focusing our attention to the analysis of the structure and function of the ribosome and its protein components. By making use of the genomic sequence data, our work can now be extended to comparative analysis of the ribosomal components at the genomic level. Such analysis will contribute to our understanding of the structure-function relationship of the ribosome that is vital to the expression of genetic information. Bearing these in mind, the ribosomal protein genes of organisms whose genomic sequence data are available were analyzed, which included Aquifex aeolicus; Archaeoglobus fulgidus; Borrelia burgdorferi; Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae; Helicobacter pylori; Methanococcus jannaschii; Mycoplasma genitalium; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Synechosystis sp., and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, the amino acid sequence data of Bacillus stearothermophilus ribosomal proteins were used in the evolutionary evaluation. The results indicate that, in eubacteria including two species of Mycoplasma, the operon structure of ribosomal protein genes is well conserved, while their relative orientation and chromosomal location are diverged into several classes. The operon structure in M. jannaschii on the other hand is quite different from the eubacterial one and we noticed that its many genes show similarity to rat ribosomal protein genes. The degrees of sequence conservation differ from one ribosomal protein gene to another, but several genes encoding proteins that are considered to be of structural importance are conserved throughout the bacterial species including archaebacteria and further in S. cerevisiae.
TI  - comB, a novel competence gene required for natural transformation of Acinetobacter sp. BD413: identification, characterization, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent regulation.
AB  - Here we describe five tandemly arranged and converging ORFs in Acinetobacter sp.  BD413, namely lytB, orfY, orfX, comB, and orfZ, located upstream of the previously identified competence gene comC. The N-termini of the deduced proteins OrfY and ComB exhibit the conserved endopeptidase cleavage motifs of prepilin proteins; the deduced protein ComB is similar to type IV pilins. LytB is similar to the Escherichia coli LytB, which has been implicated in the stringent response. No homologues of OrfX, OrfY and OrfZ could be identified. A mutation in orfY or orfZ led to 100-fold reduced transformation frequencies and a mutation in comB resulted in a non-competent phenotype. Disruption of lytB did not affect the natural transformation phenotype. Complementation studies clearly demonstrated that comB is involved in natural transformation, whereas the transformation-deficient phenotypes of orfY and orfZ mutants were due to polar effects on comB and comC, respectively. Analyses of the twitching motility phenotype and of the ultrastructure of the noncompetent comB mutant suggested that the competence gene comB is not essential for the biogenesis of type IV pili and expression of the type IV pili-associated property of twitching motility. Transcriptional fusions between comB and a promoter-free lacZ gene were constructed, and analysis of growth-phase-dependent transcription revealed increased expression of comB during prolonged exponential and stationary phases.
TI  - Polypurine.polypyrimidine sequences in complete bacterial genomes: preference for polypurines in protein-coding regions.
AB  - The genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Mycoplasma genitalium, Haemophilus influenzae, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, Helicobacter pylori, Treponema pallidum, Borrelia burgdorferri, Rickettsia prowazekeii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Bacillus subtilis, Chlamydia trachomatis, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Aquifex aeolicus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Escherichia coli have been analysed for the presence of polypurine.polypyrimidine tracts, in order to understand their distribution in these genomes. We observed a variation in abundance of such sequences in these bacteria, with the archaeal genomes forming a high-abundance group and the canonical eubacteria forming a low-abundance group. The genomes of M. tuberculosis and A. aeolicus are unique among the organisms analysed here in the abnormal underrepresentation and overrepresentation of polypurine.polypyrimidine, respectively. We also observe a strand bias, i.e., a preferential occurrence of polypurines in coding strands. It varies widely among the bacteria, from the very high bias in M. jannaschii to the slightly inverse bias in the parasitic genomes of T. pallidum and C. trachomatis. The extent of strand bias, however, cannot be explained on the basis of the GC-content of the genome, use of all-purine codons or an excess in the amino acids that are encoded by such codons. The probable causes and effects of this phenomenon are discussed.
TI  - Studies of codon usage and tRNA genes of 18 unicellular organisms and quantification of Bacillus subtilis tRNAs: gene expression level and species-specific diversity of codon usage based on multivariate analysis.
AB  - We examined codon usage in Bacillus subtilis genes by multivariate analysis, quantified its cellular levels of individual tRNAs, and found a clear constraint of tRNA contents on synonymous codon choice. Individual tRNA levels were proportional to the copy number of the respective tRNA genes. This indicates that the tRNA gene copy number is an important factor to determine in cellular tRNA levels, which is common with Escherichia coli and yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Codon usage in 18 unicellular organisms whose genomes have been sequenced completely was analyzed and compared with the composition of tRNA genes. The 18 organisms are as follows: yeast S. cerevisiae, Aquifex aeolicus, Archaeoglobus fulgidus, B. subtilis, Borrelia burgdorferi, Chlamydia trachomatis, E. coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Helicobacterpylori, Methanococcusjannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Pyrococcus horikoshii, Rickettsia prowazekii, Synechocystis sp., and Treponema pallidum. Codons preferred in highly expressed genes were related to the codons optimal for the translation process, which were predicted by the composition of isoaccepting tRNA genes. Genes with specific codon usage are discussed in connection with their evolutionary origins and functions. The origin and terminus of replication could be predicted on the basis of codon usage when the usage was analyzed relative to the transcription direction of individual genes.
TI  - Small genes/gene-products in Escherichia coli K-12.
AB  - Forty-two protein spots of observed M(r) 6-15 kDa were resolved by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, stained by Coomassie blue and subjected to Edman microsequencing. All of the proteins could be related back to their encoding open reading frames, thereby vindicating the bioinformatic tools currently utilised in their identification. However, only 14/42 gene-products were expressed as annotated. Translation was confirmed for 14 open reading frames with no attributed function (EcoGene Y-entries), while N-terminal sequence allowed the start codon to be accurately annotated for the genes yigF, yccU, yqiC, ynfD, and yeeX. The methionine start codon was cleaved in 11 gene-products (AtpE, Hns, RpoZ, RplL, CspC, YccJ, YggX, YjgF, HimA, InfA, RpsQ) and a further five showed loss of a signal peptide (PspE, HdeB, HdeA, YnfD, YkfE). Internal (Tig, AtpA, TufA) and N-terminal fragmentation (CspD, RpsF, AtcU) of much larger proteins was also detected, which may have resulted from physiological or translational processes. M(r) and pI isoforms were detected respectively for PtsH and GatB, each being phosphoproteins, as well as RplY which manifested differences with respect to predicted M(r) and pI. In addition, YjgF was shown to belong to a small gene family of unknown function with ancient conserved regions across procaryotes and eucaryotes. YgiN was revealed to have a paralogue and orthologues in Bacillus subtilis, Synechocystis sp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Neisseria gonorrhoea, and Rhodococcus erythropolis. Orthologues are also reported for YihD, YccU and YeeX. Of the 14 Y-genes, only YkfE possessed no detectable orthologues. These results highlight the need to complement genomic analysis with detailed proteomics in order to gain a better understanding of cellular molecular biology, while the confirmation of the open reading frame start codon using Edman degradation protein microsequencing has yet to be superseded by recent advances in mass spectrometry.
TI  - The serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine-specific protein kinases and protein phosphatases of prokaryotic organisms: a family portrait.
AB  - Inspection of the genomes for the bacteria Bacillus subtilis 168, Borrelia burgdorferi B31, Escherichia coli K-12, Haemophilus influenzae KW20, Helicobacter pylori 26695, Mycoplasma genitalium G-37, and Synechocystis sp PCC 6803 and for the archaeons Archaeoglobus fulgidus VC-16 DSM4304, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum delta H, and Methanococcus jannaschii DSM2661 revealed that each contains at least one ORF whose predicted product displays sequence features characteristic of eukaryote-like protein-serine/threonine/tyrosine kinases and protein-serine/threonine/tyrosine phosphatases. Orthologs for all four major protein phosphatase families (PPP, PPM, conventional PTP, and low molecular weight PTP) were present in the bacteria surveyed, but not all strains contained all types. The three archaeons surveyed lacked recognizable homologs of the PPM family of eukaryotic protein-serine/threonine phosphatases; and only two prokaryotes were found to contain ORFs for potential phosphatases from all four major families. Intriguingly, our searches revealed a potential ancestral link between the catalytic subunits of microbial arsenate reductases and the protein-tyrosine phosphatases; they share similar ligands (arsenate versus phosphate) and features of their catalytic mechanism (formation of arseno-versus phospho-cysteinyl intermediates). It appears that all prokaryotic organisms, at one time, contained the genetic information necessary to construct protein phosphorylation-dephosphorylation networks that target serine, threonine, and/or tyrosine residues on proteins. However, the potential for functional redundancy among the four protein phosphatase families has led many prokaryotic organisms to discard one, two, or three of the four.
TI  - A 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase catalyzing the formation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate in an alternative nonmevalonate pathway for terpenoid biosynthesis.
AB  - Several eubacteria including Esherichia coli use an alternative nonmevalonate pathway for the biosynthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate instead of the ubiquitous mevalonate pathway. In the alternative pathway, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol or its 4-phosphate, which is proposed to be formed from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate via intramolecular rearrangement followed by reduction process, is one of the biosynthetic precursors of isopentenyl diphosphate. To clone the gene(s) responsible for synthesis of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate, we prepared and selected E. coli mutants with an obligatory requirement for 2-C-methylerythritol for growth and survival. All the DNA fragments that complemented the defect in synthesizing 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate of these mutants contained the yaeM gene, which is located at 4.2 min on the chromosomal map of E. coli. The gene product showed significant homologies to hypothetical proteins with unknown functions present in Haemophilus influenzae, Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pyroli, and Bacillus subtilis. The purified recombinant yaeM gene product was overexpressed in E. coli and found to catalyze the formation of 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate in the presence of NADPH. Replacement of NADPH with NADH decreased the reaction rate to about 1% of the original rate. The enzyme required Mn2+, Co2+, or Mg2+ as well. These data clearly show that the yaeM gene encodes an enzyme, designated 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate reductoisomerase, that synthesizes 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate from 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate, in a single step by intramolecular rearrangement and reduction and that this gene is responsible for terpenoid biosynthesis in E. coli.
TI  - Strand compositional asymmetry in bacterial and large viral genomes.
AB  - Several bacterial genomes exhibit preference for G over C on the DNA leading strand extending from the origin of replication to the ter-region in the genomes of Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma genitalium, Bacillus subtilis, and marginally in Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Helicobacter pylori. Strand compositional asymmetry is not observed in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. genome nor in the archaeal genomes of Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, and Archaeoglobus fulgidus. A strong strand compositional asymmetry is observed in beta-type but not alpha- or gamma-type human herpesviruses featuring G > C downstream of oriL and C > G upstream of oriL. Dinucleotide relative abundances (i.e., dinucleotide representations normalized by the component nucleotide frequencies) are consonant with respect to the leading and lagging strands. Strand compositional asymmetry may reflect on differences in replication synthesis of the leading versus lagging strand, on differences between template and coding strand associated with transcription-coupled repair mechanisms, on differences in gene density between the two strands, on differences in residue and codon biases in relation to gene function, expression level, or operon organization, or on differences in single or context-dependent base mutational rates. The absence of strand asymmetry in the archaeal genomes may reflect the presence of multiple origins of replication.
TI  - Expression of small RNAs by Bacillus sp. strain PS3 and B. subtilis cells during  sporulation.
AB  - A small RNA sequence identified in an rRNA-tRNA cluster from the thermophilic Bacillus sp. strain PS3 was examined. An oligonucleotide probe specific for the RNA bound to multiple restriction fragments in Bacillus sp. strain PS3 DNA, thus several copies of this sequence occur in its genome. Similar findings were observed using DNA from B. subtilis, B. stearothermophilus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Thermus thermophilus. This sequence apparently is widespread in the eubacteria. Northern analysis of RNA from sporulating Bacillus sp. strain PS3 and B. subtilis cells revealed RNA species homologous to the probe in both bacteria. Expression of the small RNA in B. subtilis depended on sigma H.
TI  - A Bacillus subtilis gene encoding a protein similar to nucleotide sugar transferases influences cell shape and viability.
AB  - Bacillus subtilis gene ypfP, which is located at 196 degrees on the genetic map,  shows similarity to both the monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase gene of Cucumis sativus, which encodes a galactosyltransferase, and the murG genes of B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, and Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803, which encode N-acetylglucosaminyltransferases involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Cells containing a null mutation of ypfP are shorter and rounder than wild-type cells during growth in Luria-Bertani medium and glucose minimal medium. In addition, the mutant cells preferentially undergo lysis when grown on solid Luria-Bertani medium.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and analysis of the phoB-rrnE-groESL region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome.
AB  - A 36 kb sequence of the phoB-rrnE-groESL region of the Bacillus subtilis chromosome at around 55 degrees has been determined. The sequenced region contains 36 ORFs including the phoB and groESL genes, and the whole rrnE operon. The phoB gene is transcribed in the direction opposite to that of chromosome replication, while most ORFs, including groESL and the rrnE operon, are transcribed in the same direction. Two newly identified tRNA genes upstream of the rrnE operon were those for Arg-tRNA and Gly-tRNA. The sequenced region contains an operon consisting of genes for degradation and uptake of mannan. The rrnE operon and its downstream ORFs are well conserved among Mycoplasma genitalium, Haemophilus influenzae, Synechocystis sp. and Methanococcus jannaschii. delta H consensus sequences are present in the promoter regions of three ORFs, including groESL.
TI  - Structure-function relationships within the peptide deformylase family. Evidence  for a conserved architecture of the active site involving three conserved motifs and a metal ion.
AB  - Thermus thermophilus peptide deformylase was characterized. Its enzymatic properties as well as its organization in domains proved to share close resemblances with those of the Escherichia coli enzyme despite few sequence identities. In addition to the HEXXH signature sequence of the zinc metalloprotease family, a second short stretch of strictly conserved amino acids was noticed, EGCLS, the cysteine of which corresponds to the third zinc ligand. The study of site-directed mutants of the E. coli deformylase shows that the residues of this stretch are crucial for the structure and/or catalytic efficiency of the active enzyme. Both aforementioned sequences were used as markers of the peptide deformylase family in protein sequence databases. Seven sequences coming from Haemophilus influenzae, Lactococcus lactis, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bacillus subtilus and Synechocystis sp. could be identified. The characterization of the product of the open reading frame from B. stearothermophilus confirmed that it actually corresponded to a peptide deformylase with properties similar to those of the E. coli enzyme. Alignment of the nine peptide deformylase sequences showed that, in addition to the two above sequences, only a third one, GXGXAAXQ, is strictly conserved. This motif is also located in the active site according to the three-dimensional structure of the E. coli enzyme. Site-directed variants of E. coli peptide deformylase showed the involvement of the corresponding residues for maintaining an active and stable enzyme. Altogether, these data allow us to propose that the three identified conserved motifs of peptide deformylases build up the active site around a metal ion. Finally, an analysis of the location of the other conserved residues, in particular of the hydrophobic ones, was performed using the three-dimensional model of the E. coli enzyme. This enables us to suggest that all bacterial peptide deformylases adopt a constant overall tertiary structure.
TI  - Sequence and transcriptional analysis of clpX, a class-III heat-shock gene of Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of clpX, which is localized between the tig (trigger factor) and the lon (ATP-dependent protease) genes at 245 degrees on the standard Bacillus subtilis (Bs) genetic map, was determined. The putative clpX gene codes for a 46-kDa protein of 421 amino acid (aa) residues. A comparison of the deduced aa sequence with those of the recently described bacterial clpX gene products from Synechocystis sp., Escherichia coli (Ec), Haemophilus influenzae and Azotobacter vinelandii revealed strong similarities. However, in contrast to Ec, clpX and clpP of Bs are located at different loci on the chromosome and are transcribed as monocistronic genes. A heat-inducible sigma A-like promoter was mapped upstream of the clpX structural gene, but no CIRCE element, characteristic of class-I heat-shock genes (e.g., groESL and dnaK), was found between the transcriptional and translational start sites. Although the majority of the heat-inducible general stress genes in Bs are under the control of the alternative sigma factor, sigma B, the heat induction of clpX appears to be sigma B-independent. The latter indicates that clpX belongs to class-III heat-inducible genes.
TI  - Phosphorylcholine-containing antigens in bacteria from the mouth and respiratory  tract.
AB  - Phosphorylcholine (PC)-containing antigens were sought in 269 bacterial isolates  from the mouth and respiratory tract by an enzyme immunoassay method. Only 41 (15%) isolates were PC-positive and of these 29 (70%) were strains of Haemophilus influenzae. Other species that produced positive results included two of five isolates of Gemella haemolysans, two of five isolates of Micrococcus spp., and a single strain each of Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium jeikeium, Lactococcus sp. and H. parainfluenzae. The presence of PC-containing antigens in H. influenzae may be an important source of cross-reaction in antigen detection techniques that detect the C-polysaccharide antigen of Streptococcus pneumoniae in respiratory specimens and would result in false positive results.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of srfB, a regulatory gene involved in surfactin production and competence in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - A Tn917 insertion mutation srfB impairs the production of the lipopeptide antibiotic surfactin in Bacillus subtilis. srfB is located between aroG and ald in the B. subtilis genome, as determined by phage PBS1 transduction mapping, and is not linked to the previously described surfactin loci sfp or srfA. A srfB mutant was found to be also deficient in the establishment of competence. SP beta phage-mediated complementation analysis showed that both competence and surfactin production were restored in the srfB mutant by a single DNA fragment of 1.5 kilobase pairs. The sequence of the complementing DNA revealed that the srfB gene is comA, an early competence gene which codes for a product similar to that of the activator class of bacterial two-component regulatory systems. The srfB mutation impaired the expression of a srfA-lacZ fusion, suggesting that surfactin production is positively regulated at the transcriptional level by the srfB (comA) gene product.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. Patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. The tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. There were 207 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates were 101 Bacteroides sp (including 10 B fragilis group, and 47 B melaninogenicus group), 29 Fusobacterium sp, 34 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 Peptococcus sp and 9 Peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 Veillonella sp. There were 185 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 Staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group A, 4 group B, and 2 each group C and F), 14 Haemophilus sp (including 12 H influenzae type B) and 5 H parainfluenzae. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. These were all isolates of S aureus (24) and B fragilis (10), 15 of 47 B melaninogenicus (32%), 5 of the 12 B oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 H influenzae type B (17%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.
