[isolation and characterization of vaginal lactobacilli producing hydrogen peroxide].
aim: isolation and characteristics of vaginal lactobacilli that actively generate h2o2 and have high antagonistic activity. materials and methods: staphylococcus aureus 8956, escherichia coli 8852, klebsiella pneumoniae 8795 and candida albicans 5646 were used as target-strains. skim milk and mrs medium were used for lactobacilli isolation and cultivation. antagonism was studied in complete agar and saburo medium. merckoquant peroxide test (merck) stripes were used for the determination of h2o2. antibacterial activity was determined by diffusion into agar. specific culture growth rate was determined by conventional method, acidification of the culture medium--by ph-meter. results: 12 strains were isolated from vaginal smears of healthy women. these strains have an ability to ferment milk among which a highly active h2o2 producer was isolated and attributed to lactobacillus delbrueckii by the results of 16s rrna and alpha-subunit rna polymerase gene sequence analysis (16s rdna and rpoa genes are registered in genbank, numbers hq379171 and hq379180 respectively). l. delbrueckii mh-10 bacterial cells were characterized by specific growth speed 1.26 per hour, reaching a maximum titer of 2 x 10(9) pfu/ml with lowering medium ph to 4.0. under aerated conditions h2o2 concentration reached 100 microg/ml or more. l. delbrueckii mh-10 has high antibacterial activity against s. aureus, e. coli, k. pneumoniae. conclusion: l. delbrueckii mh-10 isolate is an active h2o2 producer, has high growth speed and broad antibacterial activity spectrum, is a perspective candidate for the development of probiotic preparation for the prophylaxis and therapy of vaginoses.
molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.
behavior of listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus in yogurt fermented  with a bacteriocin-producing thermophilic starter.
streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus b producing a bacteriocin active against listeria monocytogenes atcc 7644 and staphylococcus aureus sad 30 was isolated from bakery yeast. the bacteriocin was partially purified by an adsorption/desorption technique, and its spectrum of action was compared to that of a neutralized cell-free supernatant (cfs). although the cfs inhibited a number of gram-positive and -negative bacteria of health and spoilage significance, the spectrum of action of the partially purified bacteriocin was limited to gram-positive bacteria. l. monocytogenes was the most sensitive to both preparations. the bacteriocin-producing streptococcal strain was used in combination with a bac- lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus cy strain isolated from commercial yogurt to assess the effectiveness of the resulting thermophilic starter in controlling l. monocytogenes and s. aureus in yogurt during fermentation and storage at refrigeration (ca. 7 degrees c) or abuse (ca. 22 degrees c) temperature. yogurt samples were contaminated with l. monocytogenes or s. aureus to the approximate levels of 10(3) and 10(6) cfu/ml of milk, respectively. the results showed that in situ bacteriocin production was more active against l. monocytogenes than against s. aureus in vitro and in contaminated samples. while l. monocytogenes leveled off below the detectable limit in a 1-ml sample of yogurt within 24 h of processing, s. aureus survived in bac+ and bac- samples during 10 days of storage at room temperature (ca. 22 degrees c). use of a bac+ starter resulted in a 5-day extension of the shelf life.
behavior of enterotoxigenic strains of staphylococcus aureus in milk fermented with a yogurt starter culture.
the ability of a yogurt starter culture formed by streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp bulgaricus to inhibit the growth of four enterotoxin type a and b producers staphylococcus aureus strains (atcc 6538, s6, fri-100 and a strain isolated from milk) during fermentation of milk and subsequent storage was investigated. sterile skim milk was inoculated with about 10(6) cfu/ml of s. aureus and with about 10(6) cfu of starter culture, and incubated at 42 degrees c during 8 h, followed by refrigeration at 4 degrees c. samples were taken every 2 h during fermentation and every 2 days during storage. viable count of lactic acid bacteria and s. aureus as well as ph, acidity, thermostable deoxyribonuclease (tnase) and staphylococcal enterotoxin a (sea) production were evaluated. behavior of four strains was similar; s. aureus survived the 8 h fermentation with lab, and its population began to decrease from the first day of storage, being completely inhibited at 9-10 days. tnase and sea production were positive in all samples taken along the study. it was demonstrated that enterotoxigenic strains of s. aureus were able to survive the fermentation of milk with a yogurt starter culture and they were inhibited after several days during storage of the fermented product, contrary to the general belief which considered it very difficult due to the low ph. even though s. aureus was inhibited, tnase and sea were demonstrable along the storage. therefore, fermented milks may play an important role in the transmission of this organism.
detection and characterization of a novel antibacterial substance produced by a lactobacillus delbrueckii strain 1043.
a novel antibacterial substance produced by a strain isolated from bulgarian yellow cheese was characterized. the producer strain was identified by molecular typing to belong to the species lactobacillus delbrueckii, which is a rare producer of bacteriocins. the inhibitory agent was heat stable and active against lactic acid bacteria species and several food-borne pathogens: listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis. its sensitivity to amylolitic enzymes and lipase suggested that a lipid and carbohydrate moiety could be important for the activity. the amino acid content of the purified bacteriocin was estimated to 29 amino acids. the bacteriocin was shown to be small (3.6-6 kda) by three different methods: hplc gel-filtration, sds-page and amino acid contents.
