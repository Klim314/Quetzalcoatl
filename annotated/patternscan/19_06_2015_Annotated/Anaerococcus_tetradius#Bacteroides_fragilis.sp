TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this study evaluated the in vitro anti-anaerobic activity and spectrum of levornidazole, its metabolites and comparators against 375 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria, including gram-negative bacilli (181 strains), gram-negative  cocci (11 strains), gram-positive bacilli (139 strains) and gram-positive cocci (44 strains), covering 34 species. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levornidazole, its five metabolites and three comparators against these anaerobic isolates were determined by the agar dilution method. minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) of levornidazole and metronidazole were measured against 22 strains of bacteroides fragilis. levornidazole showed good activity against b. fragilis, other bacteroides spp., clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens  and peptostreptococcus magnus, evidenced by mic90 values of 0.5, 1, 0.25, 2 and 1mg/l, respectively. the activity of levornidazole and the comparators was poor for veillonella spp. generally, levornidazole displayed activity similar to or slightly higher than that of metronidazole, ornidazole and dextrornidazole against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive  cocci, especially b. fragilis. favourable anti-anaerobic activity was also seen with levornidazole metabolites m1 and m4 but not m2, m3 or m5. for the 22 clinical b. fragilis strains, mbc50 and mbc90 values of levornidazole were 2mg/l  and 4mg/l, respectively. both mbc50/mic50 and mbc90/mic90 ratios of levornidazole were 4, similar to those of metronidazole. levornidazole is an important anti-anaerobic option in clinical settings in terms of its potent and broad-spectrum in vitro activity, bactericidal property, and the anti-anaerobic activity of its metabolites m1 and m4.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among anaerobes isolated from clinical specimens in kuwait hospitals: comparative analysis of 11-year data.
AB  == our objective was to compare the antimicrobial resistance trends among clinically relevant anaerobes against 9 different antibiotics over two periods, 2008-2012 and 2002-2007. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by determining  the mics using e test method. the interpretation of results was according to the  breakpoints recommended by the clinical laboratory and standard institute (clsi)  and european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast). a total  of 2240 clinically significant isolates were collected between 2008 and 2012 in four teaching hospitals in kuwait. the commonest isolates were bacteroides fragilis (40.4%), prevotella bivia (18.6%), peptostreptococcus spp. (13.8%) and bacteroides ovatus (11.1%). according to clsi and eucast breakpoints used for the 2008-2012 and 2002-2007 isolates, high resistance rates to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, penicillin and piperacillin were noted among the gram-negative isolates. they ranged between 0 and 0-62.1 and 62.1%, and 0 and 0-59.1 and 62.1%, respectively against clindamycin, 0 and 0-34.5 and 45.3%, and 0 and 0-45 and 57.5%, respectively against piperacillin and 0 and 0-24.2 and 24.2%, and 0 and 0-23.1 and 30.6%, respectively against amoxicillin-clavulanic acid. the mean interpretative results by both clsi and eucast during the 2008-2012 and 2002-2007 periods showed that the b. fragilis isolates were highly resistant to penicillin  (100 vs 100%), clindamycin (43.7 vs 44.2%), piperacillin (35.8 vs 42.7%) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (13.2 vs 14%), respectively. when compared with 2002-2007, the clsi, but not eucast, demonstrated statistically significant decreased resistance to clindamycin (p < 0.03). however, both interpretative criteria showed demonstrable statistically significant decrease in resistance rates to imipenem (p < 0.00097 vs p < 0.00074), meropenem (p < 0.000006 vs p < 0.0407) and piperacillin (p < 0.000017 vs p < 0.0461). our data shows that there  is a need for periodic monitoring of the susceptibility testing for anaerobic bacteria in the face of increasing resistance rates as well as to guide in the empirical therapy of anaerobic infections.

TI  == trends in the susceptibility of commonly encountered clinically significant anaerobes and susceptibilities of blood isolates of anaerobes to 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, 2008-2012, northern taiwan.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial resistance trends and profiles of clinical anaerobic isolates in northern taiwan. trends in the susceptibility of five commonly encountered clinical anaerobic isolates to seven agents from 2008 to 2012 were measured using the cochran-armitage trend test. the minimum inhibitory  concentrations (mics) of 16 antimicrobial agents, including fidaxomicin and rifaximin, against anaerobic blood isolates from two medical centers were determined using the agar dilution method. during the study period, susceptibility data on 11,105 isolates were evaluated. metronidazole and chloramphenicol retained excellent activities. around 20-30 % of isolates of bacteroides and prevotella species were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefmetazole, flomoxef, and clindamycin. of the 507 tested blood isolates, the rates of resistance to commonly used agents were much higher, namely, 16.2 % for  amoxicillin-clavulanate, 15.6 % for ampicillin-sulbactam, 24.7 % for cefmetazole, and 36.1 % for clindamycin. notably, 13.5 % of b. fragilis isolates were resistant to ertapenem. also, 15.2 % of b. uniformis, 17.2 % of other bacteroides species, 14.3 % of prevotella species, and 14 % of clostridium other than c. perfringens isolates were resistant to moxifloxacin. cefoperazone-sulbactam was active against most isolates, except for clostridium species other than perfringens (resistance rate, 18.6 %). fidaxomicin exerted poor activities against most anaerobes tested (mic90 of >128 mug/ml for b. fragilis and all isolates), except for c. perfringens (mic90 of 0.03 mug/ml) and peptostreptococcus micros (mic90 of 2 mug/ml). however, rifaximin showed a wide range of susceptibilities against the tested anaerobes (mic90 of 0.5 mug/ml for b. fragilis). the emergence of resistance to ertapenem and moxifloxacin among bacteremic anaerobes highlights the need for continuous monitoring.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == population-based assessment of the incidence, risk factors, and outcomes of anaerobic bloodstream infections.
AB  == background: anaerobes are a relatively uncommon but important cause of bloodstream infection. however, their epidemiology has not been well defined in non-selected populations. we sought to describe the incidence of, risk factors for, and outcomes associated with anaerobic bacteremia. methods: population-based surveillance for bacteremia with anaerobic microorganisms was conducted in the calgary area (population 1.2 million) during the period from 2000 to 2008. results: a total of 904 incident cases were identified, for an overall population incidence of 8.7 per 100,000 per year; 231 (26 %) were nosocomial, 300 (33 %) were healthcare-associated community-onset, and 373 (41 %) were community-acquired. elderly males were at the greatest risk. the most common pathogens identified were: bacteroides fragilis group (3.6 per 100,000), clostridium (non-perfringens) spp. (1.1 per 100,000), peptostreptococcus spp. (0.9 per 100,000), and clostridium perfringens (0.7 per 100,000). non-susceptibility to metronidazole was 2 %, to clindamycin 17 %, and to penicillin 42 %. relative to the general population, risk factors for anaerobic bloodstream infection included: male sex, increasing age, a prior diagnosis of cancer, chronic liver disease, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, stroke, inflammatory bowel disease, human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd), and/or hemodialysis-dependent chronic renal failure (hdcrf). the 30-day mortality was 20 %. increasing age, nosocomial acquisition, presence of malignancy, and several other co-morbid illnesses were independently associated with an increased risk of death. conclusion: anaerobic bloodstream infection is responsible for a significant burden of disease in general populations. the data herein establish the extent to which anaerobes contribute to morbidity and subsequent mortality. this information is key in developing preventative, empiric treatment and research priorities.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == [specificity of the anaerobic bacterial infections in the surgical and orthopedic wards].
AB  == introduction: the aim of this study was to estimate the contribution strictly anaerobic bacteria in the etiology of infections in patients on surgery and orthopedic wards. methods: we examined 159 samples taken from patients hospitalized in surgical wards and 179 clinical specimens taken from orthopedic patients. clinical strains of obligate anaerobes were identified by api 20a biochemical tests (atb expression, biomerieux s.a., france). susceptibility of the clinical strains was examined by atb ana (biomerieux s.a., france) system. the mic values were determined by the gradient diffusion method, etest (ab biodisk, sweden i biomerieux s.a., france). results: gram-negative bacteria predominant in the samples taken from surgical patients, most frequently we isolated rods of the genus bacteroides (26%): b. fragilis, b. ovatus/b. thetaiotaomicron, and b. distasonis. in 44 samples (28%) we identified only anaerobic bacteria. multibacterial isolations, with the participation of anaerobic and aerobic flora, dominated among patients in the study. overall 238 strictly anaerobic bacteria were cultured from patients hospitalized in orthopedic wards. gram-positive bacteria accounted for 78%. the most frequently were isolated peptostreptococcus (56%), propionibacterium (10%) species. in this  study all bacteroides strains were resistant to penicillin g. some species were resistant to clindamycin, as well. overall 40% of bacteroides strains taken from  surgical and 50% isolated from orthopedic wards showed no sensitivity to this antibiotic. a similar phenomenon was observed among bacteria of the genus prevotella. conclusions: in samples taken from orthopedic patients we observed the predominance of gram-positive anaerobic bacteria. some of them were part of the normal flora but they should not be excluded as an etiology agents of infection. the specimens taken from patients treated in surgical wards showed the presence of a mixed microflora, which included aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, primarily gram-negative rods. rational empirical therapy of infections with anaerobes should be mainly based on the resistance pattern in each ward and hospital. in view of the increasing in the number of resistant strains is necessary to monitor drug resistance of anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.

TI  == structural segregation of gut microbiota between colorectal cancer patients and healthy volunteers.
AB  == despite a long-suspected role in the development of human colorectal cancer (crc), the composition of gut microbiota in crc patients has not been adequately  described. in this study, fecal bacterial diversity in crc patients (n=46) and healthy volunteers (n=56) were profiled by 454 pyrosequencing of the v3 region of the 16s ribosomal rna gene. both principal component analysis and unifrac analysis showed structural segregation between the two populations. forty-eight operational taxonomic units (otus) were identified by redundancy analysis as key  variables significantly associated with the structural difference. one otu closely related to bacteroides fragilis was enriched in the gut microbiota of crc patients, whereas three otus related to bacteroides vulgatus and bacteroides uniformis were enriched in that of healthy volunteers. a total of 11 otus belonging to the genera enterococcus, escherichia/shigella, klebsiella, streptococcus and peptostreptococcus were significantly more abundant in the gut  microbiota of crc patients, and 5 otus belonging to the genus roseburia and other butyrate-producing bacteria of the family lachnospiraceae were less abundant. real-time quantitative pcr further validated the significant reduction of butyrate-producing bacteria in the gut microbiota of crc patients by measuring the copy numbers of butyryl-coenzyme a coa transferase genes (mann-whitney test,  p<0.01). reduction of butyrate producers and increase of opportunistic pathogens  may constitute a major structural imbalance of gut microbiota in crc patients.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == [identification of anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical specimens and determination of antibiotic susceptibilities].
AB  == routine isolation, identification and susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria present several difficulties leading to defects in the determination of  local susceptibility patterns which will guide empirical treatment protocols. this study was carried out to identify the anaerobic bacteria isolated from various clinical materials obtained from the suspected patients with anaerobic infection and to determine the antibiotic susceptibilities against several antibiotics. one hundred clinical specimens (36 blood, 31 abscess, 12 peritoneal  fluid, 7 joint fluid, 7 pleural fluid, 3 biopsies, 3 cerebrospinal fluids and 1 surgical wound) that were examined in our laboratory during march 20-october 30 2007, were included in the study. the specimens were collected and transported under anaerobic conditions and inoculated to conventional aerobic media and to wilkins chalgren agar, schaedler agar and chopped-meat broth for anaerobic isolation. isolated anaerobic bacteria were identified with api 20a panels (bio-merieux, france) via conventional methods and by the help of an-ident discs  (oxoid, england). penicillin g, clindamycin, cefoxitin, metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem susceptibility tests were performed with e-  test method. twenty two anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 14 clinical specimens; 7 of the specimens yielding the growth of more than one type of anaerobic bacteria and 8 specimens yielding both anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacterial (4 escherichia coli and 4 enterococcus spp.) growth. anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 89 abscess and in 6 peritoneal fluid specimens. the distribution of the anaerobic bacteria identified among these specimens were as follows: bacteroides fragilis (n = 6), bacteroides spp. other than b.fragilis (n = 4), clostridium spp. (n = 2), fusobacterium necrophorum/nucleatum (n = 1), prevotella intermedia/disiens (n = 1), peptococcus niger (n = 2), peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 5), and lactobacillus acidophilus/lenseii (n = 1). beta-lactamase activity was detected only in 2 of the 6 b. fragilis isolates. all of the isolates were susceptible to imipenem and  piperacillin/tazobactam. the highest rate of resistance was detected against penicillin g (9/22; 41%). while anaerobic gram-positive cocci (n = 7) were found  to be sensitive to all antibiotics, the rate of resistance among anaerobic gram-negative bacilli were 75% (9/12) to penicillin, 33.3% (4/12) to clindamycin, 8.3% (1/12) to metronidazole. among anaerobic gram-positive bacilli (n = 3), 2 were resistant to metronidazole, one to clindamycin and one to cefoxitin. the results of this first anaerobic antimicrobial susceptibility testing study performed at konya area in turkey revealed that penicillin was not appropriate in empirical treatment of anaerobic infections, clindamycin susceptibility should be tested before use, metronidazole and cefoxitin could be used in empirical treatment and imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam should be saved for the treatment of complicated infections and infections caused by resistant bacteria.

TI  == the role of anaerobic bacteria in bacteremia.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria remain an important cause of bloodstream infections and account for 1-17% of positive blood cultures. this review summarizes the epidemiology, microbiology, predisposing conditions, and treatment of anaerobic bacteremia (ab) in newborns, children, adults and in patients undergoing dental procedures. the majority of ab are due to gram-negative bacilli, mostly bacteroides fragilis group. the other species causing ab include peptostreptococcus, clostridium spp., and fusobacterium spp. many of these infections are polymicrobial. ab in newborns is associated with prolonged labor,  premature rupture of membranes, maternal amnionitis, prematurity, fetal distress, and respiratory difficulty. the predisposing conditions in children include: chronic debilitating disorders such as malignant neoplasm, hematologic abnormalities, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, or decubitus ulcers and carried a poor prognosis. predisposing factors to ab in adults include malignant neoplasms, hematologic disorders, transplantation of organs, recent gastrointestinal or obstetric gynecologic surgery, intestinal obstruction, diabetes mellitus, post-splenectomy, use of cytotoxic agents or corticosteroids,  and an undrained abscess. early recognition and appropriate treatment of these infections are of great clinical importance.

TI  == [anaerobic bloodstream infections: study of 68 episodes].
AB  == introduction: there is some controversy regarding the current rates of anaerobic  bacteremia. some authors have described an increasing incidence in recent years,  whereas others report declining rates. there is even debate over whether to routinely perform anaerobic blood cultures. we present a prospective analysis of  anaerobic bloodstream infections diagnosed at our medical center from january 2003 to may 2008. results: sixty-eight patients had bloodstream infection caused  exclusively by anaerobic bacteria. median age was 64+/-19 years and 63.2% had at  least one comorbid condition, including 20.6% with a solid neoplasm, often related to the gastrointestinal tract. the main focus of anaerobic bacteremia was the abdomen (42.6%). the most common isolates were several species from the bacteroides fragilis group (36.7%), clostridium spp. (17.6%), peptostreptococcus  spp. (16.1%), and prevotella spp. (16.1%). empirical antimicrobial treatment was  adequate in 69.1%. overall mortality was 23.5%, and bacteremia-related mortality  was 9.2%. sepsis, septic shock, and a pitt score >4 were independent predictors of mortality. conclusions: the incidence of anaerobic bacteremia in our hospital  was 0.89 cases per 1000 hospital admissions. patients at high risk were elderly persons with associated underlying diseases including malignant disease. mortality was high.

AB  == the susceptibility trends for all anaerobes processed by the anaerobe reference laboratory against various antibiotics were determined by using data for 2557 isolates referred by all government hospitals in kuwait from 2002 to 2007. mic were determined for the following anti-anaerobic antibiotics: amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, clindamycin, imipenem, meropenem, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin (for gram-positive anaerobes only), using e-test method. the commonest isolates were bacteroides fragilis (36.8%), followed by peptostreptococcus spp. (21.9%), bacteroides ovatus (15.5%) and prevotella bivia (12.1%). in addition, prevotella  oralis and other bacteroides spp. represented 8.5% and 8.1% of total number of isolates, respectively. resistance rate varied among the antimicrobial agents and the species tested. the beta-lactams, with the exception of penicillin, were the  most active drugs. piperacillin-tazobactam was the only antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were uniformly susceptible. imipenem and metronidazole were highly active with resistance rate of only <5% recorded against most isolates. however, 42.8, 55.8 and 9.3% of clostridium difficile isolates were resistant to imipenem, clindamycin and meropenem, respectively. it is noteworthy  that from 2002 to 2007, there was a gradual increase in resistance rates to clindamycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin among b. fragilis. periodic surveillance of antibiotic resistance among the anaerobic bacteria is recommended as a guide to empiric antibiotic use and formulation of guideline for appropriate choice of antimicrobial therapy in anaerobic infections.

TI  == infective endocarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this review summarizes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of infective endocarditis (ie) due to anaerobic bacteria. anaerobic bacteria are an uncommon but important cause of ie. most cases are caused by the anaerobic and microaerophilic streptococci propionibacterium acnes, bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species. predisposing factors and signs and symptoms of ie caused by  anaerobic bacteria are similar to those seen in ie due to facultative anaerobic bacteria with the following exceptions: there is a lower incidence of pre-existing valvular heart disease, a higher incidence of thromboembolic events  and a higher mortality rate with anaerobic ie. the gastrointestinal tract is the  most common source for b. fragilis group ie, the head and neck are the most common origin for fusobacterium and bacteroides species, and the head and neck or genitourinary tract is the most common source for peptostreptococcus species. multiple mycotic aneurysms are a common complication with anaerobic ie. others include valvular destruction, aortic-ring abscess, aortitis, cardiogenic shock, dysrrhythmias and septic shock. the mortality rate for patients with anaerobic ie ranges from 21 to 43%. treatment of anaerobic ie includes the use of antimicrobial effective against these organisms. surgical intervention may be indicated in some patients.

TI  == pericarditis caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of pericarditis  due to anaerobic bacteria. the predominant anaerobes isolated from patients with  pericarditis are gram-negative bacilli (mostly bacteroides fragilis group) as well as peptostreptococcus, clostridium, fusobacterium, bifidobacterium and actinomyces spp. anaerobic bacteria can be recovered from pericarditis resulting  from the following mechanisms: (i) spread from a contiguous site of infection, either de novo or following surgery or trauma (pleuropulmonary, oesophageal fistula or perforation, and odontogenic); (ii) spread from a site of infection within the heart, most commonly from endocarditis; (iii) haematogenous infection; and (iv) direct inoculation resulting from a penetrating injury or cardiothoracic surgery. anaerobic gram-negative bacilli have increased their resistance to penicillins and other antimicrobial agents in the last two decades. identification of pathogens and determination of their antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production are essential for adequate selection of antibiotic therapy effective against these organisms.

TI  == increasing trends in antimicrobial resistance among clinically important anaerobes and bacteroides fragilis isolates causing nosocomial infections: emerging resistance to carbapenems.
AB  == this study reports data on the susceptibilities to five commonly used antianaerobic agents of five clinically frequently encountered anaerobes from 2000 to 2007 and to bacteroides fragilis isolates causing nosocomial infections from 1990 to 2006. there was a trend of decreasing susceptibilities of these anaerobes to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefmetazole, chloramphenicol, and clindamycin  with time during the study period. the rates of susceptibility to clindamycin and cefmetazole for all clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis isolates were higher than those of isolates associated with nosocomial infections. the mics of  207 anaerobic blood isolates collected in 2006 to 14 antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. the rates of nonsusceptibility to imipenem and meropenem were 7% and 12% for b. fragilis isolates (n = 60), 7% and  3% for bacteroides thetaiotamicron isolates (n = 30), 4% and 4% for fusobacterium species (n = 27), 6% and 0% for prevotella species (n = 16), 15% and 0% for clostridium species (n = 28), and 0% and 0% for peptostreptococcus species (n = 32). the rates of susceptibility to moxifloxacin were 90% for b. fragilis isolates, 87% for b. thetaiotaomicron isolates, 81% for fusobacterium species, 75% for prevotella species, 93% for clostridium species, and 78% for peptostreptococcus species. thirty-six percent of clostridium species and 12% of  peptostreptococcus species were not susceptible to metronidazole. comparison of the data with the data from a previous survey from the same institute in 2002 revealed higher rates of nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, especially for b. fragilis, fusobacterium species, and prevotella species isolates. the high rates  of nonsusceptibility to commonly used antianaerobic agents mandate our attention, and periodic monitoring of the trend of the resistance is crucial.

TI  == microbiology and management of joint and bone infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == purpose: to describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of septic arthritis and osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria. results: the predominant anaerobes in arthritis are anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (agnb) including the bacteroides fragilis group, fusobacterium spp., peptostreptococcus spp., and propionibacterium acnes. infection with p. acnes is associated with a prosthetic  joint, previous surgery, and trauma. b. fragilis group is associated with distant infection, clostridium spp. with trauma, and fusobacterium spp. with oropharyngeal infection. most cases of anaerobic arthritis, in contrast to anaerobic osteomyelitis, involved a single isolate, and most cases are secondary  to hematogenous spread. the predominant anaerobes in osteomyelitis are bacteroides, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and clostridium spp. as well as p. acnes. conditions predisposing to bone infections are vascular disease, bites, contiguous infection, peripheral neuropathy, hematogenous spread, and trauma. pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas spp. are mostly isolated in skull and bite infections, members of the b. fragilis group in hand and feet infections, and fusobacterium spp. in skull, bite, and hematogenous long bone infections. many patients with osteomyelitis due to anaerobic bacteria have evidence of an anaerobic infection elsewhere in the body that is the source of the organisms involved in the osteomyelitis. treatment of arthritis and osteomyelitis involving anaerobic bacteria includes symptomatic therapy, immobilization in some cases, adequate drainage of purulent material, and antibiotic therapy effective against  these organisms. conclusions: anaerobic bacteria can cause septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. correct diagnosis and appropriate therapy are important contributor to successful outcome.

TI  == rapid identification of non-sporing anaerobes using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and an identification strategy.
AB  == purpose: the non-sporing anaerobes cause a wide spectrum of infections. they are  difficult to culture and their identification is tedious and time-consuming. rapid identification of anaerobes is highly desirable. towards this end, the potential of nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy for providing a fingerprint within the proton spectrum of six genera belonging to anaerobes reflecting their characteristic metabolites has been investigated. methods: nmr analysis was carried out using mercury plus varian 300 mhz (7.05 t) nmr spectrophotometer on six different anaerobes. these included bacteroides fragilis, prevotella melaninogenica, prevotella denticola, fusobacterium necrophorum, peptococcus niger and peptostreptococcus spp. after the nmr analysis (256/512 scans), the different peaks were noted. the eight pus specimens, which yielded pure culture of anaerobe, also were analysed similarly. results: the major resonances of multiplex of amino acids/lipid at 0.9 ppm along with lactate/lipid at 1.3 ppm, acetate at 1.92 ppm and multiplex of lysine at 3.0 ppm  remained constant to label the organism as an anaerobe. there was a difference found in the mr spectra of different genera and species. a simple algorithm was developed for the identification of the six different anaerobes studied. the mr spectra of the pure culture of the organism matched the mr spectra of pus from which the organism was isolated. conclusions: mr-based identification was of value in the identification of anaerobes. however, a larger database of the peaks produced by anaerobes needs to be created for identification of all genera and species. it could then have the potential of diagnosing an anaerobic infection in vivo and thus expedite management of deep-seated abscesses.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of dc-159a, a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == dc-159a is a new 8-methoxy fluoroquinolone that possesses a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, with extended activity against gram-positive pathogens, especially streptococci and staphylococci from patients with community-acquired infections. dc-159a showed activity against streptococcus spp. (mic(90), 0.12 microg/ml) and inhibited the growth of 90% of levofloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains at 1 microg/ml. the mic 90s of dc-159a against staphylococcus  spp. were 0.5 microg/ml or less. against quinolone- and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains, however, the mic 90 of dc-159a was 8 microg/ml. dc-159a was the most active against enterococcus spp. (mic 90, 4 to 8 microg/ml)  and was more active than the marketed fluoroquinolones, such as levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and klebsiella pneumoniae were 0.015, 0.06, and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of dc-159a against mycoplasma pneumoniae was eightfold more potent than that of levofloxacin. the mics of dc-159a against chlamydophila pneumoniae were comparable to those of moxifloxacin, and dc-159a was more potent than levofloxacin. the mic 90s of dc-159a against peptostreptococcus spp., clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis were 0.5, 4, and 2 microg/ml, respectively; and among the quinolones tested it showed the highest level of activity against anaerobic organisms. dc-159a demonstrated rapid bactericidal activity against quinolone-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains both in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, dc-159a showed faster killing than moxifloxacin and garenoxacin. the bactericidal activity of dc-159a in a murine muscle infection model was revealed to be superior to that of moxifloxacin. these activities carried over to the in vivo efficacy in the murine pneumonia model, in which treatment with dc-159a led to bactericidal activity superior to those of the other agents tested.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility of clinically relevant anaerobes in estonia from 1999 to 2001.
AB  == at present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. the objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the estonian population. in total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. the anaerobes were isolated on wilkins-chalgren agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam  by e-tests. the results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of nccls. data from the estonian state agency of medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (defined daily doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). the following species of anaerobes were isolated: b. fragilis group, bacteroides sp., fusobacterium sp., porphyromonas sp., prevotella sp., peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified gram-positive rods. metronidazole resistance was not found among gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in estonia. only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent  in vitro activity against all anaerobes. unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. in the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (ddd/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. high resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. we would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.

TI  == an in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. the agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. in this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. the time-kill experiment was performed using anaerobe broth medium. the drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/l for linezolid, 2mg/l for clindamycin, and 8mg/l for metronidazole. samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the bioscience international autospiral dw. exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees c).  the species tested included bacteroides fragilis (2), b. distasonis, b. thetaiotaomicron, fusobacterium nucleatum, f. varium, prevotella melaninogenica,  clostridium perfringens, eubacterium lentum and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). the activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. as expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. metronidazole yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions  of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three  strains. linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)cfu/ml reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. the profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.

TI  == occurrence and activity of human intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of dietary lignans.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is necessary for the production of enterolignans  from the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg). however, little is known about the bacteria that contribute to sdg conversion. therefore, we aimed at describing the occurrence and activity of sdg metabolising bacteria. the data showed differences in conversion efficiency between sdg deglycosylating species, but sdg was completely deglycosylated within 20 h by five of six strains. the strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db showed the highest initial rate  of sdg deglycosylation. furthermore, we found that bacteroides distasonis and b.  fragilis made up 0.5% and 3.3% of total faecal bacteria, respectively. however, clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db was detected within the dominant microbiota of only  two out of 20 faecal samples. bacteria involved in the demethylation step of sdg  conversion also demethylated a variety of compounds other than sdg. in particular, peptostreptococcus productus demethylated the lignans pinoresinol, lariciresinol and matairesinol. finally, eggerthella lenta catalysed the reduction of pinoresinol and lariciresinol to secoisolariciresinol.

TI  == a 62-month retrospective epidemiological survey of anaerobic bacteraemia in a university hospital.
AB  == the incidence of anaerobic bacteraemia was studied retrospectively over 62 months at mont-godinne university hospital, yvoir, belgium. the distribution of organisms, clinical presentations, choice of antimicrobial therapy and clinical outcome were analysed. the proportion of positive blood cultures yielding obligate anaerobes was 3.3%. the overall incidence of clinically significant anaerobic bacteraemia was 0.51 cases/1,000 patient admissions (0.61 cases/10,000  hospital-days), but was significantly higher in patients with active haematological malignancies than in other groups (5.97/10,000 vs. 0.33/10,000 hospital-days; p < 0.05). the bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 61% of isolates, followed by clostridium spp. (12.2%), peptostreptococcus spp. and leptotrichia spp. (7.3% each) and fusobacterium spp. (4.8%). the most common risk-factors were gastrointestinal surgery (49%) and active haematological malignancies with chemotherapy and/or bone marrow graft (47%). one or more co-morbidities were present in 30 (77%) of 39 patients. the lower gastrointestinal tract (41%) and the oropharynx (23%) were the two most frequent  presumed or proven sources for bacteraemia, with the origin remaining unknown in  eight (20.5%) cases. the overall mortality rate (evaluated 7 days after the occurrence of bacteraemia) was 13%. fatal outcome correlated with the severity of underlying diseases and the immunosuppressed status of the patients rather than with the causative pathogen or the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy. likewise, there was no difference in the mortality rate between patients with monomicrobial and polymicrobial bacteraemia. overall, the data re-emphasise the importance of anaerobic bacteraemia, especially in patients with haematological malignancies.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in new zealand: 1999-2003.
AB  == objectives: routine susceptibility testing of all anaerobic organisms is not advocated, but it is useful for laboratories to test periodically for anaerobic organisms and provide local susceptibility data to guide therapy. this study reports the national trend of antibiotic susceptibility of clinically significant anaerobes in new zealand. methods: clinical isolates were tested using standardized methods against a range of antibiotics commonly used to treat anaerobic infections. susceptibility was determined using nccls criteria. the change in susceptibility trends between this study and earlier studies was measured by comparing the geometric mean of the mic. results: a total of 364 anaerobes were tested. penicillin had poor activity against bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., eubacterium spp., clostridium tertium and veillonella spp. in general, fusobacterium spp., bacteroides ureolyticus, propionibacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and anaerobic streptococci isolates, with the exception of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, were penicillin susceptible. amoxicillin/clavulanate showed good activity against most anaerobes, but resistance was seen with bacteroides fragilis group and p. anaerobius isolates. cefoxitin was more active than cefotetan, particularly against non-b. fragilis species, eubacterium spp. and p. anaerobius. meropenem and imipenem showed good activity against all anaerobes, with only 2 and 4% of bacteroides spp., respectively, showing resistance. with the exception of propionibacterium acnes isolates, which are predictably resistant, metronidazole was active against all anaerobes tested. there has been little change in susceptibility since 1997. conclusions: metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin/tazobactam and amoxicillin/clavulanate remain good empirical choices when anaerobes are expected in our setting. no clinically relevant changes in susceptibility over time were found.

TI  == phylogeny of human intestinal bacteria that activate the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside.
AB  == the human intestinal microbiota is essential for the conversion of the dietary lignan secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (sdg) via secoisolariciresinol (seco) to  the enterolignans enterodiol (ed) and enterolactone (el). however, knowledge of the species that catalyse the underlying reactions is scant. therefore, we focused our attention on the identification of intestinal bacteria involved in the conversion of sdg. strains of bacteroides distasonis, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and clostridium cocleatum, as well as the newly isolated strain clostridium sp. sdg-mt85-3db, deglycosylated sdg. demethylation of seco was catalysed by strains of butyribacterium methylotrophicum, eubacterium callanderi, eubacterium limosum and peptostreptococcus productus. dehydroxylation of seco was catalysed by strains of clostridium scindens and eggerthella lenta. finally, the newly isolated strain ed-mt61/pyg-s6 catalysed the dehydrogenation of ed to el. the results indicate that the activation of sdg involves phylogenetically diverse bacteria, most of which are members of the dominant human intestinal microbiota.

TI  == analysis of microbial etiology and mortality in patients with brain abscess.
AB  == objectives: despite the technological advancements in diagnostic and neurosurgical procedures, brain abscess continues to remain a potentially fatal central nervous system infection. in a prospective study we determined the predisposing factors and the microbiological profile of brain abscess. we also analyzed the mortality in patients with the type of infections identified. methods: over a period of 8 years (1997-2004), aspirated pus from 118 patients with brain abscess was directly inoculated into bactec plus+ aerobic and bactec plus+ anaerobic media immediately after collection and subcultured on solid media as appropriate. predisposing factors, if any, were recorded in all patients. mortality of patients during hospital stay was correlated with the type of infections identified. results: predisposing factors were identified in 94 (79.7%) patients, otogenic infection being the most common (37/118; 31.4%). microorganisms were demonstrated in 96 (81.4%) patients, by culture in 89 (75.4%) patients and by gram stain in 7 (5.9%) additional cases. a total of 105 organisms were isolated - 67 (63.8%) aerobes, 32 (30.5%) anaerobes, 5 (4.8%) mycobacteria and 1 (0.9%) fungus. viridans streptococci (23.8%), staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), bacteroides fragilis group/species and peptostreptococcus species (10.5% each) were the common isolates. overall mortality was 14.4%; patients with gram-negative infections had higher mortality than gram-positive infections (6/20; 30% vs. 6/63; 9.5%; p=0.02). conclusions: culture of pus immediately after aspiration in an automated system yields good results. gram stain coupled with culture can guide the neurosurgeons better to treat their patients more rationally. patients with gram-negative infections need special attention in terms of management because of high mortality rate.

TI  == identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of micro-organisms recovered from cutaneous lesions of human american tegumentary leishmaniasis in minas gerais, brazil.
AB  == an evaluation of the microbiota present in cutaneous ulcers from 31 patients with a clinical and parasitological diagnosis of american tegumentary leishmaniasis (atl) was carried out by the standard filter paper disc technique, including antimicrobial susceptibility of the bacterial isolates. microbial examination indicated that 21 patients (67.7%) were contaminated with one to four bacteria and some of them also with yeast. a total of 142 micro-organisms were isolated. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently recovered bacterium (95.2% of positive patients) and was found to produce type b (70% of the staphylococcal isolates) and type c (50%) enterotoxins as well as toxic shock syndrome toxin (60%). proteus mirabilis (33.3% of the positive patients), streptococcus pyogenes (19.0 %), h(2)s-negative proteus species (19.0%), klebsiella oxytoca (14.3%), enterobacter species (9.5%), peptostreptococcus species (9.5%), pseudomonas species (4.8%), prevotella bivia (4.8%), escherichia coli (4.8%), streptococcus agalactiae (4.8%), bacteroides fragilis (4.8%), candida albicans (9.5%) and candida tropicalis (4.8%) were also isolated. surprisingly, staph. aureus isolates were susceptible to almost all tested drugs, although some of them were  resistant to penicillin (69%) and ampicillin + sulbactam (68%). concerning obligate anaerobes, all the gram-negative isolates (25% of the total) were resistant to metronidazole. the results of the present study show that microbial  secondary contaminants, particularly staph. aureus, should be considered in the diagnosis and treatment of atl lesions.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == [comparison of the detection of anaerobic bacteria in haemoculture systems bactec lytic/10 anaerobic/f, bact/alert fan anaerobic and bact/alert fn anaerobic].
AB  == the purpose of this study is to deal with the problem of anaerobic cultivation of clinical specimens and consider the possibility of using semi-automated blood culture instruments. the bactec lytic, bact/alert fan anaerobic and bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles were inoculated with bacteriodes fragilis, clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and feingoldia magna strains. the times to detection (ttd) for positive bottles were evaluated with reference to the number of inoculated bacteria. inoculation with the same suspension of equal  bacterial strain resulted in shorter ttd values for all the bactec lytic bottles  as compared with the bact/alert fan anaerobic or bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles, respectively. statistically significant differences were recorded (p=0,05) by bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens species. feingoldia magna was submitted to culture in the bactec lytic alone. the anaerobic blood culture bottles are deemed acceptable for application in the culture of anaerobc isolates drawn from other samples except for blood (namely when prompt delivery of the sample to the laboratory is impossible and the sample can suffer damage), however, only a limited range of microorganisms can be taken into account for the detection purposes. the bactec lytic bottles are more appropriately designed for  the detection of anaerobic bacterial species compared to the bact/alert fan anaerobic and bact/alert fn anaerobic bottles. they achieve faster growth parametres and provide more successful readings of anaerobic bacteria culture and detection.

TI  == toll-like receptors-2, -3 and -4 expression patterns on human colon and their regulation by mucosal-associated bacteria.
AB  == the colonic epithelium provides an interface between the host and micro-organisms colonising the gastrointestinal tract. molecular recognition of bacteria is facilitated through toll-like receptors (tlr). the colonic epithelium expresses relatively high levels of mrna for tlr3 and less for tlr2 and -4. little is known of the expression patterns and mode of induction of expression for these pattern  recognition receptors in human colon. the aim of this study was to investigate their localization in the gut and induction of expression in epithelial cell lines by mucosal bacteria. tlr2 and -4 were expressed only in crypt epithelial cells, expression was lost as the cells matured and moved towards the gut lumen.  in contrast, tlr3 was only produced in mature epithelial cells. ht29 and caco-2 had different levels of expression for tlr1-4. co-culture of ht29 cells with different mucosal isolates showed that they were highly responsive to bacterial challenge, with up-regulation of mrna for tlr1-4. in contrast, caco-2 cells were  refractive to bacterial challenge, showing little difference in mrna levels. tlr3 was induced in ht29 only by gram-positive commensals with up-regulation of both mrna and protein and an enhancement of the antiviral immune response. this pattern of expression allows induction of responsiveness to bacteria only by the  crypt epithelium so that tolerance to commensal organisms can be maintained. in contrast, mature columnar epithelium is able to respond to viral pathogens, which are not part of the normal gut commensal microbiota.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003  and march 2004].
AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2003 to march 2004 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 455 strains including 14 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 191(75.2%) of 254 patients with surgical infections. two hundred and thirty-nine strains were isolated from primary infections, and 216 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria and aerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. among anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate  of anaerobic gram-positive bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the last several years. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant mrsa. carbapenm-resistant p. aeruginosa was seen in less than 10 per cents. last year we noticed that there were cefazolin-resistant e. coli producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase, but there was no highly cefazolin-resistant e. coli in this year. in the next series, increase of both anaerobic bacteria and enterococcus spp. should be carefully followed up.

TI  == infected neonatal cephalohematomas caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == objective: to present the microbiological and clinical features of six children with infected cephalohematomas (ic) caused by anaerobic bacteria. design: presentation of a case series. results: polymicrobial infection was present in all instances, where the number of isolates varied from two to four. two patients had anaerobes only and the other four had mixed flora of strict anaerobes and facultatives. there were 16 bacterial isolates (12 anaerobic, 4 aerobic). the anaerobic isolates were peptostreptococcus spp. (5 isolates), prevotella spp. (4), bacteroides fragilis group (2), and propionibacterium acnes (1). the aerobic isolates were e. coli (2), staphylococcus aureus (1) and group b streptococci (1). blood cultures were positive for three patients. the most common predisposing conditions were vacuum extraction and amnionitis (4 instances of each), instrumental delivery (3), electronic fetal monitoring (2), prolonged delivery (1), and premature rupture of membranes (1). all patients underwent drainage, and four also had surgical incision and drainage of the ic. osteomyelitis developed in one instance and scalp abscess developed in two patients, both of whom had electronic fetal monitoring. all patients eventually recovered from infection after receiving parenteral and subsequent oral antibiotic therapy for a total of 14-38 days. conclusion: this study highlights the polymicrobial nature and potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in ic in  newborns.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of linezolid in obese patients with cellulitis.
AB  == background: linezolid is an oxazolidinone antimicrobial with excellent oral bioavailability and tissue penetration and is active against multidrug-resistant  skin/soft tissue pathogens. objective: to study the pharmacokinetics and antibacterial activity of linezolid against selective skin/soft tissue pathogens  in obese patients. methods: we obtained multiple serum samples from 7 obese patients (>50% over their calculated ideal body weight) receiving oral linezolid  600 mg every 12 hours for treatment of cellulitis. following a minimum of 3 doses, serum concentrations of linezolid were measured in each subject prior to (trough) and 1 and 6 hours after a dose. these samples were then tested against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (linezolid minimum inhibitory concentrations [mics] 1.0, 2.0, 4.0 microg/ml) and  one strain each of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre) (mic 2.0 microg/ml), bacteroides fragilis (mic 2.0 microg/ml), and peptostreptococcus magnus (mic 1.0 microg/ml). serum inhibitory titers (sits) and bactericidal titers (sbts) were measured at each time point, and the median activity for these 7 patients was calculated. results: mean linezolid serum concentrations were 4.2, 12.3, and 7.2 microg/ml at these respective time points. median sits for 12 hours (100% of the dosing interval) were observed against each organism with the exception of the least susceptible strain of mrsa (mic 4.0 microg/ml); serum inhibitory activity was observed only at the one-hour time point against this isolate. furthermore, prolonged (> or =6 h) median sbts were observed against one isolate of mrsa (mic 1.0 microg/ml) as well as the strain of vre and p. magnus. conclusions: serum concentrations of oral linezolid in this patient population were diminished compared with those of healthy volunteers, but still provided prolonged serum inhibitory activity against common pathogens associated with skin/soft tissue infections. one treatment concern would be an obese patient receiving oral linezolid who was infected with a less susceptible (mic > or =4.0  microg/ml) strain of s. aureus. bactericidal activity was also observed against selective pathogens.

TI  == pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 milligrams and various doses of metronidazole in healthy adult subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the steady-state pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 mg administered once daily combined with three different dosages of intravenous metronidazole (500 mg every 8 h [q8h], 1,000 mg q24h, and 1,500 mg q24h). eighteen healthy adult subjects received all three combinations in a randomized,  crossover fashion. serial blood and urine samples were collected on the third day of each study period. the 24-h areas under the inhibitory (auic(0-24)) and bactericidal (aubc(0-24)) curves of these three combination regimens were determined against clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and escherichia coli. the  mean concentrations of levofloxacin were not different between study periods and  were similar to those previously published. the mean (+/- standard deviation) areas under the metronidazole plasma concentration-time curve (auc(0-24)) for 1,500-mg q24h (338 +/- 105 mg.h/liter) and 500-mg q8h (356 +/- 68 mg.h/liter) regimens were not different (p > 0.05), but both were significantly higher than the 1,000-mg q24h auc(0-24) (p < 0.05, 227 +/- 57 mg.h/liter). mean (+/- standard deviation) total body clearance and renal clearance values were similar among the 500-mg q8h, 1,000-mg q24, and 1,500-mg q24h regimens (62 +/- 7, 67 +/- 13, and 67 +/- 14 and 11 +/- 3, 12 +/- 2, and 12 +/- 5 ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively). levofloxacin at 750 mg q24h plus metronidazole at 500 mg q8h or 1,500 mg q24h resulted in similar auic(0-24) and aubc(0-24) values with one exception: the auic(0-24) for the 1,500-mg q24h regimen against b. thetaiotamicron was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than those of the other regimens. overall, the combination of levofloxacin at 750 mg once daily and metronidazole at 500 mg q8h  or 1,500 mg q24h appeared to have greater auic(0-24) and aubc(0-24) values than did the 1,000-mg q24h regimen. all combination regimens of levofloxacin and metronidazole were well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse effects were reported. the pharmacokinetic, safety, and pharmacodynamic data from our study suggest that a once-daily regimen of intravenous levofloxacin at 750 mg and metronidazole at 1,500 mg warrants further clinical investigation.

TI  == surgical infections: a microbiological study.
AB  == surgical infections are mostly polymicrobial, involving both aerobes and anaerobes. one hundred seventeen cases comprised of abscesses (n=51), secondary peritonitis (n=25), necrotizing fascitis (n=22) and wounds with devitalized tissues (n=19) were studied. the number of microorganisms isolated per lesion was highest in secondary peritonitis (2.32). the aerobe/ anaerobe ratio was 0.81 in secondary peritonitis and 1.8 in necrotizing fascitis. most secondary peritonitis (80%), necrotizing fascitis (75%) and wounds with devitalized tissues (66.7%) were polymicrobial. common microorganisms isolated in our study were e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. the most effective antibiotics for s. aureus were clindamycin (79.1%) and cefuroxime (70.8%). for gram-negatives (klebsiella spp., e. coli and proteus spp.), the most effective antibiotics were cefotaxime,  ceftizoxime, amikacin and ciprofloxacin. pseudomonas aeruginosa was maximally sensitive to amikacin (35.2%) and ciprofloxacin (35.2%). the greatest degree of multidrug resistance to all the drugs was found in p. aeruginosa (52.9%), followed by klebsiella spp. (33.3%), proteus spp. (33.3%), e. coli (22.2%), and s. aureus (12.5%). all the anaerobes that we isolated were 100% sensitive to metronidazole and chloramphenicol, followed by clindamycin (95% to 100%). apart from antibiotic therapy, non-antimicrobial methods, such as hyperbaric oxygen therapy and debridement also play an important role in the treatment of surgical  infections.

TI  == intra-abdominal, retroperitoneal, and visceral abscesses in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis, and management of intra-abdominal abscesses (including subphrenic, hepatic, splenic, and retroperitoneal abscesses) in children. they often occur as a complication of local or generalized peritonitis, commonly secondary to appendicitis, necrotizing enterocolitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and tubo-ovarian infection, surgery or trauma. the original infection generally occurs because of the entry of enteric microorganisms into the peritoneal cavity through a defect in the wall of the intestine or other viscus as a result of obstruction, infarction, or direct trauma. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora can be recovered from most abscesses. the predominant aerobic isolates are escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus spp. and the main anaerobic bacteria are bacteroides fragilis group  peptostreptococcus spp., fusobacterium spp., and clostridium spp. the treatment of intraabdominal abscesses includes drainage, surgical correction of pathology,  and administration of antimicrobials effective against both aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms.

TI  == nitroimidazole resistance genes (nimb) in anaerobic gram-positive cocci (previously peptostreptococcus spp.).
AB  == objectives: to investigate metronidazole resistance and the prevalence of nitroimidazole (nim) genes in clinically isolated anaerobic gram-positive cocci.  methods: metronidazole susceptibility was determined in 99 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci and pcr amplification for the nim gene carried out on 61 strains (metronidazole mic > or =0.5 mg/l). results: the nimb gene was detected in 34% (21/61) of the strains. these included two highly resistant finegoldia magna strains (mics >128 mg/l). the nimb gene was, however, also demonstrated in  90% (19/21) of susceptible strains. conclusions: although the nimb gene may be implicated in the high-level metronidazole resistance in 2 f. magna strains, the  alarmingly high prevalence of the nimb gene in anaerobic gram-positive cocci cannot be directly associated with resistance and the possibility of a silent nimb gene should be considered.

AB  == in vitro susceptibility data were collected for co-amoxiclav and other antimicrobial agents against 1297 recent anaerobe isolates collected in europe and the usa. the co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) mic(50/90)s (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration in a ratio of 2:1, expressed in terms  of amoxicillin concentration in mg/l) were 0.5/4 for bacteroides fragilis, </=0.125/1 for prevotella species, </=0.125/0.25 for fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5/1 for eikenella corrodens, 0.25/8 for peptostreptococcus anaerobius, </=0.125/0.5 for micromonas (peptostreptococcus) micros, </=0.25/0.5 for fingoldia (peptostreptococcus) magna, and </=0.125/0.125 for porphyromonas species. the co-amoxiclav susceptibility rate for b. fragilis was 94.6%, for p. anaerobius 84.3% and for all other species tested 100%. these data indicate that  co-amoxiclav remains an effective drug for the antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of many anaerobic infections. among the comparator drugs, metronidazole was very active against all bacterial species (>96% susceptible) except e. corrodens (mic(50/90) of >32/>64 mg/l), which is a capnophilic organism. imipenem was also highly active against all species (>98% susceptible). levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least potent agents tested, particularly against bacteroides, prevotella and peptostreptococcus (levofloxacin susceptibility rates: bacteroides 72.7%, prevotella 71.5%, f. magna 72.4%; clindamycin susceptibility rates: bacteroides 79.5%, prevotella 92.1%, f. magna 84.7%).

AB  == tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from april 2002 to march 2003 were investigated in a multicenter study in  japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 334 strains were  isolated from 131 (75.3%) of 174 patients with surgical infections. one hundred and seventy-one strains were isolated from primary infections, and 163 strains were isolated from post-operative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic  gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, although the isolation rate of staphylococcus aureus was the highest, followed by that of enterococcus faecalis from primary infections, the isolation  rate of e. faecalis was the highest from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this  order, and from postoperative infections, e. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, and citobacter freundii. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacteria from primary infections and that of aerobic gram-positive bacteria from postoperative infections were high in the  last several years. we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci nor p. aeruginosa producing metallo-beta-lactamase. but we noticed cefazolin-resistant e. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase.

TI  == characteristics of anaerobes from skin specimens.
AB  == anaerobes isolated from skin specimens from 1999 to 2001 were examined. the most  common type was peptostreptococcus spp., especially p. magnus and p. assaccharolyticus and bacteroides fragilis. dominance was seen for p. magnus, p.  acnes and p. prevotii. peptostreptococcus spp. and p. acnes showed high susceptibility to four antimicrobial agents. prevotella spp. and b. fragilis showed low or no susceptibility to ampicillin, while b. fragilis showed low susceptibility to ceftizoxime. evaluation of anaerobes is important for the balance of skin flora as well as for the choice of antimicrobial agents, when the anaerobes are pathogenic.

TI  == [comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  == the in vitro activity of ertapenem (mk-0826), a new carbapenem, was studied against 389 aerobic microorganisms (187 enterobacteriaceae, 15 aeromonas spp., 42 staphylococcus spp., 43 streptococcus spp., 15 enterococcus spp., 30 haemophilus  spp., 15 moraxella catarrhalis, 12 neisseria gonorrhoeae, 15 pseudomonas aeruginosa and 15 acinetobacter spp.) and 54 anaerobic isolates (15 clostridium spp., 12 peptostreptococcus spp. and 27 fragilis group bacteroides recovered from four spanish hospitals. ertapenem activity was compared with that of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, and norfloxacin. ertapenem was the most active antibiotic against enterobacteriaceae  (mic(90) < or =0.5 mg/l) particularly in the case of broad-spectrum, extended-spectrum and chromosomally encoded ampc betalactamase-producing strains. ertapenem exhibited less activity, even lower than that of imipenem, against p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp. and enterococci (mic(90) > or =16 mg/l). ertapenem was active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, beta-haemolytic streptococci, and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic(90) < or =1 mg/l). in the case of haemophilus spp., m. catarrhalis and n. gonorrhoeae, ertapenem, with a mic(90) < or =0.06 mg/l resulted the most active antibiotic tested. when considering the anaerobes, ertapenem displayed a broad spectrum of activity, similar to that of imipenem, against clostridium spp. (mic(90) 2 mg/l) and was slightly less active against bacteroides fragilis (mic(90) 0.5 mg/l). both carbapenems were the most active among the tested compounds. due to its activity against almost all pathogens studied, ertapenem appears to be an option for the treatment of mixed bacterial infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == by using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of clostridium difficile for which mics of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid mics were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. nineteen clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin mic at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. all strains of eubacterium, actinomyces, propionibacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the prevotella and porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin mics for all 31 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, the fusobacterium mortiferum-fusobacterium varium group, and veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. ramoplanin displays excellent activity against c. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of ph-027 versus linezolid and other anti-anaerobic antimicrobials against clinical isolates of clostridium difficile and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == ph-027 is a new 5-triazole oxazolidinone synthesized in our laboratories, which shows strong activity against gram-positive aerobic bacteria including clinical isolates. the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro activity of this compound in comparison with linezolid and other antibiotics against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes. the in vitro activity of ph-027 in comparison with those of linezolid and other antimicrobial agents was evaluated against 201 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria by agar dilution and etest methods. ph-027 showed excellent activity, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) in the range of 0.12-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates; mic90s being 4.0, 1.0, 2.0, 2.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against clostridium difficile, peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, prevotella  bivia and fusobacterium spp. respectively. in comparison, linezolid had mic in the range of 0.5-4.0 microg/ml against all isolates, with mic90s of 2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0 and 2.0 microg/ml against the same set of bacteria respectively. ph-027  demonstrated excellent in vitro activity that is superior to linezolid against peptostreptococcus spp., b. fragilis and p. bivia. however, against c. difficile  and fusobacterium spp, ph-027 and linezolid showed comparable in vitro activity.  against all anaerobes, metronidazole, ph-027 and, to a lesser extent, linezolid had the most potent activity. from the results of in vitro susceptibility testing, both linezolid and ph-027 show promise in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

TI  == the consequences of suppression of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria such as bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus species, and  fusobacterium species, when accompanied by aerobic bacteria or in the presence of dead tissue, can cause severe infections. this article discusses the most common  type of anaerobic infection, i.e., infection after colonic contamination of the abdominal cavity and soft tissues. colonic anaerobes rarely cause infections as solitary pathogens. mixed infections of aerobes and anaerobes are treated by source control, surgical drainage and debridement, and combination antibiotic therapy. antimicrobial treatment should cover both anaerobes and aerobes; treatment of mixed infections with anti-anaerobic agents alone is likely to result in abscess formation. recent trends toward cost cutting and the advent of  antibiotics with good coverage of both aerobes and relevant pathogenic anaerobes  have led to increased single-agent therapy with cefoxitin, cefotetan, ampicillin/sulbactam, imipenem/cilastatin, ticarcillin/clavulanate, trovafloxacin/alatrofloxacin, and piperacillin/tazobactam. in the past 15 years,  research has begun to focus on the gut barrier, particularly on the beneficial effects of anaerobic microflora. directing antibiotic therapy against the anaerobe when it is involved in clinical infection is important; however, the negative consequences of anti-anaerobic antibiotic therapy on the beneficial effects of normal distal gut colonization must also be considered.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.

TI  == clinical review: bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children.
AB  == this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of bacteremia caused by anaerobic bacteria in children. bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp., clostridium sp., and fusobacterium sp. were the most common clinically significant anaerobic isolates. the strains of anaerobic organisms found depended, to a large extent, on the portal of entry and the underlying disease. predisposing conditions include: malignant neoplasms, immunodeficiencies, chronic renal insufficiency, decubitus ulcers, perforation of viscus and appendicitis, and neonatal age. organisms identical to those causing anaerobic bacteremia can often be recovered from other infected sites that may have served as a source of persistent bacteremia. when anaerobes resistant to penicillin are suspected or isolated, antimicrobial drugs such as clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefoxitin, a carbapenem, or the combination of a  beta-lactamase inhibitor and a penicillin should be administered. the early recognition of anaerobic bacteremia and administration of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy play a significant role in preventing mortality and morbidity in pediatric patients.

TI  == [anaerobic infection and its rapid detection in surgical patients].
AB  == objective: to investigate anaerobic infection and its rapid detection in surgical patients. methods: 372 specimens were collected from surgical patients for anaerobe detection. to find a rapid detectable method, 110 specimens were collected for comparative studies by using indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique (ifa), enzyme labeled antibody technique (elat) and general cultural method (cm). results: the isolation rate of anaerobes was rather high in pyothorax (88.9%), abdominal abscess (86.7%), appendicitis (83.9%) and cerebral abscess (all five cases were positive). in burn wounds, the rate was about 23.6%  especially in deep burn wounds. among 212 strains detected, the predominant anaerobes were as follows b. melaninogenicus (28.8%), b. fragilis (25%), f. nucleatum (7.5%), c. perfringens (7.5%), and peptostreptococcus (5.7%); most of them (87.8%) were non-sporing anaerobes. mixed infection with aerobes accounted for 64%. the survey of rapid detection was conducted in b. fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, c. perfringens, f. nucleatum and peptostreptococcus. the detectable rate was higher in ifa (79.1%) and elat (80.9%) than in cm (37.3%). conclusion: ifa and elat might be rapid, specific, sensitive, and simple for detecting anaerobes.

AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate etest usefulness for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes and to compare the activity of five  antibacterial drugs against clinical strains of anaerobes. one hundred strains of obligate anaerobes were tested: 2 reference strains (b. fragilis atcc 25285 and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc 29741) and 98 clinical strains isolated from patients of the infant jesus clinical hospital--center for trauma treatment in warsaw during  the last three years (1997-1999). strains of seven genera of obligate nonsporeforming anaerobes (bacteroides, prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, peptostreptococcus, propionibacterium and actinomyces) and strains of two sporeforming species (c. perfringens and c. difficile) were examined. the mic values were determined by the gradient diffusion method etest (ab biodisk, sweden). wilkins-chalgren solid medium supplemented with 5% of sheep blood was used. test plates were incubated at 35 degrees c for 48 hours in glove-box (85% n2, 10% h2, 5% co2). the mic values for each strain and antimicrobial agent, and  the mic ranges for bacteria of the same species were established. ten strains resistant to clindamycin, ten resistant to piperacillin, and ten resistant to imipenem were detected. seven strains were resistant to metronidazole and two strains to piperacillin combined with tazobactam. tazobactam restored the susceptibility of eight strains to piperacillin. obtained results confirm that etest method is useful for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of obligate anaerobes. older (clindamycin and metronidazole) and newer (piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem) antimicrobial agents revealed high and comparable activity against clinical strains of obligate anaerobes. the percentage of strains susceptible to tested antimicrobials was > or = 90. these antimicrobials may be still useful in the empiric treatment of infections caused  by medically important anaerobes.

TI  == [cellulitis and necrotizing fasciitis: microbiology and pathogenesis].
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes is a common cause of necrotizing cutaneous infections in otherwise healthy children and adults. several surface components are involved in the processes of adherence and invasiveness, such as protein m and capsulae. streptolysin o and other bacterial products, such as pyrogenic exotoxins, are involved in tissue injury and necrosis. toxins a and c act as superantigens and are expressed by strains associated with the toxic shock syndrome. staphylococcus aureus, alone or in association with streptococci, is also commonly isolated form all body sites, but bacteremia is inconstant. capsule, protein a, and the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin are the major pathogenicity factors. in infections of the face and the neck, the predominant anaerobes recovered in association with group a streptococci are peptostreptococcus magnus, oral prevotella, porphyromonas spp., and fusobacterium spp. bacteroides fragilis, clostridium, enterobacteria, and enterococci are recovered in infections located  next to the perineal area. penicillin is the drug of choice for the treatment of  streptococcal infections. however benzylpenicillin may be not sufficient for severe infections and large inoculum, therefore the administration of clindamycin or another inhibitor of protein synthesis is recommended. since the infection may be polymicrobial, the initial therapy should include treatment for staphylococci  and anaerobes. in some cases broad- spectrum antibiotics also, effective on enterobacteria, are needed. the efficacy of appropriate parenteral antibiotics, however, depends on the prompt and aggressive exploration and debridement of suspected deep-seated infection, and supportive care of shock and multiple organ  failure.

TI  == multicenter survey of the changing in vitro antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical isolates of bacteroides fragilis group, prevotella, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, and peptostreptococcus species.
AB  == in vitro surveys of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important anaerobes are an important source of information that can be used for clinical decisions in the choice of empiric antimicrobial therapy. this study surveyed the susceptibilities of 556 clinical anaerobic isolates from four large medical centers using a broth microdilution method. piperacillin-tazobactam was the only  antimicrobial agent to which all the isolates were susceptible. similarly, imipenem, meropenem, and metronidazole were highly active (resistance, <0.5%), whereas the lowest susceptibility rates were noted for penicillin g, ciprofloxacin, and clindamycin. for most antibiotics, blood isolates were less susceptible than isolates from intra-abdominal, obstetric-gynecologic, and other  sources. all isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group were susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and metronidazole, while resistance to imipenem and meropenem was low (<2%). for these same isolates, resistance rates (intermediate  and resistant mics) to ampicillin-sulbactam, cefoxitin, trovafloxacin, and clindamycin were 11, 8, 7, and 29%, respectively. among the individual species of the b. fragilis group, the highest resistance rates were noted among the following organism-drug combinations: for clindamycin, bacteroides distasonis and bacteroides ovatus; for cefoxitin, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis; for ampicillin-sulbactam, b. distasonis, b. ovatus, and b. uniformis; and for trovafloxacin, bacteroides vulgatus. for the carbapenens, imipenem resistance was noted among b. fragilis and meropenem resistance was seen among b. fragilis, b. vulgatus, and b. uniformis. with few exceptions all antimicrobial agents were highly active against isolates of prevotella, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, and peptostreptococcus. these data further establish and confirm that clinically important anaerobes can vary widely in their antimicrobial susceptibilities. fortunately most antimicrobial agents were active against the test isolates. however, concern is warranted for what appears to be a significant increases in resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam and clindamycin.

TI  == calibration of the disk diffusion test for trovafloxacin susceptibility testing of four anaerobic species.
AB  == objectives: to study trovafloxacin susceptibility among clinical isolates of four anaerobic bacterial species using minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) determinations, e test assays and disk diffusion test results and to calibrate the disk diffusion method for these species using single strain regression analysis (sra). methods: one-hundred and eighty-seven clinical isolates of four anaerobic bacterial species were included. trovafloxacin mic determinations were  performed using the agar dilution technique and mic estimations using the e test. the disk diffusion test was performed according to swedish reference group for antibiotics standardization. nccls limits for susceptibility categories were applied. sra was performed using 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100 microg trovafloxacin disk  contents and atcc control strains. the regression lines obtained permitted the calculation of zone equivalents to mic limits as well as an evaluation of various disk potencies. results: trovafloxacin susceptibility (s + i) was noted in 98.9,  100, 100, and 97% of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus magnus strains, respectively, as  judged by mic determinations. agar dilution and e test estimations gave the same  results, but e test values were consistently lower than mic values by the reference method. regression lines calculated for the four species using sra showed different equation constants indicating species-related differences. interpretive zone diameter breakpoints were calculated for the four species and used for the interpretation of susceptibility. conclusions: the disk diffusion test was successfully calibrated for trovafloxacin susceptibility testing of four anaerobic species using single strain regression analysis, sra. there was a good  agreement between the results of mic-tests and disk testing. interpretive errors  of type i are prone to occur among bacteroides isolates and might require species-related mic limits. sra calculations permitted the testing of the effect  of different disk potencies on inhibition zones produced at the interpretive mic  limits. criteria for the selection of a minimal disk content showed that 5 microg trovafloxacin is sufficient, but a 10 microg disk will safeguard against residual laboratory variation without producing too large inhibition zones for very susceptible strains.

TI  == a prospective, randomized, clinical study to compare the clinical safety, effectiveness, and cost of oral ofloxacin/clindamycin vs intravenous clindamycin/gentamicin for the treatment of postpartum endomyometritis.
AB  == objective: the primary objective of this prospective, randomized, clinical study  was to compare the safety, clinical and microbiologic efficacy, and cost of oral  ofloxacin in combination with clindamycin vs intravenous (iv) clindamycin/gentamicin in the early empiric treatment for hospitalized patients with mild to moderate postpartum endomyometritis. the secondary objective is to reduce total hospital and patient treatment cost. postpartum endomyometritis is a major cause of infectious morbidity in the obstetric patient. it is the most common complication associated with cesarean delivery. careful timing and amniotomy, limited vaginal examinations, and prophylactic antibiotics for cesarean section delivery may help to reduce the incidence and severity of endomyometritis. endomyometritis is caused by bacteria that compose the normal cervicovaginal flora. these are anaerobic gram-positive cocci (peptostreptococcus and peptococcus), aerobic streptococci (group b streptococci and enterococci), enterobacteriaceae, bacteroides (b. fragilis, b. bivius, and b. disiens), and clostridium species.ofloxacin is a synthetic broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for intravenous and oral administration. following oral administration, the bioavailability in tablet form is 98% with maximum serum concentrations in 1 to 2 hours. steady state concentrations are achieved after 4 doses. ofloxacin usually  is bactericidal in action. a synthetic broad-spectrum antibacterial agent for intravenous and oral administration. ofloxacin inhibits dna topoisomerase (atp-hydrolyzing), commonly referred to as dna-gyrase. dna-gyrase causes double-stranded dna breakage; it inhibits duplication, transcription, and repair  of bacterial dna.methods: this is a preliminary study that has enrolled 19 evaluable patients towards the overall enrollment of 60 patients for statistical  significance. patients clinically diagnosed as having postpartum endomyometritis  who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria were entered into the trial. patients were examined for the presence of fever (102.2 degrees f), pelvic pain, and foul  lochia. a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory analysis were obtained prior to the first dose of antibiotic treatment. a signed consent was obtained prior to the study enrollment and randomization. appropriate endometrial, blood, and urine culture specimens were obtained prior to the initiation of antibiotic therapy.patients in group 1 were treated with oral therapy using ofloxacin 400 mg q12h plus clindamycin 900 mg q8h until 24 hrs of afebrility. in group 2, patients were treated with clindamycin 900 mg iv q8h plus gentamicin iv 5mg/kg/d q 8h until afebrility. antibiotic therapy was continued for at least 48 hours unless significant clinical deterioration occurred necessitating the withdrawal of the patient from the study.results:conclusions: we found in our preliminary study that oral ofloxacin in combination with oral clindamycin was equally as efficacious, well tolerated, and safe as the combination of intravenous therapy with clindamycin and gentamicin for the treatment of postpartum endomyometritis.

AB  == published reports on the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin mesylate (sb 265805),  a new fluoronaphthyridone, against anaerobic pathogens are reviewed here. the studies used a variety of media, inocula and antimicrobial agents. using a proposed breakpoint of 0.5 mg/l, these studies showed that gemifloxacin had generally higher potency against gram-positive anaerobes (clostridium perfringens, all peptostreptococcus spp.) and fusobacteria (fusobacterium nucleatum, fusobacterium necrophorum) and moderate but variable potency against gram-negative anaerobes. bacteroides stercoris, bacteroides tectum and many bacteroides fragilis isolates were inhibited by concentrations of < or =0.5 mg/l, while the other species of the b. fragilis group required higher concentrations for inhibition. species variability was evident: porphyromonas asaccharolytica, porphyromonas canoris, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas macaccae, prevotella heparinolytica and prevotella intermedia were susceptible to 0.5 mg/l  of gemifloxacin while most other porphyromonas and prevotella spp. were not. these data suggest that gemifloxacin may have a clinical role in the treatment of certain dental, head and neck and pleuropulmonary infections in which gram-positive anaerobes, fusobacteria and some prevotella and porphyromonas spp.  may predominate.

TI  == microbiology of infected poison ivy dermatitis.
AB  == we report the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected poison ivy dermatitis. the study involved retrospective review of clinical and microbiology laboratory records of patients with secondarily infected poison ivy  lesions. bacterial growth was noted in 33 specimens. aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 18 (55%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only in seven (21%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic bacteria in eight (24%). forty-five isolates were recovered (1.4 per specimen): 27 aerobic or facultative  anaerobic bacteria, and 18 strict anaerobes. the predominant aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (13 isolates) and group a beta-haemolytic streptococci (six). the predominant anaerobes were peptostreptococcus spp. (seven isolates), pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas  spp. (four) and fusobacterium spp. (two). single bacterial isolates were recovered in 18 (55%) patients, eight of which were s. aureus. nineteen of the organisms isolated from 16 (48%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated  in those infections. enteric gram-negative rods and bacteroides fragilis group predominated in leg and buttock lesions. group a beta-haemolytic streptococci, pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas and fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered from lesions of the finger, face and neck. the polymicrobial aetiology of secondarily infected poison ivy lesions, and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical site of the lesions, are demonstrated.

TI  == linezolid.
AB  == linezolid is an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent that acts by inhibiting the initiation of bacterial protein synthesis. cross-resistance between linezolid and other inhibitors of protein synthesis has not been demonstrated. linezolid has a  wide spectrum of activity against gram-positive organisms including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. anerobes such as clostridium spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and prevotella spp. are also susceptible to linezolid. linezolid is bacteriostatic against most susceptible organisms but displays bactericidal activity against some strains of pneumococci, bacteroides fragilis and c. perfringens. in clinical trials involving hospitalised patients with skin/soft tissue infections (predominantly s. aureus), intravenous/oral linezolid (up to 1250 mg mg/day) produced clinical success in >83% of individuals. in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, success rates were >94%. preliminary clinical data also indicate that twice daily intravenous/oral linezolid 600 mg is as effective as intravenous vancomycin 1 g in the treatment of patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia and in those with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci. moreover, linezolid 600 mg twice daily produced >85% clinical/microbiological cure in vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections. linezolid is generally well tolerated and gastrointestinal disturbances are the most commonly occurring adverse events. no clinical evidence of adverse reactions as a result of monoamine oxidase inhibition has been reported.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in auckland: 1991-1996.
AB  == aim: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of local anaerobic bacteria. method: the antimicrobial susceptibility of 357 obligate anaerobes collected between 1991 and 1997 was determined by a standard agar dilution method. isolates tested included bacteroides spp. 131, fusobacterium spp. 12, prevotella spp. 13,  veillonella spp. 5, clostridium perfringens 27, other clostridium spp. 29, propionibacterium spp. 57, actinomyces spp. 7, other non-sporing gram-positive bacilli 28 and peptostreptococcus spp. 48. ten antimicrobials were tested: penicillin, amoxycillin/ clavulanic acid, pipercillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, cefoxitin, cefotetan, imipenem, meropenem, clindamycin and metronidazole. results: imipenem, pipercillin/tazobactam, meropenem and amoxycillin/clavulanic acid were active against virtually all anaerobes tested. metronidazole was active against all anaerobic gram-negative bacteria and clostridium spp., but had variable activity against other anaerobes. cefoxitin was the most active cephalosporin against bacteroides spp., with 76%, 64% and 15% of bacteroides spp. being susceptible to cefoxitin, cefotetan and ceftriaxone, respectively. penicillin had poor activity against anaerobic gram negative bacilli. actinomyces and propionibacterium spp. were susceptible to all antimicrobials tested except metronidazole. variable results were obtained with other antimicrobial-organism combinations. comparison of results with data from a previously published survey  showed little change in susceptibility except for increased resistance of bacteroides fragilis to ceftriaxone and clostridium species (not c perfringens) to clindamycin. conclusion: our results update the local susceptibility profile of anaerobic bacteria and may be considered when choosing an antimicrobial agent  for prophylaxis or treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of biapenem in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.
AB  == biapenem is a new injectable carbapenem antibiotic which has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, and is stable to hydrolysis by dehydropeptidase i. biapenem inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus magnus, bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. the mic(90) of biapenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa was lower than that of panipenem, equivalent to that of imipenem, and greater than that of meropenem. the in vivo efficacy of biapenem was evaluated using the experimental infection model of uterine endometritis. the accumulation of neutrophils in the uterus in the biapenem- treated group was less marked than in the nontreated group, as well as bacteriological response. these results suggest that the new antimicrobial agent  biapenem might be useful for the treatment of polymicrobial infections in the fields of obstetrics and gynecology.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == [trovafloxacin in gynecology].
AB  == presence of microorganisms in the female lower genital tract (lgt) in concentrations that modify the established normal equilibrium produce different symptoms that make necessary to consult the gynecologist. it is currently accepted that infections of the lgt are due to microorganisms that are normally integrating the internal flora, except for the erroneously called "sexually transmitted diseases" that are caused by external microorganisms. this means that all those microorganisms usually present without causing any disease manifestations may, under certain circumstances and determined concentrations, originate or be associated to infections. lactobacillus sp. and corynebacterium sp. are normally the most frequent microorganisms in the vagina together with streptococcus (aerobe), streptococcus agalactiae and others like enterococcus, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides sp., bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, pseudomonas, klebsiella, fusobacterium, escherichia coli. different antibiotic schemes are proposed for different infections (bacterial vaginosis, gonococcia, chlamydial infections, pelvic inflammatory disease). they  are discussed in different sections. trovafloxacin has shown to be effective in the treatment of infections due to chlamydia with excellent clinical results and  a good tolerance. it was effective as single dose therapy in the treatment of acute gonococcia with therapeutic success in 99% of the treated patients. new fluoroquinolones are also effective in the treatment of infections due to aerobial pathogens. the use of trovafloxacin in the treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease would present great advantages: on one hand, it would cover  the wide spectrum of microorganisms responsible for the infection and, on the other, would permit an early switch to oral therapy once the acute phase is over.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of infection after trauma.
AB  == clinical and laboratory data from 1973 to 1988 were retrospectively reviewed to study the microbiology of infection following trauma. a total of 368 specimens obtained from 340 trauma patients showed bacterial growth. the traumas included lacerations (163), blunt trauma (76), penetrating trauma (65), bites (20), and open fractures (10). anaerobic bacteria only were isolated in 119 (32%) specimens, aerobic bacteria only in 58 (16%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 191 (52%). a total of 444 anaerobic (1.2 isolates per specimen) and 267 aerobic or facultative (0.7 per specimen) were recovered. the predominant anaerobic bacteria included bacteroides fragilis group (119 isolates), peptostreptococcus spp (113), clostridium spp (78), prevotella spp (58), and fusobacterium spp (23). the predominant aerobic bacteria included escherichia coli (83), staphylococcus aureus (61), streptococcus pyogenes (27), streptococcus group d (16), and klebsiella pneumoniae (16). the types of infections included abscesses (109), bacteremia (32), bites (13), empyema (10), osteomyelitis (21), peritonitis (52), thrombophlebitis (12), and wounds (116, including posttraumatic wounds, cellulitis, stump wound, decubitus ulcers, myositis, and fasciitis). s. aureus was isolated at all sites. however, organisms of the oropharyngeal flora predominated in infections that originated from that location (ie, head and neck  wounds, and abscesses or bites), and those of the gastrointestinal flora predominated in infections that originated from that site (ie, peritonitis, abdominal abscesses, decubitus ulcers). this study showed the polymicrobial nature of many infections that follow trauma.

TI  == sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  == the microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). there were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and  12 anaerobic. the predominant aerobic isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). the predominant anaerobes were prevotella sp.  (5), peptostreptococcus sp. (4), fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and bacteroides fragilis (1). beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven  instances. this study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.

TI  == [in vitro activity of 10 antibiotics including pristinamycin and its two components (rp 12536 and 27404) against strict anaerobes].
AB  == the activities of the pristinamycin and its two components (rp 12536 and rp 27404) were investigated using the reference agar dilution method m11a3, on 175 anaerobic strains in comparison with that of erythromycin, clindamycin, metronidazole, amoxycillin either alone or combined with clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefoxitin, cefotetan and cefotaxime. beta-lactamase production was  detected for all the 55 b. fragilis group strains and 8/12 prevotella and 2/18 fusobacterium strains, respectively. on the whole anaerobes, resistance rates (%) were respectively: rp 27404 (69), rp 12536 (64), pristinamycin (5) erythromycin (31), clindamycin (17), metronidazole (7) amoxycillin (24), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (2), piperacillin (7), cefoxitin (14), cefotetan (21) and cefotaxime (27). rp 27404 and 12536 had low activities on anaerobes but acted synergistically as pristinamycin. the greatest anti-anaerobic potencies were obtained with amoxycillin-clavulanic acid combination, pristinamycin, metronidazole and piperacillin. as resistance was not found for pristinamycin among prevotella, fusobacterium, gram+ rods and peptostreptococcus, this streptogramin may be an appropriate agent for the treatment of periodontitis, pulmonary, ent, gynecologic and soft tissue infections where these anaerobes are  frequently involved.

TI  == in vitro activities of e1101, a novel oral cephalosporin, against bacteria causing infections in obstetric and gynecological patients.
AB  == e1101 is a new oral cephalosporin with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. it inhibited more than 90% of clinical isolates of streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus at the concentration of 3.13 mg/l. e1101 was the most active agent against s. agalactiae and e. coli.  since none of the compounds was sufficiently active against the bacteroides fragilis and prevotella bivia isolates, they are not appropriate in the treatment of patients with infections caused by these organisms. the results of this study  suggest that, subject to confirmation by clinical trials, e1101, in combination with an agent with reliable activity against anaerobic bacteria, is suitable as empirical therapy of patients with obstetric and gynecological infections.

AB  == the anaeropack (mitsubishi gas chemical america, inc., new york, n.y.) system was compared with the gaspak (becton dickinson microbiology systems, cockeysville, md.) system and a conventional anaerobe chamber to evaluate the ability of the anaeropack system to support the growth of clinically significant anaerobes. the  anaeropack system requires no catalyst or water, produces no hydrogen, and is oxygen absorbing and carbon dioxide generating. it is simple to use and reduces preparation time to a minimum. one hundred forty clinical isolates obtained from  various anatomic sites and 10 american type culture collection type strains were  evaluated. isolates were plated on various media, and bacterial growth was examined after 24, 48, 72, and 168 h of incubation. criteria for evaluation and comparison of systems included rate and quality of growth, colonial morphology, hemolytic reactions, and pigment production. results indicate that the anaeropack system is highly effective in creating an anaerobic atmosphere. the anaeropack system never failed to reduce the methylene blue indicator, while the gaspak system failed 15% of the time. the rate or quality of growth achieved by the anaeropack system compared with that of established anaerobic culturing techniques was similar and significantly better for several genera including the  bacteroides fragilis group, fusobacterium, clostridium, and peptostreptococcus. the anaeropack system appears to be an excellent alternative to established methods for generating an environment for anaerobic incubation.

TI  == tissue penetration of meropenem in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the tissue-penetrating ability of a new beta-lactam antibiotic, meropenem, in 64 patients undergoing elective gynecologic surgery. patients received a single 500-mg dose intravenously before surgery. plasma and tissue concentrations of meropenem were highest at approximately 1 hour, and good tissue penetration was seen in the variety of specimens evaluated. the median plasma concentration at approximately 1 hour was 13.3 micrograms/ml. the median fluid and tissue concentrations at approximately 1 hour were as follows: cervix, 8.5 micrograms/g; endometrium, 2.3 micrograms/g; fallopian tube, 1.9 micrograms/g; myometrium, 3.6 micrograms/g; ovary, 2.3 micrograms/g; and uterus, 2.3 micrograms/g. these tissue concentrations exceed the mics of meropenem for 90% of typical pathogens associated with gynecologic infections. meropenem readily penetrates gynecologic tissue. a single 500-mg dose provides adequate tissue concentrations for treatment of gynecologic infections caused by  susceptible pathogens.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents. special references to bacteria isolated between july 1995 and june 1996].
AB  == isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from july  1994 to june 1995 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. one hundred and sixty-four strains were isolated from primary infections, and 202 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while from post operative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus faecalis was the highest, followed by that of staphylococcus aureus  from postoperative infections. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. among anaerobic gram-negative, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by enterobacter spp. and klebsiella spp. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both types of infections. we noticed that mics of cefazolin against three out of 23 strains of e. coli were higher than 100 micrograms/ml. among anaerobic bacteria, there were many resistant strains against penicillins and cephems with mics higher than 100 micrograms/ml, and the same trend was observed among other bacteroides spp. and prevotella spp.

TI  == emerging resistance of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents in south korea.
AB  == in previous studies, bacteroides fragilis group organisms isolated from korean patients were more frequently resistant to various antimicrobial agents, including clindamycin, than were isolates in other countries. a recent report of  increased resistance of peptostreptococcus species prompted us to include such isolates in a study of antimicrobial susceptibility. anaerobes isolated in 1994 at a tertiary care hospital in seoul were tested by agar dilution method. none of the b. fragilis group organisms were resistant to imipenem, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, or metronidazole. however, 6.7% were resistant to ampicillin/sulbactam, 20.2% to cefotetan, 30.3% to piperacillin, 48.3% to cefotaxime, and 42.7% to clindamycin. almost all of the clostridium perfringens isolates were susceptible to all of the agents tested, except tetracycline. peptostreptococcus isolates were susceptible to piperacillin, cefotaxime, and imipenem, while 7.4% were resistant to penicillin g, cefotetan, and metronidazole, and 25.9% were resistant to clindamycin. the isolates resistant to penicillin g, cefotetan, and metronidazole were identified as peptostreptococcus  anaerobius. in conclusion, besides the well-known high rate of resistance of b. fragilis group organisms to clindamycin, the emergence of resistance of peptostreptococcus species isolates to beta-lactam drugs has become obvious in korea.

TI  == comparison of activities of trovafloxacin (cp-99,219) and five other agents against 585 anaerobes with use of three media.
AB  == agar dilution testing was used to compare the in vitro activities of trovafloxacin and ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, metronidazole, and clindamycin against 585 anaerobes. the activity of trovafloxacin was superior to  those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, with 94%, 91%, 96%, 100%, 90%, and 100% inhibition of bacteroides fragilis, non-fragilis bacteroides species, peptostreptococcus magnus/peptostreptococcus micros, clostridium perfringens, prevotella bivia/prevotella disiens, and fusobacterium species, respectively, at  a breakpoint of 2 micrograms/ml. trovafloxacin was more active than clindamycin against most anaerobes and slightly less active than imipenem and metronidazole.  different testing media, which were compared side by side, did affect the in vitro activities of trovafloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin but did not affect those of the other antibiotics. testing with supplemented brain-heart infusion agar demonstrated lower minimum inhibitory concentrations than did testing with wilkins-chalgren agar and supplemented brucella agar. the activity of trovafloxacin was twofold lower when the ph of the testing media was adjusted  to 6.0 than when the ph of the testing media was adjusted to 7.0 or 7.5.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of anaerobes to quinolones in the united states.
AB  == the in vitro activity of early fluoroquinolone antibodies--including ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, fleroxacin, pefloxacin, enoxacin, and lomefloxacin--against most anaerobes has been limited, a characteristic making them poor choices as antianaerobic agents. newer fluoroquinolones, including levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, and grepafloxacin, have moderate activity against anaerobes, including the bacteroides fragilis group as well as clostridium, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, and fusobacterium species. fluoroquinolones that  demonstrate the greatest activity against the b. fragilis group and other anaerobes include du-6859a, clinafloxacin, and the related naphthyridone, trovafloxacin. there has been wide variation in the susceptibility results among  different studies testing the same antibiotic; such variation may be due in part  to the use of different methodologies, inoculum sizes, and testing media. in a direct comparison of susceptibility findings for ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and levofloxacin in three different media, we have determined that twofold dilution differences in minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values (mic90, mode mic, and geometric mean mic) may occur in association with the choice of testing media. thus, testing media should be considered when comparing results of different studies on the susceptibility of anaerobes to fluoroquinolones.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of cefodizime against clinical isolates].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefodizime (cdzm), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cdzm and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates collected from nation-wide medical institutions and in  our laboratory from september to december of 1992 and from september to december  of 1995. the results are summarized as follows: 1. bacterial species with no or few strains resistant to cdzm included streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis and neisseria gonorrhoeae. the  range of mic values of cdzm against klebsiella pneumoniae was spread. other strains, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., peptostreptococcus spp.  and bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to cephems including cdzm. 2. the mic90's of cdzm were 0.05 approximately 3.13 micrograms/ml against streptococcus  spp., h. influenzae, m. (b.) catarrhalis, e. coli, klebsiella spp., p. mirabilis, n. gonorrhoeae and peptostreptococcus spp. obtained in 1995 that were frequently  found in daily treatment of infections. it appears that the effectiveness of cdzm was still relatively high against community-acquired infections. 3. among h. influenzae isolates included imipenem (ipm)-resistant and norfloxacin (nflx)-resistant strains. the mic-range of cdzm against strains collected in 1995 including ipm-resistant and nflx-resistant strains was < or = 0.025 approximately 0.1 microgram/ml, and mic90 against these strains was 0.05 microgram/ml. cdzm showed strong antimicrobial activities against h. influenzae strains resistant to carbapenems and new-quinolones.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == the in vitro activity of trospectomycin against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the authors evaluated the activity of trospectomycin, a new aminocyclitol which is characterized by good antibacterial and broad spectrum activity, in comparison with clindamycin and ampicillin on a sample of recent isolates: bacteroides fragilis (15 strains), bacteroides urealyticus (5 strains), bacteroides vulgatus  (5 strains), bacteroides spp. (15 strains), prevotella melaninogenica (6 strains), porphyromonas asaccharolytica (7 strains), mobiluncus spp. (3 strains), peptococcus niger (3 strains), peptococcus variabilis (9 strains), peptococcus spp (30 strains), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (5 strains), peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (3 strains), peptostreptococcus spp. (25 strains) and propionibacterium spp. (7 strains). the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined for all strains by microtiter serial dilutions in wilkins-chalgren broth in an anaerobic chamber in  an atmosphere of 10% h2, 10% co2, 80% n2. all the drugs tested exert their activity against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic isolates. in particular, trospectomycin is quite active against gram-positive cocci (mic 90 =  4 - 8 mg/l), gram-negative rods (mic 90 = 8 - 16 mg/l), gram-positive rods (mic 90 = 4 mg/l) and mobiluncus spp. (mic 90 = 0.5 mg/l).

TI  == microbiology of gastrostomy site wound infections in children.
AB  == specimens of pus were obtained from gastrostomy site wound infections in 22 children. polymicrobial flora was found in 21 of the 22 wounds. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were isolated in eight (36%) instances and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora were isolated from the other 14 (64%) wounds. a total of  102 bacterial isolates (57 aerobic and 45 anaerobic) and seven cultures of candida were obtained. the most frequent isolates were escherichia coli (16 isolates). peptostreptococcus spp. (14), enterococcus spp. (14), bacteroides spp. (12) and staphylococcus aureus (6). twenty-eight strains producing beta-lactamase were isolated from 16 (73%) patients. the presence of polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic infection, and the isolation of e. coli and bacteroides spp. were more frequent in wounds with gastric leakage than in wounds without gastric  leakage (p < 0.05). bacteria similar to those isolated from the wound were also isolated from blood cultures from three patients-two isolates of e. coli and one  each of b. fragilis and s. aureus. all patients received local therapy and 11 were treated with systemic antimicrobial agents. the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of gastrostomy site wound infections, especially in association with gastric leakage, and the presence of beta-lactamase producers in most of these infections may have important implications for their management.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay y 3118, and nine other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of bay y 3118, a new chlorofluoroquinolone, was determined against 257 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activities of ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, and ornidazole. overall, bay y 3118  was the most active agent tested against the bacteroides fragilis group. its activity (mic90, 0.5 mg/l) was 16-fold lower than that of sparfloxacin (mic90, 8  mg/l), and more than 100-fold lower than that of ofloxacin (mic90, 64 mg/l) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 128 mg/l) against the group. no strains belonging to this group were resistant to metronidazole (mics range, 0.12-2 mg/l) and ornidazole (mics range, 0.12-4 mg/l). bay y 3118 was more active than those quinolones against prevotella and porphyromonas spp., fusobacterium spp., clostridium perfringens and c. difficile (mic90, 0.12, 0.06, 0.12 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively). the activity of bay y 3118 against peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 1 mg/l) was slightly lower than that of the other gram-positive bacteria tested.  in general, bay y 3118 was more active than cefoxitin, and it was superior to antianaerobic chemical agents like metronidazole, ornidazole and clindamycin. pharmacokinetic and clinical trials are required to define the role of bay y 3118 in the treatment of anaerobic infections.

TI  == the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis. a prospective study using ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle aspiration.
AB  == obstructive pneumonitis, the opacity that develops distal to an obstructing endobronchial lesion or external compression, is actually a combination of atelectasis, bronchiectasis with mucus plugging, and true parenchymal inflammation. in the majority of cases, it is usually not possible to determine whether infection is present or not from the radiographic findings alone. the aim of this study was to evaluate the bacteriology of obstructive pneumonitis and the influence of this result on the treatment of patients. from march 1992 to february 1993, 26 consecutive patients (20 men and six women) with obstructive pneumonitis were investigated. the obstructive pneumonitis had been caused by malignant tumors in 24 and benign lesions in two. chest ultrasound (us) and us-guided percutaneous transthoracic aspirations were undergone to obtain specimens for microbiologic examination. microorganisms were isolated from seven  of nine febrile patients and two of 17 nonfebrile patients. a total of 16 bacterial strains are detected in obstructive pneumonitis (pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, viridant streptococci, bacteroides fragilis, two peptostreptococcus species, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides thetaiotamomicrons, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides species, veillonella species, aerobic gram-positive bacilli, and escherichia coli). in five cases the  isolates were monobacteriae, and in the remaining four cases, cultures yielded more than one bacteria. the results of aspirate cultures led to changes in the initial antibiotic trial in seven of nine patients, and fever subsided thereafter. pneumothorax occurred in one cases as the sole complication. the pathogen causing obstructive pneumonitis is very heterogeneous, and polymicrobial infection is common.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == during 1992, the in vitro antibiotic susceptibility of 462 anaerobic bacteria was performed in 7 hospitals, by the reference agar dilution method. among the 222 bacteroides fragilis group strains, only one bacteroides fragilis strain was resistant to imipenem and all betalactams, even combined with betalactamase-inhibitors while metronidazole resistance could not be detected. one major outer membrane protein (probably a porin) was lacking in some of the six amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistant bacteroides fragilis group strains. evolution in antibiotic resistance rates could be assessed only for clindamycin and piperacillin whose resistance rates increased to 14 and 15.8 p. cent, respectively. on the whole anaerobic strains resistance rates were: imipenem 0.2, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid 0.5, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid or metronidazole 1.5, piperacillin 9.1, cefotaxime-sulbactam 9.7, cefoxitin 12.8, clindamycin 13.7, cefotaxime 27.2, amoxicillin 45 and ciprofloxacin 70, respectively.

TI  == anaerobic susceptibility testing. slight differences in inoculum size can make a  difference in minimum inhibitory concentrations.
AB  == in the present study, we compared the actual inoculum density from inoculated broth microdilution wells to the targeted inoculum size (10(5) cfu/well) when the inoculum was prepared using a mcfarland nephelometer to achieve the standard density. three target inoculum sizes (10(5), 5 x 10(5), and 10(6) cfu/well) were  used to compare the effect of slight inoculum size increases of both atcc and clinical strains of anaerobes on mics of various antimicrobials. actual colony counts of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, eubacterium lentum, and veillonella parvula ranged from 0.7 x 10(5) to 1.4 x 10(5) cfu/well. as the inoculum size rose above the desired 10(5) cfu/well level, the mics of certain antimicrobials became elevated. ceftizoxime, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone mics rose 4- to 16-fold with as little as 0.5 log10 increase in inoculum size. other increases were also noted with e. lentum and clostridium perfringens, but were primarily between the low and high inoculum sizes. results with cefoxitin, cefotetan, mezlocillin, and imipenem did not show an appreciable increased inoculum effect. this study demonstrates that the variation in organism size among anaerobes (both between species and within species) does make a difference  in actual inoculum size and certain anaerobes may require special adjustment to ensure proper mic results from susceptibility testing.

TI  == piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. the piperacillin/tazobactam study group.
AB  == objective: to compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. methods: this was  a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper  genital tract. patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the united states and two hospitals in canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. one group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. cultures for chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. results: two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. the most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). the most common microorganisms recovered included: peptostreptococcus sp (99), prevotella sp (87), black pigmented bacteroides (29), b fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group b streptococcus (26),  escherichia coli (31), neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and c trachomatis (19). a favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin  patients. among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; p = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. none of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. conclusion: the combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.

TI  == peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  == 680 peptostreptococcus sp. (ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. they included 103 ps asaccharolyticus, 74 ps magnus,  56 ps prevotii, 51 ps micros, 46 ps anaerobius, 11 ps morbilorum, and 10 ps saccharolyticus. most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), ps were recovered in pure culture. most ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. these were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). the organisms most commonly isolated with ps were bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 b. fragilis group), prevotella sp. (159), fusobacterium sp. (122), escherichia coli (114), and staphylococcus aureus (97). antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. these data illustrate the importance of ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.

TI  == effect of different combinations of antibiotics on experimental septic peritonitis in rabbits.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of different combinations of antimicrobial agents in the treatment of experimental septic peritonitis. two hundred rabbits, divided into ten groups of 20 rabbits each, were used. septic peritonitis was provoked in two stages: treatment of animals by mechanical lavage or antibiotics was performed during the first stage; blood cultures, isolation and identification of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the peritoneal cavity were performed during the second stage. the parameters assessed were survival and, in the second phase, the formation of peritoneal abscesses. the most significant finding was noted in the first phase, where diffuse peritonitis took  place, with a very high mortality rate due to bacteremia and sepsis. in both blood and pus from the peritoneal cavity cultures in all groups, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis (among the aerobes) and bacteroides fragilis, clostridium sp. and peptostreptococcus sp. (among anaerobes) were the predominant pathogens identified. high mortality rates appeared to be due to the aerobic microbes, particularly escherichia coli, whereas abscess formation was related to the anaerobes, particularly bacteroides  fragilis. all antibiotics tested were effective, whether alone or in combination. metronidazole, however, was the most effective in the reduction of intraabdominal abscesses. the lowest mortality rate was observed in animals injected with piperacillin and a combination of cefoxitin and an aminoglycoside with metronidazole. finally, good peritoneal lavage seemed to be as effective as any combination of antibiotic treatment.

TI  == antibacterial activity of oral antibiotics against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the spectrum and the antibacterial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to oral antibiotics isolated from clinical specimens was assessed in two different centres, the first receiving specimens from university departments and the second from general practitioners and small hospitals. susceptibility was studied with a microtiter ready-to-use panel system, using the manufacturer's modified wilkins-chalgren's broth as the test medium for the following antibiotics: ampicillin, ampicillin+sulbactam, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, cephalexin, cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefetamet, clindamycin, doxycycline and erythromycin. anaerobic bacteria frequently encountered in clinical specimens from the university departments were mainly resistant bacteroides spp., especially bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium spp. and peptostreptococcus spp., whereas in the outpatient center, peptostreptococcus spp, actinomyces spp. and veillonella parvula (usually considered as colonizing flora) represented 90% of the cultured bacteria. the study shows that the members of most bacteroides spp.  encountered in a hospital environment are resistant to most of these agents (except clindamycin, amoxicillin+clavulanic acid, and ampicillin+sulbactam), whereas the gram-positive pathogens are widely covered by most of the orally available agents studied including cefetamet.

TI  == intrapleural streptokinase in experimental empyema.
AB  == intrapleural streptokinase has been used in multiloculated empyemas to enhance pleural space drainage, presumably by causing fibrinolysis of the interlocular septae. we evaluated the efficacy and safety of daily administration of 10,000 u  intrapleural streptokinase or equal volumes of saline to enhance resolution of experimental empyema in the rabbit pleural space. seventy-two hours after intrapleural turpentine, 10(8) colony-forming units each of escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides fragilis were injected into the sterile pleural effusion of all animals. immediately after bacterial inoculation, and daily for 3 days, animals received 10,000 u streptokinase or saline intrapleurally. animals that achieved a pleural fluid ph < 7.30 and either glucose < 50 mg/dl or ldh > 500 iu/l were included for data analysis. at day 4 after bacterial inoculation, the streptokinase-treated empyemic rabbits had more  pleural fluid (18.8 +/- 5.1 ml) (mean +/- sem) than did saline-treated control animals (4.8 +/- 1.7 ml) (p = 0.015), fewer interpleural adhesions (8.2 +/- 2.7)  than did saline-treated control animals (25.1 +/- 3.6) (p = 0.002), and comparable amounts of visceral and parietal pleural plaque than did saline-treated control animals (p = ns). no evidence of systemic fibrinolysis was observed at 1 h after intrapleural streptokinase administration. we conclude that intrapleural streptokinase decreases interpleural adhesion numbers but fails to reduce the amount of pleural plaque observed in experimental empyema in rabbits.  the increases in pleural fluid volume observed after streptokinase administration may be due to mechanisms other than fibrinolytic activity.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of rokitamycin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == we obtained bacterial strains which were clinically isolated and identified from  outpatients with various infections in medical institutions throughout japan. possible antibacterial activities of rokitamycin (rkm) were examined against these isolates. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined through  a comparative study with reference drugs. the results of the study are summarized as follows. 1. resistance patterns of 400 isolates which were highly resistant to macrolides (mls) with mic values > 100 micrograms/ml were classified into 55 patterns. staphylococcus spp. showed cross resistance to 14-membered ring mls with 100% cross resistance observed between erythromycin (em) and clarithromycin  (cam), and 85.2% between em and oleandomycin (ol). fewer isolates showed strong resistance to 16-membered ring mls than to 14-membered ring mls. cross resistances observed among the staphylococcus isolates were 100% between acetylmidecamycin (mdm-ac) and kitasamycin (leucomycin (lm)), 93.9% between mdm-ac and josamycin (jm), and 53.3% between mdm-ac and rkm. streptococcus spp. and peptococcus spp. showed very similar resistance patterns to both 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but resistance patterns to rkm were quite different. most of anaerobic streptococci and bacteroides fragilis group had similar resistance patterns to 14- and 16-membered ring mls, but in some cases a pattern similar to  that of staphylococcus spp. was observed. 2. when ml-resistant bacteria isolated  during 1975 to 1980 were compared to those isolated in 1986 and 1989, it was observed that resistance of staphylococcus aureus remained almost unchanged, that of streptococcus pyogenes was lower in the later years than during 1975 to 1980,  but that of streptococcus pneumoniae increased. 3. most of ml-resistances of the  resistant isolates were inducible, but extents of induction varied depending on drugs tested. strong inductions were observed when 14-membered ring mls were used, but inductions were minimal with 16-membered ring mls. rkm appeared to induce resistance to the least extent. from these results, it appears that the rkm is quite useful clinically even in the 1990s.

AB  == antibiotic activities (mics) of ceftriaxone (ctrx) against 1,210 strains of bacteria including 28 spp. isolated in 1987 and 1990 were compared with those of  other cephems. 1. when compared to data on clinically isolated strains reported in the early 1980s, strains of the following species isolated in 1990 showed extremely elevated mic90s of ctrx: staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., enterobacter spp., serratia spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii and providencia spp. no changes were observed in mic90s between the 2 periods for microorganisms such as streptococcus pyogenes, haemophilus influenzae, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and peptostreptococcus spp. 2. the mic90 of ctrx to s. pneumoniae was high because a  large number of benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) was present among this species. the mic80 to bacteroides fragilis group was also high because highly resistant b. fragilis and b. thetaiotaomicron were isolated in large proportions among the bacteria of this group. other oxime-type cephems also had high mics against the above mentioned bacteria. therefore, a further evaluation has to be made with regard to activities of oxime-type cephems such as ctrx against pisp and b. fragilis group. 3. sample strains included, in high ratios, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), cephamycin-resistant  as well as oxime-type cephem-resistant intestinal bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and new-quinolone-resistant bacteria. some of there resistant bacteria  are also ctrx-resistant, and ctrx had insufficient activities against them. 4. with regard to the assessment of changes of frequencies of specific drug-resistant bacteria, including those with ctrx-resistance from year to year,  the authors would like to point out the following comment of theirs made in 1989  and 1991, which appears to be increasing its significance, "subjects of future studies should include dose on the mechanisms for the acquisition of bacterial resistance to entire beta-lactam antibiotics and the social circumstances in which resistant bacteria appear". 5. it appears that those strains resistant to cephems including ctrx are increasingly found among clinically isolated strains in recent years. ctrx, however, was found still effective against most clinical pathogens. furthermore, considering that ctrx is one of the few drugs which sustain high blood concentrations of active forms we concluded that ctrx is a useful cephem-group antibiotic.

AB  == du-6859, (-)-7-[(7s)-amino-5-azaspiro(2,4)heptan-5-yl]-8-chloro-6- fluoro-1-[(1r,2r)-cis-2-fluoro-1-cyclopropyl]-1,4-dihydro-4-oxoquinol one-3- carboxylic acid, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity which is significantly better than those of currently available quinolones. the mics for 90% of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis clinical isolates (mic90s) were 0.1, 3.13, 0.1, and 0.39 microgram/ml, respectively. mic50s of du-6859 against quinolone-resistant, methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8-, 32-, 64-, and 128-fold lower than those  of tosufloxacin and sparfloxacin, ofloxacin and fleroxacin, ciprofloxacin, and lomefloxacin, respectively. du-6859 inhibited the growth of all strains of streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus pyogenes at 0.1 and 0.2 microgram/ml,  respectively, and was more active against enterococci than the other quinolones tested. although the activity of du-6859 against pseudomonas aeruginosa was roughly comparable to that of ciprofloxacin at the mic50 level, it was fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin at the mic90 level. du-6859 was also more active against other glucose-nonfermenting bacteria, haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, than the other drugs tested. strains of bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus spp. were susceptible to du-6859; mic90s were 0.39 and 0.2 microgram/ml, respectively. du-6859 generally showed activities twofold or greater than those of ciprofloxacin and the other drugs against almost all members of the family enterobacteriaceae. the action of du-6859 against the clinical isolates was bactericidal at concentrations near the mics. du-6859 activity was not affected by different media, ph, inoculum size, or human serum but was decreased in human urine.

TI  == e-test: a new technique for antimicrobial susceptibility testing for periodontal  microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to validate the epsilometer test (e-test) method for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of selected periodontopathic microorganisms  using the agar dilution method as a standard. the e-test has been developed to provide a direct quantification of antimicrobial susceptibility of microorganisms. the device consists of a predefined, continuous, and exponential  gradient of antibiotic concentrations immobilized along a rectangular plastic test strip. after 48 hours incubation a drop-shaped inhibition zone intersects the graded test strip at the inhibitory concentration (ic) of the antibiotic. twenty-two subgingival plaque samples from periodontitis sites were plated on trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% rabbit blood or 5% sheep blood and trypticase soy agar supplemented with vancomycin and bacitracin. a total of 60 strains of key periodontal pathogens (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and capnocytophaga) isolated from 22 sites of 12 patients were studied. the antibiotics tested were clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and ampicillin at concentrations above and below the achieved blood or gingival crevicular fluid levels. as a standard reference the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the  agar dilution method. mics were compared with ics determined using the e-test method. the results showed an agreement ranging from 67% to 100%; sensitivity ranging from 75% to 100%; predictability ranging from 56% to 100% and specificity ranging from 33% to 96%. the e-test ics for ampicillin, cefoxitin, and metronidazole against the gram-negative capnophilic and microaerophilic rods and  the black-pigmented anaerobic rods ics for ampicillin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and tetracycline showed a high percentage of agreement with the agar dilution mics.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [asporogenic anaerobic thoracic empyema--an experimental model for anaerobic thoracic empyema in rabbits].
AB  == sterile pleural effusion was induced by intrapleural administration of turpentine, and empyema was induced by direct intrapleural inoculation of bacteria in rabbits. experimental models of anaerobic thoracic empyema were successfully made in this study, using escherichia coli, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, bacteroides fragilis, using the following methods; (1) a single bacterium inoculation of, a) e. coli, b) p. asaccharolyticus, c) b. fragilis, (2) simultaneous inoculations with an aerobe and an anaerobe, a) e. coli + p. asaccharolyticus, b) e. coli + b. fragilis. (3) an anaerobic inoculation 5 days after an aerobic inoculation, a) p. asaccharolyticus inoculation 5 days after e.  coli inoculation, b) b. fragilis inoculation 5 days after e. coli inoculation. the developments of several parameters (sialic acid levels, glucose levels, oxidation-reduction potential levels, bacterial counts and wbc counts in the pleural fluid and so on) were measured in each group. there was little difference of the rate of incidence of empyema between each group. empyema was highly induced even by a single anaerobe inoculation. the following tendencies were observed in development of parameters: (1) sialic acid levels and oxidation-reduction potential levels were decreased only in the conditions being  associated by b. fragilis infections. (2) in mixed infections of e. coli and anaerobes, bacterial counts of e. coli increased in number in the late phases of  the infections probably by the influences of anaerobes. the experiments of groups (2) and (3) were designed for demonstrations of biphasic infections between aerobes and anaerobes, but it turned out that quite unexpected results were seen  in these models.

TI  == multicentre study on antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria to cefoperazone-sulbactam and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the antibiotic susceptibilities of 241 anaerobic bacteria recovered from six geographic sites in north america were tested by agar dilution to cefoperazone-sulbactam and other drugs. of the 189 bacteroides fragilis group isolates, only one was resistant to cefoperazone-sulbactam (0.5%) or ampicillin-sulbactam (0.5%), and none was resistant to ticarcillin-clavulanate or chloramphenicol. no resistance to cefoperazone-sulbactam was observed among the other bacteroides spp., clostridium spp., or peptostreptococcus spp. resistance to cefoperazone-sulbactam is not commonly observed against anaerobic bacteria recovered from different geographical sites across north america.

TI  == diagnosis and management of anaerobic infections of the head and neck.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria are important pathogens in head and neck infections such as chronic otitis media, chronic sinusitis, chronic mastoiditis, head and neck abscesses, cervical adenitis, parotitis, and postoperative infection. bacteroides sp (bacteroides melaninogenicus group, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides fragilis group), peptostreptococcus sp, and fusobacterium sp predominate. the observed recent increase in the number of beta-lactamase-producing strains of bacteroides sp isolated in head and neck infections has been associated with increased failure rates of the penicillins in the management of these infections. the pathogenicity of these organisms is expressed through their ability not only  to survive penicillin therapy but also to shield penicillin-susceptible pathogens from the drug. because of these direct and indirect virulent characteristics of anaerobic bacteria, appropriate antimicrobial therapy must be directed against all pathogens in mixed infections.

TI  == the relative lethality of intestinal bacteria for gnotobiotic rats with experimental intestinal strangulation.
AB  == in eight experiments utilizing 28 animals each, germfree rats with and without ischemically or hemorrhagically strangulated closed loop intestinal segments were contaminated with either one of four common intestinal anaerobic bacteria, or a combination of two or three bacteria previously found to be innocuous in pure culture. the results showed that: a) in pure culture, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were innocuous; b) fusobacterium necrophorum alone was a very lethal organism that produced intense, confluent, intraperitoneal, fibrous adhesions after four to six days; and c) mixed inoculum of klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and/or streptococcus faecalis was found to be lethal for gnotobiotic rats with intestinal strangulation. it is concluded that fusobacterium necrophorum is so patent that it should be specifically treated with antibiotics when suspected or  known to be present in clinical specimens. this gnotobiotic animal model will be  useful to delineate the lethality of known combinations of intestinal bacteria.

TI  == the acute phase of experimental infection with trypanosoma cruzi is more severe in mice monoassociated with strict anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == 1. the influence of some components of the normal human intestinal flora on the acute phase of experimental infection with strain cl of trypanosoma cruzi was studied in 30-day-old germ-free or gnotobiotic cfw (lob) mice monoassociated with bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus sp or clostridium sp by intragastric inoculation of 10(6) bacteria 10 days before the intraperitoneal infection with 5 x 10(3) trypomastigotes/g body weight. 2. significantly earlier parasitemia peak  and mortality were observed in bacteroides fragilis- and clostridium-associated mice (16.75 +/- 0.96 and 15.00 +/- 1.15 days, respectively) when compared with germfree animals (18.83 +/- 1.17 days). more precocious mortality (10.40 +/- 2.06 days) and, curiously, much lower blood parasitemia were observed in peptostreptococcus-associated mice than in other gnotobiotic mice. 3. the extent  of cardiac tissue parasitism decreased in the following order: germfree, b. fragilis-associated, clostridium-associated, and peptostreptococcus-associated animals. the levels of inflammatory reaction decreased in the following order: germfree, peptostreptococcus-associated, clostridium-associated, and b. fragilis-associated mice. 4. these results show that the acute phase of experimental infection with t. cruzi was more severe in mice associated with strict anaerobic bacteria when compared with germfree animals. this suggests that a normal intestinal flora may be another factor, in addition to nutritional and genetic factors, responsible for the different susceptibility of organisms of the same species infected with t. cruzi.

TI  == in vitro activities of three of the newer quinolones against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of three new quinolone compounds, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin, and win 57273, against anaerobic bacteria were determined in three  separate studies. the wadsworth agar dilution technique using brucella-laked blood agar was used throughout. the activities of other antimicrobial agents, including ciprofloxacin, imipenem, chloramphenicol, metronidazole, cefotetan, cefoxitin, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, were also determined. the breakpoints of the new quinolones were 2 micrograms/ml for sparfloxacin and win 57273 and 4 micrograms/ml for temafloxacin. win 57273 displayed very good activity against anaerobes, inhibiting all strains of bacteroides fragilis group species at 2 micrograms/ml. only two strains of fusobacterium species were resistant (mic, 4 micrograms/ml). sparfloxacin inhibited 78% of b. fragilis strains and 44% of other b. fragilis group isolates at 2 micrograms/ml. at 2 micrograms/ml, the percentages of other anaerobic species susceptible were as follows: b. gracilis,  70%; other bacteroides species, 61%; clostridium species, 50%; fusobacterium species, 70%; peptostreptococcus species, 91%; non-spore-forming gram-positive rods, 71%. temafloxacin inhibited 91% of b. fragilis strains and 87% of other b.  fragilis group species at 4 micrograms/ml. all strains of other bacteroides species, 78% of fusobacterium species, 80% of clostridium species, and 90% of peptostreptococcus species were inhibited at 4 micrograms of temafloxacin per ml.

AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae is responsible for about one-third to one-half of cases of  acute pelvic inflammatory disease (pid), although there is considerable geographical variation. chlamydia trachomatis is also an important aetiological agent, and is currently isolated 4 times more commonly from the cervix than the gonococcus. however, it is now clear that acute pid is polymicrobial in aetiology. even when n. gonorrhoeae and/or c. trachomatis are isolated from the endocervix, anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis, peptococcus and peptostreptococcus and aerobes, especially the enterobacteriaceae such as e. coli, are also frequently isolated. bacterial synergism, coinfection with the gonococcus and c. trachomatis and the involvement of multiple other micro-organisms including aerobes and anaerobes and antibiotic resistance make the selection of an optimal antibiotic regimen difficult. the centers for disease control (cdc) recommendations first proposed in 1982 and revised in 1985 emphasise broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy including coverage of c. trachomatis. in september 1989, the cdc revised its recommendation for the treatment of acute pid. current recommendations include the use of newer third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone, ceftizoxime and cefotaxime which give excellent coverage of the gonococcus and the enterobacteriaceae. it is still important to include doxycycline or a tetracycline to cover c. trachomatis. for patients with advanced disease or a tubo-ovarian abscess, clindamycin plus gentamicin has been the regimen of choice. aztreonam, a new monobactam, has several advantages over gentamicin including less toxicity, more dependable blood levels and good coverage of n. gonorrhoeae and the enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == the bacteriology of gangrenous and perforated appendicitis--revisited.
AB  == by using optimum sampling, transport, and culture techniques in patients with gangrenous or perforated appendicitis, we recovered than has previously been reported. thirty patients older than 12 years with histologically documented gangrenous or perforated appendicitis had peritoneal fluid, appendiceal tissue, and abscess contents (if present) cultured. appendiceal tissue was obtained so as to exclude the lumen. a total of 223 anaerobes and 82 aerobic or faculatative bacteria were recovered, an average of 10.2 different organisms per specimen. twenty-one different genera and more than 40 species were encountered. bacteroides fragilis group and escherichia coli were isolated from almost all specimens. within the b. fragilis group, eight species were represented. other frequent isolates included peptostreptococcus (80%), pseudomonas (40% [p. aeruginosa, 23.3%, other pseudomonas spp., 16.7%]), b. splanchnicus (40%), b. intermedius (36.7%), and lactobacillus (36.7%). interestingly a previously undescribed fastidious gram-negative anaerobic bacillus was isolated from nearly  one half of all patients. this organism was found to have low dna homology (by dot blot) with the known organisms most closely resembling it.

TI  == comparative efficacy of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole, and penicillin g against anaerobic bacteria in an animal model.
AB  == treatment efficacy of various antimicrobial regimens against anaerobes was studied in semipermeable chambers simulating a closed-space, locally neutropenic  infection site in rabbits. bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides melaninogenicus, clostridium perfringens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius were inoculated (at a  mean of 5.3 log10 cfu/ml in prereduced pooled rabbit serum) into the chambers (one isolate per chamber) in triplicate. antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoperazone, cefoperazone plus sulbactam, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, metronidazole (against the gram-negative anaerobes), or penicillin g (against the gram-positive anaerobes), beginning 4 hours after organism inoculation and continuing every 6 hours for 16 doses. with the use of anaerobic techniques for specimen acquisition, transport, and culture, quantitative bacterial findings were measured at the start of therapy and at various time points thereafter. antibiotic concentrations were measured in blood and chamber fluid by liquid chromatography or bioassay methods. at the end of the study in vivo organisms were reduced by at least 3 log10 cfu/ml from drug-free growth control chambers by all the antimicrobial regimens tested except for cefoperazone against b. fragilis and ciprofloxacin against the three isolates tested. the addition of sulbactam to cefoperazone inhibited b. fragilis beta-lactamase activity and eradicated b. fragilis in vivo. in vivo results with this model confirmed in vitro susceptibilities of all tested antimicrobials except ciprofloxacin and should provide useful indications of the potential clinical efficacy of other new agents against anaerobes.

TI  == current taxonomy of medically important nonsporing anaerobes.
AB  == this review deals mainly with the taxonomy of the genera and species in the family bacteroidaceae. it has been proposed that the genus bacteroides should be  restricted to include the "bacteroides fragilis group" and that the asaccharolytic black-pigmented bacteroides species be transferred to a new genus, porphyromonas. new bacteroides, fusobacterium, and selenomonas species have been  described. a high degree of heterogeneity is apparently present among peptostreptococcus species. mobiluncus is a novel genus including gram-variable curved rods isolated from the human vagina. brachyspira has been proposed as the  generic name for spirochetes isolated from patients with intestinal spirochetosis.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria and bacterial infections: perspectives on treatment and resistance in italy.
AB  == results of laboratory tests of 2,000 samples obtained from 1984 to 1987 from patients with suspected anaerobic infections and the clinical experience of these patients are reported. of these samples, 395 were positive for anaerobes; 36.5% of these 395 samples contained single organisms, and 63.5% contained a mixture of anaerobes and aerobes. abdominal infections were the infections most frequently caused by anaerobes. the bacteroides fragilis group and strains of peptostreptococcus were the microorganisms most frequently isolated. in addition, 300 anaerobes isolated from clinical samples at three italian hospitals were tested for susceptibility to 10 antibiotics (aztreonam, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole, penicillin, and piperacillin). imipenem and metronidazole proved to be the most active agents, with low and similar values for the 50% and 90% minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics). no microorganism showed resistance to these agents. after imipenem and metronidazole, clindamycin was the most effective agent tested. all other antibiotics tested showed elevated mics against bacteroides species and clostridium difficile. in italy, cefoxitin still maintains satisfactory activity  against the majority of anaerobes tested.

TI  == microbiology of infected epidermal cysts.
AB  == specimens from 231 epidermal cyst abscesses were inoculated on media supportive for growth of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. of these, 192 yielded bacterial growth. aerobic or facultative bacteria only were recovered in 84 specimens (44%), anaerobic bacteria only in 57 specimens (30%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 51 specimens (26%). a total of 315 isolates (162 anaerobes  and 153 aerobes) were recovered. an average of 0.8 aerobic or facultative isolates per infected cyst were recovered, and this number was unrelated to the cysts' anatomic sites. however, the number of anaerobic bacteria varied; they were isolated more frequently in perirectal (1.5 isolates per specimen), vulvovaginal (1.4), and head (1.1) infections, and less frequently in trunk (0.7) and extremities (0.4) infections. the predominant aerobic or facultative bacteria were staphylococcus aureus (81 isolates), group a streptococcus (9 isolates), and escherichia coli (7 isolates). the predominant anaerobic organisms were peptostreptococcus species (85 isolates) and bacteroides species (55 isolates, including 12 bacteroides melaninogenicus and 9 bacteroides fragilis groups). the  study highlights the polymicrobial nature and predominance of anaerobes in cyst abscesses in the perirectal, vulvovaginal, and head areas.

TI  == studies on mixed populations of human intestinal bacteria grown in single-stage and multistage continuous culture systems.
AB  == mixed intestinal bacteria were grown for 336 h in two identical single-stage chemostats at low growth rates in a carbohydrate-limited medium. complex bacterial populations were maintained and anaerobes always outnumbered aerobes. the predominant organisms belonged to the genera bacteroides, bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, clostridium, eubacterium, propionbacterium, peptococcus, and peptostreptococcus. bacteroides species predominated in both fermentors, particularly b. ovatus and b. thetaiotaomicron. a high degree of reproducibility  of bacteriological and fermentation product data was obtained in these experiments. when gut contents were inoculated into a five-stage continuous culture system (retention time of 79 or 38 h) containing soya bran, the medium flow rate had little quantitative effect on the formation of acidic fermentation  products; however, more oxidized fermentation acids were produced at the higher retention time. diverse bacterial populations were maintained in every vessel at  each flow rate. bacteroides fragilis group organisms, especially b. ovatus, were  numerically the most important. the viability of bacteria decreased through the system, especially at a retention time of 79 h, when the bacteria were growing under severely nutrient-limited conditions.

AB  == specimens were obtained from 25 patients who developed tracheostomy site wound infections. aerobic bacteria only were isolated in 4 (16%) instances, anaerobic bacteria only in 2 (8%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic isolates were recovered  in 19 (76%). a total of 145 isolates (72 aerobes and 73 anaerobes) were recovered, an average of 5.8 isolates per specimen (2.9 aerobes and 2.9 anaerobes). the most frequently recovered isolates were peptostreptococcus sp., bacteroides sp., alpha-hemolytic streptococci, fusobacterium sp., and pseudomonas aeruginosa. twenty-nine isolates recovered from 19 (72%) patients produced beta-lactamase. these included all isolates of staphylococcus aureus and bacteroides fragilis group and 4 of 11 (36%) of bacteroides melaninogenicus group. the polymicrobial aerobic-anaerobic flora of tracheostomy site wound infection, and the presence of beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in most of these infections, may have important implications for their management.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of doxycycline and minocycline against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the likelihood of bacterial resistance now prevents the use of oxytetracycline in the empirical therapy of anaerobic infections. this study investigates the in-vitro activity of two semi-synthetic derivatives, doxycycline and minocycline, against a range of anaerobic bacteria. mics for each antibiotic were determined by an agar incorporation technique. doxycycline and minocycline were four to eight times more active against the majority of strains than oxytetracycline. with the exception of bacteroides bivius, almost 90% of strains were inhibited by 4 mg/l of doxycycline or minocycline, but resistance to the same concentration of oxytetracycline was present in 60% of the b. fragilis group, 30% of peptostreptococcus spp. and 24% of clostridium perfringens. doxycycline and minocycline represent an alternative therapy for anaerobic infections where bacterial sensitivities are known.

TI  == interactions of ciprofloxacin with clindamycin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and mezlocillin against gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == a total of 598 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria were tested against ciprofloxacin by the agar dilution technique with 10(5) cfu on wilkins-chalgren medium. selected strains representative of the six major genera of anaerobes relatively resistant to the quinolones were tested for interactions with ciprofloxacin in combination with clindamycin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, or mezlocillin by using a checkerboard agar dilution technique. cefotaxime-ciprofloxacin and clindamycin-ciprofloxacin were the most effective combinations, with 16% of all isolates and 44% of the bacteroides fragilis group  isolates responding synergistically to the former combination and 9% of all isolates and 37% of peptostreptococcus isolates responding synergistically to the latter. occasional synergy was seen with all other antibiotic combinations except for metronidazole-ciprofloxacin. likewise, synergism was seen with all groups of  anaerobes except for fusobacterium species. antagonistic interactions were observed only with a peptostreptococcus intermedius strain tested against clindamycin-ciprofloxacin. these data suggest that combinations of ciprofloxacin  with these agents may be useful for certain resistant anaerobic infections.

TI  == heparinase production by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the production of heparinase by a wide range of anaerobic bacteria isolated from  clinical specimens was investigated. none of the 29 strains of bacteroides fragilis produced heparinase. of 62 other bacteroides tested, only two of four strains of b ovatus, two of three strains of b thetaiotaomicron, and two of four  strains of b uniformis were heparinase producers. none of the 48 strains of fusobacteria or seven strains of veillonella produced heparinase. the anaerobic cocci (19 peptococci and seven peptostreptococci) were also negative for heparinase production as were 46 clostridium spp tested. it was concluded that heparinase production by anaerobic bacteria was unlikely to play a part in the regional thrombophlebitis that sometimes occurs in anaerobic infections.

AB  == the effect of capsulation on the ability of bacteroides fragilis, b. asaccharolyticus and anaerobic gram-positive cocci to induce bacteraemia and seeding to various organs was investigated. the test species were injected into mice subcutaneously alone, or mixed with other aerobic or facultative organisms.  capsulate anaerobes were isolated more frequently from the blood, spleen, liver,  and kidneys of infected animals than were non-capsulate organisms. after injection of single anaerobic strains, capsulate organisms were recovered from 163 (39%) of 420 animals; non-capsulate anaerobes were recovered from only 14 (3%) of 420 animals. after injection of b. fragilis mixed with aerobic or facultative organisms, the capsulate b. fragilis strain was isolated more often and for longer periods than the non-capsulate strain. capsulate b. fragilis was also recovered more often 5 days after injection with other organisms, than when  injected alone. these data demonstrate that capsulate bacteroides spp. and anaerobic gram-positive cocci are more virulent than non-capsulate strains in single and mixed infections.

TI  == direct and indirect pathogenicity of anaerobic bacteria in respiratory tract infections in children.
AB  == bacteroides sp (bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides oralis, and bacteroides  fragilis), peptostreptococci, and fusobacteria are important pathogens in respiratory tract infections (rti). these organisms are often recovered mixed with other aerobic, facultative, and anaerobic bacteria. evidence supporting their virulence is provided by studies showing their synergistic potentials in mixed infections and their increased virulence when encapsulated. a recent increase in numbers of beta-lactamase producing strains of anaerobic gram-negative bacteria in rti has been associated with increased failure rates of penicillins in eradication of these infections. these infections include chronic  otitis media, chronic sinusitis and mastoiditis, chronic recurrent tonsillitis, and lung abscesses. the pathogenicity of these organisms is apparent through their ability not only to survive penicillin therapy but also to protect penicillin susceptible pathogens from that drug. these direct and indirect virulence characteristics of anaerobic bacteria require the administration of appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed against all pathogens in mixed infections. the synergy that exists between different aerobic and anaerobic organisms in the respiratory tract is due to several pathogenic mechanisms. these mechanisms include the production of a capsule, which protects organisms from phagocytosis, and the production of beta-lactamase, which inactivates penicillins and first-generation cephalosporins. both of these mechanisms enhance infection and induce complications. however, more work is necessary to prevent encapsulation and the production of enzymes. data, thus far, indicate that there  are therapeutic modalities that can be used to prevent these occurrences and eliminate many mixed rti.

AB  == 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed  in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. on combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. the combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. in combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. of 60 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. using this combination, secondary resistance of pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. when ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == in the present study we sought to determine whether serum antibody was present against microorganisms which predominate in the subgingival flora of young adults with generalized severe periodontitis (sp). subjects with sp were often seropositive for eubacterium brachy, fusobacterium nucleatum e3c22, and peptostreptococcus micros, whereas subjects with juvenile periodontitis (jp) and  subjects with healthy periodontium (hp) were not. both sp and jp subjects were more frequently seropositive for bacteroides gingivalis, f. nucleatum d52b16, and f. nucleatum e1d1 than were hp subjects. the data were most striking for b. gingivalis, for which both the incidence and the magnitude of specific antibody was clearly elevated for sp and jp subject groups. however, sp subjects generally had either a high antibody titer or no detectable titer. in contrast, jp and hp subjects generally had at least very small amounts of antibody. except at very low levels of antibody, neither sp nor jp groups differed significantly from the  hp group for antibody to eubacterium nodatum, bacteroides intermedius (homology group 4197 or 8944), or lactobacillus minutus antibody. there was a high frequency of antibody to e. nodatum, with very high titers in all groups despite  the fact that this organism is rarely found in hp subjects. for eubacterium timidum, the jp group was clearly more frequently seropositive than the hp group. despite high levels of l. minutus in subgingival flora, none of the 50 sp subjects had a detectable antibody titer, and only four of the hp and jp subjects had detectable antibody. these results indicate that many organisms in the subgingival flora elicit antibody responses. b. gingivalis is probably the best example among the species tested. however, some organisms that are present in high concentration, e.g., l. minutus, apparently fail to induce significant antibody responses.

TI  == in vitro activity of cefbuperazone, a new cephamycin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the 90% mic of cefbuperazone (bmy 25182) was 32 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp., 128 micrograms/ml for fusobacterium and clostridium spp., 64 micrograms/ml for eubacterium and peptococcus spp., 8 micrograms/ml for actinomyces spp., and 32 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus spp. the level of activity of cefbuperazone was higher against b. fragilis and lower against anaerobic cocci than those of related cephalosporins, i.e., cefoxitin, cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, and cefmenoxime. however, the activity of cefbuperazone was comparable to that of moxalactam against all groups tested. size of inoculum and type of media used did not alter the mics of cefbuperazone for b. fragilis. cefbuperazone showed synergistic activity when combined with cefoxitin against resistant strains of b. fragilis.

TI  == mutagenic activation of biliary metabolites of 1-nitropyrene by intestinal microflora.
AB  == to investigate the modifying role of intestinal microflora in the metabolism of chemical carcinogens in vivo, we subjected bile from fischer rats treated per os  with chemical carcinogens and related compounds to a mutagenicity assay in the presence and absence of a cell-free extract from human feces. a mixture of the bile sample and potassium phosphate buffer was incubated in the presence or absence of human cell-free fecal extract and then further incubated with a bacterial suspension of salmonella typhimurium tester strains ta98 or ta100. bile from rats treated with 1-nitropyrene (1-np) produced about 2700 and 400 revertants per plate in strain ta98 in the presence and absence of the fecal extract, respectively. there was a drug dose- and bile volume-related response. treatment of 1-np-bile with beta-glucuronidase, but not aryl sulfatase, enhanced  its mutagenicity. cell-free extracts of some strains of intestinal bacteria (bacteroides fragilis atcc 12044, b. vulgatus atcc 8482, b. thetaiotaomicron atcc 12290, bacteroides sp. strain 524, eubacterium eligens vpi c15-48, peptostreptococcus sp. strain 204 and escherichia coli a-5-18) also enhanced the  mutagenicity of 1-np-bile. these bacterial cell-free extracts hydrolyzed the synthetic beta-d-glucuronides of phenolphthalein and/or p-nitrophenol. these data indicate that the glucuronide(s) of 1-np-metabolite(s) secreted into bile can be  hydrolyzed in the intestine by bacterial beta-glucuronidases to potent mutagenic  aglycone(s).

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria isolated from female genital tract infections.
AB  == certain species or subspecies of anaerobic bacteria are isolated with higher frequency from female genital tract infections than from other anatomic sites. to gain susceptibility data more specific to the treatment of these infections, nine antimicrobial agents were tested by an agar dilution technique against 230 anaerobic bacteria isolated solely from obstetric and gynecological infections. these genital isolates were, in general, very susceptible to imipenem (most active, inhibiting all gram-negative rods at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml), clindamycin (all isolates inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), metronidazole (all gram-negative rods inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml), and chloramphenicol. penicillin g had generally low activity against bacteroides spp., not restricted to just the bacteroides fragilis group, although it was very active against gram-positive species. bacteroides bivius, a species uniquely common in female genital infections, was particularly resistant (90% mic, 64 u/ml). also, the bacteroides melaninogenicus  isolates were less susceptible than previously reported for isolates not exclusively from genital sites. compared with moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone, cefoxitin usually demonstrated equal or greater activity against most bacteroides spp., with the exception of greater activity of moxalactam against b. fragilis (formerly subsp. fragilis). resistance to moxalactam was observed among strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius, a common genital isolate. overall, the activities of these four drugs were not as predictable as those observed for clindamycin, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, and imipenem.

TI  == peritonsillar abscess: bacteriological evaluation.
AB  == the pus from a series of 41 peritonsillar abscesses was examined bacteriologically. in the majority of the abscesses a mixed bacterial flora was found. the specimens yielded 0-7 different bacterial species per abscess (mean 3.0). one species alone was isolated only in five cases (12.5%). both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria were isolated from the specimens of 25 patients (61%), only  anaerobes from two specimens (4.9%), and only facultative bacteria from 12 specimens (29%). beta haemolytic streptococci were cultured in 43.9% of the cases, but streptococcus pyogenes group a in only 10 cases (24.4%). thus, the pus of the peritonsillar abscess seems to be caused by a mixed bacterial infection, where anaerobic bacteria play a significant role. indications of tonsillectomy in cases with peritonsillar abscess are discussed.

AB  == from august 1980 to june 1982, 102 burn wound specimens taken from 34 patients were studied for anaerobic cultures. fifteen instances (14.7 per cent) from 8 patients were positive and altogether 12 species were found. the predominant anaerobes were bacteroides melaninogenicus, peptococcus, bacteroides fragilis, and other strains of bacteroides and peptostreptococcus. they were mostly discovered in electric burn wounds and burn wounds affecting the perianal and oral areas. wounds with anaerobic infection usually appeared gaseous, necrotic and ischaemic with foul odour. nineteen blood samples from 10 burn patients were  also studied for anaerobic cultures, and two were positive, one caused by bacteroides and the other by mixed infection of peptococcus and serratia, indicating that the anaerobes played an important role in burn infections. it seems necessary to perform anaerobic culture studies in burn patients as a routine. a comparative study between anaerobic culture and indirect immuno-fluorescence method was undertaken for bact. fragilis and bact. melaninogenicus in 47 burn wounds. it showed that the immunofluorescence method was a more rapid, simple, sensitive and specific diagnostic method.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.

AB  == ninety intestinal organisms (71 isolates from fecal samples of neutropenic patients with cancer or from various sites in patients with intraabdominal infections and 19 control strains) were examined by reverse-phase thin-layer chromatography for their ability to produce menaquinones in vitro. menaquinones were found in all of 24 organisms of the bacteroides fragilis group. two other bacteroides species, bacteroides disiens and bacteroides bivius, also produced menaquinones. a single isolate of bacteroides species lacked menaquinones. these  constituents were found in all of five strains of escherichia coli, all of four strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, five of eight strains of propionibacterium species, two of five strains of eubacterium species, and the one strain each of arachnia propionica and veillonella parvula tested. no menaquinones were detected in organisms of the genera fusobacterium, clostridium, bifidobacterium, lactobacillus, actinomyces, peptococcus, or peptostreptococcus. these findings suggest that e. coli, bacteroides species, and some gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming bacilli produce menaquinones that may be a source of vitamin k  in patients who are deprived of exogenous vitamin k1.

AB  == twenty-nine isolates of anaerobic bacteria from foot infections in diabetic patients were tested, using the agar dilution method, for in vitro susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents. imipenem and metronidazole showed excellent activity; clindamycin and chloramphenicol were next in terms of efficacy. cefoxitin and moxalactam demonstrated good activity, although three isolates of the bacteroides fragilis group were resistant to moxalactam. penicillin g, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone showed poor activity against the b fragilis group but were quite active against other anaerobes. among the newer beta-lactam antibiotics studied, imipenem, cefoxitin and, to a lesser extent, moxalactam appear promising for clinical use as anti-anaerobic antibiotics in the treatment  of foot infections in diabetic patients.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria in sweden in 1983.
AB  == this review is concerned with anaerobic bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibility. data on the susceptibility to different antimicrobials of anaerobic isolates in sweden during 1983 is presented. among the different bacterial groups, clostridium perfringens, propionibacteria, anaerobic cocci and  curved rods were found to be susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin  and chloramphenicol. c. difficile was susceptible to benzylpenicillin and imipenem, but resistant to cefoxitin. most c. difficile strains were also susceptible to clindamycin and fusidic acid, while all strains were susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. the majority of the fusobacteria were susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics, clindamycin, metronidazole and chloramphenicol. however, some strains were found to be resistant to penicillins. against the bacteroides fragilis group, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, metronidazole and imipenem had the best activity, whereas piperacillin and cefoxitin showed good activities. most bacteroides non-fragilis strains were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. however, an increasing number of isolates were found to be resistant especially to penicillins when comparing with data from the last five years.

TI  == frequency of occurrence and antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial isolates from the intestinal and female genital tracts.
AB  == in the selection of empiric therapy for infections of the female genital tract and intraabdominal infections in humans, the requisite information includes (1) the frequency of isolation of bacterial species dominant in the normal gastrointestinal and female genital tracts and in intraabdominal and female genital tract infections and (2) the in vitro susceptibilities of the dominant species to drugs that may be used against them (e.g., penicillin g, cefoperazone, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, and metronidazole). the predominant bacteria in fecal contents are not necessarily those most frequently found in infections. intraabdominal and perirectal infections are usually polymicrobial, resulting from mixtures of facultative species (coliforms and streptococci) and anaerobes. the predominant bacteria of the normal vagina and cervix are lactobacilli, facultative streptococci, peptococcus species, and peptostreptococcus species. most infections of the female genital tract are due to mixtures of facultative enteric bacilli, streptococci, and anaerobes (peptococcus and peptostreptococcus species, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides disiens, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides bivius, and bacteroides asaccharolyticus). of the antibiotics tested, clindamycin appears the most active against many of the groups of bacteria isolated.

TI  == the recovery of anaerobic bacteria from swabs in three transport systems. statistical evaluation by application of a variance component model.
AB  == the recovery of six anaerobic species from swabs in three transport systems was quantitatively evaluated. the test strains were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, fusobacterium necrophorum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium lentum, and clostridium ramosum. the transport systems were a charcoal-impregnated cotton swab in modified stuart's transport medium (ms), or a plain cotton swab in either a dry aerobic tube (da) or an aerobic agar tube (aa). swabs were charged with a known number of organisms of the test strain and inserted in the appropriate transport systems. immediately hereafter the swabs were transferred to glass tubes with reduced buffer. after vigorous shaking, aliquots from the buffer were seeded onto blood agar plates, and the number of colony forming units (cfu) was counted after incubation. the number of  cfus from independent replications had a variation that was too large to be accounted for by the poisson distribution. the probability of recovery (por) was  defined as the number of cfu recovered from a swab as a percentage of the original inoculum. the logarithms of the por values were analyzed with a variance component model. this showed that estimated values of por were significantly higher in da (44%) than in aa (23%), while the value for ms (33%) did not differ  significantly from those for aa or da. it is concluded that in ms, friction between swab and medium does not contribute significantly to bacterial recovery loss, as compared to aa and da.

AB  == we have studied 45 patients who underwent nephrectomy owing to unilateral renal sepsis for anaerobic and aerobic bacterial growth in the urine and kidney. anaerobic organisms were recovered from 11 patients: 10 had positive kidney cultures, and only 1 had positive kidney and urine cultures. there was a distinct relationship between anaerobic infection of the kidney and urinary tract obstruction; 44 per cent of the obstructed kidneys yielded anaerobic organisms versus only 11 per cent of the unobstructed kidneys. bacteroides fragilis was the anaerobic organism most often cultured. it is suggested that cultures for anaerobic organisms be performed together with aerobic cultures in patients with  symptomatic upper urinary tract infections associated with urinary obstruction. in patients in whom anaerobic infection is suspected, in spite of negative anaerobic cultures, antibiotic treatment for anaerobes should be added to the existing therapeutic measures.

TI  == anaerobes: a new aetiology in cavitary pneumoconiosis.
AB  == the role of mycobacteria in the cavitation of large pneumoconiotic masses is well established. in other cases softness is attributed to an ischaemic or aseptic necrosis. five cases are described in which cavitation of the pulmonary masses was caused by anaerobic bacteria, confirmed by the growth of such bacterial in cultures after transtracheal or transpleural puncture. repeated cultures for mycobacteria gave negative results. two cases were acute, having serious complications such as bronchopleural fistula, empyema, and serious respiratory insufficiency. the role of anaerobes in cavitary pneumoconiosis has not been recognised previously, probably because of the special conditions required to culture these bacteria and the infrequent use of transtracheal puncture in the diagnosis of this entity. the prevalence of anaerobes as agents capable of cavitating pneumoconiotic masses remains to be established.

AB  == acidic metabolic products determined directly in clinical specimens of 51 anaerobic and 12 aerobic infections by quantitative gas-liquid chromatography (glc) were correlated with the bacteriologic findings. the presence of appreciable amounts of succinic acid, more than 1 microm per ml, propionic and isovaleric acid, at concentrations not exceeding 3 microm per ml, was strong evidence for bacteroides fragilis infections. when isobutyric acid was also detected, a b. melaninogenicus infection could be presumed. however, the presence of other anaerobes or aerobes could not be excluded. the presence of clostridium  spp. could also be presumed by the detection of butyric acid at a concentration greater than 4 microm per ml and of acetic, propionic and isobutyric acid at relatively high concentrations. in specimens from aerobic infections, no other acid except acetic and lactic acid could be detected. our data also show that quantitative glc is not valid in peptococcus and peptostreptococcus spp. infections except in some cases where peptococcus alone or together with aerobic  organisms are found.

TI  == [the effect of tinidazole on the anaerobic bacterial flora in patients undergoing gynecological surgery].
AB  == the various effects have been examined against the anaerobes by administering tinidazole when the operations of gynecology and obstetrics and the following results were obtained. 1. the serum concentrations after the single administration of 1,000 mg of tdz showed 56.6 micrograms/ml of the peak value (3  hours) and 27.7 micrograms/ml of 24 hours value, and the antibacterial potency was maintained for a long duration. the concentration in the vaginal secretions was 21.8 micrograms/tampon within 24 hours. 2. the detections of anaerobes were made in 74 cases, before the administration, with the results of 1 case alone and 73 cases mixed with aerobes, 10 species and 133 strains being detected, which comprise 33 cases with 1 species, 27 cases with 2 species mixed, 10 cases with 3  species mixed and 4 cases with 4 species mixed. the main species detected were bacteroides fragilis in 46 strains (34.6%), peptostreptococcus spp. in 31 strains (23.3%) and peptococcus spp. in 26 strains (19.5%). 3. the mic values of the detected bacteria to the tdz centered upon 0.78 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis, 3.13 micrograms/ml for peptococcus spp. and 0.78 micrograms/ml for peptostreptococcus spp. and those of the others were low, a lot of those being of sensitive strains. 4. the bacteriological effects on the anaerobes were, after the medication, observed to be 71.4% and found significantly more effective than  33.3% of natural eradication and decrease observed in the not administered group. 5. clinically, no anaerobic infections were observed often operation and the therapeutical effects were observed. a little side effect was observed. 6. according to the above-mentioned results, it was observed possible to prevent from the anaerobic infections after operation in gynecology and obstetrics by administration of tdz.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

AB  == tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. the tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of  7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. there were 207 anaerobes isolated. the predominant isolates were 101 bacteroides sp (including 10 b fragilis group, and 47 b melaninogenicus group), 29 fusobacterium sp, 34 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 peptococcus sp and 9 peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 veillonella sp. there were 185 aerobic isolates. the predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group a, 4 group b, and 2 each group c and f), 14 haemophilus sp (including 12 h influenzae type b) and 5 h parainfluenzae. beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. these were all isolates of s aureus (24) and b fragilis (10), 15 of 47 b melaninogenicus (32%),  5 of the 12 b oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 h influenzae type b (17%). our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.

TI  == premature labor. ii. bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  == human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase a2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. the striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase a2 activity. activity was found in bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus a and b, escherichia coli, klebsiella, staphylococcus epidermidis, pneumococcus, lactobacillus, and mycoplasma hominis.  bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and s viridans had the highest activities. the specific activities of phospholipase a2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase a2 of the amnion and chorion. we postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase a2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.

TI  == animal model for anaerobic lung abscess.
AB  == there are no satisfactory animal models for the study of anaerobic lung abscess.  aspiration of food, gastric mucin, or hydrochloric acid, or any combination of these, along with oropharyngeal bacteria, is commonly believed to cause aspiration pneumonia and lung abscess. in the animal model described, none of the adjuvants was effective in producing anaerobic lung abscesses. anaerobic bacteria derived from dental scrapings of a healthy adult (peptococcus morbillorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, eubacterium lentum, and bacteroides fragilis), when inoculated transtracheally without any adjuvants into new zealand male white rabbits, consistently produced lung abscesses. neither b fragilis by itself nor a mixture of p. morbillorum, f. nucleatum, and e. lentum without the addition of b. fragilis produced lung abscesses. the bacterial isolates used in this study were  stored in prereduced chopped-meat-glucose medium and subcultured several times and were found effective in reproducing anaerobic lung abscesses repeatedly. this animal model is suitable for the study of pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment  of b. fragilis-associated anaerobic lung abscess.

AB  == this study reports bacterial specimens obtained from 112 children presenting with a ruptured appendix. additional samples were studied from 11 of these patients who developed a postoperative surgical draining wound. bacterial growth occurred  in 100 peritoneal fluid specimens. anaerobic bacteria alone were present in 14 specimens, aerobes alone in 12, and mixed aerobic an anerobic flora in 74 specimens. there were 144 aerobic isolates (1.4 per specimen). the predominant isolates were: e. coli (57 specimens); alpha-hemolytic steptococcus (16 specimens); gamma-hemolytic streptococcus (15 specimens); group d streptococcus (12 specimens); and p. aeruginosa (9 specimens). there were 301 anaerobic isolates (three per specimen). the predominant isolates were: 157 bacteroides spp. (including 92 b. fragilis group and 26 b. melaninogenicus group); 62 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (including 30 peptococcus sp.; 29 peptostreptococcus sp.); 27 fusobactenium sp.; and 16 clostridium sp. b. fragilis and peptococcus sp. occurred in 23 patients. beta lactamase production was detectable in 98 isolates recovered from 74 patients. these included all isolates of b. fragilis and six of the 23 bacteroides sp. forty-nine organisms (16 aerobic and 33 anaerobic) were recovered from the draining wounds. the predominant organisms were: b. fragilis (8 specimens); e. coli (6 specimens); peptostreptococcus sp. (5 specimens); and three specimens each of p. aeruginosa and peptococcus sp. most of these isolates were also recovered from the peritoneal cavity of the patients. these findings demonstrate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of peritoneal cavity and postoperative wound flora in children with perforated appendix, and demonstrate the presence of beta lactamase-producing organisms in three-fourths of the patients.

TI  == comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  == the in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar  diffusion tests. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. saccharolytic bacteroides strains (39 b. fragilis, 6 b. thetaiotaomicron, 4 b. vulgatus) showed broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and mics of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees c. with strains of b. oralis, b. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, b. corrodens, veillonella sp. and megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution mics were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium acnes, eubacterium sp., bifidobacterium sp. and clostridium sp. had broth dilution mics of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. with the great majority of strains tested, mics were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and mic. with gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution mic and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for p. acnes). when calculating the regression lines for agar dilution mics and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for p. acnes). with b. fragilis and other bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution mics and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of antituberculosis agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobic infections may coexist with tuberculosis, and can be mistaken for one another. the effect of therapy with antituberculosis chemotherapeutic agents against anaerobic bacteria (with the exception of rifampin) is unknown. we therefore examined the in vitro efficacy of certain commonly used antituberculosis agents (rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol) against 370 strains of anaerobic bacteria, including 86 isolates of bacteroides fragilis. rifampin at a concentration of 2 microgram/ml inhibited 91 percent of all anaerobic isolates. both ethambutol and isoniazid were totally ineffective against any of the anaerobes tested, even at 64 microgram/ml. therapy with rifampin in an unsuspected anaerobic infection can be misdiagnosed for tuberculosis. therefore,  when tuberculosis is suspected, isoniazid and ethambutol can be used and rifampin withheld until the acid-fast bacilli are demonstrated by additional diagnostic procedures, such as transtracheal aspiration.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of amniotic fluid.
AB  == the antimicrobial effect of amniotic fluid (af) obtained during the first (af1) and second (af2) trimesters was compared with the third (af3) against anaerobic bacteria, such as bacteroides fragilis ss. fragilis (6 strains), eubacterium lentum (3 strains), and peptostreptococcus anaerobius (4 strains). escherichia coli (5 strains) served as a positive control. af1 supported the growth of all 4  anaerobes (except b fragilis for 4 hours) for the entire 24-hour period tested. af2 supported the growth of e coli and b fragilis for 24 hours but temporarily inhibited p anaerobius and e lentum. in contrast, af3 inhibited all bacteria tested for 8 hours or more. it is concluded that af1 is the least inhibitory, af3 the most, and af2 intermediate for the organisms tested. lack of antimicrobial effect of af on anaerobic bacteria may be one explanation for the higher incidence of anaerobic infections during absortion than during the prenatal period.

TI  == the bacteriology of cavitating pulmonary infections and empysema. studies of transtracheal aspirates and pleural fluid.
AB  == a prospective study of bacteriology in 14 cases of cavitating pulmonary infections and empyema is reported. bacteriologic results were based on transtracheal aspirates or pleural fluid. appropriate anaerobic bacteriologic methods were employed. anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 11 patients (79%); they were the only pathogens isolated in 6 patients. the predominant species were fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. aerobic bacteria were present in 7 patients. the results indicate that anaerobes play a key role in most cases of cavitating pulmonary infections and empyema, and that proper culture of adequat specimens will generally establish the bacteriological diagnosis.

TI  == enhancement of experimental anaerobic infections by blood, hemoglobin, and hemostatic agents.
AB  == certain foreign materials have been demonstrated to enhance the infectivity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. whole blood and other protein compounds encountered in surgical settings or trauma were tested for their effect on infectivity of nonsporeforming anaerobic bacteria. infectious synergistic mixtures of bacteroides fragilis plus peptostreptococcus anaerobius and bacteroides melaninogenicus plus fusobacterium necrophorum were each diluted to a barely noninfectious or minimally infectious concentration (subinfective inoculum) that was injected intraperitoneally into mice alone and in combination  with test proteins. infectivity was measured by deaths from sepsis or abscess(es) within the abdominal cavity at autopsy at 1 week. two hemostatic agents, gelfoam  powder and avitene (final concentrations, 10 mg/ml), and crystalline hemoglobin (4 g/100 ml) each produced a marked increase (p < 0.001) in the rate of infection when mixed with a normally subinfective inoculum of either bacterial mixture. fresh homologous mouse blood (0.25 ml) injected intraperitoneally without anticoagulant also significantly enhanced infectivity (p < 0.01) of a subinfective inoculum of b. fragilis plus p. anaerobius. these studies demonstrated the capacity of whole blood, hemoglobin, and hemostatic agents to enhance the infectivity of certain nonsporeforming anaerobic bacteria. the high concentrations of anaerobic bacteria in the gastrointestinal, female genital, and respiratory tracts produce an increased risk of human infection after surgery or  trauma in these sites; the protein agents studied here may further enhance infection.

TI  == quantitative evaluation of three commercial blood culture media for growth of anaerobic organisms.
AB  == the ability of three different commercial blood culture media--brain heart infusion broth (pfizer), thiol broth (difco), and prs-peptone broth (becton, dickinson & co.)--to support the growth of five different anaerobes is described. inocula of 100 and 1,000 colony-forming units per ml were used to evaluate potential differences in survival, lag time, growth rate, and doubling times of each anaerobe in each medium. in addition, each medium was evaluated for its ability to neutralize the antibacterial effects of whole blood. the results of this study indicate that the prs-peptone broth is superior to brain heart infusion and thiol broths. shorter lag times and accelerated generation times and growth rates were noted for more different anaerobes in the prs-peptone broth. neither the size of inoculum nor the addition of normal whole blood appeared to alter the survival or growth characteristics of the anaerobes in any medium. however, the addition of normal whole blood did extend the lag time of each anaerobe by approximately 1 to 2 h in each medium.

TI  == the in vitro and in vivo activity of taurolin against anaerobic pathogenic organisms.
AB  == an antibacterial agent, taurolin, formed by the combination of 2 molecules of taurine with 3 molecules of formaldehyde has been tested against anaerobes in vitro and in vivo. in vitro, taurolin is highly active against bacteroides species and anaerobic streptococci as measured by the minimum inhibitory concentration. in vivo, small dosages of taurolin given intraperitoneally increase the mortality in mice with bacteroides peritonitis. however, by increasing the dosage of taurolin, survival is prolonged and mortality reduced. intravenously administered taurolin protects rabbits from the effects of bacteroides fragilis infection whether the organisms are given intravenously or intraperitoneally.

TI  == anaerobic bacteria in biliary disease in elderly patients.
AB  == gallbladder bile from 52 elderly subjects who had undergone biliary tract surgery was examined for the presence of bacteria. twelve patients had sterile bile, 18 specimens of bile yielded anaerobes as well as aerobes, and 22 yielded aerobic bacteria only. escherichia coli was the most commonly isolated organism (30 strains). bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently encountered anaerobic bacterium and was found in 15 patients. the klebsiella-enterobacter group was the second most commonly isolated group and b. fragilis was third. clostridium perfringens was recovered in 10 specimens of bile. anaerobic bacteria were recovered more frequently in patients with ductal obstruction. the relatively frequent isolation of anaerobes, especially of b. fragilis, in this study may be  related to the anaerobic techniques used, to the age of the patients, and to the  high incidence of pigment stones among the subjects.

AB  == the efficacy of the commercially available vacutainer blood culture system to support the growth of non-sporing anaerobes was compared with two laboratory-prepared blood culture media (supplemented thioglycollate medium and brain heart infusion). the media were inoculated with 10, 100 and 1000 organisms  of the species tested, and the number of colony-forming units was determined at intervals of 8-10 hrs. analogous experiments were performed with batches of the media to which 10% vol/vol of human blood had been added. from the results obtained with strains of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides splanchnicus, sphaerophorus necrophorus, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and propionibacterium acnes it became obvious that growth of non-sporing anaerobes was significantly enhanced in the vacutainer culture tubes, whereas enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. grew equally well in all the media tested.

TI  == a double-blind comparison of clindamycin with penicillin plus chloramphenicol in  treatment of septic abortion.
AB  == the responses to therapy with either clindamycin alone or penicillin plus chloramphenicol in 77 patients with septic abortions were compared in a randomized, double-blind study. although fever index and duration of hospitalization were similar for both groups of patients, significantly more patients in the group that received clindamycin developed major complications (p  less than 0.05). this is believed to result from clindamycin's lack of activity against aerobic gram-negative bacilli. aggressive management that included early  uterine evacuation and broad-spectrum antibiotics effective against both aerobic  and anaerobic bacteria was the key to reduced morbidity and mortality rates in treatment of septic abortion. for patients treated with clindamycin, early uterine evacuation appeared more important than antibiotic therapy (p less than 0.005). bacteremia was documented in a total of 29 patients (38%). bacteremia was polymicrobial in eight patients (28%) and involved anaerobes exclusively in 18 (62%), aerobes exclusively in nine (31%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in two (7%). the organisms most frequently isolated were bacteroides (other than bacteroides fragilis), peptostreptococcus, and escherichia coli.

TI  == [susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of anaerobic bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  == the in vitro susceptibility to thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol of 272 anaerobes, most of which were recent clinical isolated, was determined by broth dilution tests, with chloramphenicol, 133 anaerobic gram-negative non-sporing rods (48 bacteroides fragilis, 13 b. thetaiotaomicron, 14 b. oralis, 16 sphaerophorus varius etc.) had mic values of 0.03 through 16 microng/ml. very similar results (mic, 0.06-16 microng/ml) were obtained with thiamphenicol. in concentrations of 4 microng/ml or less chloramphenicol inhibited 90.2% and thiamphenicol 78.95% of the strains. strains with only moderate sensitivity to both antibiotics (mic, 8 or 16 microng/ml) belonged to b. fragilis or other bacteroides species. members of the fusobacterium and sphaerophorus group were susceptible to less than or equal to 2 microng chloramphenicol/ml and less than or equal to 4 microng thiamphenicol/ml respectively. with both antibiotics, 102 strains of gram-positive non-sporing anaerobes (p. acnes, peptostreptococcus spp., peptococcus spp.) were susceptible to less than or equal to 8 microng/ml. of 37 clostridium isolates, 35 (belonging to c. perfringens, c. septicum, c. cadaveris etc.) were inhibited by concentrations of 8 microng/ml or less of chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. only one strain each of c. perfringens and clostridium sp. had an mic of 16 microng thiamphenicol/ml. accordingly, resistance to thiamphenicol or chloramphenicol was not observed. a standardized monodisk agardiffusion test was performed on 40 bacteroidaceae, 18 peptococcaceae and 20 c, (p.) acnes strains. only a poor correlation was observed between mic and zone size for thiamphenicol and chloramphenicol. therefore, inhibition zone diameter measurement cannot be regarded as a reliable method to detect chloramphenicol or thiamphenicol resistance in anaerobes. thiamphenicol, which is virtually as active against anaerobes as chloramphenicol but lacks serious toxicity, may well play an important role in the therapy of various anaerobic infections.

TI  == numbers and types of anaerobic bacteria isolated from clinical specimens since 1960.
AB  == between 1960 and 1974, 826 specimens, excluding stool, urine, sputum, and blood,  yielded 689 (83%) positive cultures, of which 403 (58.5%) contained anaerobic bacteria. this represents 48.8% of the total specimens cultured. isolates from 153 specimens obtained and stocked from 1965 to 1974 were reidentified by current criteria. gram-negative bacilli, primarily bacteroides, were the most frequently  isolated anaerobes, being found in 70% of 153 anaerobe-positive specimens and accounting for 42% of the total anaerobes isolated. gram-positive cocci were second in occurrence, being found in 66% of 153 specimens and accounting for 40%  of the total isolates. bacteroides fragilis was by far the most frequently isolated species. compairson of 14 years of cumulative data with data from current studies covering 1- to 2-year periods indicated that the anaerobes isolated from clinical material have not changed significantly in type or relative numbers.

AB  == the new antiprotozoal agent, tinidazole, was found to be bactericidal against all 52 isolates of obligate anaerobic bacteria tested, 42 bacteroides fragilis, 4 clostridia and 6 peptostreptococci. the minimum bactericidal concentrations of tinidazole for b. fragilis ranged from 0.25 to 4 mug/ml, and those of metronidazole from 0.25 to 8 mug/ml, i.e. several times lower than the serum concentrations achievable after oral administration. in most cases the mic was identical with mbc or half of it. on the average, tinidazole was slightly more effective against b. fragilis than metronidazole. although essentially the activities of the two drugs were positively correlated, there was a fourfold difference in their mbc for 10 of the 42 b. fragilis.

(5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == human fecal flora: variation in bacterial composition within individuals and a possible effect of emotional stress.
AB  == data are presented on the distribution of 101 bacterial species and subspecies among 1,442 isolates from 25 fecal specimens from three men on: (i) their normal  diet and normal living conditions, (ii) normal living conditions but eating the controlled metabolic diet designed for use in the skylab simulation and missions, and (iii) the skylab diet in simulated skylab (isolation) conditions. these bacteria represent the most numerous kinds in the fecal flora. analyses of the kinds of bacteria from each astronaut during the 5-month period showed more variation in the composition of the flora among the individual astronauts than among the eight or nine samples from each person. this observation indicates that the variations in fecal flora reported previously, but based on the study of only one specimen from each person, more certainly reflect real differences (and not daily variation) in the types of bacteria maintained by individual people. the proportions of the predominant fecal species in the astronauts were similar to those reported earlier from a japanese-hawaiian population and were generally insensitive to changes from the normal north american diet to the skylab diet; only two of the most common species were affected by changes in diet. however, one of the predominant species (bacteroides fragilis subsp. thetaiotaomicron) appeared to be affected during confinement of the men in the skylab test chamber. evidence is presented suggesting that an anger stress situation may have been responsible for the increase of this species simultaneously in all of the subjects studied. phenotypic characteristics of some of the less common isolates  are given. the statistical analyses used in interpretation of the results are discussed.

AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.

AB  == the comparative susceptibility of 622 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria to minocycline, doxycycline, and tetracycline was determined by an agar-dilution technique. in addition to bacteroides fragilis, a variety of other  anaerobic bacteria was resistant to achievable blood concentrations of tetracycline (55% inhibited by 6.25 mug/ml) and doxycycline (58% inhibited by 2.5 mug/ml). in contrast, minocycline was significantly more active (p < 0.05) than both doxycycline and tetracycline, and 70% of strains were inhibited by achievable blood concentrations of this antibiotic (2.5 mug/ml). the enhanced activity of minocycline was particularly striking for peptococcus asaccharolyticus, p. magnus, p. prevotii, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides melaninogenicus. further evaluation of the clinical efficacy of minocycline against anaerobic infections is indicated.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria by the standardized disc  diffusion method with special reference to bacteroides fragilis.
AB  == the susceptibility of 90 strains of bacteroides fragilis to 16 antibacterial drugs was determined by the agar plate dilution test and the disc diffusion test. good correlation of results was obtained with the two methods, and regression line analysis could be performed for beta-lactam antibiotics, erythromycin, tetracyclines, lincomycin and clindamycin. thus the standardized disc diffusion method can be used for susceptibility testing, but only a clear distinction between sensitive and resistant strains can be seen.

TI  == studies on the cecal microflora of commercial broiler chickens.
AB  == a study was made of the cecal microflora isolated from broilers (5-week-old) reared under typical commercial husbandry conditions. three hundred and twenty-five bacterial strains (randomly isolated from colonies representing 49 to 81% of the microscopic count) were isolated from cecal digesta of six animals on  a rumen fluid roll tube medium (m98-5). seventy-seven percent of these strains consisted of strict anaerobes: gram-negative, pleomorphic cocci (5.2%), peptostreptococcus (1.5%), gram-positive rods (36.1% as propionibacterium acnes and eubacterium sp.), gram-negative rods (18.6% as bacteroides clostridiiformis,  b. hypermegas and b. fragilis) and sporeforming rods (15.7% as clostridium sp.).  two types of facultatively anaerobic bacteria (gram-positive cocci and escherichia coli) were also isolated and constituted 17.5% of the remaining flora. the distribution of the bacterial groups isolated from six cecal samples varied considerably. data on the growth requirements of anaerobic strains indicated that many could be cultured in a simple medium consisting of an energy  source, minerals, reducing agent, trypticase, and yeast extract (or a vitamin mixture in place of yeast extract). the growth of some of these bacteria was also enhanced by co(2) and rumen fluid. these preliminary data suggest that some of the more numerous anaerobes isolated from the chicken cecum may not require complex nutrients for growth and, in fact, may be nutritionally similar to rumen  anaerobes.

TI  == extracellular deoxyribonuclease production by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the production of extracellular deoxyribonuclease was examined with anaerobic organisms isolated from clinical specimens. nuclease activity was extraordinarily common. all strains of fusobacterium, including eight species, as well as bacteroides fragilis and b. melaninogenicus, displayed enzyme activity. whereas the gram-positive bacteria were generally less productive, all strains of clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus intermedius, and p. anaerobius specifically produced deoxyribonuclease. the test is taxonomically valuable, particularly in the characterization of gram-positive cocci, since a deoxyribonuclease-producing coccus indicates p. intermedius or p. anaerobius. additionally, possession of the enzyme may prove to be a useful correlate of the  potential pathogenicity of anaerobes.

TI  == phosphatase activity of anaerobic organisms.
AB  == anaerobic organisms were tested for phosphatase activity in different ph ranges.  several groups of organisms displayed characteristic patterns. bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, and b. ruminicola produced phosphatase with strongest activity at ph 8.6. fusobacterium mortiferum was the only species of this genus to show strong hydrolysis. the enzyme was active in both acid and alkaline ranges. the activity of gram-positive organisms was variable, the most active groups being clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus intermedius, p. micros, and peptococcus constellatus. the incorporation of phosphatase activity into the identification scheme of anaerobes seems feasible. there was a correlation of hydrolysis with several important pathogens.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

TI  == oxygen sensitivity of various anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes differ in their sensitivity to oxygen, as two patterns were recognizable in the organisms included in this study. strict anaerobes were species incapable of agar surface growth at po(2) levels greater than 0.5%. species that were found to be strict anaerobes were treponema macrodentium, treponema denticola, treponema oralis n. sp., clostridium haemolyticum, selenomonas ruminatium, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, succinivibrio dextrinosolvens, and lachnospira multiparus. moderate anaerobes would include those species capable of growth in the presence of oxygen levels as high as 2 to 8%. the moderate anaerobes could be exposed to room atmosphere for 60 to 90 min without appreciable loss of viability. species considered as moderate anaerobes were bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, fusobacteria nucleatum, clostridium novyi type a, and peptostreptococcus elsdenii. the recognition of at  least two general types of anaerobes would seem to have practical import in regard to the primary isolation of anaerobes from source material.
