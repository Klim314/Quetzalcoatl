TI  == [solitary actinomycotic brain abscess: case report].
AB  == actinomycotic brain abscess is a rare condition with uncertain clinical features. here we report the case of a 66-year-old immune-competent woman with an actinomycotic brain abscess who presented with sensory aphasia and mild right hemiparesis. she had no febrile episode or headache. moreover, she did not have any periodontal or oto-rhino-laryngological disease, and the results of laboratory tests were normal. a computed tomography scan showed an irregular, low-density area in the left parietal lobe. subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed low-signal intensity in a t1 weighted image, high-signal intensity in a t2 weighted image, and mixed intensity on a diffusion weighted image. thallium-201 chloride scintigraphy showed definite accumulation of thallium in the lesion and  the patient's condition gradually deteriorated. ten days after gadolinium administration, a t1 weighted image showed a multi- lobulated irregular mass in the left parietal lobe. the patient subsequently underwent craniotomy and evacuation of the yellowish abscess. gram staining of the tissue showed the presence of gram-positive filamentous rods, and abscess cultures were positive for actinomyces and prevotella disiens. the abscess resolved after treatment with a high dose of intravenous penicillin g (24 million units/day) for 8 weeks, followed by an oral dose of amoxicillin for 4 months. the patient was discharged  with a rudimentary limitation of the visual field.

TI  == [differential diagnosis of unilateral necrotic tonsillitis].
AB  == background: the best known clinical picture of a one-sided necrotisising, infectious tonsillitis is the by plaut and vincent (1894) described angina plaut-vincent. in addition to this fusospirochetosis it is in case of necrotisising inflammations in the oropharynx differential-diagnostically important to consider also the anaerobic type prevotella, especially prevotella disiens as a potential trigger . material and methods: because the clinical course forms of a necrotisising oropharyngeal inflammations can be very different and complicate so a suitable diagnosis, it is very important to get a complete and perfect cause proof. for getting this proof a correct test production, transport and cultivation are of extreme importance . results: the type prevotella consists of different species gram-negative, obligate anaerobic strains. they are regarded as a cause of suppurating inflammations and abscesses  of the genital tract and are components of the aerobic anaerobic mixed flora in case of gingival infections. the sole proof in the microbiological culture as a smear test result of a one-sided necrotisising tonsillitis has to be seen as a first description by reason of missing literature . implication: as triggers for  one-sided necrotisising tonsillitis are considered different causes. next a carcinoma of the tonsil, lues, angina plaut-vincent have to be excluded. an infection with prevotella disiens is an extremely rare variation in contrast. however, the transmission is possible by insufficient hygiene, lack phenomena and sexual intercourse and to consider therefore as an exclusion diagnosis.

TI  == prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among 149 anaerobic gram-negative  rods isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  == in a prospective study, 47 adults presenting a rapidly progressive periodontitis  were selected in order to evaluate the prevalence of beta-lactamase-producing strains among oral anaerobic gram-negative rods. predominant anaerobes were identified from two of the deepest periodontal pockets. beta-lactamase-positive strains fulfilled to at least two of three criteria: positive nitrocefin test, penicillin etest minimal inhibitory concentration > 1 microgram/ml, and disk diffusion synergy between amoxycillin and clavulanic acid > 10 mm. at least one beta-lactamase-producing strain was found in 53.2% of patients and 39.4% of the periodontal pockets investigated. prominent beta-lactamase-positive species were  prevotella buccae and prevotella intermedia (respectively 16 of 38: 42% and 18 of 52: 35% positive strains), followed by prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum (respectively 1 of 6: 17%, 1 of  10: 10%, 1 of 10: 10%, and 1 of 13: 8% positive strains). no beta-lactamase producer could be evidenced in porphyromonas gingivalis (10 strains tested). all  the beta-lactamase-positive strains with the nitrocefin test had penicillin minimal inhibitory concentrations > 1 microgram/ml with the etest, and a strong synergy between amoxicillin and clavulanic acid was always observed.

TI  == fibronectin and laminin binding of urogenital and oral prevotella species.
AB  == 88 strains of five prevotella species--p. bivia, p. buccae, p. disiens, p. oralis, and p. oris--were examined for their fibronectin and laminin binding properties with the aid of latex particle agglutination assays. beside single protein binding activities, all species showed strains that adhered to both fibronectin and laminin. the oral species, p. buccae, p. oralis, and p. oris were found to interact with laminin to a pronouncedly higher extent than with fibronectin. the urogenital species, p. bivia and p. disiens showed comparable activities of binding to fibronectin and laminin, with p. bivia exhibiting higher matrix protein binding rates than p. disiens. within the oral species group, p. oralis showed a higher percentage of fibronectin and laminin reactive strains than did p. buccae and p. oris. the finding of species-related different binding  properties may throw some light on the known differences in clinical relevance and pathogenicity of the urogenital species, p. bivia and p. disiens, but does so only in part concerning the oral species, p. buccae, p. oralis, and p. oris. moreover, the observed differences in matrix protein binding of prevotella species may have implications in chemotaxis and opsonization on the one hand and  maintenance of colonization activities under antibiotic therapy on the other.

TI  == chromosomal dna probes for the identification of bacteroides species.
AB  == we compared 22 bacteroides species by dna-dna homology studies using the s1 endonuclease method. none of the currently defined species shared more than 30% dna homology with any other species examined with the exception of b. buccae and  b. capillus (which along with b. pentosaceus are now considered a single species), which shared 86% of their dna sequences. two clusters showed weak genetic relationships, with dna homology greater than 10%. the first cluster included b. coporis, b. disiens, b. bivius, b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus. the second cluster included b. fragilis, b. eggerthii, b. ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron and b. uniformis. five of the oral species, b. asaccharolyticus, b. gingivalis, b. loescheii, b. intermedius and b. melanogenicus, were chosen for study as whole chromosomal probes in dot blot assays. these were tested against 243 clinical strains biochemically identified as bacteroides species. the dna probes correctly identified 94% of the clinical strains. dna probe and biochemical identification was 100% for two of the five species. in contrast, only 86% of the strains biochemically identified as b. intermedius were identified by the dna probe. the dna probes gave a species identification to seven strains which could not be biochemically identified.
