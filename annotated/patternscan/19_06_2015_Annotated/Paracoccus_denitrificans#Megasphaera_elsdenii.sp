TI  == spectral and electrochemical properties of glutaryl-coa dehydrogenase from paracoccus denitrificans.
AB  == studies of the spectral (uv/vis and resonance raman) and electrochemical properties of the fad-containing enzyme glutaryl-coa dehydrogenase (gcd) from paracoccus denitrificans reveal that the properties of the oxidized enzyme (gcdox) appear to be invariant from those properties known for other acyl-coa dehydrogenases such as mammalian general acyl-coa dehydrogenase (gacd) and butyryl-coa dehydrogenase (bcd) from megasphaera elsdenii. however, when either free or complexed gcd is reduced, its spectral and electrochemical behavior differs from that of both gacd and bcd. free gcd does not stabilize any form of one-electron-reduced gcd, but when gcd is complexed to its inhibitor, aceto-acetyl-coa, the enzyme stabilizes 20% of the blue neutral radical form of fad (fadh.) upon reduction. like gacd, when crotonyl-coa- (ccoa) bound gcd is reduced, the red anionic form of fad radical (fad.-) is stabilized, and excess reduction equivalents are necessary to effect full reduction of the complex. a comproportionation reaction is proposed between fully reduced crotonyl-coa-bound  gcd (gcd2e-ccoa) and gcdox-ccoa to partially explain the stabilization of gcd-bound fad.- by ccoa. when gcd is reduced by its optimal substrate, glutaryl-coa, a two-electron reduction is observed with concomitant formation of  a long-wavelength charge-transfer band. it is proposed that the etf specific for  gcd abstracts one electron from this charge-transfer species and this is followed by the decarboxylation of the oxidized substrate. at ph 6.4, potential values measured for free gcd and gcd bound to acetoacetyl-coa are -0.085 and -0.129 v, respectively. experimental evidence is given for a positive shift in the reduction potential of gcd when the enzyme is bound to a 1:1 mixture of butyryl-coa and ccoa. however, significant gcd hydratase activity is observed, preventing quantitation of the potential shift.
