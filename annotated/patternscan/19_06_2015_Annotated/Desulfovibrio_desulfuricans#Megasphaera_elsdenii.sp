TI  == biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  == twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt) within 24 h. butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, fibrobacter succinogenes, lactobacillus vitulinus, selenomonas ruminantium, streptococcus caprinus, and succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with <5% of the original tnt recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. eubacterium ruminantium, lactobacillus ruminis, ruminobacter amylophilus, streptococcus bovis, and wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/l tnt, with 23-60% of the tnt recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. clostridium polysaccharolyticum, megasphaera elsdenii, prevotella bryantii, prevotella ruminicola, ruminococcus albus, and ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/l tnt. desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, prevotella albensis, and treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the tnt. anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/l tnt. these results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming tnt.

TI  == raman spectra of flavin bound in flavodoxins and in other flavoproteins. evidence for structural variations in the flavin-binding region.
AB  == the resonance coherent anti-stokes raman scattering (cars) spectra for a number of flavoproteins are found to be fingerprints for the particular type of flavoprotein. one group studied were the bacterial flavodoxins: desulfovibrio vulgaris, desulfovibrio desulfuricans, azotobacter vinelandii, megasphaera elsdenii, clostridium kluyverii and clostridium formicoaceticum. the other examples were the enzymes lactate monooxygenase and glucose oxidase. fmn complexed to vibrio harveyi luciferase, and a partially characterized non-fluorescent flavoprotein from photobacterium leiognathi. in the frequency range 1700-1100 cm-1, differences in the frequency positions and relative intensities of the prominent bands are reflections of the interactions of the isoalloxazine ring with the protein. based on tentative assignment of the vibrational modes in flavin models, the spectra are interpreted in terms of hydrogen bonding between the amino acid residues of the binding site and particular atoms of the isoalloxazine ring.

TI  == transformation of mercuric chloride and methylmercury by the rumen microflora.
AB  == the microflora in strained rumen fluid did not methylate or volatilize 203hg2+ at detectable rates. however, there was an exponential decay in the concentration of added ch3hg+, which was attributed to demethylation. the major product of demethylation was metallic mercury (hg0), and it was released as a volatile product from the reaction mixture. demethylation occurred under both anaerobic and aerobic conditions. the rate of demethylation was proportional to the concentration of added ch3hg+-hg from 0.02 to 100 microgram of hg per ml. the presence of hgcl2 had almost no inhibitory effect on the rate of cleavage of the  carbon-mercury bond of ch2hgcl, but it completely inhibited volatilization of the hg formed, when the concentration of hgcl2-hg reached 100 micrograms/ml. three of 11 species of anaerobic rumen bacteria catalyzed demethylation. these were desulfovibrio desulfuricans, selenomonas ruminantium, and megasphaera elsdenii. none of the 11 species caused detectable methylation, and only two caused limited volatilization of hg2+. three species of bacteria out of 90 fresh aerobic isolates from rumen contents were demethylators: two were identified as pseudomonas sp., and the third was a micrococcus sp. demethylation by the rumen microflora appeared to be carried out by both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and, on the basis of hg2+ sensitivity, probably resulted from the activity of two enzymes, a ch3-hg+ hydrolase and a hg2+ reductase.
