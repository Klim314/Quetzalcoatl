TI  == cholesterol-lowering potentials of lactic acid bacteria based on bile-salt hydrolase activity and effect of potent strains on cholesterol metabolism in vitro and in vivo.
AB  == this study collected different probiotic isolates from animal and plant sources to evaluate the bile-salt hydrolase activity of probiotics in vitro. the deconjugation potential of bile acid was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. hepg2 cells were cultured with probiotic strains with high bsh activity. the triglyceride (tg) and apolipoprotein b (apo b) secretion by hepg2 cells were evaluated. our results show that the bsh activity and bile-acid deconjugation abilities of pediococcus acidilactici nbhk002, bifidobacterium adolescentis nbhk006, lactobacillus rhamnosus nbhk007, and lactobacillus acidophilus nbhk008 were higher than those of the other probiotic strains. the cholesterol concentration in cholesterol micelles was reduced within 24 h. nbhk007 reduced the tg secretion by 100% after 48 h of incubation. nbhk002, nbhk006, and nbhk007 could reduce apo b secretion by 33%, 38%, and 39%, respectively, after 24 h of incubation. the product probio s-23 produced a greater decrease in the total concentration of cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, tg, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance in the serum or livers of hamsters with hypercholesterolemia compared with that of hamsters fed with a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet. these results show that the three probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria are better candidates for reducing the  risk of cardiovascular disease.

TI  == antibodies to lactobacilli and bifidobacteria in young children with different propensity to develop islet autoimmunity.
AB  == the intestinal microbiota is essential to the maturation and homeostasis of the immune system. immunoblot assays were used to establish the prevalence of serum igg, igm, and iga antibodies specific for bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, and lactobacillus rhamnosus gg proteins in young children presenting with or without type 1 diabetes (t1d). we demonstrated that children between the ages of 6 and 12 months had a substantial increase in the frequency of igg antibodies specific for l. rhamnosus gg proteins. we measured igg, igm, and iga class antibody reactivity against b. adolescentis dsm 20083, b. adolescentis dsm 20086, and b. longum dsm 20088 proteins demonstrating significantly higher iga responses against b. adolescentis dsm 20083 strain proteins in children who developed islet autoimmunity and t1d later in life. b. adolescentis strains showed more igm type antibodies in children who developed t1d later in life, but the difference was not statistically significant. b. longum proteins were recognized by igg and iga antibodies to a higher extent compared to other bacteria studied. these results confirm that differences in immune reactivity against some commensal strains in young children may represent  a different risk factor for developing t1d.

TI  == genotoxicity assessment of multispecies probiotics using reverse mutation, mammalian chromosomal aberration, and rodent micronucleus tests.
AB  == genotoxicity assessment is carried out on freeze dried powder of cultured probiotics containing lactobacillus rhamnosus lcr177, bifidobacterium adolescentis ba286, and pediococcus acidilactici pa318. ames tests, in vitro mammalian chromosome aberration assay, and micronucleus tests in mouse peripheral blood are performed. for 5 strains of salmonella typhimurium, the ames tests show no increased reverse mutation upon exposure to the test substance. in cho cells,  the frequency of chromosome aberration does not increase in responding to the treatment of probiotics. likewise, the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes  in probiotics-fed mice is indistinguishable from that in the negative control group. taken together, the toxicity assessment studies suggest that the multispecies probiotic mixture does not have mutagenic effects on various organisms.

TI  == alterations in fecal lactobacillus and bifidobacterium species in type 2 diabetic patients in southern china population.
AB  == background: the connection between gut microbiota and metabolism and its role in  the pathogenesis of diabetes are increasingly recognized. the objective of this study was to quantitatively measure bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species, members of commensal bacteria found in human gut, in type 2 diabetic patients (t2d) patients from southern china. methods: fifty patients with t2d and thirty control individuals of similar body mass index (bmi) were recruited from southern china. t2d and control subjects were confirmed with both oral glucose tolerance test (ogtt) and hba(1c) measurements. bifidobacterium and lactobacillus species in feces were measured by real-time quantitative pcr. data were analyzed with stata 11.0 statistical software. results: in comparison to control subjects t2d patients had significantly more total lactobacillus (+18%), l. bugaricus (+13%),  l. rhamnosum (+37%) and l. acidophilus (+48%) (p < 0.05). in contrast, t2d patients had less amounts of total bifidobacteria (-7%) and b. adolescentis (-12%) (p < 0.05). cluster analysis showed that gut microbiota pattern of t2d patients is characterized by greater numbers of l. rhamnosus and l. acidophillus, together with lesser numbers of b. adolescentis (p < 0.05). conclusion: the gut microflora in t2d patients is characterized by greater numbers of lactobacillus and lesser numbers of bifidobacterium species.

TI  == early-life gut bacteria associate with il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma production at  two years of age.
AB  == microbial exposure early in life influences immune maturation and potentially also the development of immune-mediated disease. here we studied early-life gut colonization in relation to cytokine responses at two years of age. fecal samples were collected from infants during the first two months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, a group of lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as  well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus were detected with real time pcr. peripheral mononuclear cells were stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (pha) and numbers of il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma secreting cells were evaluated using elispot. we further stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants in vitro and assessed the il-4-, il-10- and ifn-gamma inducing capacity by flow cytometry and elisa. early s. aureus colonization associated with higher numbers  of il-4- (p = 0.022) and il-10 (p = 0.016) producing cells at two years of age. in contrast to colonization with s. aureus alone, co-colonization with lactobacilli associated with suppression of il-4- (p = 0.004), il-10- (p = 0.004) and ifn-gamma (p = 0.034) secreting cells. in vitro stimulations of mononuclear cells with bacterial supernatants supported a suppressive role of l. rhamnosus gg on s. aureus-induced cytokine responses. we demonstrate that the early gut colonization pattern associates with the pha-induced cytokine profile at two years of age and our in vitro findings support that specific bacterial species influence the t helper cell subsets. this suggests that dysbiosis in the early microbiota may modulate the risk of developing inflammatory conditions like allergy.

TI  == early colonization with a group of lactobacilli decreases the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.
AB  == background: microbial deprivation early in life can potentially influence immune  mediated disease development such as allergy. the aims of this study were to investigate the influence of parental allergy on the infant gut colonization and  associations between infant gut microbiota and allergic disease at five years of  age. methods and findings: fecal samples were collected from 58 infants, with allergic or non-allergic parents respectively, at one and two weeks as well as at one, two and twelve months of life. dna was extracted from the fecal samples and  real time pcr, using species-specific primers, was used for detection of bifidobacterium (b.) adolescentis, b. breve, b. bifidum, clostridium (c.) difficile, a group of lactobacilli (lactobacillus (l.) casei, l. paracasei and l. rhamnosus) as well as staphylococcus (s.) aureus. infants with non-allergic parents were more frequently colonized by lactobacilli compared to infants with allergic parents (p = 0.014). however, non-allergic five-year olds acquired lactobacilli more frequently during their first weeks of life, than their allergic counterparts, irrespectively of parental allergy (p = 0.009, p = 0.028). further the non-allergic children were colonized with lactobacilli on more occasions during the first two months of life (p = 0.038). also, significantly more non-allergic children were colonized with b. bifidum at one week of age than the children allergic at five years (p = 0.048). conclusion: in this study we show that heredity for allergy has an impact on the gut microbiota in infants but also that early lactobacilli (l. casei, l. paracasei, l. rhamnosus) colonization  seems to decrease the risk for allergy at five years of age despite allergic heredity.

TI  == development and pilot evaluation of a novel probiotic mixture for the management  of seasonal allergic rhinitis.
AB  == microbial exposure may direct the immune system away from allergic-type responses, but until now probiotic interventions have had limited success in the  prevention and treatment of allergic diseases. in this study, a novel probiotic mixture was specifically created based on preliminary in vitro investigations on  pollen-induced immune responses. a mixture with lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and  a novel fecal bifidobacterium adolescentis isolate was formulated into a yogurt and tested for its effects in 36 subjects with allergic rhinitis over 2 pollen seasons in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. the new formulation was well tolerated, but did not have significant effects on the quality of life scores, use of antihistamines, or eosinophil cationic protein concentration in nasal lavage. however, at the end of the grass pollen season, serum il-10 and il-12 levels were increased in the probiotic group compared to the controls. during the ragweed season, the serum tgf-&beta; levels were significantly higher in the probiotic group than in the controls. in conclusion, the novel probiotic formulation had potentially desirable effects on the cytokine profile of patients with allergic rhinitis, but provided few clinical benefits. the study highlights  the challenges in designing efficient immunomodulatory probiotic therapies based  upon in vitro findings.

TI  == altered early infant gut microbiota in children developing allergy up to 5 years  of age.
AB  == background: early colonization with bifidobacteria and lactobacilli is postulated to protect children from allergy, while clostridium (c.) difficile colonization might be associated with allergic disease. previous studies of infant gut microbiota in relation to subsequent allergy development have mostly employed culture-dependent techniques, studied genera of bacteria and the follow-up period was limited to 2 years. objective: to relate gut microbiota in early infancy, notably bifidobacteria and lactobacilli at species level, to allergy development  during the first 5 years of life and study if environmental factors influence the early infant gut microbiota. methods: fecal samples were collected at 1 week, 1 month and 2 months after birth from 47 swedish infants, followed prospectively to 5 years of age. bacterial dna was analysed with real-time pcr and related to allergy development, family size as well as endotoxin and fel d 1 levels in house dust samples. primers binding to c. difficile, four species of bifidobacteria, two lactobacilli groups and bacteroides fragilis were used. children regarded as  allergic manifested allergic symptoms and were skin prick test positive during their first 5 years while non-allergic children were neither. results: children who developed allergy were significantly less often colonized with lactobacilli group i (lactobacillus (l.) rhamnosus, l. casei, l. paracasei), bifidobacterium adolescentis and c. difficile during their first 2 months. infants colonized with several bifidobacterium species had been exposed to higher amounts of endotoxin and grew up in larger families than infants harbouring few species. conclusion: a more diverse gut microbiota early in life might prevent allergy development and may be related to the previously suggested inverse relationship between allergy,  family size and endotoxin exposure.

TI  == effect of maternal consumption of lactobacillus gg on transfer and establishment  of fecal bifidobacterial microbiota in neonates.
AB  == background: establishment of the gut microbiota at birth provides a substantial source of microbial stimuli for the maturation of the immune system. deviations in this process precede the development of specific diseases providing the rationale for the use of probiotics to counteract them. objective: this study was designed to characterize both the mother-infant bifidobacteria transfer at birth  and the development of bifidobacteria microbiota during the first weeks of life in infants whose mothers received lactobacillus rhamnosus gg or placebo. methods: species-specific pcr was used to assess the fecal bifidobacterial composition of  mothers before and after delivery and in infants at 5 days and 3 weeks of age. results: bifidobacterium longum was the species most commonly found in the mothers. bifidobacterium catenulatum was the most prevalent group in infants at 5 days of age and b. longum the predominant species at 3 weeks. at 5 days of age, infants whose mothers received l. rhamnosus gg showed a significantly higher occurrence of b. breve and lower of b. adolescentis than those from the placebo group. in addition, l. rhamnosus gg consumption increased the bifidobacterial diversity in infants and reduced the bifidobacterium microbiota similarity between mother and infant. conclusions: these results indicate that specific changes in the transfer and initial establishment of bifidobacteria in neonates take place as consequence of the consumption of l. rhamnosus gg by the mothers.

TI  == absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium.
AB  == to investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus gasseri, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium longum, lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. the production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by hplc analysis in growing cultures. resting whole cells from a positive control strain, eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of  .2 mm cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at ph 7.3. however, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. in growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by e. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. none of the test strains showed production of either  deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
