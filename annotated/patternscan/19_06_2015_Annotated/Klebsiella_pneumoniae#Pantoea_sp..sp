TI  == effects of ensiling fermentation and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community in italian ryegrass, guinea grass, and whole-crop maize silages stored  at high moisture content.
AB  == the effects of storage period and aerobic deterioration on the bacterial community were examined in italian ryegrass (ir), guinea grass (gg), and whole-crop maize (wm) silages. direct-cut forages were stored in a laboratory silo for 3, 7, 14, 28, 56, and 120 d without any additives; live counts, content  of fermentation products, and characteristics of the bacterial community were determined. 2,3-butanediol, acetic acid, and lactic acid were the dominant fermentation products in the ir, gg, and wm silages, respectively. the acetic acid content increased as a result of prolonged ensiling, regardless of the type  of silage crop, and the changes were distinctively visible from the beginning of  gg ensiling. pantoea agglomerans, rahnella aquatilis, and enterobacter sp. were the major bacteria in the ir silage, indicating that alcoholic fermentation may be due to the activity of enterobacteria. staphylococcus sciuri and bacillus pumilus were detected when ir silage was spoiled, whereas between aerobically stable and unstable silages, no differences were seen in the bacterial community  at silo opening. lactococcus lactis was a representative bacterium, although acetic acid was the major fermentation product in the gg silage. lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus brevis, and morganella morganii were suggested to be associated with the increase in acetic acid due to prolonged storage. enterobacter cloacae appeared when the gg silage was spoiled. in the wm silage, no distinctive changes due to prolonged ensiling were seen in the bacterial community. throughout the ensiling, weissella paramesenteroides, weissella confusa, and klebsiella pneumoniae were present in addition to l. plantarum, l. brevis, and l. lactis. upon deterioration, acetobacter pasteurianus, klebsiella variicola, enterobacter hormaechei, and bacillus gibsonii were detected. these results demonstrate the diverse bacterial community that evolves during ensiling  and aerobic spoilage of ir, gg, and wm silages.

TI  == nature of bacteria found on some wards in sultan qaboos university hospital, oman.
AB  == this study aims to determine what objects lying in the hospital environment or brought in from outside contribute to the introduction of bacteria associated with nosocomial infections. one hundred swab specimens collected from children's  toys, sinks, door handles, telephone handsets and flowers brought into the hospital were plated on different culture media. colonial growth on the media was purified and identified subsequently using standard bacteriological methods. of the 100 samples cultured, 61 (61%) grew a range of bacteria including pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=14, 23.0%), acinetobacter spp. (n=13, 21.3%), serratia spp. (n=9, 14.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=9, 14.7%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n=4, 6.6%), staphylococcus aureus (n=4, 6.6%), enterobacter cloacae (n=3, 4.9%), pantoea sp. (n=2, 3.3%), chryseobacterium sp. (n=2, 3.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (n=1, 1.6%). although all the serratia, enterobacter, klebsiella and pantoea species isolates showed varying degrees of resistance to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, cefuroxime and cefotaxime, all were resistant to ampicillin. chryseobacterium and stenotrophomonas species isolates were resistant to amikacin, imipenem, gentamicin and ceftazidime, to which only three isolates of pseudomonas species were resistant. all the staphylococcal isolates were susceptible to methicillin. although there has been no major outbreak of a nosocomial infection in the hospital, it is strongly recommended that effective control measures (e.g., sampling the hospital water supply, disinfecting children's toys, use of appropriate hand washing and checking some of the disinfectants for presence of bacteria) are needed. these measures are necessary  to ensure that the antibiotic-resistant strains identified in this study are not  allowed to spread in the hospital.

TI  == confirmation of e. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  == paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. some are rich in wood  fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their  coliform microflora. therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. for the first series of analyses, the medium used was colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to  isolate bacteria in pure culture on macconkey agar. in a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase  activities, were used to isolate bacteria. first, the presence of thermotolerant  coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 mpn/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. from this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on macconkey medium and identified as citrobacter freundii, enterobacter sp, e. sakazakii, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, k. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, k. pneumoniae subsp.  ozaenae, k. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, pantoea sp, raoultella terrigena, r. planticola. second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 mpn/g (d.w) sludge, whereas e. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 mpn/g (d.w.) sludge. the presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and e. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in  large quantities. also, indigenous e. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated e. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. in this second series of isolations, api20e and biolog identified most isolates as e. coli, but others remained unidentified. the sequences of the 16s rdna confirmed that most isolates were likely e. coli, few burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. this study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.

TI  == microbiology of choledochal bile in patients with choledocholithiasis admitted to a tertiary hospital.
AB  == aim: the present study was designed to investigate the microbiology of choledochal bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis. methods: we identified and determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis diagnosed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp). results: nineteen (82.6%) of 23 patients with choledocholithiasis had positive bile cultures. a single agent was detected in 11 patients (57.9%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to three species, were seen in eight patients (42.1%). patients with clinical manifestations of cholangitis had significantly higher counts of colonies per ml of bile (> 105 cfu/ml). the predominant gram-negative aerobic bacteria isolated were escherichia coli (9, 31.0%), klebsiella pneumoniae (5, 17.2%), enterobacter cloacae (2, 6.9%), pantoea agglomerans (1, 3.4%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 3.4%). the predominant gram-positive bacteria were enterococcus faecalis (5, 17.2%) and streptococcus sp. (5, 17.2%). bacteroides fragilis was isolated in one patient with mixed growth. all gram-positive bacteria isolated in bile were sensitive to ampicillin, and all gram-negative bacteria isolated were sensitive to gentamicin with a minimum inhibitory concentration (cim90) ranging from 0.5 to 1.0- micro g/ml. gram-negative bacteria were also sensitive to imipenem, fluorquinolones, second and third generation cephalosporins. although all five isolates of e. faecalis were sensitive to ampicillin, two of five (40%) e. faecalis isolates demonstrated high levels of resistance to gentamicin. conclusion: e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. faecalis and streptoccocus sp. were the most common bacteria isolated in the bile of patients with cholangitis and choledocholithiasis, which were sensitive to a simple therapeutic regimen, such as the combination of ampicilin and gentamicin.
