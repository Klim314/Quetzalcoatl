TI  == classification, identification, and clinical significance of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with host specificity for humans.
AB  == the aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive update on the current classification and identification of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species with exclusive or predominant host specificity for humans. haemophilus influenzae and  some of the other haemophilus species are commonly encountered in the clinical microbiology laboratory and demonstrate a wide range of pathogenicity, from life-threatening invasive disease to respiratory infections to a nonpathogenic, commensal lifestyle. new species of haemophilus have been described (haemophilus  pittmaniae and haemophilus sputorum), and the new genus aggregatibacter was created to accommodate some former haemophilus and actinobacillus species (aggregatibacter aphrophilus, aggregatibacter segnis, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). aggregatibacter species are now a dominant etiology of infective endocarditis caused by fastidious organisms (hacek endocarditis), and a. aphrophilus has emerged as an important cause of brain abscesses. correct identification of haemophilus and aggregatibacter species based on phenotypic characterization can be challenging. it has become clear that 15 to 20% of presumptive h. influenzae isolates from the respiratory tracts of healthy individuals do not belong to this species but represent nonhemolytic variants of  haemophilus haemolyticus. due to the limited pathogenicity of h. haemolyticus, the proportion of misidentified strains may be lower in clinical samples, but even among invasive strains, a misidentification rate of 0.5 to 2% can be found.  several methods have been investigated for differentiation of h. influenzae from  its less pathogenic relatives, but a simple method for reliable discrimination is not available. with the implementation of identification by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry, the more rarely encountered species of haemophilus and aggregatibacter will increasingly be identified in clinical microbiology practice. however, identification of some strains will still be problematic, necessitating dna sequencing of multiple housekeeping gene fragments or full-length 16s rrna genes.

TI  == reclassification of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus and haemophilus segnis as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans gen. nov., comb. nov., aggregatibacter aphrophilus comb. nov. and aggregatibacter segnis comb. nov., and emended description of aggregatibacter aphrophilus to include v factor-dependent and v factor-independent isolates.
AB  == the aim of this study was to reinvestigate the relationships and the generic affiliations of the species actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus, haemophilus paraphrophilus and haemophilus segnis. the nicotinamide  phosphoribosyltransferase gene (nadv) conferring v factor-independent growth was  identified in haemophilus aphrophilus. the gene encodes a polypeptide of 462 amino acids that shows 74.5 % amino acid sequence identity to the corresponding enzyme from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. ten isolates of haemophilus paraphrophilus all carried a nadv pseudogene. dna from haemophilus aphrophilus was able to transform haemophilus paraphrophilus into the nad-independent phenotype. the transformants carried a full-length nadv inserted in the former locus of the pseudogene. the dna-dna relatedness between the type strains of haemophilus aphrophilus and haemophilus paraphrophilus was 77 %. we conclude that the division into two species haemophilus aphrophilus and haemophilus paraphrophilus is not justified and that haemophilus paraphrophilus should be considered a later heterotypic synonym of haemophilus aphrophilus. forty strains  of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus and haemophilus  segnis were investigated by multilocus sequence analysis. the 40 strains form a monophyletic group clearly separate from other evolutionary lineages of the family pasteurellaceae. we propose the transfer of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, haemophilus aphrophilus and haemophilus segnis to a new genus aggregatibacter gen. nov. as aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans comb. nov. (the type species; type strain atcc 33384(t)=ccug 13227(t)=cip 52.106(t)=dsm 8324(t)=nctc 9710(t)), aggregatibacter aphrophilus comb. nov. (type strain atcc 33389(t)=ccug 3715(t)=cip 70.73(t)=nctc 5906(t)) and aggregatibacter segnis comb. nov. (type strain hk316(t)=atcc 33393(t)=ccug 10787(t)=ccug 12838(t)=cip 103292(t)=nctc 10977(t)). the species of the genus aggregatibacter are independent of x factor and variably dependent on v factor for growth in vitro.
