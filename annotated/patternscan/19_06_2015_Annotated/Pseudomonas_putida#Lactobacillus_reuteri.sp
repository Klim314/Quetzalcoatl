TI  == the production of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid using fatty acid metabolism and cofactor optimization in escherichia coli.
AB  == hydroxylated fatty acids (hfas) are used as important precursors for bulk and fine chemicals in the chemical industry. here, to overproduce long-chain (c16-c18) fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acid, their biosynthetic pathways including thioesterase (lreu_0335) from lactobacillus reuteri dsm20016, beta-hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase (fabz) from escherichia coli, and a p450 system  (i.e., cyp153a from marinobacter aquaeolei vt8 and cama/camb from pseudomonas putida atcc17453) were overexpressed. acyl-coa synthase (fadd) involved in fatty  acid degradation by beta-oxidation was also deleted in e. coli bw25113. the engineered e. coli ffa4 strain without the p450 system could produce 503.0 mg/l of palmitic (c16) and 508.4 mg/l of stearic (c18) acids, of which the amounts are ca. 1.6- and 2.3-fold higher than those of the wild type. on the other hand, the  e. coli hfa4 strain including the p450 system for omega-hydroxylation could produce 211.7 mg/l of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, which was 42.1 +/- 0.1 % of the generated palmitic acid, indicating that the hydroxylation reaction was the rate-determining step for the hfa production. for the maximum production of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid, nadh, i.e., an essential cofactor for p450 reaction, was overproduced by the integration of nad+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (fdh) from candida boidinii into e. coli chromosome and the deletion of alcohol dehydrogenase (adh). finally, the nadh-level-optimized e. coli strain produced 610 mg/l of omega-hydroxy palmitic acid (omega-hpa), which was almost a threefold increase in its yield compared to the same strain without nadh overproduction.
