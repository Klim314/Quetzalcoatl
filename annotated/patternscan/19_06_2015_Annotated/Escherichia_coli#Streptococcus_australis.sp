TI  == tetab46, a predicted heterodimeric abc transporter conferring tetracycline resistance in streptococcus australis isolated from the oral cavity.
AB  == objectives: to identify the genes responsible for tetracycline resistance in a strain of streptococcus australis isolated from pooled saliva from healthy volunteers in france. s. australis is a viridans streptococcus, originally isolated from the oral cavity of children in australia, and subsequently reported in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and as a cause of invasive disease in an elderly patient. methods: agar containing 2 mg/l tetracycline was used for the isolation of tetracycline-resistant organisms. a genomic library in escherichia coli was used to isolate the tetracycline resistance determinant. in-frame deletions and chromosomal repair were used to confirm function. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by agar dilution and disc diffusion assay. results: the tetracycline resistance determinant from s. australis frstet12 was isolated from a genomic library in e. coli and dna sequencing showed two open reading frames predicted to encode proteins with similarity to multidrug resistance-type  abc transporters. both genes were required for tetracycline resistance (to both the naturally occurring and semi-synthetic tetracyclines) and they were designated tetab(46). conclusions: this is the first report of a predicted abc transporter conferring tetracycline resistance in a member of the oral microbiota.

TI  == leptospirae of serotype lora of the serogroup australis isolated for the first time from swine in the netherlands.
AB  == leptospirosis in swine, caused by serotype lora (serogroup australis) was detected both serologically and by culture. the most important symptoms consisted in abortion during the final month of gestation and the birth of dead or not viable piglets.
