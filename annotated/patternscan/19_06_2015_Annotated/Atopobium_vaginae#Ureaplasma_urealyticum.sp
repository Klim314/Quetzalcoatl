TI  == sensitive detection of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents using multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is characterized by a polymicrobial proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and depletion of lactobacilli, which are components of natural vaginal microbiota. currently, there are limited conventional methods for bv diagnosis, and these methods are time-consuming, expensive, and rarely allow for  the detection of more than one agent simultaneously. therefore, we conceived and  validated a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (m-pcr) assay for the simultaneous screening of thirteen bacterial vaginosis-associated agents (bv-aas) related to symptomatic bv: gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, bacteroides fragilis, mycoplasma hominis, atopobium vaginae, ureaplasma urealyticum, megasphaera type i, clostridia-like bacteria vaginosis-associated bacteria (bvabs) 1, 2, and 3, sneathia sanguinegens, and mycoplasma genitalium. the overall validation parameters of m-pcr compared to single pcr (spcr) were extremely high, including agreement of 99.1% and sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of 100.0%, negative predictive value of 97.0%, accuracy of 99.3%, and agreement with nugent results of 100.0%. the prevalence of bv-aas was very high (72.6%), and simultaneous agents were detected in 53.0%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the m-pcr assay. therefore, the m-pcr assay has great potential to impact bv diagnostic methods in vaginal samples and  diminish associated complications in the near future.

TI  == bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling.
AB  == objectives: sexually transmitted infections are a significant cause of genital disease, infertility and hospital admissions. the economic impact is high. an accurate diagnosis is often difficult and time consuming. we report the development and validation of a novel bead-based multiplex sexually transmitted infection profiling (stip) assay that detects 18 sexually transmitted infections  using a multiplex pcr followed by luminex bead-based hybridisation. methods: stip was validated using urogenital samples pretested by commercially available quantitative pcr, microscopy or by culturing methods. results: stip specifically  detects chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, treponema pallidum,  trichomonas vaginalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, mycoplasma (m.) genitalium, m. hominis, m. pneumonia, m. spermatophilum, ureaplasma urealyticum and u. parvum, and quantifies bacterial vaginosis-associated atopobium vaginae and gardnerella vaginalis as well as three candida species and normal genital flora-associated lactobacillus species. stip reached an overall concordance of 95-100% with commercially available quantitative pcr tests. compared to nugent score, stip reached a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 86% for bacterial vaginosis detection. candida specimens, pretested by direct culturing, were identified with a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99%. conclusions: stip is a powerful high-throughput tool in assessing a broad spectrum of urogenital infections.

TI  == clinical characteristics of bacterial vaginosis among women testing positive for  fastidious bacteria.
AB  == objectives: as the aetiology of bacterial vaginosis (bv) is not well understood,  this study sought to determine the relationships between several fastidious microbes, bv and selected clinical characteristics of bv. methods: endometrial and cervical specimens from 50 women with non-gonococcal, non-chlamydial endometritis were tested for leptotrichia sanguinegens/amnionii, atopobium vaginae, bacterial vaginosis-associated bacteria 1 (bvab1), ureaplasma urealyticum biovar 2 (uu-2) and ureaplasma parvum using pcr. bv was categorised using nugent's and amsel's criteria. odds ratios (or) adjusted for age and race were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. results: although elevated ph was a universal feature, other bv characteristics differed by pathogen, suggesting variable clinical presentation. only uu-2 was strongly associated with vaginal discharge, but a positive whiff test and a 20% or greater classification of epithelial cells as clue cells were more common among women with l sanguinegens/amnionii, a vaginae and bvab1. for each of these bacteria, there were trends towards associations with bv defined by amsel's criteria (l sanguinegens/amnionii or 2.9, 95% ci 0.5 to 15.7; a vaginae or 2.6, 95% ci 0.6 to 11.4; bvab1 or 5.7, 95% ci 1.0 to 31.1) and significant associations with bv defined by gram stain (l sanguinegens/amnionii or 17.7, 95% ci 2.8 to 113.0; a vaginae or 19.2, 95% ci 3.7 to 98.7; bvab1 or 21.1, 95% ci 2.2 to 198.5). conclusions: l sanguinegens/amnionii, a vaginae and bvab1 are associated with clinical characteristics consistent with bv and bv defined by nugent's and amsel's criteria. these fastidious bacteria may cause unrecognised infection, as  none was associated with abnormal vaginal discharge.

TI  == molecular quantification of gardnerella vaginalis and atopobium vaginae loads to  predict bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == background: bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a poorly detected public health problem that is associated with preterm delivery and for which no reliable diagnostic tool exists. methods: molecular analysis of 231 vaginal samples, classified by gram stain-based nugent score, was used to propose molecular criteria for bv; these criteria were prospectively applied to 56 new samples. a quantitative molecular tool targeting 8 bv-related microorganisms and a human gene was developed using a specific real-time polymerase chain reaction assay and serial dilutions of a plasmid suspension. the targeted microorganisms were gardnerella vaginalis, lactobacillus species, mobiluncus curtisii, mobiluncus mulieris, and candida albicans (which can be identified by gram staining), as well as atopobium vaginae, mycoplasma hominis, and ureaplasma urealyticum (which cannot be detected by gram staining). results: with use of the nugent score, 167 samples were classified as normal, 20 were classified as bv, and 44 were classified as intermediate. except for u. urealyticum, m. mulieris, and lactobacillus species,  dna of the tested bacteria was detected more frequently in samples demonstrating  bv, but the predictive value of such detection was low. the molecular quantification of a. vaginae (dna level, > or = 10(8) copies/ml) and g. vaginalis (dna level, > or = 10(9) copies/ml) had the highest predictive value for the diagnosis of bv, with excellent sensitivity (95%), specificity (99%), and positive (95%) and negative (99%) predictive values; 25 (57%) of the samples demonstrating intermediate flora had a bv profile. when applied prospectively, our molecular criteria had total positive and negative predictive values of 96% and 99%, respectively. conclusions: we report a highly reproducible, quantitative tool to objectively analyze vaginal flora that uses cutoff values for the concentrations of a. vaginae and g. vaginalis to establish the molecular diagnosis of bv.
