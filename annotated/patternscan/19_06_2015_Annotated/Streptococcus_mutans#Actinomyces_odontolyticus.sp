TI  == antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

TI  == degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  == purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was  measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper  prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and  excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex  pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa)  identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

TI  == bacterial composition and red fluorescence of plaque in relation to primary and secondary caries next to composite: an in situ study.
AB  == background/hypothesis: secondary caries has been suggested as the main reason for restoration replacement. we hypothesized that more caries-associated bacteria are found on composite resin restoration material, compared to sound tooth tissue. methods: both restored and unrestored dentin and enamel samples were placed in a  full denture of eight subjects for 20 weeks. the microbiological composition of approximal plaque and the association between caries-associated bacteria and red  autofluorescence of dental plaque was studied. every 4 weeks the specimens were microradiographed using transversal wavelength independent microradiography (t-wim). after 1 and 20 weeks red fluorescence pictures and plaque samples were taken. samples were cultured for total anaerobic counts, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, candida and actinomyces odontolyticus. results: lesion depth in the dentin and enamel was positively associated with lactobacilli, and lesion depth in dentin was positively associated with a. odontolyticus, whereas no association was found between mutans streptococci and lesion depth. the red-fluorescent bacteria a. odontolyticus and lactobacilli did not correlate with red-fluorescent plaque, indicating that red fluorescence is probably not caused by a single species of these bacteria. after 20 weeks, a higher proportion of combined mutans streptococci and lactobacilli was found on restored tissue compared to non-restored tissue (p = 0.04). conclusion: the higher proportion of caries-associated bacteria on restored tissue indicates that the ecology on the surface of primary lesions differs from that on lesions next to composite, and that secondary caries next to composite may differ from the primary caries process.

TI  == the effect of antibacterial monomer mdpb on the growth of organisms associated with root caries.
AB  == mdpb, 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide, was tested for its ability to  inhibit the growth of organisms associated with active root caries lesions and to modify the growth characteristics of these organisms at sub-mics. mics and mbcs of mdpb for independent isolates (n=5) of the following taxa: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces gerensceriae, actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus spp., and candida albicans were determined, and the effects at sub-mic on microbial growth kinetics were assessed. all isolates were sensitive to inhibition by mdpb. the median mics and mbcs of mdpb for these organisms were  in the range of 3.13 to 25.0 microg/ml and 6.25 to 50.0 microg/ml, respectively.  as for the influence of ph, inhibition was sensitive to acidic ph. even at sub-mics, the growth of all strains, measured as cell yield and doubling time, was significantly reduced. based on the results of this study, mdpb exhibited the potential to inhibit the growth of microbiota associated with active root caries  lesions.

TI  == effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  == dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. recent literature has demonstrated that infrared co(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. in this study, a xecl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (summit technology, boston, usa). both aerobe (streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii) and  anaerobe microorganisms (a. odontolyticus, prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. according to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 j/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 hz were used for all irradiations. colony-forming units  after laser irradiation were counted. excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. as compared to s. mutans and s. sanguis, a. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both  aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. new studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other  wavelengths or conventional therapies.

TI  == [analysis of oral microflora early colonized in infants].
AB  == objective: to observe the dynamic changes of oral microflora early colonized in infants. methods: the oral swab samples for the study were taken in 1 day, 1, 3,  6, 9, 12 months after birth from 12 healthy neonates. by choosing suitable diluted concentration, the samples were incubated aerobically, facultative anaerobically and anaerobically. the strains were identified by observing colony  characteristics, gram staining and biochemical tests. results: s. salivarius was  the most frequent microflora, followed by s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii and s. mutans occurred in oral cavity after tooth eruption. veillonella spp. can be detected in oral cavity of 1-month-old babies, a. odontolyticus was isolated from 8.3% infants of more than 3 months old. l. acidophilus maintained the lower prevalence in oral cavity of babies. leptotrichia buccalis and capnocytophaga spp. occurred in oral cavity of some dentate infants. conclusion: s. solivarius and s. mitis are predominant species in oral cavity of the infants, veillonella spp. is the first and the most anaerobic species appeared in oral cavity of healthy babies. a. odontolyticus is the first actinomyces detected in oral cavity. with the increasing months, kind and amount of microflora increase dramatically.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == red light kills bacteria via photodynamic action.
AB  == with the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. we report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the  optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. in particular, the pathogenic gram-positive porphyrin producing atcc strains propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces odontolyticus and porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin ix. in addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mw/cm2 light intensity and 360 j/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. the survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/-  0.10 in porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. no photoeffect was found for the bacterium streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species prevotella intermedia. taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  == the distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque  to facilitate sampling. about 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (a), to the side of (s), and below (b) the contact area. plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. an average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. streptococcus and actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. the predominant actinomyces and streptococcal species at most  subsites were a. naeslundii and strep. mitis biovar i. a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite b (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and a. israelii at subsite s (66.7%) strep. mitis 1 and strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite s (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas strep mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. gordonii and veillonella spp. were  recovered most commonly from subsite b (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). the isolation frequencies of strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite b (a b p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites b and s (a < b, p > 0.01;  b > s, p < 0.05), while neisseria spp. were most common at subsite a (a > b. p >  0.03). igal protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total streptococcus population. this study  has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. the population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the  location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area b.

TI  == the microflora associated with the development of initial enamel decalcification  below orthodontic bands in vivo in children living in a fluoridated-water area.
AB  == thirty-four caries-free teeth destined for orthodontic extraction were banded to  provide a protected area for the accumulation of plaque. the teeth were extracted at one, two, four, eight, and 14 days after being banded, and samples of the flora below the band were analyzed for the presence of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus 'mitior', 'mutans streptococci', actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces  naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, lactobacillus species, and veillonella. after plaque sampling, the teeth were sent to the royal dental college (copenhagen) for histological analysis. the results showed that s. mutans could colonize the area below the band after one day, but that colonization was only 100% at 14 days. lactobacillus was only isolated from 2/8 samples at four days and from 4/8 samples at 14 days. s. sanguis and 's. mitior' were regularly isolated at all banding times, and veillonella was isolated from all samples. a.  viscosus was the most commonly isolated actinomyces. the numbers of streptococcus and veillonella were significantly higher at day 1 than at day 14 (p less than 0.05). s. mutans and a. viscosus were isolated more frequently at day 14 than at  day 1 (p less than 0.01). histological examination revealed that dissolution of the enamel below a band could occur after two days, but that even after 14 days dissolution could be questionable. dissolution was detected in areas where s. mutans was not isolated (8/34), but s. mutans was also present in samples showing dissolution (12/34). there was no relationship between dissolution and the numbers of s. mutans; however, the isolation frequency of s. mutans was associated with dissolution (p less than 0.05).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == an in vitro study of the antibacterial and antifungal properties of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with disinfectant.
AB  == the difficulties associated with the disinfection of alginate (irreversible hydrocolloid) materials have resulted in the development of an irreversible hydrocolloid impression material impregnated with an antimicrobial compound, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride. this investigation assessed the antibacterial  and antifungal properties in vitro of this innovative irreversible hydrocolloid material by using the agar well technique. the microorganisms used were pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus odontolyticus rodriguez, actinomyces odontolyticus, mixed salivary  organisms, and candida albicans. the results showed an absence of activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. varying degrees of antibacterial activity were exhibited against the other microorganisms. it is concluded that it is not know whether the limited antibacterial and antifungal effect demonstrated in this study is sufficient to prevent bacterial and fungal colonization of the impression surface in the mouth during clinical practice.

TI  == effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  == physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion  to intact dental tissue slabs. in addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, a. viscosus, and a. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mj.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in  the physiological buffer. the surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased  upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. the adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was  lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some  bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.

TI  == intergeneric bacterial coaggregations involving mutans streptococci and oral actinomyces.
AB  == mutans streptococci (ms) representing eight different serotypes were tested for their ability to coaggregate in vitro with oral actinomyces and other streptococcal species. of the mutans streptococci tested, only strains of s. cricetus (formerly s. mutans serotype a) displayed pronounced coaggregations and  only with certain strains of actinomyces. s. cricetus coaggregated, by lactose nonreversible mechanisms, with serotype 4 actinomyces naeslundii wvu963 and wvu924 and with serotype 2 actinomyces odontolyticus wvu758. the first pair was disaggregated by protein denaturants (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea) and  edta. this coaggregation was inhibited when the streptococcal, but not the actinomyces, partner was pretreated with either heat or protease, suggesting the  presence of a protein mediator on only the streptococcal cell surface. the s. cricetus-a. odontolyticus coaggregation appeared to involve protein components on each cell, as shown by the lack of coaggregation after pretreatment of either cell type with heat or proteases. this coaggregation was also reversed by sodium  dodecyl sulfate and urea, as well as by sodium deoxycholate, but not by edta. the data indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in each of these coaggregations.

TI  == bacterial profiles of subgingival plaques in periodontitis.
AB  == in this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. the patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. the bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, a. odontolyticus and  s. mutans and significantly lower proportions of b. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. the spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (ap) patients,  averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. the bacteriological results could not distinguish between ada type iii and iv periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any ap patient. the patients designated as early onset periodontitis (eop) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of bacteroides gingivalis and/or b. intermedius. two types of eop were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. four localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients were notable in not having detectable a. actinomycetemcomitans. the data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of ljp are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent b. gingivalis and b. intermedius.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of plaque on removable dentures in patients with healthy oral mucosa.
AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.
