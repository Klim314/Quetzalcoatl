TI  == antiparasitic chaiyaphumines from entomopathogenic xenorhabdus sp. pb61.4.
AB  == a new class of four depsipentapeptides called chaiyaphumines a-d (1-4) was isolated from xenorhabdus sp. pb61.4. their structures were elucidated by detailed 1d and 2d nmr experiments and by a marfey's analysis following flash hydrolysis of the peptide. verification of the structure was achieved by three-dimensional modeling using noe-derived distance constraints, molecular dynamics, and energy minimization. chaiyaphumine a (1) showed good activity against plasmodium falciparum (ic50 of 0.61 mum), the causative agent of malaria, and was active against other protozoal tropical disease causing agents.

TI  == genetic analysis of xenocoumacin antibiotic production in the mutualistic bacterium xenorhabdus nematophila.
AB  == xenocoumacin 1 (xcn1) and xenocoumacin 2 (xcn2) are the major antimicrobial compounds produced by xenorhabdus nematophila. to study the role of xcn1 and xcn2 in the life cycle of x. nematophila the 14 gene cluster (xcna-n) required for their synthesis was identified. overlap rt-pcr analysis identified six major xcn  transcripts. individual inactivation of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase genes, xcna and xcnk, and polyketide synthetase genes, xcnf, xcnh and xcnl, eliminated xcn1 production. xcn1 levels and expression of xcna-l were increased in an ompr strain while xcn2 levels and xcnmn expression were reduced. xcn1 production was also increased in a strain lacking acetyl-phosphate that can donate phosphate groups to ompr. together these findings suggest that ompr-phosphate negatively regulates xcna-l gene expression while positively regulating xcnmn expression. hplc-ms analysis revealed that xcn1 was produced first and was subsequently converted to xcn2. inactivation of xcnm and xcnn eliminated conversion of xcn1 to xcn2 resulting in elevated xcn1 production. the  viability of the xcnm strain was reduced 20-fold relative to the wild-type strain supporting the idea that conversion of xcn1 to xcn2 provides a mechanism to avoid self-toxicity. interestingly, inactivation of ompr enhanced cell viability during prolonged culturing.

TI  == two novel insect defensins from larvae of the cupreous chafer, anomala cuprea: purification, amino acid sequences and antibacterial activity.
AB  == a humoral immune response in larvae of the coleopteran insect, anomala cuprea has been examined for exploring the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions. the antibacterial activity against the gram-positive strain, micrococcus luteus was detected at a low level in absence of injection. the activity increased strikingly in the hemolymph of the larvae challenged with escherichia coli, showing the fluctuating profile through a time course, which consists of the static induction phase, the production phase rising to a maximum level, and the reduction phase extending over a long duration. two peptides were purified and characterized by reverse-phase hplc, edman degradation and mass spectrometry. they were isoforms, composed of similar sequences with two amino acid substitutions in 43 residues, and novel members of the insect defensins, cysteine-rich antibacterial peptides. anomala defensins a and b showed potent activity against gram-positive bacteria, with slight differences in activity against a few strains of tested bacteria. anomala defensin b was active at high concentration of 40 microm against the gram-negative strain, xenorhabdus japonicus, a pathogen toward the host, a. cuprea larvae.
