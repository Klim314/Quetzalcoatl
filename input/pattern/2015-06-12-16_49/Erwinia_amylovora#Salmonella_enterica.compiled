TI  - Acetyl coenzyme A synthetase is acetylated on multiple lysine residues by a protein acetyltransferase with a single Gcn5-type N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) domain in Saccharopolyspora erythraea.
AB  - Reversible lysine acetylation (RLA) is used by cells of all domains of life to modulate protein function. To date, bacterial acetylation/deacetylation systems have been studied in a few bacteria (e.g., Salmonella enterica, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Erwinia amylovora, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and Geobacillus kaustophilus), but little is known about RLA in antibiotic-producing actinomycetes. Here, we identify the Gcn5-like protein acetyltransferase AcuA of Saccharopolyspora erythraea (SacAcuA, SACE_5148) as the enzyme responsible for the acetylation of the AMP-forming acetyl coenzyme A synthetase (SacAcsA, SACE_2375). Acetylated SacAcsA was deacetylated by a sirtuin-type NAD(+)-dependent consuming deacetylase (SacSrtN, SACE_3798). In vitro acetylation/deacetylation of SacAcsA enzyme was studied by Western blotting, and acetylation of lysine residues Lys(237), Lys(380), Lys(611), and Lys(628) was confirmed by mass spectrometry. In a strain devoid of SacAcuA, none of the above-mentioned Lys residues of SacAcsA was acetylated. To our knowledge, the ability of SacAcuA to acetylate multiple Lys residues is unique among AcuA-type acetyltransferases. Results from site-specific mutagenesis experiments showed that the activity of SacAcsA was controlled by lysine acetylation. Lastly, immunoprecipitation data showed that in vivo acetylation of SacAcsA was influenced by glucose and acetate availability. These results suggested that reversible acetylation may also be a conserved regulatory posttranslational modification strategy in antibiotic-producing actinomycetes.
TI  - CRISPRs: molecular signatures used for pathogen subtyping.
AB  - Rapid and accurate strain identification is paramount in the battle against microbial outbreaks, and several subtyping approaches have been developed. One such method uses clustered regular interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs), DNA repeat elements that are present in approximately half of all bacteria. Though their signature function is as an adaptive immune system against invading DNA such as bacteriophages and plasmids, CRISPRs also provide an excellent framework for pathogen tracking and evolutionary studies. Analysis of the spacer DNA sequences that reside between the repeats has been tremendously useful for bacterial subtyping during molecular epidemiological investigations. Subtyping, or strain identification, using CRISPRs has been employed in diverse Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Salmonella enterica, and the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. This review discusses the several ways in which CRISPR sequences are exploited for subtyping. This includes the well-established spoligotyping methodologies that have been used for 2 decades to type Mycobacterium species, as well as in-depth consideration of newer, higher-throughput CRISPR-based protocols.
TI  - Characterization of the RcsC sensor kinase from Erwinia amylovora and other Enterobacteria.
AB  - RcsC is a hybrid sensor kinase which contains a sensor domain, a histidine kinase domain, and a receiver domain. We have previously demonstrated that, although the Erwinia amylovora rcsC mutant produces more amylovoran than the wild-type (WT) strain in vitro, the mutant remains nonpathogenic on both immature pear fruit and apple plants. In this study, we have comparatively characterized the Erwinia RcsC and its homologs from various enterobacteria. Results demonstrate that expression of the Erwinia rcsC gene suppresses amylovoran production in various amylovoran overproducing WT and mutant strains, thus suggesting the presence of a net phosphatase activity of Erwinia RcsC. Findings have also demonstrated that rcsC homologs from other enterobacteria could not rescue amylovoran production of the Erwinia rcsC mutant in vitro. However, virulence of the Erwinia rcsC mutant is partially restored by rcsC homologs from Pantoea stewartii, Yersinia pestis, and Salmonella enterica but not from Escherichia coli on apple shoots. Domain-swapping experiments have indicated that replacement of the E. coli RcsC sensor domain by those of Erwinia and Yersinia spp. partially restores virulence of the Erwinia rcsC mutant, whereas chimeric constructs containing the sensor domain of E. coli RcsC could not rescue virulence of the Erwinia rcsC mutant on apple. Interestingly, only chimeric constructs containing the histidine kinase and receiver domains of Erwinia RcsC are fully capable of rescuing amylovoran production. These results suggest that the sensor domain of RcsC may be important in regulating bacterial virulence, whereas the activity of the histidine kinase and receiver domains of Erwinia RcsC may be essential for amylovoran production in vitro.
TI  - Biologically active isoforms of CobB sirtuin deacetylase in Salmonella enterica and Erwinia amylovora.
AB  - Sirtuins are NAD(+)-dependent protein deacylases that are conserved in all domains of life and are involved in diverse cellular processes, including control of gene expression and central metabolism. Eukaryotic sirtuins have N-terminal extensions that have been linked to protein multimerization and cellular localization. Here the first evidence of sirtuin isoforms in bacteria is reported. The enterobacterium Salmonella enterica synthesizes two isoforms of CobB sirtuin, a shorter 236-amino-acid isoform (here CobB(S)) and a longer 273-amino-acid isoform (here CobB(L)). The N-terminal 37-amino-acid extension of CobB(L) is amphipathic, containing 18 basic amino acids (12 of which are Arg) and 13 hydrophobic ones; both isoforms were active in vivo and in vitro. Northern blot and transcription start site analyses revealed that cobB is primarily expressed as two monocistronic cobB mRNAs from two transcription start sites, one of which was mapped within the neighboring ycfX gene and the other of which was located within cobB. Additionally, a low-abundance ycfX-cobB bicistronic mRNA was observed which could encode up to three proteins (YcfX, CobB(L), and CobB(S)). CobB(L) isoforms are common within the family Enterobacteriaceae, but species of the genus Erwinia (including the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora) encode only the CobB(L) isoform. The CobB(L) isoform from E. amylovora restored growth of as S. enterica cobB mutant strain on low acetate.
TI  - Tetracycline and streptomycin resistance genes, transposons, and plasmids in Salmonella enterica isolates from animals in Italy.
AB  - Fifty-eight multidrug-resistant Salmonella enterica strains of 20 serotypes, isolated from animal sources in Italy, were analyzed for tet(A) and strA-strB, conferring tetracycline and streptomycin resistance, respectively. The strA and strB genes were highly prevalent in Salmonella strains of our collection, being detected in 84% of the streptomycin-resistant strains. In many strains, the strA and strB genes were linked to a particular Tn5393-derivative transposon characterized by the presence of the insertion sequence IS1133, previously identified only in the plant pathogen Erwinia amylovora. Sixty-eight percent of the tetracycline-resistant strains were tet(A) positive, indicating that this gene is widely diffused in Salmonella strains circulating in animals in Italy. Most of the tet(A) genes were localized within a deleted Tn1721 transposon variant. Two prevalent repN and repI1 resistance plasmids were identified in Salmonella isolates of our collection.
TI  - Characterization of serracin P, a phage-tail-like bacteriocin, and its activity against Erwinia amylovora, the fire blight pathogen.
AB  - Serratia plymithicum J7 culture supernatant displayed activity against many pathogenic strains of Erwinia amylovora, the causal agent of the most serious bacterial disease of apple and pear trees, fire blight, and against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia liquefaciens, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas fluorescens. This activity increased significantly upon induction with mitomycin C. A phage-tail-like bacteriocin, named serracin P, was purified from an induced culture supernatant of S. plymithicum J7. It was found to be the only compound involved in the antibacterial activity against sensitive strains. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the two major subunits (23 and 43 kDa) of serracin P revealed high homology with the Fels-2 prophage of Salmonella enterica, the coliphages P2 and 168, the phiCTX prophage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a prophage of Yersinia pestis. This strongly suggests a common ancestry for serracin P and these bacteriophages.
TI  - Molecular characterization of global regulatory RNA species that control pathogenicity factors in Erwinia amylovora and Erwinia herbicola pv. gypsophilae.
AB  - rsmB(Ecc) specifies a nontranslatable RNA regulator that controls exoprotein production and pathogenicity in soft rot-causing Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora. This effect of rsmB(Ecc) RNA is mediated mostly by neutralizing the function of RsmA(Ecc), an RNA-binding protein of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora, which acts as a global negative regulator. To determine the occurrence of functional homologs of rsmB(Ecc) in non-soft-rot-causing Erwinia species, we cloned the rsmB genes of E. amylovora (rsmB(Ea)) and E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae (rsmB(Ehg)). We show that rsmB(Ea) in E. amylovora positively regulates extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production, motility, and pathogenicity. In E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae, rsmB(Ehg) elevates the levels of transcripts of a cytokinin (etz) gene and stimulates the production of EPS and yellow pigment as well as motility. RsmA(Ea) and RsmA(Ehg) have more than 93% identity to RsmA(Ecc) and, like the latter, function as negative regulators by affecting the transcript stability of the target gene. The rsmB genes reverse the negative effects of RsmA(Ea), RsmA(Ehg), and RsmA(Ecc), but the extent of reversal is highest with homologous combinations of rsm genes. These observations and findings that rsmB(Ea) and rsmB(Ehg) RNA bind RsmA(Ecc) indicate that the rsmB effect is channeled via RsmA. Additional support for this conclusion comes from the observation that the rsmB genes are much more effective as positive regulators in a RsmA(+) strain of E. carotovora subsp. carotovora than in its RsmA(-) derivative. E. herbicola pv. gypsophilae produces a 290-base rsmB transcript that is not subject to processing. By contrast, E. amylovora produces 430- and 300-base rsmB transcripts, the latter presumably derived by processing of the primary transcript as previously noted with the transcripts of rsmB(Ecc). Southern blot hybridizations revealed the presence of rsmB homologs in E. carotovora, E. chrysanthemi, E. amylovora, E. herbicola, E. stewartii and E. rhapontici, as well as in other enterobacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Shigella flexneri, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Y. pseudotuberculosis. A comparison of rsmB sequences from several of these enterobacterial species revealed a highly conserved 34-mer region which is predicted to play a role in positive regulation by rsmB RNA.
TI  - Transfer of episome F'lac+ and chromosomal trp+ genes from Erwinia amylovora to Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - The F'lac+ episome of Escherichia coli origin was transferred by conjugation with frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-5) from Erwinia amylovora to 14 out of 15 Salmonella typhimurium trp female parents. The chromosomal trp+ genes were transferred with frequencies of 10(-7) to 10(-6) only to one trpB and 2 trpD female parents, which have a point mutation in the 2nd and fourth structural genes, respectively, of the tryptophan operon. The transferred male trp+ genes became integrated at the selected sites of the S. tryphimurium chromosome. The resulting Trp+ hybrids were phenotypically stable, lacked a cryptic trp allele selected against in the female parent, had high genetic homology values in the tryptophan region, and showed biochemical reactions and pathogenicity typical of S. typhimurium.
TI  - Transfer among Erwinia spp. and other enterobacteria of antibiotic resistance carried on R factors.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance carried on R factors was transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli B/r and Shigella flexneri 1a to Erwinia spp. Tetracycline resistance (TetR) carried on R factor R100 drd-56 was transferred from E. coli B/r to strains of Erwinia amylovora, E. aroideae, E. atroseptica, E. chrysanthemi, E. cytolytica, E. dissolvens, E. herbicola, E. nigrifluens, and E. nimipressuralis, but not to strains of Erwinia carotovora, E. carnegieana, E. dieffenbachiae, E. oleraceae, and E. quercina. Multiple antibiotic resistance (chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline; ChlR-StrR-TetR) carried on R factor SR1 was transferred from a clinical isolate of S. flexneri 1a to strains of E. aroideae, E. chrysanthemi, E. herbicola, and E. nigrifluens, but not to strains of other Erwinia spp. The frequency of this transfer was low with receptive cultures of Erwinia spp. and E. coli (F(-) strain). Antibiotic resistance in the exconjugants showed varying degrees of stability in the presence or absence of acridine orange, depending on the strain tested. The frequencies of segregation to drug susceptibility in the presence of acridine orange, though low, suggest that the elements exist as plasmids in the majority of the Erwinia exconjugants. Multiple antibiotic resistance (ChlR-StrR-TetR) was found to segregate into various resistance classes (ChlR-StrR, StrR-TetR, TetR, StrR, and none) in these exconjugants. The exconjugants of E. amylovora, E. herbicola, and E. nigrifluens, to which R100 drd-56 was transferred from E. coli B/r, were sensitive to the male (F)-specific phage M13. There was a positive correlation between the susceptibility of exconjugants to the F-specific phage M13 and their ability to transfer R100 drd-56 to the recipient cultures of Escherichia coli, Erwinia herbicola, Salmonella typhimurium, and Shigella dysenteriae. Exceptions were, however, noted with Erwinia dissolvens and E. nimipressuralis exconjugants harboring R100 drd-56; these exconjugants, although not susceptible to M13, transferred R100 drd-56 to the recipient cultures. The frequency of transfer of R100 drd-56 and the levels of resistance to tetracycline in Erwinia exconjugants were found to differ markedly depending upon the strain employed. Transfer of multiple antibiotic resistance (ChlR-StrR-TetR) from Erwinia exconjugants was not obtained in preliminary trials with an E. coli F(-) strain as the recipient culture.
