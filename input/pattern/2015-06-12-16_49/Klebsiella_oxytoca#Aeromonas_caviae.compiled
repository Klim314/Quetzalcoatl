TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - Detection, prevalence, purification and characterization of lecithinase of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Lecithinase activity in Klebsiella is a rare trait as out of 208 strains of Klebsiella belonging to 3 species, viz. K. pneumoniae (168), K. planticola (29) and K. oxytoca (11), only 4 strains of K. pneumoniae produced lecithinase positive colonies on egg-yolk-agar. Although cell lysates of 16 K. pneumoniae yielded positive results for lecithinase assay on egg-yolk-agar, 19 strains were detected positive for lecithinase with ELISA using anti-lecithinase serum. Release of up to 52.12% cell-bound lecithinase could be achieved with polymyxin-B treatment at 100 micrograms/ml concentration. Purified lecithinase was determined to be a high molecular weight (70 kDa), crystalizable, anionic (pI, 3.5) protein. It possessed cytolytic, haemolytic and dermonecrotic activities but did not induce fluid accumulation in rabbit ileal loop or infant mouse guts. It was inactivated by boiling, trypsin and chymotrypsin treatment and alkaline pH. Serologically, it was related to lecithinase of Aeromonas caviae and phospholipase-C of Salmonella.
TI  - [Post-traumatic endophthalmitis with multiple water pathogens].
AB  - HISTORY AND SIGNS: A 37-y-old worker for a recycling company suffered from a corneal perforation by a wire which had been in contact with dirt and moisture. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Initially, the typical signs of an endophthalmitis were missing so that we only irrigated and instilled antibiotics into the anterior chamber. However, later on two pars-plana vitrectomies became necessary. At each operation a bacteriological examination was performed and we found four different species-Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella oxytoca, Aeromonas caviae, Flavobacterium odoratum. CONCLUSION: The latter two species are very rare in ophthalmology. This fact and some peculiarities in the clinical course of the patient's disease make him an unusual case. After unsuccessful irrigation of the anterior chamber vitrectomy ought to be performed immediately.
