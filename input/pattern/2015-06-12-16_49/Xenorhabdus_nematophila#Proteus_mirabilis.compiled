TI  - The xaxAB genes encoding a new apoptotic toxin from the insect pathogen Xenorhabdus nematophila are present in plant and human pathogens.
AB  - Xenorhabdus nematophila, a member of the Enterobacteriaceae, kills many species of insects by strongly depressing the immune system and colonizing the entire body. A peptide cytotoxin has been purified from X. nematophila broth growth, and the cytolytic effect on insect immunocytes and hemolytic effect on mammalian red blood cells of this toxin have been described (Ribeiro, C., Vignes, M., and Brehelin, M. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 3030-3039). We show here that this toxin, Xenorhabdus alpha-xenorhabdolysin (Xax), triggers apoptosis in both insect and mammalian cells. We also report the cloning and sequencing of two genes, xaxAB, encoding this toxin in X. nematophila. The expression of both genes in recombinant Escherichia coli led to the production of active cytotoxin/hemolysin. However, hemolytic activity was observed only if the two peptides were added in the appropriate order. Furthermore, we report here that inactivation of xaxAB genes in X. nematophila abolished the major cytotoxic activity present in broth growth, called C1. We also show that these genes are present in various entomopathogenic bacteria of the genera Xenorhabdus and Photorhabdus, in Pseudomonas entomophila, in the human pathogens Yersinia enterocolitica and Proteus mirabilis, and in the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. This toxin cannot be classified in any known family of cytotoxins on the basis of amino acid sequences, locus organization, and activity features. It is, therefore, probably the prototype of a new family of binary toxins.
TI  - Unique organization and regulation of the mrx fimbrial operon in Xenorhabdus nematophila.
AB  - Xenorhabdus nematophila, a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the Proteus clade of the family Enterobacteriaceae, forms a mutualistic association with the soil nematode Steinernema carpocapsae. The nematode invades insects and releases Xenorhabdus into the haemolymph, where it participates in insect killing. To begin to understand the role of fimbriae in the unique life cycle of Xenorhabdus, the organization and expression of the mrx fimbrial operon was analysed. The mrx operon contained only five structural genes (mrxACDGH), making it one of the smallest chaperone-usher fimbrial operons studied to date. Unlike the mrp operon of Proteus mirabilis, a site-specific recombinase was not linked to the mrx operon. The intergenic region between the major fimbrial gene (mrxA) and the usher gene (mrxC) lacked a mrpB-like gene, but contained three tandem inverted repeat sequences located downstream of mrxA. A 940 nt mrxA-containing mRNA was the major transcript produced in cells growing on agar, while an mrx polycistronic mRNA was produced at low levels. A canonical sigma(70) promoter, identified upstream of mrxA, was not subject to promoter inversion. Fimbriae were not produced in an lrp-mutant strain, suggesting that the leucine-responsive regulatory protein, Lrp, plays a role in the regulation of the mrx operon. These findings show that the genetic organization and regulation of the mrx operon is in several respects distinct from other chaperone-usher fimbrial operons.
