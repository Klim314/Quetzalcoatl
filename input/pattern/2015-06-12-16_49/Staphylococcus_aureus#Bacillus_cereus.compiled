TI  - Purification, crystallization and X-ray crystallographic studies of a Bacillus cereus MepR-like transcription factor, BC0657.
AB  - Transcription factors of the MarR family respond to internal and external changes and regulate a variety of biological functions through ligand association with microorganisms. MepR belongs to the MarR family, and its mutations are associated with the development of multidrug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, which has caused a growing health problem. In this study, a Bacillus cereus MepR-like transcription regulator, BC0657, was crystallized. The BC0657 crystals diffracted to 2.05 A resolution and belonged to either space group P6222 or P6422, with unit-cell parameters a = 110.57, b = 110.57, c = 67.29 A. There was one molecule per asymmetric unit. Future comparative structural studies on BC0657 would extend knowledge of ligand-induced transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in the MarR family and would make a significant contribution to the design of antibiotic drugs against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - A novel suicide plasmid for efficient gene mutation in Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Although several plasmids have been used in Listeria monocytogenes for generating mutants by allelic exchange, construction of L. monocytogenes mutants has been inefficient due to lack of effective selection markers for first and second recombination events. To address this problem, we have developed a new suicide plasmid, pHoss1, by using the pMAD plasmid backbone and anhydrotetracycline selection marker (secY antisense RNA) driven by an inducible Pxyl/tetO promoter. Expression of the secY antisense RNA eliminates merodiploids and selects for the loss of plasmid via a second allelic exchange, which enriches the number of mutants with deleted genes. To assess the effectiveness of pHoss1 for the generation of stable in-frame deletion mutations, we deleted the ispG and ispH genes of L. monocytogenes serotype 4b strain F2365. Results showed that identification of the second allelic exchange mutants was very efficient with 80-100% of the colonies yielding desired deletion mutants. L. monocytogenes' intestinal cell attachment was not altered when ispG and ispH genes were deleted. We expect that this new plasmid will be very useful for construction of marker-free deletion mutants in L. monocytogenes and in other Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Kinetics of bacterial inactivation by 405nm and 520nm light emitting diodes and the role of endogenous coproporphyrin on bacterial susceptibility.
AB  - Photodynamic inactivation studies of microbial pathogens have focused on the use  of an external photosensitizer or a precursor compound to eliminate bacteria. The present study investigated the inactivation kinetics of six bacterial pathogens by a 405nm light emitting diode (LED) without the addition of any external compound. The role of endogenous coproporphyrin on the bacterial susceptibility to LEDs was also examined. Pathogens were illuminated with LEDs at 25, 10 and 4 degrees C for 9h and the inactivation curves were modeled using six different equations. Endogenous coproporphyrin was quantified using an HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector. At a dose of 306J/cm2, the 405nm LED brought about 4.0, 2.1 and 1.9 log reductions in the populations of Staphylococcus aureus at 25, 10 and 4 degrees C, respectively. At all three temperatures, the population of Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes reduced by approximately 2.3 and 1.9 log respectively. Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed moderate susceptibility to 405nm LED while Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most resistant. Of the six models tested, Hom model proved most suitable. This study demonstrated that 405nm LEDs can be useful in the inactivation of bacterial pathogens with the aid of endogenous coproporphyrin alone.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities from Jatropha dioica roots.
AB  - The antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of organic extracts obtained from roots of the medicinal plant Jatropha dioica (Euphorbiaceae) were investigated. In order to evaluate their antimicrobial activity, the organic extracts were tested against clinical isolates of the human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhimurium, Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis and Sporothrix schenckii. Results revealed that the hexane extract possess the stronger activity and a broader microbicide spectrum compared to the acetone and ethanol extracts. The activity of hexane extract may be attributed in part to the presence of beta-sitosterol, the major compound identified by bioautography. The hexane extract, as well as the bioactive fraction were not cytotoxic when assays were profiled against the normal cell lines Chang, OK and LLCPK-1 (IC50>1000 mug mL(-1)).
TI  - Supercritical CO2 extraction of functional compounds from Spirulina and their biological activity.
AB  - Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCCO2) extraction and fractionation of Spirulina platensis was carried out to obtain functional compounds with antioxidant, antimicrobial and enzyme inhibitory activities. Extraction of SCCO2 was carried out using 200 g of Spirulina powder at 40 masculineC under 120 bar pressure with CO2 flow rate of 1.2 kg h(-1). SCCO2 fraction obtained was further treated with hexane and ethyl acetate to identify its components. Individual components were identified by comparing mass spectra of samples with standard data and retention indices (RI) of C5-C20 n-alkanes mixture using the kovat index formula. The phenolic and flavonoid content of the SCCO2 extract was found to be 0.34 +/- 0.01 g/100 g and 0.12 +/- 0.01 g/100 g respectively. The SCCO2 extract had antioxidant activity with IC50 value of 109.6 +/- 3.0 mug mL(-1) for DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picryl hydrazyl radical), IC50 value of 81.66 +/- 2.5 mug mL(-1) for reducing power and IC50 value of 112.70 +/- 0.8 mug mL(-1) for hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Further, antioxidant activity study on oxidative induced DNA damage was analysed to elucidate the positive role of SCCO2 extract. SCCO2 extracts showed high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus FRI 722 and Bacillus cereus F 4810) compared to that of Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli MTCC 108 and Yersinia enterocolitica MTCC 859). The SCCO2 extract exhibited inhibitory activity on both Angiotensin-1 converting enzyme and alpha-glucosidase with IC50 values of 274 +/- 1.0 mug mL(-1) and 307 +/- 2.0 mug mL(-1) respectively.
TI  - PCR detection and identification of bacterial contaminants in ocular samples from post-operative endophthalmitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery which requires urgent medical consideration including comprehensive diagnosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a sensitive molecular method has been extensively used for detection of microbial species in clinical specimens. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify the causative organisms of endophthalmitis in our patient population using a procedure based on PCR. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vitreous samples from 32 patients with post-operative endophthalmitis were collected. Total vitreous DNA was extracted and then assessed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene was amplified from genomic DNA using PCR with a pair of HAD2 universal primers. Library of PCR products from 16S rRNA, cloned into the pTZ57R/T vector. The ligated products were then transformed into E. coli DH5alpha strain and grown in the LB-ampicillin/X-Gal/IPTG plate. RESULTS: From the total of 32 vitreous samples, 18 specimens were positive, illustrating the presence of bacterial infection (56.4 %). Twelve species including Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus subtilis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria meningitides, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus were identified using BLAST for known 16S rRNA sequences. CONCLUSION: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) accompanied with cloning and sequencing approved to be sensitive and specific. The rapid molecular technique was useful in detection of 12 major microbial species, in infectious endophthalmitis.
TI  - Bioactive compounds isolated from submerged fermentations of the Chilean fungus Stereum rameale.
AB  - Liquid fermentations of the fungus Stereum rameale (N degrees 2511) yielded extracts with antibacterial activity. The antibacterial activity reached its peak after 216 h of stirring. Bioassay-guided fractionation methods were employed for the isolation of the bioactive metabolites. Three known compounds were identified: MS-3 (1), vibralactone (2) and vibralactone B (3). The three compounds showed antibacterial activity as a function of their concentration. Minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of compound 1 against Gram-positive bacteria were as follows: Bacillus cereus (50 mug/mL), Bacillus subtilis (10 mug/mL) and Staphylococcus aureus (100 mug/mL). Compounds 2 and 3 were active only against Gram-negative bacteria. The MBC of compound 2 against Escherichia coli was 200 mug/mL. Compound 3 inhibited significantly the growth of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MBC values of 50 and 100 mug/mL, respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility of and spp. intended for use as starter and probiotic cultures.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were tested for 23 Lactobacillus and three Bifidobacterium strains isolated from different ecological niches. Agar-well diffusion method was used to test the antagonistic effect (against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans) of acid and neutralized (pH 5.5) lyophilized concentrated supernatants (cell-free supernatant; CFS) and whey (cell-free whey fractions; CFW) from de Man-Rogosa-Sharpe/trypticase-phytone-yeast broth and skim milk. Acid CFS and CFW showed high acidification rate-dependent bacterial inhibition; five strains were active against C. albicans. Neutralized CFS/CFW assays showed six strains active against S. aureus (L. acidophilus L-1, L. brevis 1, L. fermentum 1, B. animalis subsp. lactis L-3), E. coli (L. bulgaricus 6) or B. cereus (L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic). Inhibition of two pathogens with neutralized CFS (L. bulgaricus 6, L. helveticus 3, L. plantarum 24-2L, L. fermentum 1)/CFW (L. plantarum 24-5D, L. plantarum 24-4capital VE, Cyrillic) was detected. Some strains maintained activity after pH neutralization, indicating presence of active substances. The antibiotics minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the Epsilometer test method. All strains were susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline. Four lactobacilli were resistant to one antibiotic (L. rhamnosus Lio 1 to streptomycin) or two antibiotics (L. acidophilus L-1 and L. brevis 1 to kanamycin and clindamycin; L. casei L-4 to clindamycin and chloramphenicol). Vancomycin MICs > 256 mug/mL indicated intrinsic resistance for all heterofermentative lactobacilli. The antimicrobially active strains do not cause concerns about antibiotic resistance transfer and could be used as natural biopreservatives in food and therapeutic formulations.
TI  - Design, synthesis, in silico and in vitro studies of substituted 1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydro pyrimidine phosphorus derivatives.
AB  - Molecular docking studies of the designed two series (4a-l, 6a-l, 9 and 10) of novel substituted phosphorylated 1, 4-dihydropyridine and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine derivatives against the drug targets of DHFR from Bacillus cereus, LpxC from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, IDH from E. coli and MurB from Staphylococcus aureus were encouraged for their synthesis. These compounds were synthesized from substituted aromatic aldehydes, thiourea/urea and ethyl acetoacetate in presence of polyphosphoric acid (PPA). These were further phosphorylated with diethyl (2-chloroethoxy) methyl phosphonate to get the desired products. In vitro anti-bacterial activity against the specified bacterial strains related to docked protein exhibited good inhibitory activity at different dose concentrations. Quantitative Structure Activity Relationship (QSAR) descriptors of the designed structures have demonstrated their satisfactory drug like properties. The results from Molecular docking, QSAR descriptors and in vitro anti-bacterial activities led to the identification of safer and potential antibacterial agents of the title compounds screened. Compounds 4a, 4d, 4i, 6a, 6d, 9 and 10 were found to be potent antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of native California medicinal plant extracts isolated from Rhamnus californica and Umbellularia californica.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global public health. Medicinal plants have long been used as remedies for infectious diseases by native cultures around the world and have the potential for providing effective treatments for antibiotic-resistant infections. Rhamnus californica (Rhamnaceae) and Umbellularia californica (Lauraceae) are two indigenous California plant species historically used by Native Americans to treat skin, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. This study aimed to assess the in vitro antimicrobial activity of methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: Methanolic extracts of leaves and bark of R. and U. californica were prepared by soxhlet extraction and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa using disc diffusion and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. Chemical profiling of the extracts was performed using standard methods. RESULTS: All extracts inhibited the growth of MRSA and other Gram-positive bacteria with MICs of 3.3-6.0 mg/ml. Gram-negative organisms were unaffected by these extracts. U. californica extracts (leaves and bark) had the lowest MIC values. Chemical profiling detected the presence of quinones, alkaloids, flavonoids, cardenolides, tannins and saponins in these extracts. Our study is the first to report the antimicrobial properties of R. and U. californica and illustrates their promising anti-MRSA potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our results give scientific credence to the traditional medicinal uses of these plants by the indigenous peoples of California. Further investigation of the secondary metabolites responsible for the antimicrobial activity of these extracts against MRSA is warranted.
TI  - A novel antimicrobial flavonoid from the stem bark of Commiphora pedunculata (Kotschy & Peyr.) Engl.
AB  - A new flavonoid, 2-(3,5-dihydroxy-4-methoxy-phenyl)-3,5-dihydroxy-8,8-dimethyl-2,3-dihydro-8H-pyra no[3,2]chromen-4-one, together with previously reported epicatechin was isolated from the ethyl acetate soluble fraction of the methanol extract of the stem bark of Commiphora pedunculata. The structures of these compounds were elucidated based on extensive analysis of their spectral data, including 1 and 2D NMR. The compounds were active against 9 out of 12 tested microorganisms including a resistant strain; vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The zones of inhibition ranged between 22 and 34 mm against the microorganisms. The minimum inhibitory concentration was as low as 6.25 mug/mL against Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus and S. aureus while the minimum bactericidal concentration was as low as 50 mug/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, VRE and C.albicans. This is the first report of the isolation of the compound.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities and mechanism of sugar fatty acid esters against five food-related bacteria.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activities of sugar fatty acid esters, with different fatty acid and saccharide moieties, against five food-related bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. Sucrose monocaprate showed the strongest antibacterial activity against all tested bacteria, especially Gram-positive bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria were 2.5 and 10mM, respectively. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) for Gram-positive bacteria were 10mM. Time-kill assay also showed that sucrose monocaprate significantly inhibit the growth of tested bacteria. The permeability of the cell membrane and intracellular proteins were both changed by sucrose monocaprate according to cell constituents' leakage, SDS-PAGE and scanning electron microscope assays. It is suggested that sucrose monocaprate, with both emulsifying and antibacterial activities, have a potential to serve as a safe multifunctional food additive in food industries.
TI  - Effect of UV-C light on the microbial and sensory quality of seasoned dried seafood.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of different doses of UV-C light at 253.7 nm  (0-18 kJ/m2) on the reduction of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus in contaminated seasoned dried filefish (Thamnaconus modestus) and sliced squid (Todarodes pacificus) surfaces and sensory quality. The counts of all three bacteria were significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by the increase of UV-C dosage. E. coli, S. aureus and B. cereus on filefish with 18 kJ/m2 of UV-C maximally reduced by 2.70, 2.55 and 2.57 log CFU/g, respectively; however, on the sliced squid using the same UV dose reduced the same bacteria by 1.35, 0.54 and 1.05 log CFU/g, respectively. However, the results suggest that 6 to 9 kJ/m2 of UV-C could be used for the inactivation of E. coli and B. cereus in these dried fishery products without any changes in sensory quality. However, S. aureus levels on sliced squid will require a combination of UV-C light and chemical treatment.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial properties of 2,3-dideoxyglucosides of terpene alcohols and phenols.
AB  - Essential oils and their oxygenated terpene constituents possess potent antimicrobial properties. In the present study, a facile synthetic route to the 2,3-dideoxy 1-O-glucosides of important phenols and terpene alcohols in excellent yields (85-96%) has been delineated. Studies on their antimicrobial action against four food-borne pathogens - Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica - demonstrated that the zone of inhibition, in general, was higher for the 2,3-unsaturated 1-O-glucoside derivatives (1b-6b) and the corresponding saturated glucosides (1c-5c) when compared to the parent alcohols/phenols (1-6). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values for these derivatives too were generally lower than those of the parent compounds. Furthermore, the time-kill and bacteriolysis assays too demonstrated the greater antimicrobial potential of the derivatives. The 2,3-dideoxy 1-O-glucosides of phenols and terpene alcohols were more effective in their antimicrobial action than the corresponding parent compounds. The study indicated that these novel derivatives can find useful application in control of food-related pathogenic microbes in foods.
TI  - Challenge study of the pathogen reduction capacity of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma technology.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Although most pathogen reduction systems for plasma primarily target viruses, bacterial contamination may also occur. This study aimed to investigate the bacterial reduction capacity of a methylene blue (MB) treatment process and its virus inactivation capacity in lipaemic plasma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial concentrations in plasma units spiked with different bacterial strains were measured before and after the following steps of the THERAFLEX MB-Plasma procedure: leucocyte filtration, MB/light treatment and MB filtration. Virus inactivation was investigated for three virus types in non-lipaemic, borderline lipaemic and highly lipaemic plasma. RESULTS: Leucocyte filtration alone efficiently eliminated most of the tested bacteria by more than 4 logs (Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus) or to the limit of detection (LOD) (>/= 4.8 logs; Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae). MB/light and MB filtration further reduced Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus to below the LOD. The small bacterium Brevundimonas diminuta was reduced by 1.7 logs by leucocyte filtration alone, and to below the LOD by additional MB/light treatment and MB filtration (>/= 3.7 logs). Suid herpesvirus 1, bovine viral diarrhoea virus and human immunodeficiency virus 1 were efficiently inactivated by THERAFLEX MB-Plasma, independent of the degree of lipaemia. CONCLUSION: THERAFLEX MB-Plasma efficiently reduces bacteria, mainly via the integrated filtration system. Its virus inactivation capacity is sufficient to compensate for reduced light transparency due to lipaemia.
TI  - Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides as potent Gram-positive antibacterial agents.
AB  - Twelve 4-benzoyl-1-dichlorobenzoylthiosemicarbazides have been tested as potential antibacterials. All the compounds had MICs between 0.49 and 15.63 microg/ml toward Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis indicating, in most cases, equipotent or even more effective action than cefuroxime. In order to clarify if the observed antibacterial effects are universal, further research were undertaken to test inhibitory potency of two most potent compounds 3 and 11 on clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus. Compound 11 inhibited the growth of methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) at MICs of 1.95-7.81 microg/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) at MICs of 0.49-1.95 microg/ml and MDR-MRSA at MIC of 0.98 and 3.90 microg/ml, respectively. Finally, inhibitory efficacy of 3 and 11 on planktonic cells and biofilms formation in clinical isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus parainfluenzae was tested. The majority of cells in biofilm populations of MSSA and MRSA were eradicated at low level of 3, with MBICs in the range of 7.82-15.63 microg/ml.
TI  - Chemical constituents and biological activities of Albizia myriophylla wood.
AB  - CONTEXT: Albizia myriophylla Benth (Leguminosae) is a medicinal plant widely used in Thailand and other Asian countries as a folk medicine remedy for many ailments. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to investigate the chemical compositions, antibacterial activity, and cytotoxicity of A. myriophylla wood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The structure identification of the isolated compounds was established using spectroscopic methods. In vitro antibacterial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus and the cytotoxicity against KB cells of extracts and compounds from A. myriophylla were performed using broth microdilution and resazurin microplate assays, respectively. The lupinifolin content in A. myriophylla extracts was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: A rare flavan-3,4-diol (1) together with eight known compounds (2-9) were isolated from the wood of A. myriophylla. Compounds 4-9 exhibited anti-S. mutans activity, of which lupinifolin (5) was the most potent with an MIC value of 0.98 microg/mL, followed by its dihydroxy derivative 4 with an MIC value of 62.5 microg/mL. Compounds 4 and 5 also displayed marked antibacterial activity against B. cereus and S. aureus (MIC value 15.63-125 microg/mL) and showed strong cytotoxic activity against KB cells (IC50 value 4.95-12.55 microg/mL). The lupinifolin contents in ethanol extracts from two different collections of this plant originating from central and southern Thailand were 93.85 and 0.04 mg/g, respectively. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of compounds 1-4 from A. myriophylla. Compounds 4 and 5 showed potent antibacterial and cytotoxic activities compared with other isolates. The anti-S. mutans activity of A. myriophylla extracts seems to be related to the lupinifolin content.
TI  - Ieodoglucomide C and Ieodoglycolipid, New Glycolipids from a Marine-Derived Bacterium Bacillus licheniformis 09IDYM23.
AB  - Chemical examination of the ethyl acetate extract from the fermentation broth of  the marine-derived bacterium Bacillus licheniformis resulted in the isolation of two new glycolipids, ieodoglucomide C (1) and ieodoglycolipid (2). The structural characterization of 1 and 2 was achieved by extensive spectroscopic evidence, including 2D NMR experiments. A combination of chemical derivatization techniques followed by NMR studies, LC-MS data analysis and a literature review was deployed for the establishment of the stereo-configurations of 1 and 2. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited good antibiotic properties against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with MICs ranging from 0.01 to 0.05 muM. Furthermore, the antifungal activity of 1 and 2 was evaluated against plant pathogenic fungi Aspergillus niger, Rhizoctonia solani, Botrytis cinerea and Colletotrichum acutatum as well as the human pathogen Candida albicans. Compounds 1 and 2 inhibited the mycelial growth of these pathogens with MIC values of 0.03-0.05 muM, revealing that these compounds are good candidates for the development of new fungicides.
TI  - UniStatus - a cross-sectional study on the contamination of uniforms in the Danish ambulance service.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients are at risk of contracting infections due to the presence of disease-causing microorganisms that can be transmitted from the medical staff's uniforms to the patient. The dual purpose of this study was to examine the contamination level of the uniforms worn by ambulance staff after a shift and to test the effect of washing of the uniform with and without a detergent containing acetic peroxide. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which 30 ambulance staff uniforms were randomly selected for inclusion and divided into two groups. Before washing, 90 prints were performed with specific agar plates to determine bacterial contamination and to establish the prevalence of a variety of microorganisms. Group A uniforms were washed with a detergent without acetic peroxide; Group B uniforms were washed with a detergent containing acetic peroxide. RESULTS: Before washing, the 90 prints had an average colony-forming units (CFU) of potentially pathogenic bacteria of 68.89 per 25 cm(2) and a prevalence of: E. coli and Pseudomonas 0%, Bacillus cereus 27.78% (CI 95% +/- 9.80), Clostridium and Enterococcus 2.22% (CI 95% +/- 1.96), Staphylococcus aureus 21.11% (CI 95% +/- 7.80). After washing, CFU was reduced to 3.09 (CI 95% +/- 5.04) per 25 cm(2) in Group A and to 1.47 (CI 95% +/- 4.77) per 25 cm(2) in Group B. The prevalence of specific bacteria in either group was 0%, except for S. aureus which had a prevalence rate of 4.40% (CI 95% +/- 6.10) in Group A. The difference between the contamination degrees of the two groups was not significant in either test (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Potentially pathogenic bacteria are detectable on ambulance staff uniforms when a shift ends. Optimal prevention of bacterial infection may be achieved by daily changing, washing at a minimum of 60 degrees Celsius and use of a detergent containing acetic peroxide.
TI  - Antimicrobial and immunomodulatory efficacy of extracellularly synthesized silver and gold nanoparticles by a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus Bipolaris tetramera.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Particulates of nanometers size have occupied a significant area in the field of medicinal and agricultural purposes due to their large surface-to-volume ratio and exceptional physicochemical, electronic and mechanical properties. Myconanotechnology, an interface between mycology and nanotechnology is budding nowadays for nanoparticle-fabrication using fungus or its metabolites. In the present study, we have isolated and characterized a novel phosphate solubilizing fungus B. tetramera KF934408 from rhizospheric soil. This phosphatase releasing fungus was subjected to extracellular synthesis of metal nanoparticles by redox reaction. RESULTS: Silver (AgNPs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopic analysis. The formulated AgNPs were irregular shaped with a size ranging between 54.78 nm to 73.49 nm whereas AuNPs were spherical or hexagonal, with a size of 58.4 and 261.73 nm, respectively. The nanoparticles were assessed for their antibacterial and antifungal efficacy. The results showed effective antimicrobial activity of AgNPs against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter aeroginosa and Trichoderma sp. at higher concentrations, however, AuNPs possessed only moderate antibacterial efficacy while they found no antifungal activity. Cytotoxicity analysis of nanoparticles on J774 and THP1 alpha cell lines revealed the dose dependence in case of AgNPs, while AuNPs were non-toxic at both low and high doses. Furthermore, significant elevation of intracellular ROS was observed after 4 h of incubation with both the nanoparticles. The capping of fungal proteins on the particulates might be involved in the activities demonstrated by these inert metal nanoparticles. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the findings showed that the metal nanoparticles synthesized by fungus B. tetramera could be used as an antimicrobial agents as well as cost effective and nontoxic immunomodulatory delivery vehicle.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of plants used for the treatment of diarrhoea in a rural community in northern Maputaland, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zulu people living in the rural area of Maputaland (KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa) rely heavily on medicinal plants for the treatment of diarrhoea. Abundant availability of medicinal plants in the study area offers low cost health care, but scientific validation is needed in order to lend credibility to the traditional use against many ailments including diarrhoeal infections. With this in mind a study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of 23 plant species which are used for the treatment of diarrhoea in rural Maputaland. Four 1:1 plant combinations were also evaluated to determine their interactive effects against seven diarrhoea-related bacterial pathogens. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays were undertaken on dichloromethane-methanol (CH2Cl2: MeOH) and aqueous crude extracts. The following micro-organisms were selected for this study and were tested based on their association with stomach ailments and diarrhoea; Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212), Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), Proteus vulgaris (ATCC 33420), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Shigella flexneri (ATCC 25875) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12600). The fractional inhibitory concentration index (SigmaFIC) was determined for plants traditionally used in combination. RESULTS: Shigella flexneri proved to be the most susceptible pathogen, where the organic extract of Terminalia sericea showed the most prominent noteworthy antibacterial activity (mean MIC value of 0.04 mg/mL). The aqueous extracts generally showed poorer antimicrobial activity with some exceptions i.e. Acacia burkei, Brachylaena transvaalensis against B. cereus and B. transvaalensis against S. flexneri. In the combination studies, synergy was predominant with mean (across all pathogens) SigmaFIC values of 0.30 for Acanthospermum glabratum with Krauseola mosambicina; SigmaFIC values of 0.46 for A. glabratum with Psidium guajava; SigmaFIC values of 0.39 for B. transvaalensis with P. guajava and SigmaFIC values of 0.88 (additive) for the combination of B. transvaalensis with Sclerocarya birrea. CONCLUSION: This study provided some insight into the bacterial in vitro efficacies of plants traditionally used to treat diarrhoea by the people of Northern Maputaland. Very little connection was observed between frequency of use and efficacy. Plant combinations demonstrated favourable efficacy with mostly synergistic effects noted, lending some credibility to their use in combination.
TI  - Secondary metabolites of Seseli rigidum: Chemical composition plus antioxidant, antimicrobial and cholinesterase inhibition activity.
AB  - Extracts of different polarity obtained from various plant parts (root, leaf, flower and fruit) of Seseli rigidum were studied by different antioxidant assays: DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity, by total reducing power method as well as via total content of flavonoids and polyphenols. Essential oils of all plant parts showed weak antioxidant characteristics. The inhibitory concentration range of the tested extracts, against bacteria Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and fungi Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger was 0.01-1.50mg/mL and of a microbicidal 0.02-3.00mg/mL. In the interaction with cholinesterase, all essential oils proved effective as inhibitors. The highest percentage of inhibition versus human and horse cholinesterase was shown by root essential oil (38.20% and 48.30%, respectively) among oils, and root hexane extract (40.56% and 50.65% respectively). Essential oils and volatile components of all plant parts were identified by GC, GC-MS and headspace/GC-MS. Statistical analysis of the ensemble of results showed that the root essential oil composition differed significantly from essential oils of other parts of the plant. Taking into account all of the studied activities, the root hexane extract showed the best overall properties. By means of high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry, the 30 most abundant constituents were identified in extracts of different polarity. The presence of identified constituents was linked to observed specific biological activities, thus designating compounds potentially responsible for each exhibited activity.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a novel plantaricin, KL-1Y, from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1.
AB  - Three bacteriocins from Lactobacillus plantarum KL-1 were successfully purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC. The bacteriocin peptides KL-1X, -1Y and -1Z had molecular masses of 3053.82, 3498.16 and 3533.16 Da, respectively. All three peptides were stable at pH 2-12 and 25 degrees C and at high temperatures of 80 and 100 degrees C for 30 min and 121 degrees C for 15 min. However, they differed in their susceptibility to proteolytic enzymes and their inhibition spectra. KL-1Y showed broad inhibitory activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis DMST 17368, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, P. aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739. KL-1X and -1Z inhibited only Gram-positive bacteria. KL-1X, KL-1Y and KL-1Z exhibited synergistic activity. The successful amino acid sequencing of KL-1Y had a hydrophobicity of approximately 30 % and no cysteine residues suggested its novelty, and it was designated "plantaricin KL-1Y". Plantaricin KL-1Y exhibited bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus JCM 2152(T). Compared to nisin, KL-1Y displayed broad inhibitory activities of 200, 800, 1600, 800, 400 and 400 AU/mL against the growth of Bacillus coagulans JCM 2257(T), B. cereus JCM 2152(T), Listeria innocua ATCC 33090(T), Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 118, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli ATCC 8739, respectively, whereas nisin had similar activities against only B. coagulans JCM 2257(T) and B. cereus JCM 2152(T). Therefore, the novel plantaricin KL-1Y is a promising antimicrobial substance for food safety uses in the future.
TI  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  - Foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni,  Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. To help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. Topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and physicochemical methods (heat, UV light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. Possible areas for future research are suggested. Plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. The collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Organic-inorganic hybrid nanoparticles for bacterial inhibition: synthesis and characterization of doped and undoped ONPs with Ag/Au NPs.
AB  - Organic nanoparticles (ONPs) of lipoic acid and its doped derivatives ONPs/Ag and ONPs/Au were prepared and characterized by UV-Visible, EDS, and TEM analysis. The antibacterial properties of the ONPs ONPs/Ag and ONPs/Au were tested against bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and bacterial growth inhibition tests show that ONPs/Ag are more effective in limiting bacterial growth than other NPs, particularly, for Gram positive than for Gram-negative ones. The order of bacterial cell growth inhibition was ONPs/Ag > ONPs > ONPs/Au. The morphology of the cell membrane for the treated bacteria was analyzed by SEM. The nature of bond formation of LA with Ag or Au was analyzed by molecular orbital and density of state (DOS) using DFT.
TI  - Characterization of films based on chitosan lactate and its blends with oxidized  starch and gelatin.
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosan lactate (CHL) was tested against bacteria and phytopathogenic fungi. Then, the structural, physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of films based on CHL, oxidized potato starch (OPS), and gelatin (GEL) were investigated. With the exception of Rhizopus nigricans, CHL was effective against the target organisms. Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) were more sensitive to CHL than Gram-negative bacteria (Pectobacterium carotovorum and Escherichia coli). Cryo-SEM images showed total miscibility between the polymers in the blends and the ATR-FTIR spectra revealed that there was an interaction among the polymeric components. Pure CHL films displayed the highest moisture content (25.51%), water vapor permeability (48.78gmmm(-2)d(-1)kPa(-1)), and the lowest tensile and puncture strength (2.00 and 1.45MPa, respectively) among the studied films. CHL50/GEL50 films had lower permeability, higher mechanical strength, and lower elongation compared to CHL50/OPS50 films. Films obtained from CHL and CHL50/GEL50 were completely water-soluble and did not show sorbitol recrystallization. The incorporation of CHL into OPS and GEL films did not affect their transparency and improved UV-blocking capacity. CHL films were the only ones that exhibited antibacterial efficiency. Antifungal activities against Alternaria alternata and Monilinia fructigena were detected for CHL and CHL50/GEL50 films.
TI  - Microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  - The present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (FABs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). Samples were screened for Escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. Microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log CFU/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (P < 0.05), whereas the other FABs contained , 25 CFU/25 ml microorganisms. Unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7 to 14.1%) or pH (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. Despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and B. cereus (detected in all FABs) were present in some products. B. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (P < 0.05). The finding that spore-forming B. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality FAB products. New strategic quality management plans for various FABs are needed.
TI  - Expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in Canada.
AB  - Enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in Canada and globally. Understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. Expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously, to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information is difficult or expensive to obtain. Thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. The elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. Experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. Estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. Transmission was attributed primarily to food for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Cyclospora cayetanensis, Trichinella spp., all three Vibrio spp. categories explored, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as Campylobacter spp., four Escherichia coli categories, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. Water was the primary pathway for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and Shigella spp. Consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. This study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for Canada, considering all possible transmission routes. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and E. coli subgroups in Canada.
TI  - Alternative modes of biofilm formation by plant-associated Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The ability to form multicellular communities known as biofilms is a widespread adaptive behavior of bacteria. Members of the Bacillus group of bacteria have been found to form biofilms on plant roots, where they protect against pathogens and promote growth. In the case of the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis the genetic pathway controlling biofilm formation and the production of an extracellular matrix is relatively well understood. However, it is unclear whether other members of this genus utilize similar mechanisms. We determined that a plant-associated strain of Bacillus cereus (905) can form biofilms by two seemingly independent pathways. In one mode involving the formation of floating biofilms (pellicles) B. cereus 905 appears to rely on orthologs of many of the genes known to be important for B. subtilis biofilm formation. We report that B. cereus 905 also forms submerged, surface-associated biofilms and in a manner that resembles biofilm formation by the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. This alternative mode, which does not rely on B. subtilis-like genes for pellicle formation, takes place under conditions of glucose fermentation and depends on a drop in the pH of the medium.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis CBMDC3f with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria: UV-MALDI-TOF MS analysis of its bioactive compounds.
AB  - In this work a new Bacillus sp. strain, isolated from honey, was characterized phylogenetically. Its antibacterial activity against three relevant foodborne pathogenic bacteria was studied; the main bioactive metabolites were analyzed using ultraviolet matrix assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry (UV-MALDI MS). Bacillus CBMDC3f was phylogenetically characterized as Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis after rRNA analysis of the 16S subunit and the gyrA gene (access codes Genbank JX120508 and JX120516, respectively). Its antibacterial potential was evaluated against Listeria monocytogenes (9 strains), B. cereus (3 strains) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213. Its cell suspension and cell-free supernatant (CFS) exerted significant anti-Listeria and anti-S. aureus activities, while the lipopeptides fraction (LF) also showed anti-B. cereus effect. The UV-MALDI-MS analysis revealed surfactin, iturin and fengycin in the CFS, whereas surfactin predominated in the LF. The CFS from CBMDC3f contained surfactin, iturin and fengycin with four, two and four homologues per family, respectively, whereas four surfactin, one iturin and one fengycin homologues were identified in the LF. For some surfactin homologues, their UV-MALDI-TOF/TOF (MS/MS; Laser Induced Decomposition method, LID) spectra were also obtained. Mass spectrometry analysis contributed with relevant information about the type of lipopeptides that Bacillus strains can synthesize. From our results, surfactin would be the main metabolite responsible for the antibacterial effect.
TI  - Grafted alpha-hydroxyphosphonic acids onto polymeric supports: preparation, characterization, and antimicrobial effect.
AB  - The paper deals with the preparation and characterization of compounds with antimicrobial activity: alpha-hydroxyphosphonic acids grafted onto styrene-12%-(15%)-divinylbenzene copolymer. These products proved to have antimicrobial effect against two species of gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and two species of gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and a species of yeast (Candida albicans). Tests showed the reduction of bacterial load at different time intervals during the 18 h of contact.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiquorum-sensing studies. Part 3: Synthesis and biological evaluation of new series of [1,3,4]thiadiazoles and fused [1,3,4]thiadiazoles.
AB  - New series of [1,3,4]thiadiazoles and fused [1,3,4]thiadiazoles were synthesized. The newly synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli. Compounds 3b and 10a displayed the highest activity against E. coli with MIC value of 78.125 mug/mL. In addition, compound 10a exhibited the highest activity against B. cereus with MIC value of 156.25 mug/mL. The antifungal activity of these compounds was also tested against Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus 3375. Compounds 3b, 5a, 10a, and 12b showed the best activity against A. flavus 3375 with MIC value of 19.531 mug/mL. The same compounds were examined for their antiquorum-sensing activity against Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472, whereas compounds 3b, 5a, and 12b exhibited moderate activity. In vitro cytotoxicity testing of compounds 3b,c, 5a, 6a, 10a, and 12a,b against human normal lung fibroblast (W138) cell line was performed. The in vivo acute toxicity of the same compounds was also tested and the obtained results indicated that compound 10a is the least toxic analog. The same compounds were studied for their DNA-binding affinity and the obtained results showed that compounds 3b, 10a, and 12a,b have moderate DNA-binding affinity.
TI  - The development of a green approach for the biosynthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles by using Panax ginseng root extract, and their biological applications.
AB  - The biosynthesis of nanoparticles has received attention because of the development of economic and environmentally friendly technology for the synthesis of nanoparticles. The study develops a convenient method for the green synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles by utilizing fresh root extract of the four-year old Panax ginseng plant, and evaluated the antimicrobial applications of silver nanoparticles against pathogenic microorganisms. P. ginseng is a well-known herbal medicinal plant, and its active ingredients are mainly ginsenosides. The fresh root of the 4 year old P. ginseng plant has been explored for the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles without the use of any additional reducing and capping agents. The reduction of silver nitrate led to the formation of silver nanoparticles within 2 h of reaction at 80 degrees C. The gold nanoparticles were also successfully synthesized by the reduction of auric acid at 80 degrees C, within 5 min of reaction. The biosynthesized gold and silver nanoparticles were characterized by techniques using various instruments, viz. ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis spectroscopy), field emission transmission electron microscopy (FE-TEM), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), elemental mapping, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). In addition, the silver nanoparticles have shown antimicrobial potential against Bacillus anthracis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Characterization and in vitro biological activities of Thai traditional fermented shrimp pastes.
AB  - In this work, chemical and biological characteristics of two types of Thai fermented shrimp paste, Kapi Ta Dam and Kapi Ta Deang, at different fermentation periods and their raw materials were investigated. Kapi had low water activity and high proteins with high glutamic acid and lysine. Both Kapis, which had different sources, showed similar characteristics. The number of lactic acid bacteria in the products increased during the early stages of fermentation. Free alpha-amino acid contents in the products increased with the fermentation time. The water extracts from Kapi products showed strong antioxidative activities against ABTS(+) radical, and ACE inhibitory activity but they did not exhibit antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. Biological activities in Kapi could be developed by fermentation process, enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins and non-enzymatic browning reactions. Kapi could, thus, serve as a potential source of natural bioactive substances.
TI  - Characterization of Deep Sea Fish Gut Bacteria with Antagonistic Potential, from  Centroscyllium fabricii (Deep Sea Shark).
AB  - The bacterial isolates from Centroscyllium fabricii (deep sea shark) gut were screened for antagonistic activity by cross-streak method and disc diffusion assay. This study focuses on strain BTSS-3, which showed antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria including Salmonella Typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus macerans and Bacillus pumilus. BTSS3 was subjected to phenotypic characterization using biochemical tests, SEM imaging, exoenzyme profiling and antibiotic susceptibility tests. Comparative 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis indicated that this strain belonged to the genus Bacillus, with high (98 %) similarity to 16S rDNA sequences of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The chemical nature of the antibacterial substance was identified by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. The antibacterial activity was reduced by the action of these enzymes pointing out its peptide nature. It was observed from the growth and production kinetics that the bacteriocin was produced in the eighth hour of incubation, i.e., during the mid-log growth phase of the bacteria.
TI  - [Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra Oaxaca, Mexico].
AB  - Specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in Southern sierra  Oaxaca, Mexico. Bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. They have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. To contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. For this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from February to October 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. Each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees C. Bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and biochemical tests. We obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. We found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum Proteobacteria and the family Enterobacteriaceae. Statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. It was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with Bacillus cereus, B. sp. X. sp., as well as, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermis, Aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. Bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. These bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. By understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.
TI  - Mechanical and antibacterial properties of novel high performance chitosan/nanocomposite films.
AB  - Zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle was successfully synthesized using hydrothermal method as well as, silver (Ag) nanoparticle was direct prepared during chitosan nanocomposites preparation. Chitosan films were investigated by recognized the effect of kinds of acids (formic or acetic acid). Correspondingly, using of concentrated NaOH was checking for facilitating de-casting of the films. Utilization of formic acid arisen higher quality films than those films produced using acetic acid as solvent. Optimization was based on the mechanical properties for both types of acids solvent. Furthermore, the elasticity of the prepared films was enhanced by blending hydroxyl ethylcellulose (HEC) with chitosan. Loading the films by silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles (Ag-NPs and ZnO) was achieved during the preparation of films under the optimum conditions. Characterizations of the prepared ZnO nanoparticles and the prepared nanocomposites films were investigated by FT-IR, XRD, SEM, TEM and EDAX. Chitosan nanocomposite films displayed good Antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhamrium, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocyte. Therefore, these films can be used for packaging applications.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal and in vitro antileukaemia activity of metal complexes  with thiosemicarbazones.
AB  - 1-phenyl-3-methyl-4-benzoyl-5-pyrazolone 4-ethyl-thiosemicarbazone (HL) and its copper(II), vanadium(V) and nickel(II) complexes: [Cu(L)(Cl)].C(2)H(5)OH.(1), [Cu(L)(2)].H(2)O (2), [Cu(L)(Br)].H(2)O.CH(3)OH (3), [Cu(L)(NO(3))].2C(2)H(5)OH (4), [VO(2)(L)].2H(2)O (5), [Ni(L)(2)].H(2)O (6), were synthesized and characterized. The ligand has been characterized by elemental analyses, IR, (1) H NMR and (13) C NMR spectroscopy. The tridentate nature of the ligand is evident from the IR spectra. The copper(II), vanadium(V) and nickel(II) complexes have been characterized by different physico-chemical techniques such as molar conductivity, magnetic susceptibility measurements and electronic, infrared and electron paramagnetic resonance spectral studies. The structures of the ligand and its copper(II) (2, 4), and vanadium(V) (5) complexes have been determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The composition of the coordination polyhedron of the central atom in 2, 4 and 5 is different. The tetrahedral coordination geometry of Cu was found in complex 2 while in complex 4, it is square planar, in complex 5 the coordination polyhedron of the central ion is distorted square pyramid. The in vitro antibacterial activity of the complexes against Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and the antifungal activity against Candida albicans strains was higher for the metal complexes than for free ligand. The effect of the free ligand and its metal complexes on the proliferation of HL-60 cells was tested.
TI  - Biogenic silver and gold nanoparticles synthesized using red ginseng root extract, and their applications.
AB  - In the present study, we report a green methodology for the synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles, using the root extract of the herbal medicinal plant Korean red ginseng. The silver and gold nanoparticles were synthesized within 1 h and 10 min respectively. The nanoparticles generated were not aggregated, and remained stable for a long time, which suggests the nature of nanoparticles. The phytochemicals and ginsenosides present in the root extract assist in reducing and stabilizing the synthesized nanoparticles. The red ginseng root extract-generated silver nanoparticles exhibit antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms including Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. In addition, the silver nanoparticles exhibit biofilm degrading activity against S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, the present study opens up a new possibility of synthesizing silver and gold nanoparticles in a green and rapid manner using Korean red ginseng root extract, and explores their biomedical applications.
TI  - Safety, efficacy and utility of methods of transferring adhesive and cohesive Escherichia coli cells to microplates to avoid aerosols.
AB  - The virtual colony count (VCC) microbiological assay has been utilized for over a decade to measure the antimicrobial activity of peptides such as defensins and LL-37 against biosafety level (BSL)-1 and BSL-2 bacteria including Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In addition, a modified pipetting technique was presented in a 2011 study of defensin activity against the BSL-3 pathogen Bacillus anthracis. Both studies were published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. Here I report that the method can also detect cross-contamination caused by aerosols utilizing the VCC method of data analysis by quantitative growth kinetics (QGK). The QGK threshold time, or T t, equivalent to the cycle time C t reported in 1996 by Heid et al., precisely identifies when wells were inoculated.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of seven Eucalyptus species essential oils leaves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In this paper, we have studied the essential oils chemical composition of the leaves of seven Eucalyptus species developed in Tunisia. Eucalyptus leaves were picked from trees growing in different arboretums in Tunisia. Choucha and Mrifeg arboretums located in Sedjnene, region of Bizerte (Choucha: E. maideni, E. astrengens et E. cinerea; Mrifeg : E. leucoxylon), Korbous arboretums located in the region of Nabeul, North East Tunisia with sub-humid bioclimate, (E. lehmani), Souiniet-Ain Drahem arboretum located in region of Jendouba (E. sideroxylon, E. bicostata). Essential oils were individually tested against a large panel of microorganisms including Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6539), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC29212), Listeria ivanovii (RBL 30), Bacillus cereus (ATCC11778). RESULTS: The yield of essential oils ranged from 1.2% to 3% (w/w) for the different Eucalyptus species. All essential oils contain alpha-pinene, 1,8-cineol and pinocarveol-trans for all Eucalyptus species studied. The 1,8-cineol was the major compound in all species (49.07 to 83.59%). Diameter of inhibition zone of essential oils of Eucalyptus species varied from 10 to 29 mm. The largest zone of inhibition was obtained for Bacillus cereus (E. astrengens) and the lowest for Staphylococcus aureus (E. cinerea). The essential oils from E. maideni, E. astrengens, E. cinerea (arboretum of Bizerte), E. bicostata (arboretum of Aindraham) showed the highest antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus. CONCLUSION: The major constituents of Eucalyptus leaves essential oils are 1,8-cineol (49.07 to 83.59%) and alpha-pinene (1.27 to 26.35%). The essential oils from E. maideni, E. astrengens, E. cinerea, E. bicostata showed the highest antibacterial activity against Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus, they may have potential applications in food and pharmaceutical products.
TI  - Evaluation of antioxidant, total phenol and flavonoid content and antimicrobial activities of Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit) of underutilized tropical fruit extracts.
AB  - Artocarpus altilis (breadfruit) pulp, peel and whole fruit were extracted with various solvents such as hexane, dichloromethane (DCM) and methanol. The antioxidant activity of these extracts were examined using the stable 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging test. IC50 was 55 +/- 5.89 mug/ml for the pulp part of methanol extract. In the beta-carotene bleaching assay, the antioxidant activity was 90.02 +/- 1.51 % for the positive control (Trolox) and 88.34 +/- 1.31 % for the pulp part of the fruit methanol extract. The total phenolic content of the crude extracts was determined using the Folin-Ciocalteu procedure; methanol pulp part demonstrated the highest phenol content value of 781 +/- 52.97 mg GAE/g of dry sample. While the total flavonoid content was determined using the aluminium chloride colorimetric assay, the highest value of 6213.33 +/- 142.22 mg QE/g was indicated by pulp part of the fruit methanol extract. The antimicrobial activity of the crude extracts was tested using disc diffusion method against pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Candida albicans. Methanol extract of pulp part was recorded to have the highest zone of inhibition against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and MBC/minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) for the extracts were also determined using the microdilution method ranging from 4000 to 63 mug/ml against pathogenic microbes. The MBC/MFC values varied from 250 to 4000 mug/ml. A correlation between antioxidant activity assays, antimicrobial activity and phenolic content was established. The results shows that the various parts of A. altilis fruit extracts promising antioxidant activities have potential bioactivities due to high content of phenolic compounds.
TI  - Characterisation of antimicrobial extracts from dandelion root (Taraxacum officinale) using LC-SPE-NMR.
AB  - Plant extracts have traditionally been used as sources of natural antimicrobial compounds, although in many cases, the compounds responsible for their antimicrobial efficacy have not been identified. In this study, crude and dialysed extracts from dandelion root (Taraxacum officinale) were evaluated for their antimicrobial properties against Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial strains. The methanol hydrophobic crude extract (DRE3) demonstrated the strongest inhibition of microbial growth against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Bacillus cereus strains. Normal phase (NP) fractionation of DRE3 resulted in two fractions (NPF4 and NPF5) with enhanced antimicrobial activity. Further NP fractionation of NPF4 resulted in two fractions (NPF403 and NPF406) with increased antimicrobial activity. Further isolation and characterisation of compounds in NPF406 using liquid chromatography solid phase extraction nuclear magnetic resonance LC-SPE-NMR resulted in the identification of 9-hydroxyoctadecatrienoic acid and 9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, while the phenolic compounds vanillin, coniferaldehyde and p-methoxyphenylglyoxylic acid were also identified respectively. The molecular mass of these compounds was confirmed by LC mass spectroscopy (MS)/MS. In summary, the antimicrobial efficacy of dandelion root extracts demonstrated in this study support the use of dandelion root as a source of natural antimicrobial compounds.

TI  - Phenolic acids profile, antioxidant and antibacterial activity of chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle (Asteraceae).
AB  - Chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle ethanolic extracts were chemically analysed with respect to phenolics. Twelve phenolic acids were separated and identified by HPLC-DAD and the presence of rosmarinic acid was additionally confirmed by LC-MS. Five methods were applied for the evaluation of extracts' antioxidant properties (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, chelating activity, Briggs-Rauscher reaction), while the antibacterial activity was tested against some of the major food-borne pathogens (Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella Infantis, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus). Immortelle extract was the richest in phenolics with a dominant flavonoid fraction, while the other two extracts contained higher amount of non-flavonoids. The phenolic acid profile also varied; high concentration of rosmarinic acid was found in chamomile and common yarrow, while caffeic acid was dominant in immortelle. The best antioxidant properties were obtained for chamomile extract, while good antimicrobial activity, especially against Gram-positive bacterial species, was detected for immortelle. The obtained results could be used as a tool for chemotaxonomic classification of the investigated plants or for their potential application as natural antioxidants/antimicrobials.
TI  - Quantitative and qualitative evaluation of bio-aerosols in surgery rooms and emergency department of an educational hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bio-aerosols are a potential hazard in hospitals and are mostly produced by hospital staff, patients and visitors. Bio-aerosols are solid or liquid particles pending in the air and they consist of aerosols accompanying micro-organisms or organic compounds of micro-organisms such as endotoxin, metabolite, toxin and other parts of organism. Those are a potential hazard in hospitals and are mostly produced by hospital staff, patients and visitors. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the types and amount of bacterial contamination in operating rooms and emergency department of an educational hospital in Zahedan, South-East of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 72 samples were collected from three operating rooms and three rooms in the emergency department of an educational hospital during 2012. On the first day of every month, a sample was taken from each room during the morning shift; active sampling was done on plates consisting of blood agar and brain-heart infusion agar (BHI) for 10 minutes in the axis of a one-story Anderson impactor (flow rate 28.1 litter per minutes) and SIBATA air pump SIP 32-L and samples were then placed in a 35 degrees C Incubator. Bacterial colonies were counted; warm coloring and differential tests were done and the data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. RESULTS: Seventeen types of bacteria were detected including Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, Viridians, Pneumococcus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Diphtheroid, Citrobacter and Enterobacter. Quantitative bacterial results showed that the number of observed bacteria in the emergency department with an average of 103.88 +/- 33.84 cfu/m(3) was more than that of the surgery rooms with an average of 63.32 +/- 32.94 cfu/m(3). Furthermore, the highest average number of all counted colonies (106 +/- 28.45 cfu/m(3)) was determined in autumn. In all samples, S. aureus and Micrococcus were the most detected bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested relatively relaxed limits of 100 cfu/m(3) for bacteria and 50 cfu/m(3) for fungi in the hospital air. Therefore, quantitative and qualitative outcomes of this study demonstrate that contamination level and bacterial variety in surgery rooms and emergency departments is high and effective measures must be taken to control the possible health risks.
TI  - An outbreak of gastroenteritis linked to a buffet lunch served at a Canberra restaurant.
AB  - In 2013, an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness occurred following a buffet lunch at a restaurant in Canberra. An investigation was conducted to identify the cause of illness and to implement appropriate public health measures to prevent further disease. We conducted a retrospective cohort study via telephone interviews, using a structured questionnaire developed from the restaurant buffet menu. A case was defined as someone who ate the buffet lunch at the restaurant on the implicated date and developed any symptoms of gastrointestinal illness (such as diarrhoea, abdominal pain and nausea) following the consumption of food. A total of 74% (225/303) of known attendees were interviewed, of whom 56% (125/225) had become ill. The median incubation period and duration of illness were 13 and 19 hours respectively. The most commonly reported symptoms were diarrhoea (94%, 118/125) and abdominal pain (82%, 103/125). A toxin-mediated gastrointestinal illness was suspected based on the incubation period, duration of illness and the symptoms. The environmental health investigation identified a lack of designated hand washing facilities in the kitchen, an absence of thermometers for measuring food temperatures and several maintenance and minor cleaning issues. A number of food samples were taken for microbiological analysis. Multivariable analysis showed that illness was significantly associated with consuming curried prawns (OR 18.4, 95% CI 8.6-39.3, P < 0.001) and Caesar salad (OR 3.6, 95% CI 1.8-7.5, P 0.001). Enterotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus were identified in leftover samples of cooked buffet food, but this food was not epidemiologically implicated. The investigation suggested that a breakdown in cleanliness, temperature control and food handling practices may have resulted in contamination of the buffet food. In order to prevent such outbreaks in the future, caterers and restaurateurs need to ensure they have the appropriate facilities and procedures in place if planning to cater for large groups.
TI  - Analysis of Bacillus cereus toxicity using PCR, ELISA and a lateral flow device.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the performance of immunodetection methods and PCR analysis of enterotoxigenic Bacillus cereus strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight enterotoxigenic B. cereus group strains linked to food-borne outbreaks and illnesses were studied with 30 exclusivity nonenterotoxigenic strains including Bacillus amyoliquifaciens, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella and Escherichia coli for this assessment. The PCR results showed 80% agreement with immunoassays for the Nhe target and 84% for the Hbl product. All exclusivity strains were PCR and serologically negative. CONCLUSIONS: PCR has proven to be a valuable tool when used in conjunction with immunoassays to quickly identify enterotoxigenic B. cereus group strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study assessed the utility of rapid methods to characterize enterotoxigenic profiles of B. cereus group strains. The identification of enterotoxigenic bacteria and any associated toxins detected from food products is essential in food defense programs as public health officials search for methods to rapidly and accurately screen a global food supply.
TI  - Introducing Urtica dioica, A Native Plant of Khuzestan, As an Antibacterial Medicinal Plant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urtica dioica is a flowering plant with long history of use in folk medicine and as a food source. OBJECTIVES: This study examined in vitro antibacterial potential of alcoholic extracts of U. dioica. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hydroalcoholic extracts from aerial parts were prepared using aqueous solution of ethanol and methanol and their inhibitory effects against clinical isolates was examined by disc diffusion method at different doses. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) indexes were also investigated. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was also performed to find structural changes of affected bacteria consequent to exposing with extracts. RESULTS: Both extracts were active against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli with respectively 16, 10, 18, and 14 mm (methanolic) and 11, 9, 17, and 16 mm (ethanolic) inhibition zone. The MIC of ethanolic extract against S. epidermidis and E. coli was respectively 10 and 40 mg/mL. The MIC of methanolic extract against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was 40 and 10 mg/mL, respectively. The MBC was found only for S. epidermidis (20 mg/mL). In SEM analysis the round shape of S. epidermidis was changed and irregular shapes were appeared, which suggest that the main target of these extracts was cell wall. CONCLUSIONS: Extracts of U. dioica showed significant antibacterial effect against some clinically important pathogenic bacteria. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that U. dioica is useful as antibacterial and bactericidal agent in treating infectious diseases.
TI  - Evaluation of HACCP system implementation on the quality of mixed fresh-cut salad prepared in a university canteen: a case study.
AB  - The increasing awareness that foods can represent vehicles for health risk factors has caused scientists and public authorities to multiply their efforts to reduce these risks to within acceptable limits. Nevertheless, some challenging issues still remain unsolved and new ones have recently emerged, such as the increase in outbreaks of foodborne diseases originating from the consumption of meals at catering facilities. The study described in this article was aimed at evaluating the microbiological quality of mixed fresh-cut salads at an Italian university canteen operating in conformity with the hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP) system. The effectiveness of the preventive and corrective measures taken was also assessed with respect to the frequency of unsatisfactory salad samples. During the investigation, E. coli, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes were never detected. By contrast, a high number of samples exceeded the mandatory or suggested limits for food processing hygiene (in terms of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and sulfite-reducing clostridia counts). Despite the introduction of a series of preventive and corrective actions, the results were only partially satisfactory; this was most likely due to the impossibility of having available an adequate level of human resources that are indispensable to correctly putting the HACCP procedures into daily practice.
TI  - Effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: A review.
AB  - Abstract According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. Climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. Animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. This review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall, drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, Bacillus cereus, Brucella, Campylobacter, Clostridium, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio and Yersinia enterocolitica. These relationships are then used to predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. The development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.
TI  - Propidium monoazide combined with real-time PCR for selective detection of viable Staphylococcus aureus in milk powder and meat products.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a spherical, gram-positive, pathogenic bacterium commonly associated with bovine mastitis and clinical infections. It is also recognized as a pathogen that causes outbreaks of food poisoning. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a rapid and reliable technique that combines propidium monoazide (PMA) staining with real-time quantitative (q)PCR to detect and quantify viable cells of Staph. aureus in milk powder and meat products. The inclusivity and exclusivity of the assay were evaluated using 58 strains belonging to 14 species. Serial dilutions of Staph. aureus cells were used to establish a standard curve and to confirm the effect of PMA treatment. Milk powder and meat products were used as the spiked foods, and the ability of PMA-qPCR to eliminate nonviable cells was determined in milk powder. Furthermore, meat products were inoculated with different concentrations of Staph. aureus and 10(5) cfu/g of Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enterica to test the interference by nontarget microorganisms. When PMA treatment was applied before DNA extraction, we were able to eliminate false-positive results with little effect on viable cells. The PMA-qPCR assay was specific and more sensitive than conventional PCR, and the level of detection was 3.0x10(2) cfu/g in spiked milk powder. Additionally, we observed no significant interference for the detection of viable Staph. aureus from other nontarget bacteria. The PMA-qPCR protocol is an effective and rapid method to quantify viable cells of Staph. aureus in food samples. The PMA-qPCR assay is specific and reliable, offering a valuable diagnostic tool for routine analysis in food and clinical diagnostic research at a reasonable cost.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activities of Three Medicinal Plants and Investigation of Flavonoids of Tripleurospermum disciforme.
AB  - Rosa damascena, Tripleurospermum disciforme and Securigera securidaca were used as disinfectant agents and for treatment of some disease in folk medicine of Iran. The antimicrobial effects of different fractions of seeds extract of S. securidaca, petals extract of R. damascena and aerial parts extract of T. disciforme were examined against some gram positive, gram negative and fungi by cup plate diffusion method. The petroleum ether and chloroform fractions of S. securidaca showed antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, while its methanol fraction had no antibacterial effects. R. damascena petals extract demonstrated antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. T. disciforme aerial parts extract exhibited antimicrobial effects only against S. aureus and S. epidermidis. None of the fractions had any antifungal activities. Therefore, present study confirmed utility of these plants as disinfectant agents. Six flavonoids were isolated from T. disciforme: Luteolin, Quercetin-7-O-glucoside, Kaempferol, Kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, Apigenin and Apigenin-7-O-glucoside. The flavonoids and the antimicrobial activity of T. disciforme are reported for the first time.
TI  - Antimicrobial and inhibition on heat-induced protein denaturation of constituents isolated from Polygonatumverticillatum rhizomes.
AB  - This study was designed to assess the susceptibility of various microorganisms and inhibition on heat-induced protein denaturation against diosgenin and santonin, isolated from Polygonatum verticillatum rhizomes. Both diosgenin and santonin showed significant zone of inhibition when studied against various Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi). In antifungal assay, only santonin exhibited profound sensitivity against various fungi (Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma harzianum and Fusarium oxysporum) used in the test. Both diosgenin and santonin also exhibited marked attenuation on heat-induced protein denaturation in a concentration-dependent manner with EC50 values of 375 and 310 mug/mL, respectively. In conclusion, both the isolated compounds have antimicrobial potential supported by strong inhibition on protein denaturation and thus support the antimicrobial uses of plant in traditional system of treatment.
TI  - Spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-Clostridium activity from Actinomadura sp. 2EPS.
AB  - The rare actinomycetes strain 2EPS was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell wall, and 16S rRNA gene sequence indicates that 2EPS belongs to genus Actinomadura. In addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the relationships of this strain to other members of Actinomadura. A butanol extract with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. The structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)H-NMR and (13)C-NMR) and mass spectrometric analysis (HR-TOF-MS). Compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the Japanese patent number JP 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are BE-45722A (1), BE-45722B (2) and BE-45722C (3), respectively. All compounds were active against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633) with low MIC values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. Moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar MIC values, against Clostridium perfringens S107 at 0.63 microg/ml and C. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. These results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of Clostridium infections. Overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of Pulicaria vulgaris essential oil  from Iran.
AB  - The present study investigated the chemical composition of the essential oil (EO) from aerial parts (flowering stage) of Pulicaria vulgaris Gaertn. by GC-MS. Also, the antimicrobial activity of the EO against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and fungi (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans) was tested. In total, 23 compounds were recognized, accounting for 98.08% of the EO. The main compounds in the EO were thymol (50.22%), p-menth-6-en-2-one (carvotanacetone, 20.2%), thymol isobutyrate (16.88%), menthan-2-one (4.31%), 1-methyl-1,2-propanedione (4.13%), 2,5-dimethoxy-p-cymene (4.01%), myrtenol (1.22%), linalool (1.1%), and beta-myrcene (1.9%). Results of antibacterial test of P. vulgaris essential oil showed that all assayed concentrations significantly inhibited the growth of B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa at P < 0.05. MIC for B. cereus, S. aureus, E. coli, P. aeruginosa was 17.5, 25.2, 19.4 and 33.2 mug/mL respectively; antifungal screening of the essential oil of P. vulgaris showed that the oil significantly inhibited the growth of A. niger and C. albicans (MIC = 15.5 and 9.9 mug/mL, respectively). Results of cytotoxicity assay showed that the essential oil exhibited a significant cytotoxic activity against both cell lines. In case of MCF-7 and Hep-G2 cell lines, IC50 of the essential oil were 5.36 and 7.16 mug/ml, respectively. The potent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of the EO may be attributed to its high contents of thymol, carvotanacetone and thymol isobutyrate. Antimicrobial and antitumor chemotherapies are showing diminishing effectiveness because of emergence of drug-resistance. Hence, using efficient natural chemotherapeutic agents such as Pulicaria vulgaris essential oil with fewer side effects is an encouraging approach to fight cancer and infectious diseases in medicine, agriculture, food science and related fields.
TI  - Evaluating the efficiency of humic acid to remove micro-organisms from denture base material.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficiency of humic acid substances on removing micro-organisms from denture base materials. BACKGROUND: Old denture wearer needs effective, easy-use and safe denture-cleaning material. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Square-shaped, heat-polymerised acrylic resin specimens (n = 550) were prepared and divided into five groups (n = 110 for each) corresponding to the microbial contamination (Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Contaminated specimens were randomly assigned to the application of five different denture-cleaning agents as follows (n = 20 for each): Kloroben, Corsodyl, Steradent, Corega, experimental solution with humic acid. Ten specimens were assessed as an experimental control carried out simultaneously for the treatment groups for each micro-organism. It was divided into two groups: negative control and positive control (n = 5 for each). All acrylic specimens were incubated 37 degrees C for 24 h (for bacterial strains) and 37 degrees C for 48 h (for yeast strains). After incubation period, all brain-heart infusion broths (BHI) which contain disinfectant acrylic specimens were cultured on 5% sheep blood agar (for bacteria) and Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for yeast using loop. The numbers of colony-forming units per millilitre (CFU/ml) were calculated. The results were analysed by Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p = 0.05). RESULTS: Corsodyl and Kloroben completely eliminated the adherence of all investigated micro-organisms (100%) and showed the highest removal activity compared with other cleaning agents (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between Corsodyl and Kloroben (p >/= 0.05), and there was no statistically significant difference between Corega, Steradent and experimental solution (p >/= 0.05). CONCLUSION: Humic acid could be used as an alternative 'natural' solution for denture-cleaning agent.
TI  - The Cyclic Antibacterial Peptide Enterocin AS-48: Isolation, Mode of Action, and  Possible Food Applications.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus. It contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. The conformation of enterocin AS-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. Enterocin AS-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on Gram-positive bacteria. Sensitivity of Gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. Eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. This cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. Microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in Bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. Enterocin AS-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. The potential applications of enterocin AS-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus spp., Paenibacillus spp., Geobacillus stearothermophilus, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Staphylococcus carnosus, Lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). The efficacy of enterocin AS-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high hydrostatic pressure.
TI  - Novel polycarboxylate porphyrins: synthesis, characterization, photophysical properties and preliminary antimicrobial study against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - We describe the synthesis, characterization and photophysical properties of two new polycarboxylic photosensitizers. Owing to their structural design, these two compounds show water solubilities larger than natural carboxylic photosensitizers (e.g., protoporphyrin IX, hematoporphyrin, etc.) and also good singlet oxygen quantum yields. These compounds were tested as photo-antimicrobial agents against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus strains. Results reveal that their photocytotoxicities are strongly dependent on their amphiphilic character and more precisely the number and position of the carboxylic acid and mesityl substituents.
TI  - Microbiological quality of seasoned roasted laver and potential hazard control in a real processing line.
AB  - Microbiological quality of laver, one of the edible seaweeds, has not been reported in a real processing line. Laver or supplements were collected from six manufacturers (A to F) to assess potential microbiological hazards and the critical control points in commercial processing lines. Aerobic plate counts (APC), coliform counts, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were enumerated, and the presence of B. cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, S. aureus, and V. parahaemolyticus were confirmed during processing. The raw material, i.e., dried laver, had a high initial APC level (4.4 to 7.8 log CFU/g), which decreased gradually during processing (final products, 1.3 to 5.9 log CFU/g). Coliforms and B. cereus were not detected in any of the final products, but they were present in some raw materials and semiprocessed products in quantitative analysis. After enrichment for recovery of stress-injured cells, E. coli and foodborne pathogens were not detected in any samples, with the exception of B. cereus. Heat-injured and spore-forming B. cereus isolates were occasionally obtained from some of the raw materials and products after enrichment, thus B. cereus may be a potential microbiological hazard that should be controlled using strategic intervention measures. Secondary roasting (260 to 400 degrees C, 2 to 10 s) significantly reduced the APC (maximum log reduction, 4.7 log CFU/g), and this could be a key intervention step for controlling microbiological hazards during processing (critical control point). When this step was performed appropriately, according to the processing guide for each plant, the microorganisms were inactivated more successfully in the products. This study provides scientific evidence that may facilitate the development of strategies for microbiological hazard control and hygienic management guidelines for real manufacturing plants.
TI  - Effect of white mustard essential oil on the growth of foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms and the effect of food components on its efficacy.
AB  - Antimicrobial preservative compounds are added to foods to target specific pathogens and spoilage organisms. White mustard essential oil (WMEO) is an extract that contains 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, a compound which has been demonstrated to have antimicrobial activity in limited studies. The objective of this research was to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of WMEO against gram-positive and gram-negative spoilage and pathogenic bacteria and determine the effect of food components on the antimicrobial activity. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Lactobacillus fermentum, as well as the acid- and preservative-resistant yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, were evaluated. All microorganisms were inhibited by WMEO at 8.3 g/liter (equivalent to 1,000 mg/liter 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate). In general, WMEO was more effective against gram-negative than against gram-positive bacteria. Salmonella Enteritidis and S. pombe were the most sensitive, with inhibition at as low as 2.1 g/liter. The effects on growth profiles varied but included increased lag phases and lethality, indicating both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity. Soybean oil had a negative effect on the efficacy of WMEO against L. monocytogenes, and at 5% soybean oil, the antimicrobial activity against Salmonella Enteritidis was eliminated after 48 h. Sodium caseinate at 1% also negated the antimicrobial effect of WMEO against Salmonella Enteritidis and decreased its effectiveness against L. monocytogenes. The presence of starch had no significant effect on the antimicrobial activity of WMEO against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis. Thus, WMEO is effective against a wide range of microorganisms and has potential to be used in foods, depending upon the target microorganism and food components present.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of Calotropis gigantea L.
AB  - The present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of Calotropis gigantea L. toward biomedical applications. Initially, synthesis of AgNPs was confirmed through UV-Vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (SPR) at 420 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy confirms the presence of silver as a major constituent element. X-ray diffractograms displays that the synthesized AgNPs were biphasic crystalline nature. Electron microscopic studies such as Field emission scanning electron microscopic (Fe-SEM) and Transmission electron microscope (TEM) reveals that synthesized AgNPs are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. Further, crude latex aqueous extract and synthesized AgNPs were evaluated against different bacterial pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Enterococci sp, Shigella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized AgNPs exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. Likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized AgNPs against tested HeLa cells. The output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized AgNPs using latex of C. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and genotypic-phenotypic characteristics of bacteriocin-producing Bacillus subtilis KKU213: potential as a probiotic strain.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and probiotic properties of Bacillus subtilis strain KKU213, isolated from local soil, were investigated. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) of a KKU213 culture containing crude bacteriocins exhibited inhibitory effects on Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The antibacterial activity of the CFS precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate (AS) remained even after treatment at 60 and 100 degrees C, at pH 4 and 10 and with proteolytic enzymes, detergents and heavy metals. When analyzed by SDS-PAGE and overlaid with the indicator strains B. cereus and S. aureus, the 40% AS precipitate exhibited inhibitory activity on proteins smaller than 10 kDa. However, proteins larger than 25 kDa and smaller than 10 kDa were still observed on a native protein gel. Purified subtilosin A was prepared by Amberlite XAD-16 bead extraction and HPLC and analyzed by Nano-LC-QTOF-MS. Its molecular mass was found to be 3.4 kDa, and it retained its antibacterial activity. These results are consistent with the detection of the anti-listerial subtilosin A gene of the sbo/alb cluster in the KKU213 strain, which is 100% identical to that of B. subtilis subsp. subtilis 168. In addition to stable and cyclic subtilosin A, a mixture of many extracellular antibacterial peptides was also detected in the KKU213 culture. The KKU213 strain produced extracellular amylase, cellulase, lipase and protease, is highly acid-resistant (pH 2) when cultured in inulin and promotes health and reduces infection of intestinally colonized broiler chickens. Therefore, we propose that bacteriocin-producing B. subtilis KKU213 could be used as a potential probiotic strain or protective culture.
TI  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of Pleurostylia capensis Turcz (Loes) (celastraceae).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pleurostylia capensis is a large tree that can reach the maximum height of 20 m long, and it have been traditionally used as cosmetic, for steam bath, ritual body wash, and as a purgative to treat symptoms of witchcraft. Using ethanol, chloroform, dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA), and water extracts, leaves, bark and roots of Pleurostylia capensis were investigated scientifically for their effectiveness in antimicrobial, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities using standard methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extracts were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis), Gram negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Klebsiella oxytoca, Streptococcus pyogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium), and Candida albicans. The antioxidant activity was investigated using 2, 2-diphenlyl-1-picrylhadrazyl (DPPH), free radical scavenging assay. The anti-inflammatory activity of P. capensis extracts was evaluated against both cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX 1 and 2). RESULTS: The ethyl acetate extracts of P. capensis showed a strong antimicrobial activity against B. cereus, K. pneumonia, S. pyogenes, and M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.39 and 0.78 mg/ml. While the ethanol bark extract was most active against M. smegmatis with MIC value of 0.78 mg/ml; the least potent activity was observed with dichloromethane, chloroform and water extracts, with an MIC value ranging from 1.56 mg/ml to 50.0 mg/ml. The plant extracts proved to be good antioxidant agent, whereas extracts of ethanol were the most active, with IC50 ranging from 1.00 to 1.74 microg/ml, which is lower, and in close range to Vitamin C (1.40 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Its moderation to potent inhibitory activity was observed in all extracts. Ethanol and dichloromethane extracts were among the most potent when compared to water and petroleum ether extracts. The water extracts showed to be nontoxic on the Hek cell line with an IC50 value of 204.0, and 207.3 microg/ml (roots and bark) respectively. The dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, chloroform and ethanol extracts showed to be toxic on the Hek cell, with IC50 range from 5.94 to 42.91microg/ml. The results obtained indicate the effectiveness of these plants.
TI  - Pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) in  infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Linum usitatissimum, commonly known as Flaxseed has traditionally been used for the management of diarrhea and gastrointestinal infections. This study was planned to assess pharmacological basis for the medicinal use of Flaxseed in infectious and non-infectious diarrhea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The crude aqueous-methanolic extract of Flaxseed was studied using the in vivo castor oil-induced diarrhea, gut motility and enteropooling assays. Mechanistic basis was further elucidated by testing the inhibitory effect on spontaneously contracting isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, suspended in a 10ml tissue bath containing Tyrode solution, maintained at 37 degrees C and aerated with carbogen. Antibacterial efficacy of the Flaxseed extract was tested against different enteric and non-enteric pathogenic bacteria using in vitro antibacterial assays. RESULTS: Flaxseed extract reduced the diarrheal score in mice, by 39%, 63.90% and 68.34% at the respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. Intestinal secretions were reduced by 24.12%, 28.09% and 38.80%, whereas the intestinal motility was reduced by 31.66%, 46.98% and 56.20% at respective doses of 100, 300 and 500mg/kg. When tested on isolated rabbit jejunum preparations, Flaxseed extract produced a dose-dependent inhibition of both spontaneous and high K(+) (80mM)-induced contractions, and shifted the concentration-response curves of Ca(++) to the right with suppression of the maximum response, similar to that caused by verapamil. Flaxseed extract was found to possess bactericidal activity at the tested concentrations of 12.5mg/ml, against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), Escherichia coli K1 (88.88%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (98.76%), Bacillus cereus (92.64%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (76.83%) and Salmonella typhi (26.91+/-3.35%). The concentration of 10mg/ml showed bactericidal effects against all the aforementioned pathogens except Escherichia coli K1, whereas for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, it was bacteriostatic at this concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that Linum usitatissimum (Flaxseed) extract exhibits antidiarrheal and antispasmodic activities by virtue of its antimotility and antisecretory effects which are mediated possibly through inhibition of Ca(++) channels, though additional mechanism(s) cannot be ruled out. Flaxseed extract proved effective against both enteric and non-enteric pathogens causing diarrhea, thus ensuring wide coverage and rationalizing its medicinal use in both the infectious and non-infectious diarrhea.
TI  - Production and purification of anti-bacterial biometabolite from wild-type Lactobacillus, isolated from fermented bamboo shoot: future suggestions and a proposed system for secondary metabolite onsite recovery during continuous fermentation.
AB  - Wild-type lactobacillus isolated form Khorisa, a fermented bamboo shoot product of Assam, India were evaluated for production anti-bacterial secondary biometabolites, against Staphylococcus aureus. Submerged fermentation technique was used for the production of secondary anti-microbial biometabolite by a single wild-type lactobacillus strain, which tested positive for the release of anti-bacterial factor(s). Crude cell-free supernatant was obtained, followed by extraction in water-immiscible solvents viz., chloroform, hexane, petroleum ether. Chloroform extract of cell-free crude supernatant showed maximum yield (0.054 g/ml) and inhibited all indicator bacterial strains viz., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. Yields of hexane and petroleum ether extract were 0.052 and 0.026 g/ml, respectively. Minimum lethal dose concentration assay of the chloroform extract showed LDmin values at 27, 1.68, and 1.68 mg/ml for E. coli, S. aureus, and B. cereus, respectively. Kill time for all the indicator bacterial strains were less than 12 h. The efficacy of the anti-bacterial substance seemed to depend on the presence of organic acids, particularly lactic acid. Conceptual-based suggestion for the development of an onsite secondary metabolites recovery system during continuous fermentation has also been attempted.
TI  - Kawasaki disease-specific molecules in the sera are linked to microbe-associated  molecular patterns in the biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis of unknown etiology. The innate immune system is involved in its pathophysiology at the acute phase. We have recently established a novel murine model of KD coronary arteritis by oral administration of a synthetic microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP). On the hypothesis that specific MAMPs exist in KD sera, we have searched them to identify KD-specific molecules and to assess the pathogenesis. METHODS: We performed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of fractionated serum samples from 117 patients with KD and 106 controls. Microbiological and LC-MS evaluation of biofilm samples were also performed. RESULTS: KD samples elicited proinflammatory cytokine responses from human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs). By LC-MS analysis of KD serum samples collected at 3 different periods, we detected a variety of KD-specific molecules in the lipophilic fractions that showed distinct m/z and MS/MS fragmentation patterns in each cluster. Serum KD-specific molecules showed m/z and MS/MS fragmentation patterns almost identical to those of MAMPs obtained from the biofilms formed in vitro (common MAMPs from Bacillus cereus, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus) at the 1st study period, and from the biofilms formed in vivo (common MAMPs from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis/Bacillus cereus/Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus) at the 2nd and 3rd periods. The biofilm extracts from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus also induced proinflammatory cytokines by HCAECs. By the experiments with IgG affinity chromatography, some of these serum KD-specific molecules bound to IgG. CONCLUSIONS: We herein conclude that serum KD-specific molecules were mostly derived from biofilms and possessed molecular structures common to MAMPs from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and Staphylococcus aureus. Discovery of these KD-specific molecules might offer novel insight into the diagnosis and management of KD as well as its pathogenesis.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial and anthelmintic activities with total phenolic contents of Piper betel leaves.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study was conducted to investigate the antibacterial and anthelmintic activities and to determine total phenolic contents of methanolic extract of Piper betel leaves. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The extract was subjected to assay for antibacterial activity using both gram positive and gram negative bacterial strains through disc diffusion method; anthelmintic activity with the determination of paralysis and death time using earthworm (Pheritima posthuma) at five different concentrations and the determination of total phenolic contents using the Folin-ciocalteau method. RESULTS: The extract showed significant (p<0.01) zone of inhibitions against gram positive Staphylococcus aureus [(6.77+/-0.25) mm] and Gram negative Escherichia coli [(8.53+/-0.25) mm], Salmonella typhi [(5.20+/-0.26) mm], Shigella dysenteriae [(11.20+/-0.26) mm] compared to positive control Azithromycin (ranging from 20.10+/-0.17 to 25.20+/-0.35 mm) while no zone inhibitory activity was found for both the extract and the standard drug against Gram positive Bacillus cereus. The extract also showed potent anthelmintic activity requiring less time for paralysis and death compared to the standard drug albendazole (10 mg/ml). At concentrations 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/ml, leaves extract showed paralysis at mean time of 9.83+/-0.60, 8.50+/-0.29, 6.60+/-0.17, 6.20+/-0.44 and 4.16+/-0.60; death at 11.33+/-0.88, 9.67+/-0.33, 7.83+/-0.17, 7.16+/-0.60 and 5.16+/-0.72 minutes, respectively. Whereas the standard drug showed paralysis and death at 19.33+/-0.71 and 51.00+/-0.23 minutes respectively. The extract confirmed the higher concentration of phenolic contents (124.42+/-0.14 mg of GAE /g of extract) when screened for total phenolic compounds. CONCLUSION: As results confirmed potential antibacterial and anthelmintic activities of Piper betel leaves extract, therefore it may be processed for further drug research.
TI  - Infection of cardiovascular implantable electronic devices: detection with sonication, swab cultures, and blood cultures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of patients with cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) is increasing. The purpose of this study was to compare three methods (sonication, swab cultures, and blood cultures) to detect bacteria in infections of CIEDs. METHODS: Patients with pocket infection of CIEDs and/or CIED-associated infective endocarditis were prospectively included. Generators and leads were sonicated together. Swab cultures of the generator pocket and blood cultures were performed. RESULTS: Between January 2009 and September 2012, 18 patients with a CIED infection were recorded, including two definite and four possible CIED-IEs. In 17 patients, blood cultures were performed and the device was analyzed by sonication. A swab culture from the device pocket was performed in 16 cases. Ten (59%) patients received antibiotic therapy before the device was removed. In 15 of 16 cases (94%), bacteria were detected by sonication, while bacteria were detected in only nine (56%) and seven (41%) cases by swab-and blood cultures, respectively. In four cases (24%), sonication was the only method that detected bacteria. The following bacteria were detected by sonication: methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 6), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS; n = 3), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 2), Staphylococcus lugdunensis (n = 1), MSSA/Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1),Bacillus cereus (n = 1), MSSA/P. acnes (n = 1), andP. acnes/CNS (n = 1). All positive swab cultures and all positive blood cultures but one grew the same bacteria as sonication fluid cultures. CONCLUSION: Sonication can be more sensitive than swab cultures or blood cultures in detecting bacteria in infections of CIEDs.
TI  - An in vitro antibacterial and antifungal effects of cadmium(II) complexes of hexamethyltetraazacyclotetradecadiene and isomers of its saturated analogue.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antibacterial and antifungal effects of cadmium(II) complexes with hexamethyltetraazacyclotetradecadiene ligands. METHODS: Five coordinated square pyramidal cadmium(II) complexes and six coordinated square octahedral cadmium(II) complexes have been synthesized by interaction of 5,7,7,12,14,14-hexamethyl-1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradeca-4,11-diene (denoted by L.2HClO4) and C-chiral isomers of its saturated analogue (denoted by 'teta' and 'tetb') with different salts of Cd(2+) ion [e.g. CdI2, Cd(NO3)2.6H2O, CdCl2.2H2O and Cd(ClO4)2.6H2O] in methanolic solution. Complexes of the ligands were investigated for antibacterial activity by disc diffusion method and antifungal effect by poisoned food technique. RESULTS: The newly synthesized cadmium(II) complexes of the ligands were screened as potential antimicrobial agent against a number of medically important bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli) and against two fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus aculeatus). The growth inhibiting activity of the ligands and complexes against bacteria and fungi were compared with the standard antibiotic ampicillin and commercially important antifungal agent, griseofulvin respectively. Among them some of the macrocyclic complexes were found to be more fungitoxic and antibacterial than the reference antifungal drug griseofulvin and antibacterial drug ampicillin respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Hexamethyltetraazacyclotetradecadiene ligands and its complexes could be considered as very potential antibacterial and antifungal agent with further investigation.
TI  - Chemical compositions and antimicrobial activities of Athrixia phylicoides DC. (bush tea), Monsonia burkeana (special tea) and synergistic effects of both combined herbal teas.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the chemical compositions and evaluate the antimicrobial  activity of bush tea (Athrixia phylicoides DC.), special tea (Monsonia burkeana) and synergy (combination of bush tea and special tea). METHODS: Total polyphenols were determined using the methods reported by Singleton and Rossi (1965) and modified by Waterman and Mole (1994). Tannins were determined using vanillin HCL methods described by Prince et al. (1978). Total antioxidants were determined using the methods described by Awika et al. (2004). The micro dilution technique using 96-well micro-plates, as described by Eloff (1998) was used to obtain the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) and minimum microbicidal concentration (MMC) values of the ethanol extracts against the microorganisms under study. The microbes strain used was Gram negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumonia; Gram positive bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and a fungus Candida albicans. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that special tea contains significantly higher content of total polyphenols (8.34 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant (0.83 mg/100 g) as compared to bush tea [total polyphenols (6.41 mg/100g) and total antioxidant (0.63 mg/100g)] and combination of bush tea and special tea [total polyphenols (6.42 mg/100 g) and total antioxidant (0.64 mg/100 g)]. There was no significant difference in tannins between bush tea, special tea and synergy. The results of antimicrobial activity (MIC and MMC) demonstrated that the ethanol extracts of bush tea, special tea and synergy possessed antimicrobial activity against all microorganisms at different zones. The MIC of bush tea ranged from 1.56 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 0.78 to 12.50 mg/mL. Special tea's MIC ranged from 0.39 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 0.01 to 12.50 mg/mL. The MIC of synergy ranged from 3.13 to 12.50 mg/mL while the MMC ranged from 3.13 to 12.50 mg/mL without positive synergistic effect recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Both bush and special tea contain total polyphenols, total antioxidants and tannins with special tea containing a significantly higher total polyphenols and total antioxidant as compared to bush tea and synergy. Bush tea, special tea and synergy possess antimicrobial activity at various degrees.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts of Mentha longifolia L. and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. plants against important human pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the potential antibacterial activity of ethyl acetate and aqueous extracts from Mentha longifolia L. (M. longifolia) and hydroalcoholic extract of Zataria multiflora Boiss. (Z. multiflora) against important human pathogens. METHODS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumonia), Enterobacter cloacae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Staphylococcus aureus were kinds of pathogenic bacteria to determine the antibacterial effect of aqueous and ethyl acetate extracts of M. longifolia and hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora using broth microdiluation method. RESULTS: The lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.25 and 2.5 mg/mL) were observed by the hydroalcoholic extract of Z. multiflora and the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values for K. pneumonia and Serratia marcescens (2.5 and 5 mg/mL) were observed by the aqueous extracts of M. longifolia. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, it seems that Z. multiflora and M. longifolia extracts could inhibit the growth of all of the mentioned bacteria.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Polish herbhoneys.
AB  - The present study focuses on samples of Polish herbhoneys (HHs), their chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was used to analyse eight samples of herbal honeys and three samples of nectar honeys. Their antimicrobial activities were tested on selected Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus schleiferi) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacteria, as well as on pathogenic fungi Candida albicans. Ether extracts of HHs showed significant differences in composition but the principal groups found in the extracts were phenolics and aliphatic hydroxy acids typical of royal jelly and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids. In spite of the differences in chemical composition, antimicrobial activity of the extracts of HHs against all the tested microorganisms except E. coli was observed.
TI  - Prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from Australian dairy farm environments.
AB  - The ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. In dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. This survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3 caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in Victoria, Australia. A total of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. The prevalence of the Bacillus cereus group, Campylobacter, Clostridium perfringens, Cronobacter, Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli, Listeria, Salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), and Yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. The 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the B. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by Cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. The highest occurrence of any pathogen was the B. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. Fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. Salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. Out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. All of the CPS were Staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. Pathogenic Listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 L. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 L. monocytogenes-positive water sample. Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a single raw milk sample. Cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms, predominantly in feed samples. No Y. enterocolitica was detected. Results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. Monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as Cl. perfringens and B. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.
TI  - Identification of multidrug-resistant bacteria and Bacillus cereus from healthcare workers and environmental surfaces in a hospital.

TI  - Terpenoids, flavonoids and caffeic acid derivatives from Salvia viridis L. cvar.  Blue Jeans.
AB  - Three diterpenoids, 1-oxomicrostegiol (1), viroxocin (2), viridoquinone (3), were isolated from the roots of Salvia viridis L. cvar. Blue Jeans. Five known diterpenoids, microstegiol (4), 7alpha-acetoxy-14-hydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (5; 7-O-acetylhorminone tautomer), 7alpha,14-dihydroxy-8,13-abietadiene-11,12-dione (6; horminone tautomer), ferruginol and salvinolonyl 12-methyl ether (7) were also found in the roots together with 1-docosyl ferulate (8), and a mixture of 2-(4'-alkoxyphenyl) ethyl alkanoates (9). Two lupane triterpenoids, 2alpha-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-3beta-ol (10), and 3beta-acetoxy-lup-20(29)-en-2alpha-ol (11) were found in the aerial parts together with known compounds, lup-20(29)-ene-2alpha,3beta-diol (12), ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, beta-sitosterol and beta-sitosterol glucoside. A known phenylpropanoid, trans-verbascoside (or acteoside; 13), was the main constituent in the polar fraction of the aerial part, and it is now reported in the genus Salvia for the first time. Other polyphenolic compounds were cis-verbascoside (14), leucosceptoside A (15), martynoside (16), caffeic acid, 6-O-caffeoyl-glucose (18), rosmarinic acid, salidroside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-galactopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside, luteolin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside, and apigenin-7-O-beta-glucopyranoside. The structures were determined by 1D-, 2D-NMR and HR-ESI-MS techniques. Compounds 6, 10, ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid exhibited antibacterial activity against Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 775) with MIC 50 muM, 25 muM, 50 muM, 12.5 muM, 12.5 muM respectively. Ferruginol, ursolic acid and oleanolic acid were also active against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6571), and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 2599) with MIC 12.5-50 muM. 4 was also active against S.aureus (ATCC 6571) with MIC 50 muM. These values are consistent with previous studies on the antimicrobial activity of Salvia diterpenoids.
TI  - Development of biopolymer nanocomposite for silver nanoparticles and Ciprofloxacin controlled release.
AB  - Screening of biopolymeric gel beads containing Silver NanoParticles (Ag-NPs) stabilized in Guar Gum Alkyl Amine (GGAA) and Ciprofloxacin (Cip) was carried out in order to obtain a novel nanocomposite with controlled release profile of both antimicrobians. The selected matrix composed of Alginate/High Methoxyl Pectin (HMP)/GGAA (4:4:1) was able to co-incorporate Ag-NPs and Cip with encapsulation efficiency higher than 70%. SEM images revealed good cohesivity and compatibility between the biopolymers and the cargos. Beads provided protection against Ag-NPs degradation at acidic pHs and HMP would played a key role providing hydrophobic regions. While Cip release profile showed a pH independent diffusional process, Ag-NPs release was restricted to matrix erodability. Calcium quelating agents and/or alginate degrading enzymes could modulate the release profile. The bactericidal activity of beads was tested in liquid medium, showing cooperative effects between the antimicrobials against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. TEM images confirmed interaction of Ag-NPs with bacterial surfaces followed by membrane damage. Results suggested the nanocomposite matrix as a promising system for oral treatment of intestinal infectious diseases caused by multidrug resistant and unknown microorganisms, since both Cip and Ag-NPs would be able to reach intestine in the active form.
TI  - Biological activity of Pinus nigra terpenes--evaluation of FtsZ inhibition by selected compounds as contribution to their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - In the current work, in vitro antioxidant, antibacterial, and antifungal activites of the needle terpenes of three taxa of Pinus nigra from Serbia (ssp. nigra, ssp. pallasiana, and var. banatica) were analyzed. The black pine essential oils showed generally weak antioxidative properties tested by two methods (DPPH and ABTS scavenging assays), where the highest activity was identified in P. nigra var. banatica (IC50=25.08 mg/mL and VitC=0.67 mg (vitamin C)/g when tested with the DPPH and ABTS reagents, respectively). In the antimicrobial assays, one fungal (Aspergilus niger) and two bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) showed sensitivity against essential oils of all three P. nigra taxa. The tested oils have been shown to possess inhibitory action in the range from 20.00 to 0.62 mg/mL, where var. banatica exhibited the highest and ssp. nigra the lowest antimicrobial action. In order to determine potential compounds that are responsible for alternative mode of action, molecular docking simulations inside FtsZ (a prokaryotic homolog of tubulin) were performed. Tested compounds were the most abundant terpenoid (germacrene D-4-ol) and its structurally similar terpene (germacrene D), both present in all three essential oils. It was determined that the oxygenated form of the molecule creates stable bonds with investigated enzyme FtsZ, and that this compound, through this mechanism of action participates in the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Reducing pathogens by using zinc oxide nanoparticles and acetic acid in sheep meat.
AB  - Practical applications of different concentrations (0, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mM) of zinc oxide (ZnO) suspensions containing 1 % acetic acid were investigated against the pathogenic bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. ZnO suspensions (0, 1, 3, 6, and 8 mM) containing acetic acid had a significant inhibitory effect on the growth of L. monocytogenes, E. coli, and S. aureus during 12 h of incubation, and the 8 mM suspensions of ZnO were the most effective against all the strains. These data suggested that the antibacterial activity of ZnO was concentration dependent. Thus, 6 and 8 mM ZnO were selected for further studies in meat. ZnO nanoparticles reduced initial growth of all inoculated strains in meat. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the antibacterial activity of ZnO nanoparticles in meat and indicates the potential of these nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent in the food industry.
TI  - Bacteriological quality of vegetables from organic and conventional production in different areas of Korea.
AB  - Foods grown in organic production systems have been described as representing an  increased risk to public health compared with foods from conventional production. Leafy vegetables (spinach, romaine lettuce, and green sesame leaves) grown in organic and conventional systems were collected from various areas in Korea and examined using standard culture methods to compare the microbiological quality of the produce grown in the two agricultural systems. The 354 samples of these leafy vegetables were analyzed for levels of indicator bacteria (aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and Escherichia coli) and the prevalence of the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella. Aerobic bacteria and coliforms were detected in all vegetable types, but nonpathogenic E. coli was below the limit of detection in all samples. B. cereus was the most prevalent pathogen, found on 7 (11.1%) of the 63 organic spinach samples. The prevalence of S. aureus was highest in organic sesame leaves; it was found on 5 (8.0%) of the 63 samples. The prevalence of L. monocytogenes was highest on organic romaine lettuce and spinach; it was found in 4 (6.4%) of 63 samples of each type of vegetable. E. coli O157:H7 found on only 1 (1.58%) of 55 conventional spinach samples. These results suggest that farming type at most only slightly affects the hygienic quality of leafy vegetables, and no effect was found for sample collection area. Salmonella was not isolated from any of the conventional or organic leafy vegetables. These results do not support the hypothesis that organic produce poses a substantially greater risk of pathogen contamination than does conventional produce.
TI  - Analgesic, antibacterial and central nervous system depressant activities of Albizia procera leaves.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain analgesic, antibacterial and central nervous system (CNS) depressant activities of ethyl acetate, dichloromethane and carbon tetrachloride fractions of methanol extract of Albizia procera (A. procera) leaves. METHODS: Leaves extracts of A. procera were tested for analgesic activity by acetic acid induced and formalin test method in mice. The in vitro antibacterial activity was performed by agar well diffusion method. CNS depressant activity was evaluated by hole cross and open field tests. RESULTS: All the extracts at 200 mg/kg exhibited significant (P<0.01) analgesic activity in acetic acid induced and formalin tests method in mice. Analgesic activity of the ethyl acetate fraction was almost same like as standard drug indomethacin in acetic acid induced method. The CNS depressant activity of the extracts at 500 mg/kg was comparable to the positive control diazepam as determined by hole cross and open field test method. The extracts exhibited moderate antimicrobial activity against all the tested microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Esherichia coli, Shigella soneii, Shigella boydii) at concentration of 0.8 mg/disc. The measured diameter of zone of inhibition for the extracts was within the range of 7 to 12 mm which was less than the standard kanamycin (16-24 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that all the extracts possess potential analgesic and CNS depressants activity. This study also showed that different fractions of methanol extract could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Cobalt(II) complexes with the antimicrobial drug enrofloxacin: structure, antimicrobial activity, DNA- and albumin-binding.
AB  - The cobalt(II) complexes with the quinolone antimicrobial agent enrofloxacin (Herx) in the presence of the nitrogen-donor heterocyclic ligands pyridine (py), 2,2'-bipyridylamine (bipyam), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 2,2'-bipyridine (bipy) or the oxygen-donor ligand N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were synthesized and characterized. The crystal structures of complexes [Co(erx)2(py)2].MeOH.6H2O and [Co(erx)2(bipyam)].4.5MeOH.1.25H2O were determined by X-ray crystallography. The deprotonated enrofloxacinato ligands are bidentately bound to cobalt(II) ion through the pyridone oxygen and a carboxylato oxygen. The antimicrobial activity of the complexes was tested against five different microorganisms (Escherichia coli XL1, Xanthomonas campestris ATCC 33013, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778 and Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633) and the complexes were more active than free Herx. The binding of the complexes to calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) was monitored by spectroscopic techniques, viscosity measurements, cyclic voltammetry and by mobility shift experiments in agarose gel electrophoresis with CT DNA and plasmid DNA (pDNA). All complexes exhibited a preference for binding to the supercoiled structure of the pDNA. The ability of the complexes to displace ethidium bromide (EB) from the EB-DNA complex was also investigated. The experiments indicated intercalation as the most possible mode and the DNA-binding strength of the complexes were also calculated. The complexes bind to human or bovine serum albumin protein exhibiting relatively high binding constant values.
TI  - The Antibacterial Activity of Cassia fistula Organic Extracts.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cassia fistula, is a flowering plant and a member of Fabaceae family. Its leaves are compound of 4 - 8 pairs of opposite leaflets. There are many Cassia species around the world which are used in herbal medicine. OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to examine in vitro anti-bacterial activity of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula native to Khuzestan, Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbial inhibitory effect of methanolic and ethanolic extracts of C. fistula was tested on 3 Gram positive: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and S. epidermidis and 5 Gram negative: Salmonella Typhi, Kelebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis bacterial species using disc diffusion method at various concentrations. The minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations (MIC and MBC) were measured by the tube dilution assay. RESULTS: The extract of C. fistula was effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. The most susceptible microorganisms to ethanolic and methanolic extracts were E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Also B. cereus and S. aureus showed the least sensitivity to ethanolic and methanolic extracts, respectively. The MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) of ethanolic extracts against S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis and K. pneumoniae were also determined. CONCLUSIONS: With respect to the obtained results and regarding to the daily increase of the resistant microbial strains to the commercial antibiotics, it can be concluded that these extracts can be proper candidates of antibacterial substance against pathogenic bacterial species especially S. aureus, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. epidermidis.
TI  - Antibacterial and Antifungal Activity of Holothuria leucospilota Isolated From Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of antimicrobial resistance toward a number of conventional antibiotics has triggered the search for antimicrobial agents from a variety of sources including the marine environment. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of Holothuria leucospilota from Qeshm and Kharg Islands against some selected bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this investigation, sea cucumbers from two coastal cities of Persian Gulf were collected in March and May 2011 and identified by the scale method according to the food and agriculture organization of the United Nations. Antibacterial activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of the body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid, methanol, chloroform, and n-hexane extracts of the body wall were evaluated by the spot test. In addition, their antifungal activity was assessed by the broth dilution method. RESULTS: The displayed effect was microbiostatic at concentrations of 1000 and 2000 microg/mL rather than microbicidal. The highest activity of hydroalcoholic extracts was exhibited by body wall, cuvierian organs and coelomic fluid against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Aspergillus niger, A. fumigatus, A. flavus and A. brasilensis. However, none of the methanol, chloroform and n-haxane extracts showed appreciable effects against Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. Moreover, cuvierian organs did not possess any antifungal potential. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicated that water-methanol extracts from the body wall of H. leucospilota possess antibacterial and antifungal activity. However, additional and in-depth studies are required to isolate and identify the active component(s).
TI  - Mangostanaxanthones I and II, new xanthones from the pericarp of Garcinia mangostana.
AB  - Two new xanthones: mangostanaxanthones I (3) and II (5) were isolated from the pericarp of Garcinia mangostana, along with four known xanthones: 9-hydroxycalabaxanthone (1), parvifolixanthone C (2), alpha-mangostin (4), and rubraxanthone (6). Their structures were elucidated on the basis of IR, UV, 1D, 2D NMR, and MS spectroscopic data, in addition to comparison with literature data.

Compounds 3 and 4 possessed quorum-sensing inhibitory activity against Chromobacterium violaceum ATCC 12472.
TI  - Antibacterial tetraoxygenated xanthones from the immature fruits of Garcinia cowa.
AB  - A phytochemical investigation of the acetone extract from the immature fruits of  Garcinia cowa led to the isolation of two novel tetraoxygenated xanthones, garcicowanones A (1) and B (2), together with eight known tetraoxygeanted xanthones. Their structures were determined by spectroscopic analysis. All isolated compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus TISTR 688, Bacillus subtilis TISTR 008, Micrococcus luteus TISTR 884, Staphylococcus aureus TISTR 1466, Escherichia coli TISTR 780, Pseudomonas aeruginosa TISTR 781, Salmonella typhimurium TISTR 292 and Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 12228. alpha-Mangostin showed potent activity (MIC 0.25-1 mug/mL) against three Gram-positive strains and garcicowanone A and beta-mangostin exhibited strong antibacterial activity against B. cereus with the same MIC values of 0.25 mug/mL.
TI  - Thiophene acetylenes and furanosesquiterpenes from Xanthopappus subacaulis and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - In a search for naturally occurring antibacterial compounds in medicinal plants,  six hitherto unknown thiophene acetylenes, named 10,11-threo-xanthopappin D, 10,11-erythro-xanthopappin D, 10,11-cis-xanthopappin B, 5-(but-4-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-ynyl)-2-(Z)-pent-3-ene-1-ynylthiophene, 5-(but-4-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-ynyl)-2-(E)-pent-3-ene-1-ynylthiophene, 5-(but-3,4-dihydroxy-1-ynyl)-2-(Z)-pent-3-ene-1-ynylthiophene and two furanosesquiterpenes, as well as fifteen known compounds, were isolated from Xanthopappus subacaulis, which has been used as a traditional Tibetan medicine in China. A biosynthetic pathway to thiophene acetylenes was proposed and, the isolated compounds were tested for their antibacterial activity against five bacteria. Within the series of thiophene acetylenes tested, 10,11-threo-xanthopappin D with a threo configuration exhibited strong activity against Bacillus subtilis, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 7.25mug/mL, whereas 10,11-erythro-xanthopappin D with erythro configuration possessed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Erwinia carotovora, with MICs of 12.5, 15.5, 7.25 and 7.25mug/mL, respectively. Meanwhile, the compounds 10,11-cis-xanthopappin B, xanthopappin B, 5-(but-4-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-ynyl)-2-(Z)-pent-3-ene-1-ynylthiophene and 5-(but-4-chloro-3-hydroxy-1-ynyl)-2-(E)-pent-3-ene-1-ynylthiophene substituted with a Cl atom at C-14 showed moderate inhibitory activity against E. coli, B. cereus, S. aureus, E. carotovora and B. subtilis, with MICs ranging from 31.25 to 62.5mug/mL. The structures of these compounds were elucidated through the comprehensive analysis of spectroscopic data, including UV, IR, MS and NMR.

AB  - Six new quinone sesquiterpenes, myrothecols A-F (1-6), and hymenopsin B (7) were  isolated from cultures of Myrothecium sp. SC0265 by bioassay-guided fractionation. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of 1D and 2D NMR and MS data. The absolute configurations of the new compounds were assigned by CD/TDDFT calculations, and that of and hymenopsin B was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 1-5 and hymenopsin demonstrated cytotoxic activity against human carcinoma A549, HeLa, and HepG2 cells. Compounds 1-5 also exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Chemometric approach to prediction of antibacterial agent production by Streptomyces hygroscopicus.
AB  - The nutritional requirements for antimicrobial agent production using Streptomyces hygroscopicus were analyzed in shake flask experiments. Antimicrobial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. The mathematical models have been generated with relative high complexity in order to give an adequate fit to the data. All the results suggest a high dependence of produced antimicrobial agent quantities on the amount of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in cultivation medium. The statistical results of the generated models reflect the high predictive ability. The derived models were validated using leave-one-out cross-validation technique, and from statistical point of view, they have significantly high values of the cross-validation parameters.
TI  - New thiophene-1,2,4-triazole-5(3)-ones: highly bioactive thiosemicarbazides, structures of Schiff bases and triazole-thiols.
AB  - Key compound 2-(4-amino-5-oxo-3-(thiophene-2-ylmethyl)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-tiazole-1-yl) acetohydrazide (3) was synthesized by reacting hydrazine hydrate with ethyl-2-(4-amino-5-oxo-3-(thiophene-2-ylmethyl)-4,5-dihydro-1,2,4-tiazole-1yl)ace tate (2), obtained in basic media from 4-amino-5-(thiophene-2-ylmethyl)-2H-1,2,4-triazole-3(4H)-one (1). Compound 3 was converted to thiosemicarbazide derivatives (4a-d) and Schiff base derivatives 6a-e and 7a-e. The treatment of compound 4 with NaOH gave 4-amino-2-((4-(4-aryl)-5-mercapto-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-yl)methyl)-5-(thiophene-2-y lmethyl)-2H-1,2,4-triazole-3(4H)-ones (5a-d). All newly compounds, well characterized by elemental analyses, IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral studies were tested for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Thiosemicarbazide derivatives (4a-d) were highly active in two antioxidant tests with 69.0-88.2% DPPH. scavenging and 503-1257 muM TEAC values, while the others showed lower or no activity. The results of the two antioxidant tests correlated well. Moreover, Thiosemicarbazide derivatives (4a-d) also showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Mycobacterium smegmatis. Thiosemicarbazide group deserves attention in the synthesis of bioactive compounds.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria via photosensitization of vitamin K3 by UV-A light.
AB  - This study investigated inactivation of bacteria with ultraviolet light A irradiation in combination with vitamin K3 as a photosensitizer. Six bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli suspended in vitamin K3 aqueous solution were exposed to ultraviolet light A. Five of six bacteria, with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were reduced by eight logs with 1600 muM of vitamin K3 and 5.8 J cm(-2) UV-A irradiation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was reduced by four logs under these conditions. Reactive oxygen species including singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radical and superoxide anion radical were generated in vitamin K3 aqueous solution under UV-A irradiation. These results suggest that vitamin K3 and UV-A irradiation may be effective for bacterial inactivation in environmental and medical applications.
TI  - Compositional studies and Biological activities of Perovskia abrotanoides Kar. oils.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current study has been designed to evaluate the chemical composition  of essential and fixed oils from stem and leaves of Perovskia abrotanoides and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of these oils. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis of essential oil identified 19 compounds with (E)-9-dodecenal being the major component in stem and hexadecanoic acid in leaves. In contrast, GC-MS analysis of fixed oil showed 40 constituents with alpha-amyrin the major component in stem and alpha-copaene in leaves. The antioxidant activity showed the highest value of 76.7% in essential oil from leaves in comparison with fixed oil from stem (45.9%) through inhibition of peroxidation in linoleic acid system. The antimicrobial assay tested on different microorganisms (e.g. E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, Nitrospira, S. epidermis, A. niger, A. flavus and C. albicans) showed the higher inhibition zone at essential oil from leaves (15.2 mm on B. cereus) as compared to fixed oil from stem (8.34 mm on S. aureus) and leaves (11.2 mm on S. aureus). CONCLUSIONS: The present study revealed the fact that essential oil analyzed from Perovskia abrotanoides stem and leaves could be a promising source of natural products with potential antioxidant and antimicrobial activities, as compared to fixed oil.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Ammodaucus leucotrichus fruit oil from Algerian Sahara.
AB  - Three fruit oil samples of Ammodaucus leucotrichus Cosson & Durieu from Algerian  Sahara were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC(RI), GC-MS and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The main compounds were perillaldehyde (87.0-87.9%) and limonene (7.4-8.2%). The antimicrobial effect of the essential oil was evaluated against bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi. High antibacterial activity was observed against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus. Enterobacter cloaceae, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella typhimurium, with MIC values between 0.5-1.0 microL/mL. Fungal strains were also sensitive to the essential oil (MIC values: 0.25-0.75 microL/mL).The most potent activity was observed against the filamentous fungi, Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillusflavus (0.25-0.50 microL/mL).
TI  - Unsaturated fatty acid, cis-2-decenoic acid, in combination with disinfectants or antibiotics removes pre-established biofilms formed by food-related bacteria.
AB  - Biofilm formation by food-related bacteria and food-related pathogenesis are significant problems in the food industry. Even though much disinfection and mechanical procedure exist for removal of biofilms, they may fail to eliminate pre-established biofilms. cis-2 decenoic acid (CDA), an unsaturated fatty acid messenger produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is reportedly capable of inducing the dispersion of established biofilms by multiple types of microorganisms. However, whether CDA has potential to boost the actions of certain antimicrobials is unknown. Here, the activity of CDA as an inducer of pre-established biofilms dispersal, formed by four main food pathogens; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella enterica and E. coli, was measured using both semi-batch and continuous cultures bioassays. To assess the ability of CDA combined biocides treatments to remove pre-established biofilms formed on stainless steel discs, CFU counts were performed for both treated and untreated cultures. Eradication of the biofilms by CDA combined antibiotics was evaluated using crystal violet staining. The effect of CDA combined treatments (antibiotics and disinfectants) on biofilm surface area and bacteria viability was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy, digital image analysis and LIVE/DEAD staining. MICs were also determined to assess the probable inhibitory effects of CDA combined treatments on the growth of tested microorganisms' planktonic cells. Treatment of pre-established biofilms with only 310 nM CDA resulted in at least two-fold increase in the number of planktonic cells in all cultures. While antibiotics or disinfectants alone exerted a trivial effect on CFU counts and percentage of surface area covered by the biofilms, combinational treatments with both 310 nM CDA and antibiotics or disinfectants led to approximate 80% reduction in biofilm biomass. These data suggests that combined treatments with CDA would pave the way toward developing new strategies to control biofilms with widespread applications in industry as well as medicine.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using lingonberry and cranberry juices and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - In this study lingonberry and cranberry juices were used for silver nanoparticle  synthesis. The berry juices were characterized by total phenolics, total anthocyanins and benzoic acid content, respectively 1.9-2.7mg/ml, 55.2-83.4mg/l and 590.8-889.2mg/l. The synthesis of silver nanoparticles was performed at room temperature assisting in solutions irradiated by ultraviolet for 30min. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy and microscopy confirmed the formation of nanoparticles as well as the dark red color of colloid of silver samples showed the formation of stable nanoparticles. Broad localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) peaks in UV-vis spectra indicated the formation of polydispersive silver nanoparticles and LSPR was observed at 485nm and 520nm for the silver nanoparticles synthesis using lingonberry and cranberry juices, respectively. The antimicrobial activity of silver nanoparticles was determined against the reference strains of microorganisms that could be found in food products: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Salmonella typhimurium ATCC 13076, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and foodborne B. cereus producing and non-producing enterotoxins. Silver nanoparticles showed a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and were most active against S. aureus ATCC 25923, B. subtilis ATCC 6633 and B. cereus ATCC 11778 reference cultures, and less active against C. albicans ATCC 10231 and foodborne B. cereus. It can be concluded that lingonberry and cranberry juices could be used as bioreductants for silver ions.
TI  - Influence of Albizia lebbeck Saponin and Its Fractions on In Vitro Gas Production Kinetics, Rumen Methanogenesis, and Rumen Fermentation Characteristics.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of crude seed powder (CSP) and gross saponins extract (GSE) of seeds of Albizia lebbeck on antimicrobial activity by taking two Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), two Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhi) bacteria, and two fungi species (Aspergillus niger and Candida butyric) were taken at 25, 50, 100, 250, and 500 microg levels using agar well diffusion method. Zone of inhibition was increased with increasing of concentration of CSP and saponins which indicates that Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli), Gram-positive bacteria (B. cereus), and A. niger were significantly susceptible to inhibition. Another experiment was conducted to study the effect of GSE and saponins fraction A and B of A. lebbeck supplementation at 6% on DM basis on methane production and other rumen fermentation parameters using in vitro gas production test, by taking three different type diets, that is, high fiber diet (D1, 60R : 40C), medium fiber diet (D2, 50R : 50C), and low fiber diet (D3, 40R : 60C). Significant (P </= 0.05) increase was seen in IVDMD, methane production; however ammonia nitrogen concentration decreased as compared to control. The methane production was reduced in a range between 12 and 49% by saponin supplemented diets except in case of GSE in D2. Sap A showed the highest methane reduction per 200 mg of truly digested substrate (TDS) than other treatment groups. Results in relation with quantification of methanogens and protozoa by qPCR indicated the decreasing trend with saponins of A. lebbek in comparison with control except total methanogen quantified using mcr-A based primer.
TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Toxin production and growth of pathogens subjected to temperature fluctuations simulating consumer handling of cold cuts.
AB  - It is crucial for the quality and safety of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods to maintain  the cold chain from production to consumption. The effect of temperature abuse related to daily meals and elevated refrigerator temperatures on the growth and toxin production of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus weihenstephanensis and Staphylococcus aureus and the growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica was studied. A case study with temperature loggings in the domestic environment during Easter and Christmas holidays was performed to select relevant time and temperature courses. A model for bacterial surface growth on food using nutrient agar plates exposed to variations in temperatures was used to simulate food stored at different temperatures and exposed to room temperature for short periods of time. The results were compared with predicted growth using the modeling tool ComBase Predictor. The consumers exposed their cold cuts to room temperatures as high as 26.5 degrees C with an average duration of meals was 47 min daily for breakfast/brunch during the vacations. Short (</= 2 h) daily intervals at 25 degrees C nearly halved the time the different pathogens needed to reach levels corresponding to the levels associated with human infection or intoxication, compared with the controls continuously stored at refrigerator temperature. Although the temperature fluctuations affected growth of both B. weihenstephanensis and S. aureus, toxin production was only detected at much higher cell concentrations than what has been associated with human intoxications. Therefore, growth of L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica was found to be the limiting factor for safety. In combination with data on temperature abuse in the domestic environment, modeling programs such as ComBase Predictor can be efficient tools to predict growth of some pathogens but will not predict toxin production.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial properties of the essential oil and ethanol extract from the stem of Aglaia odorata Lour.
AB  - The stem-derived essential oil of Aglaia odorata Lour. was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type system. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the oil revealed the identification of 39 compounds, representing 76.4% of the oil; germacrene D (20.3%), alpha-humulene (17.1%), alpha-himachalene (12.7%) and beta-caryophyllene (10.2%) were the major components. Ar-turmerone (1) and eichlerialactone (2) were isolated from the stem oil and ethanolic stem extract of this plant species, respectively. Antimicrobial activities of the oil and ethanol extract were tested against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains including Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, as well as three rice fungal pathogens Bipolaris oryzae, Pyricularia oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani using broth microdilution method. The oil and 1 exhibited significant antifungal activity against the three rice pathogens tested, whereas 2 exhibited good antibacterial activity against both the Gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Development of 23 individual TaqMan(R) real-time PCR assays for identifying common foodborne pathogens using a single set of amplification conditions.
AB  - Most of the acute intestinal diseases are caused by foodborne pathogens with infants and elderly people being at major risk. The aim of this study was to develop a procedure to simultaneously detect 20 foodborne pathogens in complex alimentary matrices such as milk, cheese and meat. The list of targets include, among the others, Listeria spp., Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Escherichia coli spp., Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp. and Staphylococcus aureus. The accuracy of detection was determined by using ATCC strains as positive and negative controls. The achieved sensitivity of each of assays was 1 pg of genomic DNA, which was equivalent to approximately 1 cfu. The working ranges of the TaqMan((R)) Real-time PCR assays, when used quantitatively on cheese and meat samples inoculated with serial dilution of Listeria spp., Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, Salmonella enterica, Shigella boydii, E. coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterobacter sakazakii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 10(8) cfu/g to 10(4) cfu/g. No matrix interferences were observed.
TI  - Evaluation of indirect impedance for measuring microbial growth in complex food matrices.
AB  - The suitability of indirect impedance to accurately measure microbial growth in real food matrices was investigated. A variety of semi-solid and liquid food products were inoculated with Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteriditis, Candida tropicalis or Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and CO2 production was monitored using a conductimetric (Don Whitely R.A.B.I.T.) system. The majority (80%) of food and microbe combinations produced a detectable growth signal. The linearity of conductance responses in selected food products was investigated and a good correlation (R(2) >/= 0.84) was observed between inoculum levels and times to detection. Specific growth rate estimations from the data were sufficiently accurate for predictive modeling in some cases. This initial evaluation of the suitability of indirect impedance to generate microbial growth data in complex food matrices indicates significant potential for the technology as an alternative to plating methods.
TI  - Influence of acetylation degree and molecular weight of homogeneous chitosans on  antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - The results given in the literature are conflicting when considering the relationship between antimicrobial activity and chitosan characteristics. To be able to clarify, we prepared fifteen homogeneous chitosans with different acetylation degrees (DA) and molecular weights (MW) by reacetylation of a fully deacetylated chitin under homogeneous conditions. They were tested at different pH values for their antimicrobial activities against four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhi), four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus) and three fungi (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Alternaria solani). Chitosans markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria and fungi tested, although the inhibitory effect depends on the type of microorganism and on the chitosan characteristics (DA and MW) with minimum inhibitory concentrations in the range of 0.001 to 0.1 w%. Considering chitosan efficiency on bacteria, our series of data clearly show that the lower DA and the lower pH give the larger efficiency. Antibacterial activity was further enhanced for Gram-negative bacteria with decreasing MW, whereas, opposite effect was observed with the Gram-positive. Concerning the antifungal activity, the influence of chitosan characteristics was dependent on the particular type of fungus. Fungal growth decreased with increasing MW for F. oxysporum and decreasing DA for A. solani, but no MW or DA dependences were observed with A. niger.
TI  - Eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoids with diverse skeletons from Ligularia sagitta.
AB  - Five new highly oxygenated eremophilane-type sesquiterpenoids, possessing C19 (1  and 2), C15 (3 and 4), and C14 (8) skeletons, along with eight known eremophilenolides were obtained from the aerial parts of Ligularia sagitta. The absolute configuration of 1 was assigned by X-ray diffraction analysis and that of 3 by ECD spectroscopy. Compounds 1-10 were evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Erwinia carotovora. Compounds 4 and 5 displayed broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against these bacteria with MIC values of approximately 7.25 mug/mL, followed by 3 and 6 with MIC values in the range of 23.0-125.0 mug/mL. Compounds 3 and 8 showed mild activity against three human tumor cell lines (IC50 approximately 13 muM). Preliminary structure-activity relationships for these eremophilenolides are reported.
TI  - Radiation-treated ready-to-eat (RTE) chicken breast Adobo for immuno-compromised  patients.
AB  - Usually in hospitals low-bacterial diets are served to immuno-compromised patients (ICPs). However, low-bacterial diets still pose a high risk of microbial infections and limit the food selection of the patients. Thus, pathogen-free dishes must be made available. This study presents the development of pathogen-free ready-to-eat (RTE) Filipino ethnic food chicken breast Adobo, sterilized by exposure to high-dose gamma rays (25 kGy) in combination with conventional treatments. Frozen vacuum-packed samples artificially inoculated with Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, were exposed to 25 kGy gamma radiation for complete sterilization. Microbial quality and sterility of the samples were analysed following 15, 30, and 60 days of storage at -4 degrees C. The effects of high-dose gamma irradiation on the nutritional quality and sensory characteristics of RTE chicken breast Adobo were also evaluated.
TI  - Lipodiscamides A-C, new cytotoxic lipopeptides from Discodermia kiiensis.
AB  - Lipodiscamides A-C, three new lipodepsipeptides, were characterized from the marine sponge Discodermia kiiensis. These structurally rare cyclic lipodepsipeptides were found to possess an unprecedented dilactone macrocycle and, thus, represent a new family of lipopeptides. They are the only lipopeptides bearing 4S-hydroxy-trans-2-enoate, and noncanonical amino acids, l-3-ureidoalanine (Uda), E-dehydronorvaline (Denor), and d-citrulline (Cit). MTT assays against P388 and HeLa cells revealed the moderate cytotoxicity of all three compounds.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using Acacia leucophloea extract and their antibacterial activity.
AB  - The immense potential of nanobiotechnology makes it an intensely researched field in modern medicine. Green nanomaterial synthesis techniques for medicinal applications are desired because of their biocompatibility and lack of toxic byproducts. We report the toxic byproducts free phytosynthesis of stable silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using the bark extract of the traditional medicinal plant Acacia leucophloea (Fabaceae). Visual observation, ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the synthesized AgNPs. The visible yellow-brown color formation and surface plasmon resonance at 440 nm indicates the biosynthesis of AgNP. The TEM images show polydisperse, mostly spherical AgNP particles of 17-29 nm. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that primary amines, aldehyde/ketone, aromatic, azo, and nitro compounds of the A. leucophloea extract may participate in the bioreduction and capping of the formed AgNPs. X-ray diffraction confirmed the crystallinity of the AgNPs. The in vitro agar well diffusion method confirmed the potential antibacterial activity of the plant extract and synthesized AgNPs against the common bacterial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 737), Bacillus cereus (MTCC 1272), Listeria monocytogenes (MTCC 657), and Shigella flexneri (MTCC 1475). This research combines the inherent antimicrobial activity of silver metals with the A. leucophloea extract, yielding antibacterial activity-enhanced AgNPs. This new biomimetic approach using traditional medicinal plant (A. leucophloea) barks to synthesize biocompatible antibacterial AgNPs could easily be scaled up for additional biomedical applications. These polydisperse AgNPs green-synthesized via A. leucophloea bark extract can readily be used in many applications not requiring high uniformity in particle size or shape.
TI  - Cyclic lipodepsipeptides produced by Pseudomonas spp. naturally present in raw milk induce inhibitory effects on microbiological inhibitor assays for antibiotic residue screening.
AB  - Two Pseudomonas strains, identified as closely related to Pseudomonas tolaasii, were isolated from milk of a farm with frequent false-positive Delvotest results for screening putative antibiotic residues in raw milk executed as part of the regulatory quality programme. Growth at 5 to 7 degrees C of these isolates in milk resulted in high lipolysis and the production of bacterial inhibitors. The two main bacterial inhibitors have a molecular weight of 1168.7 and 1140.7 Da respectively, are heat-tolerant and inhibit Geobacillus stearothermophilus var. calidolactis, the test strain of most of the commercially available microbiological inhibitor tests for screening of antibiotic residues in milk. Furthermore, these bacterial inhibitors show antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis and also interfere negatively with yoghurt production. Following their isolation and purification with RP-HPLC, the inhibitors were identified by NMR analysis as cyclic lipodepsipeptides of the viscosin group. Our findings bring to light a new challenge for quality control in the dairy industry. By prolonging the refrigerated storage of raw milk, the keeping quality of milk is influenced by growth and metabolic activities of psychrotrophic bacteria such as pseudomonads. Besides an increased risk of possible spoilage of long shelf-life milk, the production at low temperature of natural bacterial inhibitors may also result in false-positive results for antibiotic residue screening tests based on microbial inhibitor assays thus leading to undue production loss.
TI  - Investigating the potential of under-utilised plants from the Asteraceae family as a source of natural antimicrobial and antioxidant extracts.
AB  - Antimicrobial properties of ethanol and water extracts from eight Asteraceae species were investigated against three Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA and Bacillus cereus) and two Gram negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial strains. Ethanol extracts from Centaurea scabiosa, Arctium minus, Taraxacum officinale, Centaurea nigra and Cirsium palustre demonstrated antimicrobial activity against strains of S. aureus, MRSA and B. cereus (MIC=187.5-365mug/ml). Ethanol extracts also had higher antioxidant activities and phenolic content demonstrating a link between these compounds and the bioactivity of these extracts. Further investigation into the phenolic content of ethanol extracts using UPLC-MS/MS lead to the identification and quantification of numerous phenolic compounds in all species including; 18 from Cirsium arvense, 16 from Cirsium vulgare, 19 from C. palustre, 15 from C. nigra, 17 from C. scabiosa, 14 from Sonchus asper, 17 from A. minus and 11 from T. officinale.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and carbonic anhydrase enzyme inhibitor effects of salicilaldehyde-N-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone and its Palladium(II), Cobalt(II) complexes.
AB  - We report the synthesis of the ligand, salicilaldehyde-N-methyl p-toluenesulfonylhydrazone (salptsmh) derived from p-toluenesulfonicacid-1-methylhydrazide (ptsmh) and its Pd(II) and Co(II) metal complexes were synthesized for the first time. The structure of the ligand and their complexes were investigated using elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, molar conductance and spectral (IR, NMR and LC-MS) measurements. Salptsmh has also been characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction. (1)H and (13)C shielding tensors for crystal structure were calculated with GIAO/DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G(d,p) methods in CDCl3. The complexes were found to have general composition [ML2]. The results of elemental analysis showed 1:2 (metal/ligand) stoichiometry for all the complex. Magnetic and spectral data indicate a square planar geometry for Pd(II) complex and a distorted tetrahedral geometry for Co(II) complexes. The ligand and its metal chelates have been screened for their antimicrobial activities using the disk diffusion method against the selected Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Gram negative bacteria: Eschericha coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia. The inhibition activities of these compounds on carbonic anhydrase II (CA II) and carbonic anhydrase I (CA I) have been investigated by comparing IC50 and Ki values and it has been found that Pd(II) complex have more enzyme inhibition efficiency than salptsmh and Co(II) complex.
TI  - Electrochemical detection of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in human fluid samples via pyocyanin.
AB  - The ability to quickly detect the presence of pathogenic bacteria in patient samples is of the outmost importance to expedient patient care. Here we report the direct, selective, and sensitive detection of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, spiked in human whole blood with sodium heparin, urine, sputum, and bronchial lavage samples using unmodified, disposable carbon electrode sensors that detect the presence of pyocyanin, a virulence factor that is unique to this species. Square wave voltammetry scans of biological fluids from healthy individuals spiked with P. aeruginosa showed a clear pyocyanin response within one day of culturing at 37 degrees C. Scans of supernatants taken from cultures of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, and Bacillus cereus taken over a span of three days in the potential range from -0.5 to 0 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference showed no electrochemically detectable molecules with the exception of P. aeruginosa. The results indicate the potential to sensitively and selectively determine the presence of P. aeruginosa in human samples via the electrochemical detection of pyocyanin in less than 5 min, without any sample preparation or separation steps.
TI  - Studies on Antimicrobial and Immunomodulatory Effects of Hot Aqueous Extract of Acacia nilotica L. Leaves against Common Veterinary Pathogens.
AB  - Acacia nilotica is a plant species that is almost ubiquitously found in different parts of the world. Various preparations of it have been advocated in folk medicine for the treatment of tuberculosis, leprosy, smallpox, dysentery, cough, ophthalmia, toothache, skin cancer as astringent, antispasmodic, and aphrodisiac since immemorial times. The present study investigates the antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and immunomodulatory potential of hot aqueous extract (HAE) of Acacia nilotica leaves. On dry matter basis, the filtered HAE had a good extraction ratio (33.46%) and was found to have carbohydrates, glycosides, phytosterols, phenolic compounds, saponins, and flavonoids as major constituents. HAE produced dose dependent zone of inhibition against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, E. coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus uberis and fungal pathogens Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigates; however, no antiviral activity was recorded against IBR virus. HAE of A. nilotica revealed both proliferative and inhibitory effects on the rat splenocytes and IL-10 release depending on the dose. Detailed studies involving wide spectrum of bacterial, fungal, and viral species are required to prove or know the exact status of each constituents of the plant extract.
TI  - A multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus in Korean ready-to-eat food.
AB  - A multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed for simultaneous  detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus in various Korean ready-to-eat foods. The six specific primer pairs for multiplex PCR were selected based on the O157 antigen (rfbE) gene of E. coli O157:H7, the DNA gyrase subunit B (gyrB) gene of B. cereus, the toxin regulatory protein (toxR) gene of V. parahaemolyticus, the invasion protein A (invA) gene of Salmonella spp., the hemolysin (hly) gene of L. monocytogenes, and the thermonuclease (nuc) gene of S. aureus. The 16S rRNA gene was targeted as an internal control gene in the presence of bacterial DNA. The specificity and sensitivity assays for multiplex primer pairs were investigated by testing different strains. When this multiplex PCR assay was applied to evaluate the validity of detecting six foodborne pathogens in artificially inoculated several ready-to-eat food samples, the assay was able to specifically simultaneously detect as few as 1 colony-forming unit/mL of each pathogen after enrichment for 12 h. Their presence in naturally contaminated samples also indicates that the developed multiplex PCR assay is an effective and informative supplement for practical use.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of antimicrobial features of vasopressors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drugs administered as intravenous infusion may be contaminated during several stages of production or preparation. However studies focusing on antibacterial effects of vasopressor drugs are very rare. This study investigates the in vitro antimicrobial activity of the clinically used forms of vasopressors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro antimicrobial activities of vasopressor drugs of different concentrations were investigated by using the micro dilution technique. Microorganisms used in the test were Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ATCC 911, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 43251, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus 702 Roma, Mycobacterium smegmatis ATCC607, Candida albicans ATCC 60193, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae RSKK 251. Antibacterial assays were performed in Mueller-Hinton broth at pH 7.3 and antifungal assays were performed in buffered Yeast Nitrogen Base at pH 7.0. RESULTS: Two different dopamine preparations showed antimicrobial activity. No other study drug showed any antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSIONS: In our opinion, dopamine's antibacterial effects may be advantageous for inhibiting the spread of bacterial contamination during the preparation of the infusion solutions. However, it is important that strict guidelines regarding the need for sterile equipment and deliverables be adhered to during all procedures performed in the intensive care units.
TI  - Phytochemistry and Preliminary Assessment of the Antibacterial Activity of Chloroform Extract of Amburana cearensis (Allemao) A.C. Sm. against Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase-Producing Strains.
AB  - The chloroform extract of the stem bark of Amburana cearensis was chemically characterized and tested for antibacterial activity.The extract was analyzed by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The main compounds identified were 4-methoxy-3-methylphenol (76.7%), triciclene (3.9%), alpha -pinene (1.0%), beta -pinene (2.2%), and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (3.1%). Preliminary antibacterial tests were carried out against species of distinct morphophysiological characteristics: Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica Serotype Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determinate in 96-well microplates for the chloroform extract and an analogue of themain compound identified, which was purchased commercially.We have shown that plant's extract was only inhibitory (but not bactericidal) at the maximum concentration of 6900 mu g/mL against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. Conversely, the analogue 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol produced MICs ranging from215 to 431 mu g/mL against all bacterial species.New antibacterial assays conducted with such chemical compound against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains have shown similarMICresults and minimumbactericidal concentration (MBC) of 431 mu g/mL.We conclude that A. cearensis is a good source of methoxy-methylphenol compounds,which could be screened for antibacterial activity againstmultiresistant bacteria fromdifferent species.
TI  - Water-based oligochitosan and nanowhisker chitosan as potential food preservatives for shelf-life extension of minced pork.
AB  - Water-based chitosans in the forms of oligochitosan (OligoCS) and nanowhisker chitosan (CSWK) are proposed as a novel food preservative based on a minced pork model study. The high surface area with a positive charge over the neutral pH range (pH 5-8) of OligoCS and CSWK lead to an inhibition against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative microbes (Salmonella enteritidis and Escherichia coli O157:H7). In the minced pork model, OligoCS effectively performs a food preservative for shelf-life extension as clarified from the retardation of microbial growth, biogenic amine formation and lipid oxidation during the storage. OligoCS maintains almost all myosin heavy chain protein degradation as observed in the electrophoresis. The present work points out that water-based chitosan with its unique morphology not only significantly inhibits antimicrobial activity but also maintains the meat quality with an extension of shelf-life, and thus has the potential to be used as a food preservative.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antiinsectan phenolic metabolites of Dalea searlsiae.
AB  - Continued interest in the chemistry of Dalea spp. led to investigation of Dalea searlsiae, a plant native to areas of the western United States. Methanol extractions of D. searlsiae roots and subsequent chromatographic fractionation afforded the new prenylated and geranylated flavanones malheurans A-D (1-4) and known flavanones (5 and 6). Known rotenoids (7 and 8) and isoflavones (9 and 10) were isolated from aerial portions. Structure determination of pure compounds was accomplished primarily by extensive 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy. The absolute configurations of compounds 1-5, 7, and 8 were assigned using electronic circular dichroism spectroscopy. Antimicrobial bioassays revealed significant activity concentrated in the plant roots. Compounds 1-6 exhibited MICs of 2-8 mug/mL against Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus, and oxacillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Aerial metabolites 7-10 were inactive against these organisms, but the presence of 7 and 8 prompted investigation of the antiinsectan activity of D. searlsiae metabolites toward the major crop pest Spodoptera frugiperda (fall armyworm). While compounds 1-10 all caused significant reductions in larval growth rates, associated mortality (33-66%) was highest with flavanone 4 and rotenoids 7 and 8. These findings suggest a differential allocation of antimicrobial and antiinsectan plant resources to root and aerial portions of the plant, respectively.
TI  - Microwave-assisted synthesis of diverse pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones and their antibacterial activities.
AB  - With the aim of developing a general and practical method for library production, a novel and efficient two-phase microwave-assisted cascade reaction between isatins and beta-ketoamides in [Bmim]BF4/toluene was developed for the synthesis of pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones. The features of this methodology are, the use of microwave-assisted rapid synthesis, mild reaction conditions, high yields, operational simplicity, facile product separation, and recyclability. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of the pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-dione derivatives produced were evaluated against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus). These derivatives showed antibacterial activities against Gram-positive strains that were at least equivalent to that against Gram-negative strains. Compound 7{3,5} displayed the most potent antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa (MIC = 0.5 mug/mL) and greater activity than standard ampicillin (MIC = 1 mug/mL). Compound 7{4,7} exhibited the best inhibitory activity against E. coli and E. aerogenes (MIC = 1 and 0.5 mug/mL), compared with the standard ampicillin (both MICs = 1 mug/mL). The synthesized pyrrolo[3,4-c]quinoline-1,3-diones are expected to be widely used as lead compounds for the development of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antimicrobial potential of bacteriocin producing Lysinibacillus jx416856 against  foodborne bacterial and fungal pathogens, isolated from fruits and vegetable waste.
AB  - In this study, antimicrobial potential, some probiotics properties and bacteriocin nature of Lysinibacillus, isolated from fruits and vegetable waste were evaluated. For this, 125 Lactobacillus isolates were tested against foodborne bacterial and fungal pathogens. Among these, an isolated Bacillus spp. showed significant aggregation-co-aggregation probiotics properties and potentially inhibits the foodborne gram positive microbial pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus, (22 mm ZOI), Staphylococcus epedermidis and Bacillus cereus (18 mm). Phenotypically and molecularly it was identified as Lysinibacillus (NCBI accession no. JX416856) and it was found closest to Lysinibacillus fusiformis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus and Lysinibacillus xylanilyticus. Physico-biochemically, it was found to be negative for amylase, protease, gelatinase, nitrate reductase and urease while positive for catalase. The diagnostic fatty acid was 22;2 (3.51). The growth conditions and bacteriocin activity were found to be optimum with MRS media at pH 7-10, Temperature 35-40 degrees C and salt tolerance at 1-3%. Eventually its production was optimized with MRS broth at pH 7.6, 37 degrees C, for 36 h in shaking conditions at the rate of 100 rpm. Active bacteriocin was isolated at 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The molecular weight of given bacteriocin was found to be nearly 25-35 kDa by SDS-PAGE. Based on physico- biochemical properties, the isolated bacteriocin was to be categories in class II bacteriocin. The bacteriocin was found to be stable in the range of 4-80 degrees C temperature, 6-10 pH and even in the presence of surfactant (such as SDS and Tween 80). However, proteases like pepsin and trypsin were found to degrade the bacteriocin. Collectively, the broad spectrum inhibitory potential and physical stability offered the antimicrobial potential to Lysinibacillus, and its relevant bacteriocin might be used as an alternative food preservative or therapeutic agent to control spoilage of different food products.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial metabolites from an endophytic Aspergillus sp. associated with Melia azedarach.
AB  - Seven known metabolites, dianhydro-aurasperone C (1), isoaurasperone A (2), fonsecinone A (3), asperpyrone A (4), asperazine (5), rubrofusarin B (6) and (R)-3-hydroxybutanonitrile (7), were isolated from the culture of Aspergillus sp. KJ-9, a fungal endophyte isolated from Melia azedarach and identified by spectroscopic methods. All isolates were evaluated in vitro against several phytopathogenic fungi (Gibberella saubinetti, Magnaporthe grisea, Botrytis cinerea, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Alternaria solani) and pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillus cereus). Compounds 3 and 7 were active against almost all phytopathogenic fungi tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 6.25-50 muM. Moreover, compound 3 was active against all pathogenic bacteria with MIC in the range of 25-100 muM. Compound 7 is a rare new natural product isolated from a natural source for the first time, and the detailed NMR data of 1 were first assigned.
TI  - Survival of foodborne pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes) and Bacillus cereus spores in fermented alcoholic beverages (beer and refined rice wine).
AB  - Only limited information is available on the microbiological safety of fermented  alcoholic beverages because it is still a common belief that such beverages do not provide a favorable environment for bacterial growth and survival. Thus, in this study, we examined the survival of major foodborne pathogens and spores in fermented alcoholic beverages. Foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) and B. cereus spores (initial population, 3 to 4 log CFU/ml) were inoculated separately into three types of beer and refined rice wine, which were then stored at 5 and 22 degrees C. Bacterial counts were assayed periodically for up to 28 days. Vegetative B. cereus counts decreased rapidly, whereas B. cereus spore counts remained constant (P > 0.05) for a long period of time in all beverages. Vegetative B. cereus cells formed spores in beer at 5 and 22 degrees C, and the spores survived for long periods. Among vegetative cells, E. coli O157:H7 had the highest survival (only 1.49 to 1.56 log reduction during 28 days in beer at 5 degrees C). Beer and refined rice wine supported microbial survival from several days to several weeks. Our results appear to contradict the common belief that pathogens cannot survive in alcoholic beverages. Long-term survival of pathogens (especially B. cereus and E. coli O157:H7) in beer and refined rice wine should be taken into consideration by the manufacturers of these beverages. This study provides basic information that should help further research into microbial survival in alcoholic beverages and increase the microbiological safety regulation of fermented alcoholic beverages.
TI  - Evaluation of a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial contamination in apheresis and pooled random-donor platelet units.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite existing strategies, bacterial contamination of platelets (PLTs) remains a problem, and reliable testing near the time of use is needed. We evaluated the BacTx assay (Immunetics, Inc.), a rapid colorimetric assay for detection of bacterial peptidoglycan, for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Apheresis- and whole blood-derived PLT units, the latter tested in 6-unit pools, inoculated with 10 representative bacterial species (eight aerobic, two anaerobic), were tested with the BacTx assay at two sites to determine analytic sensitivity and time to detection. Specificity on sterile PLTs and reproducibility across different PLT units and assay kit lots was also determined. RESULTS: Analytical sensitivity for the 10 bacterial species ranged from 6.3 x 10(2) to 7.6 x 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. In time-to-detection studies after inoculation of PLTs with 0.7 to 5.3 CFUs/mL, 10 replicates of all eight aerobic species were positive when bacterial titers were above the analytic sensitivity detection limit, which occurred at 48 hours for 60 PLT units and at 72 hours for the remaining 4 units, as well as at 7 days for all units. Specificity was 99.8% and reproducibility was 100%. CONCLUSIONS: The BacTx assay had an analytical sensitivity below the 10(5) CFUs/mL threshold of clinical significance, detected all eight aerobic bacterial species 48 to 72 hours after inoculation as well as at 7 days, and had high specificity and reproducibility. These findings suggest that the BacTx assay will be a valuable test for detection of clinically relevant levels of bacterial contaminants in PLT units and pools near time of use.
TI  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles using Delphinium denudatum root extract exhibits antibacterial and mosquito larvicidal activities.
AB  - Green synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using aqueous root extract of Delphinium denudatum (Dd) by reduction of Ag(+) ions from silver nitrate solution has been investigated. The synthesized DdAgNPs were characterized by using UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The prepared DdAgNPs showed maximum absorbance at 416nm and particles were polydispersed in nature, spherical in shape and the size of the particle obtained was85nm. The DdAgNPs exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Bacillus cereus NCIM 2106, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027. The DdAgNPs showed potent larvicidal activity against second instar larvae of dengue vector Aedes aegypti with a LC50 value of 9.6ppm.
TI  - Crystal and solution structure analysis of FhuD2 from Staphylococcus aureus in multiple unliganded conformations and bound to ferrioxamine-B.
AB  - Iron acquisition is a central process for virtually all organisms. In Staphylococcus aureus, FhuD2 is a lipoprotein that is a high-affinity receptor for iron-bound hydroxamate siderophores. In this study, FhuD2 was crystallized bound to ferrioxamine-B (FXB), and also in its ligand-free state; the latter structures are the first for hydroxamate-binding receptors within this protein family. The structure of the FhuD2-FXB conformation shows that residues W197 and R199 from the C-terminal domain donate hydrogen bonds to the hydroxamate oxygens, and a ring of aromatic residues cradles the aliphatic arms connecting the hydroxamate moieties of the siderophore. The available ligand-bound structures of FhuD from Escherichia coli and YfiY from Bacillus cereus show that, despite a high degree of structural conservation, three protein families have evolved with critical siderophore binding residues on either the C-terminal domain (S. aureus), the N-terminal domain (E. coli), or both (B. cereus). Unliganded FhuD2 was crystallized in five conformations related by rigid body movements of the N- and C-terminal domains. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) indicates that the solution conformation of unliganded FhuD2 is more compact than the conformations observed in crystals. The ligand-induced conformational changes for FhuD2 in solution are relatively modest and depend on the identity of the siderophore. The crystallographic and SAXS results are used to discuss roles for the liganded and unliganded forms of FhuD2 in the siderophore transport mechanism.
TI  - Diffusible signal factor (DSF) quorum sensing signal and structurally related molecules enhance the antimicrobial efficacy of antibiotics against some bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extensive use of antibiotics has fostered the emergence of superbugs  that are resistant to multidrugs, which becomes a great healthcare and public concern. Previous studies showed that quorum sensing signal DSF (diffusible signal factor) not only modulates bacterial antibiotic resistance through intraspecies signaling, but also affects bacterial antibiotic tolerance through interspecies communication. These findings motivate us to exploit the possibility of using DSF and its structurally related molecules as adjuvants to influence antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial pathogens. RESULTS: In this study, we have demonstrated that DSF signal and its structurally related molecules could be used to induce bacterial antibiotic susceptibility. Exogenous addition of DSF signal (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid) and its structural analogues could significantly increase the antibiotic susceptibility of Bacillus cereus, possibly through reducing drug-resistant activity, biofilm formation and bacterial fitness. The synergistic effect of DSF and its structurally related molecules with antibiotics on B. cereus is dosage-dependent. Combination of DSF with gentamicin showed an obviously synergistic effect on B. cereus pathogenicity in an in vitro model. We also found that DSF could increase the antibiotic susceptibility of other bacterial species, including Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Neisseria subflava and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: The results indicate a promising potential of using DSF and its structurally related molecules as novel adjuvants to conventional antibiotics for treatment of infectious diseases caused by bacterial pathogens.
TI  - The first report on flavonoid isolation from Annona crassiflora Mart.
AB  - Annona crassiflora, a native tree from Brazilian Cerrado, is reported to possess  several ethnomedical uses. Here, we report the isolation and unambiguous characterisation of the flavonoids quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosil(1 --> 6)-O-alpha-L-arabinoside (1), known as peltatoside, kaempferol-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (2), quercetin-3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (3), quercetin-3-O-beta-L-arabinopiranoside (4) and the ( - )-epicatechin (5) from the hydroalcoholic portion of the leaf ethanolic extract. Their structures were elucidated by using 1D and 2D NMR, ESI-MS, UV/Vis spectroscopy, optical rotation analysis and literature data comparison. The leaf ethanolic extract and its isolated compounds were evaluated by using antimicrobial, antioxidant and larvicidal assays, expressing antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. This is the first report on flavonoid isolation from A. crassiflora.
TI  - New flavonoids C-glycosides from Rhabdophyllum arnoldianum.
AB  - Two new flavone glycosides, 3''-O-acetyl-7-O-methylvitexin (1) and 6''-alpha-rhamnopyranosyl-7-O-methylvitexin (2), along with nine known compounds (3-11) were isolated from the leaves of Rhabdophyllum arnoldianum (Ochnaceae). The structures of the new compounds were established by detailed spectroscopic studies and mass spectrometry, while known compounds were characterised by direct comparison of their reported NMR data with those found in the literature. All these compounds were the first reported from Rhabdophyllum genus. The biological assays on crude extracts and compounds of this plant demonstrated that the crude extracts possess significant antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of acid-hydrolyzed Citrus unshiu peel extract in milk.
AB  - Citrus fruit (Citrus unshiu) peels were extracted with hot water and then acid-hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid. Antimicrobial activities of acid-hydrolyzed Citrus unshiu peel extract were evaluated against pathogenic bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Antilisterial effect was also determined by adding extracts at 1, 2, and 4% to whole, low-fat, and skim milk. The cell numbers of B. cereus, Staph. aureus, and L. monocytogenes cultures treated with acid-hydrolyzed extract for 12h at 35 degrees C were reduced from about 8log cfu/mL to <1log cfu/mL. Bacillus cereus was more sensitive to acid-hydrolyzed Citrus unshiu peel extract than were the other bacteria. The addition of 4% acid-hydrolyzed Citrus unshiu extracts to all types of milk inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes within 1d of storage at 4 degrees C. The results indicated that Citrus unshiu peel extracts, after acid hydrolysis, effectively inhibited the growth of pathogenic bacteria. These findings indicate that acid hydrolysis of Citrus unshiu peel facilitates its use as a natural antimicrobial agent for food products.
TI  - Colloidal polyaniline dispersions: antibacterial activity, cytotoxicity and neutrophil oxidative burst.
AB  - Polyaniline colloids rank among promising application forms of this conducting polymer. Cytotoxicity, antibacterial activity, and neutrophil oxidative burst tests were performed on cells treated with colloidal polyaniline dispersions. The antibacterial effect of colloidal polyaniline against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was most pronounced for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli, with a minimum inhibitory concentration of 3,500 mug mL(-1). The data recorded on human keratinocyte (HaCaT) and a mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH/3T3) cell lines using an MTT assay and flow cytometry indicated a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity of colloid, with the absence of cytotoxic effect at around 150 mug mL(-1). The neutrophil oxidative burst test then showed that colloidal polyaniline, in concentrations <150 mug mL(-1), was not able to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species in neutrophils and whole human blood. However, it worked efficiently as a scavenger of those already formed.
TI  - Cerecidins, novel lantibiotics from Bacillus cereus with potent antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized and posttranslationally modified antimicrobial peptides that are widely produced by Gram-positive bacteria, including many species of the Bacillus group. In the present study, one novel gene cluster coding lantibiotic cerecidins was unveiled in Bacillus cereus strain As 1.1846 through genomic mining and PCR screening. The designated cer locus is different from that of conventional class II lantibiotics in that it included seven tandem precursor cerA genes, one modification gene (cerM), two processing genes (cerT and cerP), one orphan regulator gene (cerR), and two immunity genes (cerF and cerE). In addition, one unprecedented quorum sensing component, comQXPA, was inserted between cerM and cerR. The expression of cerecidins was not detected in this strain of B. cereus, which might be due to repressed transcription of cerM. We constitutively coexpressed cerA genes and cerM in Escherichia coli, and purified precerecidins were proteolytically processed with the endoproteinase GluC and a truncated version of putative serine protease CerP. Thus, two natural variants of cerecidins A1 and A7 were obtained which contained two terminal nonoverlapping thioether rings rarely found in lantibiotics. Both cerecidins A1 and A7 were active against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive bacteria. Cerecidin A7, especially its mutant Dhb13A, showed remarkable efficacy against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MDRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE), and even Streptomyces.
TI  - Antibacterial potency of housefly larvae extract from sewage sludge through bioconversion.
AB  - Use of the fly to convert sewage sludge into nutrient-rich soil conditioner and amendment is an attractive approach for sludge bioconversion. During this process, fecal coliforms, an indicating pathogen, in sludge were reduced to 5.3 x 10(2) most probable number/g dry solid from initial 3.32 x 10(6) MPN/g dry solid. It was also found that the extract of larvae grown in sludge during bioconversion have an observable inhibitory effect against bacteria compared to larvae grown in wheat bran as measured by minimum bacterial concentration tests. In vitro antimicrobial assay tests over time also showed that the extract had strong inhibitory efficiencies of ca. 99% against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Serratia marcescens, while the efficiency was 69% and 57% against Bacillus subtilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. The observed pathogenic bacterial cell membrane damage was found to be responsible for the phenomenon mentioned above, with nuclear acids leaching out quickly and alkaline phosphatase increasing in the outer membrane, followed by an increase of beta-galactosidase in the inner membrane. Clearly, housefly larvae extract from sewage sludge through bioconversion possesses antibacterial potency against pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Influence of phenolic compounds of Kangra tea [Camellia sinensis (L) O Kuntze] on bacterial pathogens and indigenous bacterial probiotics of Western Himalayas.
AB  - Phenolic compounds of nutraceutical importance viz., catechins (C), (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC), (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) were estimated in fresh green tea shoots of Camellia sinensis (L) O Kuntze cultivar. The total polyphenols and total catechins were in the range of 219.90 to 317.81 and 140.83 to 271.39 g/kg, respectively in monthly samples of tea. The values of C, EC, EGC, EGCG and ECG in tea powders as analyzed through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were in the range of 1.560 to 3.661, 13.338 to 27.766, 26.515 to 39.597, 62.903 to 102.168 and 18.969 to 39.469 mg/g, respectively. Effect of tea extracts and standard flavanols against five pathogenic bacteria viz., Listeria monocytogenes (MTCC-839), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MTCC-741), Bacillus cereus (MTCC-1272), Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC-96) and Escherichia coli (MTCC-443), and eleven indigenous potential bacterial probiotics belonging to genera Enterococcus, Bacillus and Lactobacillus spp. obtained from fermented foods of Western Himalayas, was investigated. EGCG, ECG and EGC exhibited antibacterial activity but, C and EC did not show this activity. Tea extracts having high concentrations of EGCG and ECG were more potent in antibacterial action against bacterial pathogens. Tea extracts and standard flavan-3-ols augmented viability of potential probiotics in an order of EGCG > EGC > ECG > EC > C. Tea extracts and standard flavanols had no antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (MTCC-443) but, in combination with probiotic culture supernatants, this activity was seen. The Kangra tea thus, exerts antibacterial effect on bacterial pathogens through EGCG, ECG and EGC constituents while stimulatory effect on growth of indigenous potential probiotics.
TI  - Multiplex PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assay for detection of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella sp., Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in spiked shrimps (Penaeus monodon).
AB  - The coastal aquaculture mainly shrimps constitute major export sector in Bangladesh and is increasingly shaped by international trade conditions and by national responses to those stringent quality and safety standards. PCR based validated methods for detection of major bacterial pathogens in shrimp might be very useful tool for ensuring quality and safety standards of exportable shrimps. The objective of this study was to evaluate overall performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the multiplex PCR assay for detection of Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella sp. and Escherichia coli O157:H7 from spiked shrimp samples. The targeted genes were ompW for V. cholerae, tdh for V. parahaemolyticus, sefA for Salmonella spp. and hlyEHEC for E. coli O157:H7. The genomic DNA was extracted by using standard method and amplified accordingly. Sensitivity of the assay was tested by inoculating the shrimp homogenate with viable cells of laboratory references strains (target pathogens). The genes were amplified individually both from culture homogenate and spiked samples. Twenty different uniplex and multiplex PCR assay were performed; the results showed that the sensitivity and specificity of multiplex PCR are comparable to that of the results of uniplex PCR for the samples. DNA extracted from shrimp samples spiked with non-target pathogen (Bacillus cereus, Shigella flexneri and Staphylococcus aureus) yielded negative results.
TI  - Efficacy of commercial natural antimicrobials alone and in combinations against pathogenic and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Microbial control strategies are needed in the food industry to prevent foodborne illnesses and outbreaks and prolong product shelf life. The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of the commercial natural antimicrobials white mustard essential oil (WMEO), citrus flavonoid and acid blend (CFAB), olive extract (OE), Nisaplin (a compound containing nisin), and lauric arginate (LAE) alone and in combinations against foodborne pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. MICs of individual and combined antimicrobials against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined at pH 6.0 and 25 degrees C. WMEO was most effective against B. cereus and S. aureus, with MICs of 250 and 500 mg/liter, respectively. CFAB inhibited all tested microorganisms, requiring only 12 to 35 mg/liter for gram-positive bacteria. For OE, 2,000 mg/liter was needed to achieve microbial inhibition. Nisaplin at 400 to 1,200 mg/liter inhibited only gram-positive bacteria. LAE was effective at low concentrations and required only 20 to 50 mg/liter to inhibit all tested microorganisms. When WMEO was combined with other antimicrobials, the effects were usually additive except for WMEO plus Nisaplin and WMEO+OE, which had synergistic activity against L. monocytogenes and Salmonella Enteritidis, respectively. An antagonistic effect was observed for WMEO+CFAB against E. aerogenes. For WMEO+LAE+CFAB, additive antimicrobial effects were noted against all strains tested except S. aureus, where a synergistic effect occurred. These findings suggest that these commercial natural antimicrobials have potential to enhance food safety by inhibiting foodborne pathogens and extending product shelf life.
TI  - Spectroscopy and solvatochromism studies along with antioxidant and antibacterial activities investigation of azo-azomethine compounds 2-(2-hydroxyphenylimino)methyl)-4-phenyldiazenyl)phenol.
AB  - The azo-azomethine compounds 2-(2-hydroxyphenylimino)methyl)-4-phenyldiazenyl)phenol (2a-d) were prepared from the reaction of 2-aminophenol with 2-hydroxy-5-(aryldiazenyl)benzaldehyde (1a-d). The structures of all compounds were then characterized by elemental analysis, mass, infrared, UV-vis, (1)H and (13)C NMR spectroscopy. The electronic absorption spectra indicated enol-keto tautomeric and positive solvatochromism in compounds (2a-d), which is dependent on the substitution, nature of solvent, pH and environment temperature. The compounds (2a-d) were also evaluated for antibiotic activities by disc diffusion method. Compounds 2a and 2b exhibited antibacterial activities against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, but 2c and 2d were found to have no remarkable antibacterial activity. All the compounds (2a-d) also showed antioxidant activity as determined by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) method.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity, growth inhibition of human tumour cell lines, and phytochemical characterization of the hydromethanolic extract obtained from Sapindus saponaria L. aerial parts.
AB  - The hydromethanolic extract of Sapindus saponaria L. aerial parts was investigated for antimicrobial activity (against several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi) and capacity to inhibit the growth of different human tumor cell lines as also nontumor liver cells. The evaluated extract was further characterized in terms of phytochemicals using UV, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, and MS spectroscopic tools. The extract has shown a significant antimicrobial activity on all tested bacterial and fungal species. The best activity was achieved against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus among bacteria and against all three Penicillium species tested. It also revealed cytotoxicity against human colon (HCT-15), cervical (HeLa), breast (MCF-7), and lung (NCI-H460) carcinoma cell lines, with HeLa being the most susceptible tumor cell line. The extract was not toxic for nontumor liver cells. Chromatographic separation of the extract resulted in the isolation and identification of stigmasterol, oleanolic acid, luteolin, luteolin 8-C-beta-glucoside (orientin), luteolin 6-C-beta-glucoside (isoorientin), luteolin 7-O-beta-glucuronide, and rutin. The results of the present findings may be useful for the discovery of novel antitumor and antimicrobial agents from plant origin.
TI  - Brown seaweed (Saccharina japonica) as an edible natural delivery matrix for allyl isothiocyanate inhibiting food-borne bacteria.
AB  - The edible, brown seaweed Saccharina japonica was prepared as powder in the size  range 500-900 mum for the desorption release of allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). Powders were used as raw (containing lipids) and as de-oiled, where the lipid was removed. In general, de-oiled powders adsorbed larger masses of AITC after vapour or solution contact. Mass adsorbed due to solution contact exceeded vapour contact. Larger particles adsorbed more than smaller particles. No chemical bonding between AITC and the powder surface occurred. Release from vapour deposited particles reached 70-85% available within 72 h; solution deposited reached 70-90% available at 192 h. The larger amounts of AITC adsorbed via solution deposition resulted in greater vapour-phase concentrations at 72 h for antimicrobial activity studies. No loss of activity was detected against Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhimurium or Bacillus cereus. Only a nominal activity against Staphylococcus aureus was demonstrated. S. japonica powder could be used as an edible, natural vehicle for AITC delivery.
TI  - Hydrothermal synthesis of copper based nanoparticles: antimicrobial screening and interaction with DNA.
AB  - Copper based nanoparticles (Cu-based NPs) of different compositions and sizes have been hydrothermally synthesized by varying the reaction time in the presence of the biocompatible surfactants polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan laurate (Tween 20) and polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG 8000). Effective control of the above synthetic parameters gave rise to Cu, Cu2O and Cu/Cu2O NPs of 10-44 nm. The antibacterial activity of the NPs was screened against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Xanthomonas campestris, Escherichia coli) bacteria. The Cu-based NPs induce pDNA degradation in a dose-dependent manner as well as extensive ds CT-DNA degradation. Cu2O NPs of 16 nm and 12 nm exhibit the lowest IC50 values (2.13 mug/mL and 3.7 mug/mL) against B. cereus and B. subtilis, respectively. The agarose gel electrophoresis of ds CT-DNA treated with Cu2O NPs demonstrated degradation at high concentration. In lower concentrations, viscosity measurements indicated groove binding. In regard to the enhanced antibacterial effect and specificity of Cu2O NPs against the Gram-positive strains, the activity pathway was further explored and ROS production and lipid peroxidation verified. The released copper ions 5.15 mg/L in distilled water and 16.32 mg/L in nutrient medium, found below the critical value to inhibit bacterial growth and thus nanosized composition effect is predominant.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological studies of substituted quinozoline-4-(3H)-ones containing diazepine moiety.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of new series of 1,4-benzodiazepine derivatives have been presented. The structures were confirmed by elemental analyses, IR spectral, (1)H NMR spectral and mass spectral data. All the compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities. The antibacterial activity was tested against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive), Bacillus cereus (Gram positive), Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram negative). The antifungal activity was tested against Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans. All the compounds showed considerable antimicrobial activity against the microorganism studied. The significant anthelmintic activity of all novel compounds was demonstrated against Pheretima posthuma. Based on the nature of substituent present, the structure-activity correlation of novel compounds was discussed.
TI  - Trifolium pratense L. as a potential natural antioxidant.
AB  - The essential oils of three different growth stages of Trifolium pratense L. (TP1, TP2 and TP3) were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and tested for their antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. The highest content of volatile compounds was found in the essential oil sample TP1, where terpenes such as beta-myrcene (4.55%), p-cymene (3.59%), limonene (0.86%), tetrahydroionone (1.56%) were highlighted due to their biological activity. The antioxidant activity was determined by following the scavenging capacity of the essential oils for the free radicals DPPH., NO. and O2.-, as well as effects of the investigated oils on lipid peroxidation (LP). In all three cases, the sample TP1 showed the best radical-capturing capacity for DPPH. (27.61+/-0.12 microg/mL), NO. (16.03+/-0.11 microg/mL), O2.- (16.62+/-0.29 microg/mL) and also had the best lipid peroxidation effects in the Fe2+/ascorbate induction system (9.35+/-0.11 microg/mL). Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against the following bacteria cultures: Escherichia coli (ATCC10526), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 11632) and Bacillus cereus (ATCC 10876). None of the examined essential oil samples showed inhibitory effects on the tested bacterial strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different natural honeys from Transylvania, Romania.
AB  - Honey is used in food industry and medicine due to its nutritive, therapeutic and dietetic qualities. The microbiological characteristics of 10 unpasteurized honey samples of known origin, collected from Transylvania beekeepers (Romania) were determined. The antibacterial activity of these types of honey against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella anatum, Salmonella choleraesuis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis subsp. spizizenii and Listeria monocytogenes strains was studied. The most sensitive to the antibacterial activity were the two staphylococus strains (the largest diameter of inhibition zone was 18 mm) and B. subtilis strains (13.5 mm). The strains of B. cereus, E. coli, L. monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. were found to present resistance to some of the honey samples. Manna, sunflower and polyfloral honeys presented high antibacterial activity while acacia and linden honeys had a lower activity in terms of the number of sensible strains. Statistical analysis shows that the type of strains and the type of honey have influence on the diameter of inhibition.
TI  - Synthesis of novel 2-(substituted amino)alkylthiopyrimidin-4(3H)-ones as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - 5-Alkyl-6-(substituted benzyl)-2-thiouracils 3a,c were reacted with (2-chloroethyl) diethylamine hydrochloride to afford the corresponding 2-(2-diethylamino)ethylthiopyrimidin- 4(3H)-ones 4a,b. Reaction of 3a-c with N-(2-chloroethyl)pyrrolidine hydrochloride and/or N-(2-chloroethyl)piperidine hydrochloride gave the corresponding 2-[2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)ethyl]-thiopyrimidin-4(3H)-ones 5a-c and 2-[2-(piperidin-1-yl)ethyl]thiopyrimidin-4(3H)-ones 6a,b, respectively. Treatment of 3a-d with N-(2-chloroethyl)morpholine hydrochloride under the same reaction conditions formed the corresponding 2-[2-(morpholin-4-yl)ethyl]thiopyrimidines 6c-f. On the other hand, 3a,b were reacted with N-(2-bromoethyl)phthalimide and/or N-(3-bromopropyl)phthalimide to furnish the corresponding 2-[2-(N-phthalimido)ethyl]-pyrimidines 7a,b and 2-[3-(N-phthalimido)-propyl]pyrimidines 7c,d, respectively. Compounds 3a-d, 4a,b, 5a-c, 6a-f and 7a-d were screened against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Bacillus subtilis NRRL 4219 and Bacillus cereus), yeast-like pathogenic fungus (Candida albicans ATCC 10231) and a fungus (Aspergillusniger NRRL 599). The best antibacterial activity was displayed by compounds 3a, 3b, 4a, 5a, 5b, 6d, 6f, 7b and 7d, whereas compounds 4b, 5b, 5c, 6a, 6b and 6f exhibited the best antifungal activity.
TI  - In-vitro anticancer and antimicrobial activities of PLGA/silver nanofiber composites prepared by electrospinning.
AB  - In the present work, a series of 0, 1 and 7 wt% silver nano-particles (Ag NPs) incorporated poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nano-fibers were synthesized by the electrospinning process. The PLGA/Ag nano-fibers sheets were characterized using SEM, TEM and DSC analyses. The three synthesized PLGA/silver nano-fiber composites were screened for anticancer activity against liver cancer cell line using MTT and LDH assays. The anticancer activity of PLGA nano-fibers showed a remarkable improvement due to increasing the concentration of the Ag NPs. In addition to the given result, PLGA nano-fibers did not show any cytotoxic effect. However, PLGA nano-fibers that contain 1 % nano silver showed anticancer activity of 8.8 %, through increasing the concentration of the nano silver to 7 % onto PLGA nano-fibers, the anticancer activity was enhanced to a 67.6 %. Furthermore, the antibacterial activities of these three nano-fibers, against the five bacteria strains namely; E.coli o157:H7 ATCC 51659, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 13565, Bacillus cereus EMCC 1080, Listeria monocytogenes EMCC 1875 and Salmonella typhimurium ATCC25566 using the disc diffusion method, were evaluated. Sample with an enhanced inhibitory effect was PLGA/Ag NPs (7 %) which inhibited all strains (inhibition zone diameter 10 mm); PLGA/Ag NPs (1 %) sample inhibited only one strain (B. cereus) with zone diameter 8 mm. The PLGA nano-fiber sample has not shown any antimicrobial activity. Based on the anticancer as well as the antimicrobial results in this study, it can be postulated that: PLGA nanofibers containing 7 % nano silver are suitable as anticancer- and antibiotic-drug delivery systems, as they will increase the anticancer as well as the antibiotic drug potency without cytotoxicity effect on the normal cells. These findings also suggest that Ag NPs, of the size (5-10 nm) evaluated in the present study, are appropriate for therapeutic application from a safety standpoint.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activities of honey collected from Timergara (Dir, Pakistan).
AB  - In this study honeys of Acacia modesta, Prunus persica, Zizyphus sativa and Isodon rogosus plants were tested against two Gram-positive bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), two Gram-negative bacterial strains (Klebsilla pneumonia and Escherichia coli) and two fungal strains (Alternaria alternata and Trichoderma harzianum) through Agar well diffusion method. The tested honeys showed high antimicrobial activities to the tested bacterial and fungal strains. All the tested honeys were more active against Gram-negative bacterial strains than the Gram-positive bacterial strains. They showed lower activity against the tested fungal strains as compared to all the tested bacterial strains. The given honeys showed free radical scavenging activity also.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 2-alkynoic fatty acids against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The first study aimed at determining the structural characteristics needed to prepare antibacterial 2-alkynoic fatty acids (2-AFAs) was accomplished by synthesizing several 2-AFAs and other analogs in 18-76% overall yields. Among all the compounds tested, the 2-hexadecynoic acid (2-HDA) displayed the best overall antibacterial activity against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=15.6 mug/mL), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (MIC=15.5 mug/mL), and Bacillus cereus (MIC=31.3 mug/mL), as well as against the Gram-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.8 mug/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC=125 mug/mL). In addition, 2-HDA displayed significant antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) ATCC 43300 (MIC=15.6 mug/mL) and clinical isolates of MRSA (MIC=3.9 mug/mL). No direct relationship was found between the antibacterial activity of 2-AFAs and their critical micelle concentration (CMC) suggesting that the antibacterial properties of these fatty acids are not mediated by micelle formation. It was demonstrated that the presence of a triple bond at C-2 and the carboxylic acid moiety in 2-AFAs are important for their antibacterial activity. 2-HDA has the potential to be further evaluated for use in antibacterial formulations.
TI  - A new bis-labdanic diterpene from the rhizomes of Alpinia pahangensis.
AB  - The rhizomes of Alpinia pahangensis yielded a new bis-labdanic diterpene for which the name pahangensin C (1) was proposed along with twelve known analogues (2-13). The structure of 1 was elucidated via spectroscopic methods including 1D and 2D NMR techniques and LCMS-IT-TOF analysis. Compounds 2 and 12 were isolated for the first time from the genus Alpinia. This is the second occurrence of compounds 2 and 12 in the Zingiberaceae family. Selected analogues exhibited moderate to strong inhibitory activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - An alkenylresorcinol derivative from Hakea sericea fruits and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Hakea sericea has been introduced to Portugal for ornamental purposes. The phytochemical composition and the antioxidant, antibacterial, antibiofilm and cytotoxic properties of this shrub species have been previously reported. The present work describes the bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude methanolic extract of H. sericea fruits and the isolation of 9-(3,5-dihydroxy-4-methylphenyl)nona-3(Z)-enoic acid. The structure of this new compound was established by one- and two-dimensional NMR and IR spectroscopy, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The antibacterial properties of the new alkenylresorcinolwere studied by determining its MIC values against several strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria using the resazurin microtiter assay. The new alkenylresorcinol inhibited the growth of Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus with MIC values of 0.31, 0.02 and 0.16 mg/mL, respectively. Good MIC values were obtained against Staphylococcus aureus strains (0.005 - 0.16 mg/mL), including the clinical isolates (SA 01/10, SA 02/10 and SA 03/10) and MRSA strains.
TI  - Characterization of amylolysin, a novel lantibiotic from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GA1.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lantibiotics are heat-stable peptides characterized by the presence of thioether amino acid lanthionine and methyllanthionine. They are capable to inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria, including Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus, the causative agents of food-borne diseases or nosocomial infections. Lantibiotic biosynthetic machinery is encoded by gene cluster composed by a structural gene that codes for a pre-lantibiotic peptide and other genes involved in pre-lantibiotic modifications, regulation, export and immunity. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GA1 was found to produce an antimicrobial peptide, named amylolysin, active on an array of Gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin resistant S. aureus. Genome characterization led to the identification of a putative lantibiotic gene cluster that comprises a structural gene (amlA) and genes involved in modification (amlM), transport (amlT), regulation (amlKR) and immunity (amlFE). Disruption of amlA led to loss of biological activity, confirming thus that the identified gene cluster is related to amylolysin synthesis. MALDI-TOF and LC-MS analysis on purified amylolysin demonstrated that this latter corresponds to a novel lantibiotic not described to date. The ability of amylolysin to interact in vitro with the lipid II, the carrier of peptidoglycan monomers across the cytoplasmic membrane and the presence of a unique modification gene suggest that the identified peptide belongs to the group B lantibiotic. Amylolysin immunity seems to be driven by only two AmlF and AmlE proteins, which is uncommon within the Bacillus genus. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Apart from mersacidin produced by Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains Y2 and HIL Y-85,544728, reports on the synthesis of type B-lantibiotic in this species are scarce. This study reports on a genetic and structural characterization of another representative of the type B lantibiotic in B. amyloliquefaciens.
TI  - New hydrazones with pyrazolone structure: synthesis, characterization and biological evaluation.
AB  - AIM: To design new hydrazones with pyrazolone structure with improved biological  properties. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New hydrazones of antipyrine have been prepared by reaction of 4-aminophenazone (4-aminoantipyrine) with chloracetylchoride and hydrazine hydrate and then condensation with various aromatic aldehydes. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Sarcinalutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Bacillus subtilis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922) and pathogenic yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 10231, Candida sake, Candidaglabrata). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial and antifungal activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also evaluated using the total antioxidant capacity test. CONCLUSIONS: The chemical modulations performed on antipyrine structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds.
TI  - New derivatives of aryl-propionic acid. Synthesis and biological evaluation.
AB  - AIM: To design new derivatives of aryl-propionic acid with potential antibacterial and antioxidant activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS: New hydrazone of ibuprofen (2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid) have been synthesized by reaction of ethyl ester of ibuprofen with hydrazine hydrate and then condensation of corresponding hydrazide with various aromatic aldehydes. RESULTS: The synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Sarcinalutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579, Bacillus subtilis) and Gram negative bacterial strains (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922). Some of them were found to have good antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity of these compounds was also tested using the total antiox idant capacity test. CONCLUSIONS: The chemical modulations performed on ibuprofen structure have a good influence on the biological activity of the synthesized compounds.
TI  - Capillary electrophoresis of microbial aggregates.
AB  - Uncontrolled aggregation of bacterial cells is a significant disadvantage of electrophoretic separations. Various aspects of the electrophoretic behavior of different strains of Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus(1), and Micrococcus luteus bacteria and Gram-negative Escherichia coli bacteria were investigated in this study. Our findings indicate that bacteria can be rapidly analyzed by CZE with surface charge modification by calcium ions (Ca(2+)). Bound Ca(2+) ions increase zeta potential to more than 2.0 mV and significantly reduce repulsive forces. Under the above conditions, bacterial cells create compact aggregates, and fewer high-intensity signals are observed in electropherograms. The above can be attributed to the bridging effect of Ca(2+) between bacterial cells. CE was performed to analyze bacterial aggregates in an isotachophoretic mode. A single peak was observed in the electropherogram.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the roots, stems and leaves of Alchornea floribunda.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Alchornea floribunda Mull. Arg. is used in traditional medicine across Africa for the treatment of bacterial, fungal, parasitic and inflammatory disorders. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate the antibacterial activity of the crude extracts of different plant parts in order to provide a scientific rationale for the proposed broad efficacy of Alchornea floribunda in the treatment of bacterial infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracts of roots, stems and leaves were prepared using solvents of various polarities in order to extract a wide range of phytochemicals. The antibacterial activity of these crude extracts was evaluated by micro-dilution assay, against Gram-positive (i.e. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus saprophyticus) as well as Gram-negative (i.e. Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria. RESULTS: Generally, the ethanol (EtOH), methanol (MeOH), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and chloroform (CHCl3) extracts demonstrated the best activities, with the leaves exhibiting the highest average activity for six of the eight pathogens. Of these, the ethanolic leaf extract was the most active against Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 50microg/mL. Some other notable activity was observed for the ethyl acetate and chloroform root extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), and for selected stem extracts against Staphylococcus aureus (50microg/mL), Klebsiella pneumoniae (63microg/mL) and Staphylococcus saprophyticus (63microg/mL). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the promising antibacterial activity of Alchornea floribunda against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria responsible for gastrointestinal, skin, respiratory and urinary ailments, and validates its use in the ethnopharmacology of the region.
TI  - Synergy of antibacterial and antioxidant activities from crude extracts and peptides of selected plant mixture.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A plant mixture containing indigenous Australian plants was examined  for synergistic antimicrobial activity using selected test microorganisms. This study aims to investigate antibacterial activities, antioxidant potential and the content of phenolic compounds in aqueous, ethanolic and peptide extracts of plant mixture. METHODS: Well diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) assays were used to test antibacterial activity against four pathogenic bacteria namely Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. DPPH (2, 2-diphenyl-1- picrylhydrazyl) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) assays were used to evaluate antioxidant activity. HPLC and gel filtration were used for purification of the peptides. Scanning electron microscope was applied to investigate the mode of attachment of the peptides on target microbial membranes. RESULTS: Aqueous extraction of the mixture showed no inhibition zones against all the test bacteria. Mean diameter of inhibition zones for ethanol extraction of this mixture attained 8.33 mm, 7.33 mm, and 6.33 mm against S. aureus at corresponding concentrations of 500, 250 and 125 mg/ml while E .coli showed inhibition zones of 9.33 mm, 8.00 mm and 6.66 mm at the same concentrations. B. cereus exhibited inhibition zones of 11.33 mm, 10.33 mm and 10.00 mm at concentrations of 500, 250 and 125 mg/ml respectively. The peptide extract demonstrated antibacterial activity against S. aureus, E. coli and B. cereus. The MIC and MBC values for ethanol extracts were determined at 125 mg/ml concentration against S. aureus and E. coli and B. cereus value was 31.5 mg/ml. MIC and MBC values showed that the peptide extract was significantly effective at low concentration of the Australian plant mixture (APM). Phenolic compounds were detected in hot aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the plant mixture. Hot aqueous, ethanol and peptides extracts also exhibited antioxidant activities. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that APM possessed good antibacterial and antioxidant activities following extraction with different solvents. The results suggest that APM provide a new source with antibacterial agents and antioxidant activity for nutraceutical or medical applications.
TI  - A large outbreak of salmonellosis associated with sandwiches contaminated with multiple bacterial pathogens purchased via an online shopping service.
AB  - Food sold over the internet is an emerging business that also presents a concern  with regard to food safety. A nationwide foodborne disease outbreak associated with sandwiches purchased from an online shop in July 2010 is reported. Consumers were telephone interviewed with a structured questionnaire and specimens were collected for etiological examination. A total of 886 consumers were successfully contacted and completed the questionnaires; 36.6% had become ill, with a median incubation period of 18 h (range, 6-66 h). The major symptoms included diarrhea (89.2%), abdominal pain (69.8%), fever (47.5%), headache (32.7%), and vomiting (17.3%). Microbiological laboratories isolated Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Salmonella Virchow, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli from the contaminated sandwiches, Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Virchow from the patients, and Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus from food handlers. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis genotyping suggested a common origin of Salmonella bacteria recovered from the patients, food, and a food handler. Among the pathogens detected, the symptoms and incubation period indicated that Salmonella, likely of egg origin, was the probable causative agent of the outbreak. This outbreak illustrates the importance of meticulous hygiene practices during food preparation and temperature control during food shipment and the food safety challenges posed by online food-shopping services.
TI  - [Diagnosis and control of human food poisoning outbreaks].
AB  - Medical microbiology laboratories play a key role in the investigation of foodborne disease outbreaks. Bacterial pathogens (Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, etc) have historically been implicated in foodborne illness, while the role of viruses (especially Norovirus) appears to have been underestimated. Culture-based diagnosis has gradually been complemented, or replaced, by rapid molecular methods applied directly to biological samples. These new tools should help to reduce the number of outbreaks in which the etiological agent goes unidentified, and to improve the exhaustiveness of notifications.
TI  - Physicochemical properties of gelatin/silver nanoparticle antimicrobial composite films.
AB  - Active nanocomposite films were prepared by blending aqueous solutions of gelatin with different concentrations of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) using a solvent casting method. Formation of silver nanoparticles in the solution and films was confirmed with the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band at 400-450 nm, measured by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The incorporation of AgNPs slightly affected the physical and mechanical properties of the films. Increase in the concentration of AgNPs resulted in a substantial decrease in water vapour permeability (WVP) and tensile strength (TS) of the gelatin films. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the presence of elemental silver and crystalline structure of the AgNPs in the gelatin film. Microscopic surface structure and thermal properties of the films were also examined by FE-SEM and thermogravimetric analysis. Gelatin/AgNPs nanocomposite films exhibited strong antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens. Gelatin/AgNPs nanocomposite films are expected to have high potential as an active food packaging system to maintain food safety and to extend the shelf-life of packaged foods.
TI  - Effects of a skin neuropeptide (substance p) on cutaneous microflora.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin is the largest human neuroendocrine organ and hosts the second most numerous microbial population but the interaction of skin neuropeptides with the microflora has never been investigated. We studied the effect of Substance P (SP), a peptide released by nerve endings in the skin on bacterial virulence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Bacillus cereus, a member of the skin transient microflora, was used as a model. Exposure to SP strongly stimulated the cytotoxicity of B. cereus (+553+/-3% with SP 10(-6) M) and this effect was rapid (<5 min). Infection of keratinocytes with SP treated B. cereus led to a rise in caspase1 and morphological alterations of the actin cytoskeleton. Secretome analysis revealed that SP stimulated the release of collagenase and superoxide dismutase. Moreover, we also noted a shift in the surface polarity of the bacteria linked to a peel-off of the S-layer and the release of S-layer proteins. Meanwhile, the biofilm formation activity of B. cereus was increased. The Thermo unstable ribosomal Elongation factor (Ef-Tu) was identified as the SP binding site in B. cereus. Other Gram positive skin bacteria, namely Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis also reacted to SP by an increase of virulence. Thermal water from Uriage-les-Bains and an artificial polysaccharide (Teflose(R)) were capable to antagonize the effect of SP on bacterial virulence. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SP is released in sweat during stress and is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of numerous skin diseases through neurogenic inflammation. Our study suggests that a direct effect of SP on the skin microbiote should be another mechanism.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activities of Leaf Extracts of Guava (Psidium guajava L.) on Two Gram-Negative and Gram-Positive Bacteria.
AB  - Aim. To determine the antimicrobial potential of guava (Psidium guajava) leaf extracts against two gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis) and two gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) which are some of foodborne and spoilage bacteria. The guava leaves were extracted in four different solvents of increasing polarities (hexane, methanol, ethanol, and water). The efficacy of these extracts was tested against those bacteria through a well-diffusion method employing 50 mu L leaf-extract solution per well. According to the findings of the antibacterial assay, the methanol and ethanol extracts of the guava leaves showed inhibitory activity against gram-positive bacteria, whereas the gram-negative bacteria were resistant to all the solvent extracts. The methanol extract had an antibacterial activity with mean zones of inhibition of 8.27 and 12.3 mm, and the ethanol extract had a mean zone of inhibition of 6.11 and 11.0 mm against B. cereus and S. aureus, respectively. On the basis of the present finding, guava leaf-extract might be a good candidate in the search for a natural antimicrobial agent. This study provides scientific understanding to further determine the antimicrobial values and investigate other pharmacological properties.
TI  - Effect of different in vitro culture extracts of black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) on toxic metabolites-producing strains.
AB  - In the present study, the effect of different in vitro cultures (callus, in vitro shoots) and commercially available peppercorn extract was investigated for its activity against toxic metabolite-producing strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Salmonella typhi, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans). These in vitro cultures were extracted with ethanol, hexane, and chloroform, and the antipathogenic activity was determined by well-diffusion method. Hexane extract of callus showed 22 mm zone of inhibition against B. cereus, 23 mm against S. aureus, while regenerated shoots and seeds have shown 24.3 and 26 mm zones of inhibition. The ethanolic extracts of regenerated Piper shoots have shown 25 mm activity against S. aureus, 21 mm against B. cereus, and 16 mm in the case of C. albicans in comparison with standard antibiotics. Peppercorn extracts in chloroform and ethanol had shown activities against B. cereus (23.6 mm) and B. subtilis (23.5 mm). During in vitro organogenesis and morphogenesis, cells and tissues produced a comparable phytochemicals profile like mother plant. Morphogenesis is critically controlled by the application of exogenous plant-growth regulators. Such addition alters the hormonal transduction pathways, and cells under in vitro conditions regenerate tissues, which are dependant on the physiological state of cells, and finally enhance the production of secondary metabolites. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to compare the antimicrobial potential of in vitro regenerated tissues and peppercorn with standard antibiotics. In conclusion, most of the extracts showed pronounced activities against all the pathogenic microbes. This is a preliminary work, and the minimum inhibitory concentration values needs to be further explored. Regenerated tissues of P. nigrum are a good source of biologically active metabolites for antimicrobial activities, and callus culture presented itself as a good candidate for such activities.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis of Andrographis paniculata and Orthosiphon stamineus leaf  extracts for their antibacterial and antioxidant potential.
AB  - Leaves of Andrographis paniculata and Orthosiphon stamineus were extracted with water, ethanol, methanol and chloroform to assess their potential as antibacterial and antioxidant agents. High performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that the methanolic extracts of A. paniculata and O. stamineus leaves gave the highest amounts of andrographolide and rosmarinic acid, respectively. These leaf extracts exhibited antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and, at the highest concentration tested (200 mg/mL), showed greater inhibitory effects against the Gram positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus than 10% acetic acid. Andrographis paniculata and O. stamineus methanolic and ethanolic leaf extracts also showed the strongest antioxidant activity as compared with the other extracts tested. The bioactive compounds present in these leaf extracts have the potential to be developed into natural antibacterial and antioxidant agents that may have applications in animal and human health.
TI  - Development of new active packaging film made from a soluble soybean polysaccharide incorporated Zataria multiflora Boiss and Mentha pulegium essential oils.
AB  - An active edible film from soluble soybean polysaccharide (SSPS) incorporated with different concentrations of Zataria multiflora Boiss (ZEO) and Mentha pulegium (MEO) essential oils was developed, and the film's optical, wettability, thermal, total phenol and antioxidant characteristics were investigated, along with their antimicrobial effectiveness against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. The film's colour became darker and more yellowish and had a lower gloss as the levels of ZEO or MEO were increased. Antioxidant activity of the films was determined using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), and ferric-reducing antioxidant power assays. DPPH was reduced in the range of 19.84-74.12% depending on the essential oil type and concentration. Film incorporated with 3% (v/v) ZEO showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity and ferric reducing antioxidant power (IC50=4188.60+/-21.73mg/l and EC50=8.86+/-0.09mg/ml, respectively), compared with the control and MEO added film. Films containing ZEO were more effective against the tested bacteria than those containing MEO. S. aureus was found to be the most sensitive bacterium to both ZEO or MEO, followed by B. cereus and E. coli. A highest inhibition zone of 387.05mm(2) was observed for S. aureus around the films incorporated with 3% (v/v) ZEO. The total inhibitory zone of 3% (v/v) MEO formulated films was 21.98 for S. typhimurium and 10.15mm(2) for P. aeruginosa. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis revealed a single glass transition temperature (Tg) between 16 and 31 degrees C. The contact angle increased up to 175% and 38% as 3% (v/v) of ZEO or MEO used: it clearly shows that films with ZEO were more hydrophobic than those with MEO. The results showed that these two essential oils could be incorporated into SSPS films for food packaging.
TI  - Novel antibacterial activity of lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis z11 isolated from zabady.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to select and characterize a probiotic bacterium with distinctive antimicrobial activities. In this respect, Lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis Z11 (L. lactis Z11) isolated from Zabady (Arabian yoghurt) inhibited other strains of lactic acid bacteria and some food-born pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus. The inhibitory activity of cell free supernatant (CFS) of L. lactis Z11 isolated from zabady was lost by proteolytic enzymes, heat resistant. Consequently, the active substance(s) of CFS was characterized as a bacteriocin. This bacteriocin has been shown to consist of protein but has no lipidic or glucidic moieties in its active molecule. Its activity was stable in the pH range 2.0 to 7.0 and was not affected by organic solvents. The L. lactis Z11 bacteriocin was produced in CFS throughout the mide to the late exponential phase of growth of the producer organism and maximum bacteriocin production was obtained at initial pH 6.5 at incubation temperature of about 30 degrees C.
TI  - Pahangensin A and B, two new antibacterial diterpenes from the rhizomes of Alpinia pahangensis Ridley.
AB  - The rhizomes of Alpinia pahangensis Ridley yielded a new bis-labdanic diterpene for which the name pahangensin A (1) was proposed along with a new labdane diterpene, pahangensin B (2). Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic methods including, 1D and 2D NMR techniques and LCMS-IT-TOF analysis. Pahangensin A (1) was found to be an antibacterial agent against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis with MIC values less than 100 mug/mL, respectively. Pahangensin B (2) exhibited antibacterial activity (MIC <100 mug/mL) against B. cereus.
TI  - Potential cellular targets and antibacterial efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma.
AB  - Atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) has been gaining increasing interest as a new alternative antibacterial approach. Although this approach has demonstrated promising antibacterial activity, its exact mechanism of action remains unclear. Mechanistic elucidation of the antimicrobial activity will facilitate development and rational optimisation of this approach for potential medical applications. In this study, the antibacterial efficacy of an in-house-built APNTP jet was evaluated alongside an investigation of the interactions between APNTP and major cellular components in order to identify the potential cellular targets involved in plasma-mediated bacterial destruction mechanisms. The investigated plasma jet exhibited excellent, rapid antibacterial activity against a selected panel of clinically significant bacterial species including Bacillus cereus, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all of which were completely inactivated within 2 min of plasma exposure. Plasma-mediated damaging effects were observed, to varying degrees, on all of the investigated cellular components including DNA, a model protein enzyme, and lipid membrane integrity and permeability. The antibacterial efficacy of APNTP appears to involve a multiple-target mechanism, which potentially reduces the likelihood of emergence of microbial resistance towards this promising antimicrobial approach. However, cellular membrane damage and resulting permeability perturbation was found to be the most likely rate-determining step in this mechanism.
TI  - Volatile analysis and antimicrobial screening of the parasitic plant Cuscuta reflexa Roxb. from Nepal.
AB  - The essential oil from the parasitic vine Cuscuta reflexa Roxb., collected from Kirtipur, Kathmandu, Nepal, was obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. From a total of 62 peaks, 61 compounds were identified in the oil, accounting for 99.6% of the oil. The majority of the essential oil was dominated by the relatively rare component cis-3-butyl-4-vinylcyclopentane (26.4%). The oil also contained substantial amounts of limonene (5.1%) and (E)-nerolidol (9.5%). Biological screening for antimicrobial activities did not show appreciable activity against either Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) or Gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. However, marginal activity against Aspergillus niger was observed (minimum inhibitory concentration = 313 mug/mL).
TI  - Comparison of antibacterial activity of Ag nanoparticles synthesized from leaf extract of Parthenium hystrophorus L in aqueous media and Gentamicin sulphate: in-vitro.
AB  - Monodisperse silver (Ag) nanoparticles were synthesized by using Parthenium hystrophorus L leaf extract in aqueous media. The synthesized nanoparticles were characterized by using UV-vis spectrophotometer, X-ray diffracto-meter (XRD), transmission electron microscope (TEM), and dynamics light scattering (DLS). Size-dependent antibacterial activities of Ag nanoparticles were tested against Gram negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Gram positive Staphylococcus aureus. Ag nanoparticles having 20 +/- 2 nm size in diameter show maximum zone of inhibition (23 +/- 2.2 mm) in comparison to 40 nm and 70 nm diameter nanoparticles for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The zone of inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus were 19 +/- 1.8 mm, 15 +/- 1.5 mm and 11 +/- 1 mm for 20 nm, 40 nm, and 70 nm, respectively. In addition, affect of concentration of 20 nm size Ag nanoparticles on Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus species were also reported and results were compared with 10 microg/ml dose of Gentamicin sulphate. The Parthenium hystrophorus L leaf extract capped 20 +/- 2 nm Ag nanoparticles (7.5 microg/ml) shows statistically significant antibacterial activity than Gentamicin sulphate (10 microg/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Nisin-activated hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces: assessment of peptide adsorption and antibacterial activity against some food pathogens.
AB  - An effective antimicrobial packaging or food contact surface should be able to kill or inhibit micro-organisms that cause food-borne illnesses. Setting up such systems, by nisin adsorption on hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, is still a matter of debate. For this purpose, nisin was adsorbed on two types of low-density polyethylene: the hydrophobic native film and the hydrophilic acrylic acid-treated surface. The antibacterial activity was compared for those two films and it was highly dependent on the nature of the surface and the nisin-adsorbed amount. The hydrophilic surfaces presented higher antibacterial activity and higher amount of nisin than the hydrophobic surfaces. The effectiveness of the activated surfaces was assessed against Listeria innocua and the food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus was more sensitive than the three other test bacteria toward both nisin-functionalized films. Simulation tests to mimic refrigerated temperature showed that the films were effective at 20 and 4 degrees C with no significant difference between the two temperatures after 30 min of exposure to culture media.
TI  - In vitro cytotoxic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities of Mesua beccariana (Baill.) Kosterm., Mesua ferrea Linn., and Mesua congestiflora extracts.
AB  - The in vitro cytotoxicity tests on the extracts of Mesua beccariana, M. ferrea, and M. congestiflora against Raji, SNU-1, HeLa, LS-174T, NCI-H23, SK-MEL-28, Hep-G2, IMR-32, and K562 were achieved using MTT assay. The methanol extracts of Mesua beccariana showed its potency towards the proliferation of B-lymphoma cell (Raji). In addition, only the nonpolar to semipolar extracts (hexane to ethyl acetate) of the three Mesua species indicated cytotoxic effects on the tested panel of human cancer cell lines. Antioxidant assays were evaluated using DPPH scavenging radical assay and Folin-Ciocalteu method. The methanol extracts of M. beccariana and M. ferrea showed high antioxidant activities with low EC(5)(0) values of 12.70 and 9.77 mug/mL, respectively, which are comparable to that of ascorbic acid (EC(5)(0) = 5.62 mug/mL). Antibacterial tests were carried out using four Gram positive and four Gram negative bacteria on Mesua beccariana extracts. All the extracts showed negative results in the inhibition of Gram negative bacteria. Nevertheless, methanol extracts showed some activities against Gram positive bacteria which are Bacillus cereus, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), while the hexane extract also contributed some activities towards Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Antimicrobial Property of Extracts of Indian Lichen against Human Pathogenic Bacteria.
AB  - Context. Usnea ghattensis G. Awasthi (Usneaceae) endemic fruticose lichen found growing luxuriantly in Northern Western Ghats of India, it also contains Usnic acid as a major chemical and tested against some human pathogenic bacteria. Objective. To explore antimicrobial properties of Usnea ghattensis against some human pathogenic bacteria. Materials and Methods. The lichen was extracted in acetone, methanol, and ethanol. In vitro antimicrobial activity was tested initially by Kirby-Bauer technique of disc diffusion method and was confirmed by minimum inhibitory concentration using Broth microdilution method according to the NCCLS guidelines. Results. Ethanol extract was most effective against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a zone of inhibition 29.8 +/- 0.6 mm and 12.3 +/- 0.5 mm diameters at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. Acetone and methanol extract demonstrated almost similar activity against Staphylococcus aureus and the zone of inhibition was 24.6 +/- 0.5 and 24.7 +/- 0.4 mm. Only methanol extract was showing activity against Streptococcus faecalis with a 13.5 +/- 0.8 mm zone. MIC value noted against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis was 6.25 mu g/mL and 25 mu g/mL, whereas against Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MIC calculated was 3.125 mu g/mL and 200 mu g/mL, respectively. Conclusion. The present study demonstrates the relatively higher activity of this lichen against not only gram (+) but significantly also against gram (-) bacteria. This indicates that this lichen might be a rich source of effective antimicrobial agents.
TI  - New derivatives of salicylamides: Preparation and antimicrobial activity against  various bacterial species.
AB  - Three series of salicylanilides, esters of N-phenylsalicylamides and 2-hydroxy-N-[1-(2-hydroxyphenylamino)-1-oxoalkan-2-yl]benzamides, in total thirty target compounds were synthesized and characterized. The compounds were evaluated against seven bacterial and three mycobacterial strains. The antimicrobial activities of some compounds were comparable or higher than the standards ampicillin, ciprofloxacin or isoniazid. Derivatives 3f demonstrated high biological activity against Staphylococcus aureus (0.03mumol/L), Mycobacterium marinum (0.40mumol/L) and Mycobacterium kansasii (1.58mumol/L), 3g shows activity against Clostridium perfringens (0.03mumol/L) and Bacillus cereus (0.09mumol/L), 3h against Pasteurella multocida (0.03mumol/L) and M. kansasii (0.43mumol/L), 3i against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and B. cereus (0.03mumol/L). The structure-activity relationships are discussed for all the compounds.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of polyhalobenzonitrile quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives.
AB  - A novel series of polyhalobenzonitrile quinazolin-4(3H)-one derivatives were synthesized and characterized by NMR, IR, MS, and HRMS spectra. All of the newly prepared compounds were screened for antimicrobial activities against four strains of bacteria (Gram-positive bacterial: Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus; Gram-negative bacterial: Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and one strain of fungi (Candida albicans). Among the synthesized compounds, 5-(dimethylamino)-8-(2,4,5-trichloro-isophthalonitrile) quinazolin-4(3H)-one (7k) exhibited significant activity towards Gram-positive bacterial, Gram-negative bacterial, and the fungi strains. The MIC (0.8-3.3mug/mL) and MBC (2.6-7.8mug/mL) for this compound were close to those of nofloxacin, chlorothalonil, and fluconazole, making it the most potent antimicrobial agents in the series.
TI  - Combination of extracts from Aristolochia cymbifera with streptomycin as a potential antibacterial drug.
AB  - The appearance of new antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a societal problem that requires the development of new alternative treatments. Therefore, this work evaluated the antibacterial activity of ethanolic (EHI), dichloromethanic (EDI) and hexanic (EHE) extracts from Aristolochia cymbifera stems and the combination of these extracts with an antimicrobial drug to develop a new antibacterial therapy. The EDI, EHE and EHI extracts were obtained by maceration using three different solvents. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of these extracts were determined using the microdilution test to determine the antibacterial potential of these extracts and their combination with streptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. The extract dose leading to the cytotoxicity of 50% of the cells (CC50) was evaluated using mammalian cells MA104 and the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) colorimetric assay. The extracts had a MIC under 500 mg/L and a CC50 lower than 50 mg/L. The antibiotic/extract proportion influenced the antibacterial activity of the mixtures, and the proportion that optimized the antibacterial activity of streptomycin was a mixture that contained 75 percent of extract. This composition included less than 6.5 mg/L of extract and 2.5 mg/L of streptomycin and has potential as a new antibacterial therapy.
TI  - Structure of the NheA component of the Nhe toxin from Bacillus cereus: implications for function.
AB  - The structure of NheA, a component of the Bacillus cereus Nhe tripartite toxin, has been solved at 2.05 A resolution using selenomethionine multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD). The structure shows it to have a fold that is similar to the Bacillus cereus Hbl-B and E. coli ClyA toxins, and it is therefore a member of the ClyA superfamily of alpha-helical pore forming toxins (alpha-PFTs), although its head domain is significantly enlarged compared with those of ClyA or Hbl-B. The hydrophobic beta-hairpin structure that is a characteristic of these toxins is replaced by an amphipathic beta-hairpin connected to the main structure via a beta-latch that is reminiscent of a similar structure in the beta-PFT Staphylococcus aureus alpha-hemolysin. Taken together these results suggest that, although it is a member of an archetypal alpha-PFT family of toxins, NheA may be capable of forming a beta rather than an alpha pore.
TI  - Chemical composition and biological activity of the essential oil from leaves of  Moringa oleifera Lam. cultivated in Mozambique.
AB  - The antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) grown in Mozambique was investigated. The chemical composition was studied by means of GC and GC-MS analysis. Hexacosane (13.9%), pentacosane (13.3%) and heptacosane (11.4%) were the main components. Ultra High Performance Chromatography-DAD analysis detected the flavonoids quercetin (126 mug/g) and luteolin (6.2 mug/g). The essential oil exhibited a relatively low free radical scavenging capacity. The antimicrobial activity of the essential oil was assayed against two Gram-positive strains (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus), two Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and five fungal strains of agro-food interest (Penicillium aurantiogriseum, Penicillium expansum, Penicillium citrinum, Penicillium digitatum, and Aspergillus niger spp.). B. cereus and P. aeruginosa, as well as the fungal strains were sensitive to the essential oil.
TI  - Durable contact active antimicrobial materials formed by a one-step covalent modification of polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose and glass surfaces.
AB  - In this work we have applied a direct covalent linkage of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) to prepare a series of contact active antimicrobial surfaces based on widely utilized materials. Formation of antimicrobial polyvinyl alcohol (PVA-QAS), cellulose (cellulose-QAS) and glass (glass-QAS) surfaces was achieved by one step synthesis with no auxiliary linkers. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed tridentate binding mode of the antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial activity of the prepared materials was tested on Bacillus cereus, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Active site density of the modified materials was examined and found to correlate with their antimicrobial activity. Stability studies at different pH values and temperatures confirmed that the linkage of the bioactive moiety to the surface is robust and resistant to a range of pH and temperatures. Prolonged long-term effectiveness of the contact active materials was demonstrated by their repeated usage, without loss of the antimicrobial efficacy.
TI  - pGIAK1, a heavy metal resistant plasmid from an obligate alkaliphilic and halotolerant bacterium isolated from the Antarctic Concordia station confined environment.
AB  - pGIAK1 is a 38-kb plasmid originating from the obligate alkaliphilic and halotolerant Bacillaceae strain JMAK1. The strain was originally isolated from the confined environments of the Antarctic Concordia station. Analysis of the pGIAK1 38,362-bp sequence revealed that, in addition to its replication region, this plasmid contains the genetic determinants for cadmium and arsenic resistances, putative methyltransferase, tyrosine recombinase, spore coat protein and potassium transport protein, as well as several hypothetical proteins. Cloning the pGIAK1 cad operon in Bacillus cereus H3081.97 and its ars operon in Bacillus subtilis 1A280 conferred to these hosts cadmium and arsenic resistances, respectively, therefore confirming their bona fide activities. The pGIAK1 replicon region was also shown to be functional in Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, but was only stably maintained in B. subtilis. Finally, using an Escherichia coli - B. thuringiensis shuttle BAC vector, pGIAK1 was shown to display conjugative properties since it was able to transfer the BAC plasmid among B. thuringiensis strains.
TI  - Synthesis and characterization of novel organocobaloximes as potential catecholase and antimicrobial activity agents.
AB  - An asymmetric, potentially bidentate dioxime ligand (H(2)L) was formed by condensation of 4-biphenylchloroglyoxime and napthyl-1-amine. Two equivalents of H(2)L were reacted with CoCl(2) . 6H(2)O under appropriate conditions with deprotonation of the dioxime ligand. A series of new organocobaloxime derivatives of the type [CoR(HL)(2)Py], [CoRL(2)PyB(2)F(4)], and [CoRL(2)Py(Cu(phen))(2)] (H(2)L = 4-(napthyl-1-amino)biphenylglyoxime; phen = 1,10-phenathroline; R = izopropyl and benzyl; Py = pyridine) were synthesized. The products were characterized by elemental analysis, molar conductance, FT-IR, (1)H NMR, and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Catecholase-like activity properties of all complexes were also studied. All complexes are catalysts for the oxidation of 3,5-di-tert-butylcatechol to 3,5-di-tert-butyl-1,2-benzoquinone in methanol. Antimicrobial activity studies of H(2)L and the six complexes were carried out on standard strains (human pathogenic) of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudominas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi) and the yeast Candida albicans. The compounds showed a significant inhibition of the growth of the Gram-positive bacteria tested. Among the tested microorganisms, S. aureus was the most sensitive strain, especially to H(2)L and its complexes.
TI  - Cyclic dipeptides from rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode-associated Bacillus cereus have antimicrobial activities.
AB  - The cell free culture filtrate of Bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, Rhabditis (Oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. The ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. The structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (FABMS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (1)H-(1)H COSY, (1)H-(13)C HMBC) and Marfey's method. The compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (CDPs): cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp), cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val), cyclo(D-Pro-D-Met), and cyclo(D-Pro-D-Phe), respectively. Compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant S. aureus) except cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val). Cyclo(L-Leu-L-Val) recorded activity only against Gram positive bacteria. Best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against S. aureus (4 mug/ml). The four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (Trichophyton rubrum, Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin B, the standard fungicide. The highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) was recorded against T. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. The activity of cyclo(L-Pro-L-Trp) against T. rubrum, C. neoformans and C. albicans were better than amphotericin B, the standard antifungal agent. To our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of CDPs against the human pathogenic fungi T. rubrum and C. neoformans. The four CDPs are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. We conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - The diversity and antimicrobial activity of Preussia sp. endophytes isolated from Australian dry rainforests.
AB  - Limited knowledge currently exists regarding species diversity and antimicrobial  activity of endophytic isolates of Preussia within Australia. This report describes endophytic Preussia species that were identified through molecular analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region. Screening for antimicrobial secondary metabolites was determined by testing crude ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extracts derived from fungal mycelia against a panel of ATCC type strains which included Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and the opportunist yeast pathogen Candida albicans. Subsequently, high-performance liquid chromatography generated fractions of bioactive EtOAc extracts which were subject to confirmatory testing using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference microdilution antimicrobial activity assay. A total of 18 Preussia were isolated from nine host plants with 6/18 having a <97 % sequence similarity to other known species in Genbank, suggesting that they are new species. In preliminary screening, 13/18 Preussia isolates revealed antimicrobial activity against at least one of the microbes tested, whilst 6/18 isolates, including 4/6 putative new species showed specific antimicrobial activity against MRSA and C. albicans. These results highlight the antimicrobial potential of Australian Preussia spp. and also the importance of Australian dry rainforests as an untapped repository of potentially significant bioactive compounds.
TI  - Three different bacterial detection systems for platelet concentrates under inter-laboratory conditions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A variety of screening methods are currently used worldwide in order  to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis and improve the safety of PCs. METHODS/MATERIALS: PCs inoculated with five different transfusion-relevant species of bacteria at concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 colony-forming units (CFU)ml(-1) were stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. Flow cytometry (FACS), BacT/Alert automated culturing, and a quantitative real-time PCR (Q-PCR) were then used to detect the presence of bacteria in samples prepared from these PCs. RESULTS: At the initial spiking concentrations of 1, 10, and 100 CFU ml(-1), Q-PCR detected all five bacterial species tested. Screening with the BacT/Alert culture-based system allowed bacterial detection (inoculated on day 0) within a mean time of 15.13 h for all three spiking concentrations. Using FACS, positive signals were obtained for all three concentrations of Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus on day 1 and for initial spiking concentrations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus of 1 CFU ml(-1) on day 2. For Staphylococcus epidermidis, detection of an initial inoculum of 1 CFU ml(-1) was possible only beginning on day 6. CONCLUSION: This study shows that under standard laboratory conditions the sensitivity of FACS in the detection of bacterial contamination of PCs was lower than that of either the BacT/Alert automated culturing method or Q-PCR.
TI  - Structure-activity relationships of alphas-casein peptides with multifunctional biological activities.
AB  - Multifunctional bioactive peptides have a wider role in modulating physiological  functions and possess multiple biological activities. Peptides from bovine milk with sequences QKALNEINQF [p10] and TKKTKLTEEEKNRL [p14] from alpha-S2 casein f (79-88) and alpha-S2 casein f (148-161) were identified to be having multifunctional biological activities and were synthesized. These synthesized peptides show various biological activities like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition, prolyl endopeptidase inhibition, antioxidant, and antimicrobial activities. The mode of antimicrobial mechanism was studied and p10 shows depolarization of cell membrane, whereas p14 was found to display DNA-binding activity. Structural studies envisaged backbone flexibility, for differences in their mode of action. Peptide structure function studies were correlated to understand their multifunctional biological activity.
TI  - Antioxidative, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of the phenolics of Leea indica leaf extract.
AB  - This study investigated the phytochemical, antioxidative, antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects of Leea indica leaf ethanol extract. Phytochemical values namely total phenolic and flavonoid contents, total antioxidant capacity, DPPH radical scavenging effect, FeCl3 reducing power, DMSO superoxide scavenging effect and Iron chelating effects were studied by established methods. Antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic effects were screened by disk diffusion technique, food poison technique and brine shrimp bioassay, respectively. Results showed the total phenolic content 24.00 +/- 0.81 g GAE/100 g, total flavonoid content 194.68 +/- 2.43 g quercetin/100 g and total antioxidant capacity 106.61 +/- 1.84 g AA/100 g dry extract. Significant (P < 0.05) IC50 values compared to respective standards were recorded in DPPH radical scavenging (139.83 +/- 1.40 mug/ml), FeCl3 reduction (16.48 +/- 0.64 mug/ml), DMSO superoxide scavenging (676.08 +/- 5.80 mug/ml) and Iron chelating (519.33 +/- 16.96 mug/ml) methods. In antibacterial screening, the extract showed significant (P < 0.05) zone of inhibitions compared to positive controls Ampicillin and Tetracycline against Gram positive Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, and Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, and Escherichia coli. Significant minimum inhibitory concentrations compared to tetracycline were obtained against the above organisms. In antifungal assay, the extract inhibited the growth of Aspergillus flavus, Candida albicans and Fusarium equisetii by 38.09 +/- 0.59, 22.58 +/- 2.22, and 22.58 +/- 2.22%, respectively. The extract showed a significant LC50 value compared to vincristine sulfate in cytotoxic assay. The results evidenced the potential antioxidative, antimicrobial and cytotoxic capacities of Leea inidica leaf extract to be processed for pharmaceutical use.
TI  - Isolation and screening of bioactive principle from Chaetomorpha antennina against certain bacterial strains.
AB  - Microbial pathogens develop resistance to a particular antibiotic after repeated  administration during the treatment of infectious diseases. Moreover, multiple drug resistance is a very common problem especially in hospital acquired infections. Therefore, it is necessary to find out alternative antibacterial drugs and the present trend is focused on seaweeds. This preliminary research work was carried out to find out the antibacterial activity of petroleum ether extract of Chaetomorpha antennina. The extracts were tested against Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 121, Bacillus cereus MTCC 492, Bacillus subtilis MTCC 441, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 530, Escherichia coli MTCC 443 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 779 by agar well diffusion technique. It was observed that petroleum ether extract showed prominent zone of inhibition against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus even at 50 mug/ml concentration. The maximum spectrum of activity was observed against Staphylococcus aureus ranged from 7.3 +/- 0.8 to 18 +/- 2.4 mm at the concentration 50 to 500 mug/ml, respectively. Hence the most susceptible bacterium was Staphylococcus aureus among the tested organisms. However, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are also susceptible. But the Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae are resistant against the tested extract.
TI  - A product of heme catabolism modulates bacterial function and survival.
AB  - Bilirubin is the terminal metabolite in heme catabolism in mammals. After deposition into bile, bilirubin is released in large quantities into the mammalian gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We hypothesized that intestinal bilirubin may modulate the function of enteric bacteria. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of bilirubin on two enteric pathogens; enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), a Gram-negative that causes life-threatening intestinal infections, and E. faecalis, a Gram-positive human commensal bacterium known to be an opportunistic pathogen with broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. We demonstrate that bilirubin can protect EHEC from exogenous and host-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the absorption of free radicals. In contrast, E. faecalis was highly susceptible to bilirubin, which causes significant membrane disruption and uncoupling of respiratory metabolism in this bacterium. Interestingly, similar results were observed for other Gram-positive bacteria, including B. cereus and S. aureus. A model is proposed whereby bilirubin places distinct selective pressure on enteric bacteria, with Gram-negative bacteria being protected from ROS (positive outcome) and Gram-positive bacteria being susceptible to membrane disruption (negative outcome). This work suggests bilirubin has differential but biologically relevant effects on bacteria and justifies additional efforts to determine the role of this neglected waste catabolite in disease processes, including animal models.
TI  - Summertime Bacillus cereus colonization of hospital newborns traced to contaminated, laundered linen.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine screening of premature newborns for haemolytic streptococci,  Staphylococcus aureus and enteric Gram-negative bacteria done at birth using umbilical swabs identified clustering of babies colonized with Bacillus cereus in summers of 2009 and 2010 at a 400-bedded UK general hospital. AIM: To determine the source of this organism by focusing on the clinical environment. METHODS: Umbilical swab screening was extended to all newborns and the labour ward environment, including construction-related dust, was sampled for B. cereus. FINDINGS: During the summer of 2009, 65% of newborns had umbilical swabs which were culture positive for B. cereus. Blood agar and B. cereus selective agar impression plates of unused labour ward linen, and freshly received linen from the hospital's external laundry, gave mainly confluent growth of B. cereus in >85% of items sampled. In-use and exposed healthcare products including liquid handwashing agents, paper hand-towels, vaginal lubricants, labour ward dust and air were culture negative. Linen contamination and umbilical swab culture positivity both approached zero in autumn. B. cereus colonization of newborn umbilici recurred in summer 2010 and unused laundered linen was again found to be as contaminated. Washing linen at the laundry in a washer-extractor, with higher dilution than the continuous tunnel washer normally used, coincided with lowering of detectable B. cereus numbers in unused washed linen and no clustering in newborns the following summer (2011). CONCLUSION: Freshly laundered linen can be contaminated with B. cereus with subsequent spread and colonization of newborns. This contamination appears to be associated with low-dilution washing and high ambient temperatures.
TI  - Enhanced antimicrobial activity of peptide-cocktails against common bacterial contaminants of ex vivo stored platelets.
AB  - Bacterial contamination of blood components such as ex vivo-stored platelets is a major safety risk in transfusion medicine. We have recently shown that synthetic antimicrobial peptides named PD1-PD4 derived from the thrombin-induced human platelet-derived antimicrobial proteins, and repeats of Arg-Trp (RW1-RW5) demonstrate microbicidal activity against selected bacteria and viruses. In the present study, we selected PD3, PD4, RW2, RW3 and RW4 and evaluated each individual peptide and their various combinations to see whether the cocktail regimen enhances the antimicrobial activity above and over the individual peptides. Stored platelet or plasma samples spiked with known titres of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus were treated with either individual peptides or with peptides in various combinations. Analyses revealed that individual peptides show moderate microbicidal activity (10- to 100-fold reduction) against the tested bacteria relative to their combined regimen. The peptide combinations (RW2 + RW4, RW2 + RW3 + RW4 and PD4 + RW3 + RW4) on the other hand enhanced the microbicidal activity (c.10 000-fold reduction) and revealed a minimal inhibitory concentration of 5 muM. Time-kill kinetics indicated that these three peptide combinations exhibited enhanced antimicrobial activity bringing about a 100-fold reduction of bacterial titres within 20 min of incubation. The present study therefore demonstrates the synergistic effect of antimicrobial peptides when used in combinations and provides a proof-of-concept of its potential application as a molecular tool towards pathogen reduction and further extends the possibility of using peptide combinatorial therapeutics as broad-spectrum antibiotics or as alternatives to combat drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - A concise synthesis and antimicrobial activity of a novel series of naphthylpyridine-3-carbonitrile compounds.
AB  - A novel series of acyclic nucleosides 2-5 and 13a-c were synthesized by utilizing 4-phenyl-6(naphthalen-2-yl)-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropridine-3-carbonitrile (1) as a key starting material. Chlorination of 1 yielded the chloro analogue 6 that was allowed to react with urea, thiourea, thiosemicarbazide and alicyclic secondary amines to produce the corresponding derivatives 7a-c and 11a-c. Further condensation of 6 with various amino acids provided the compounds 8-10, whereas hydrazinolysis of 6 yielded the hydrazinyl analogue 12 which was condensed with different isothiocyanates and acid anhydrides to afford derivatives 18-20, respectively. Upon treatment of 12 with sodium nitrite, the azide derivative 14 was obtained which was subjected to reaction with various active methylene compounds to obtain the corresponding triazolo derivatives 15-17. The structure assignment of the new compounds is based on chemicaland spectroscopic evidence. Antimicrobial evaluation of the newly synthesized derivatives was performed using ciprofloxacin and fluconazole as reference antibacterial and antifungal drugs. The most effective compounds against the tested bacterial and fungal isolates were the benzothiohydrazide compound 18b followed by the hydrazone and the phthalic anhydride derivatives 13c and 20, respectively.
TI  - Screening of biological activities of Polygonum maritimum L. from Algerian coast.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antioxidant and the antibacterial activities of crude extract from aerial part of Polygonum maritimum L. (Polygonaceae) (P. maritimum) and to find new actives biomolecules. METHODS: The whole plant was collected from the Rechgoune coast (West of Algeria), and methanolic crude extract of aerial parts of P. maritimum (PMCE) was prepared. The extract was tested against different bacterial strain and tested for his ability to neutralize free radical (DPPH) and to scavenge the H2O2. RESULTS: PMCE had a very high content of total phenol, which was (352.49+/-18.03) mg/g dry weight, expressed as gallic acid equivalent. PMCE exhibited excellent antioxidant activity, as measured using DPPH and H2O2 scavenging assays. It also showed a high antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacterial strains: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus with an highest MIC of 120 microg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The antioxidant and antibacterial activity of the PMCE is probably due to phenolic compounds present in the extract. The contemporary presence of antioxidant and antibacterial activities in the PMCE suggests that this plant may be a source of bioactive substances with multifaceted activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity and Phytochemical Constituents of Leaf Extracts of Cassia  auriculata.
AB  - Plants produce a wide variety of phytochemical constituents, which are secondary  metabolites and are used either directly or indirectly in the pharmaceutical industry. 'For centuries, man has effectively used various components of plants or their extracts for the treatment of many diseases, including bacterial infections. In the present study methanol, chloroform and aqueous extracts of Cassia auriculata leaf were subjected for antimicrobial activity by well-diffusion method against six bacterial strains namely Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. The results revealed that the methanol and chloroform extracts exhibited strong inhibitory activity against all the tested organisms (zone of inhibition of 12-20 mm), except Pseudomonas aeruginosa (zone of inhibition 10 mm or nil). The aqueous extracts showed moderate activity by 'Zone of inhibition </=12 or nil). The extracts were screened for their phytochemical constituents by standard protocols' and were shown to contain carbohydrates, proteins, alkaloids, flavonoids, steroids, saponins and tannins. The antibacterial activity of these extracts is possibly linked to the presence of flavonoids, steroid, saponins and/or tannins. Further studies are needed to determine the precise active principles from Cassia auriculata.
TI  - Bioactive metabolites from an endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. inhabiting Clidemia hirta.
AB  - An endophytic Cryptosporiopsis sp. was isolated from Clidemia hirta and analyzed  for its secondary metabolites that lead to the isolation of three bioactive molecules. The compounds were purified from the culture broth of the fungus and their structures were determined by spectroscopic methods as (R)-5-hydroxy-2-methylchroman-4-one (1), 1-(2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)pentan-1-one (2) and (Z)-1-(2-(2-butyryl-3-hydroxyphenoxy)-6-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydroxybut-2-en-1-one (3). Compound 1 exhibited significant cytotoxic activity against the human leukemia cell line, HL-60 with an IC50 of 4 mug/ml. This compound induced G2 arrest of the HL-60 cell cycle significantly. In addition, out of these compounds, 2 and 3 were active against several bacterial pathogens. Compound 2 was active against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with IC50 values varying from 18 to 30 mug/ml, and compound 3 displayed activity against Pseudomonas fluorescens with an IC50 value of 6 mug/ml. Compounds 2 and 3 are novel whereas compound 1 was reported earlier but the stereochemistry of its C-2 methyl is established for the first time.
TI  - Effects of lipid emulsion and multivitamins on the growth of microorganisms in peripheral parenteral nutrition solutions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood stream infections caused by Bacillus cereus or Serratia marcescens in patients receiving peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN) have occasionally been reported in Japan, but these microorganisms are not major causes of blood stream infections in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition via a central venous catheter. In Japan, commercially available PPN solutions contain amino acids, glucose, and electrolytes, but not contain lipid emulsion (LE) and multivitamins (MV). In this study, the effects of LE and MV on the growth of microorganisms such as Bacillus cereus, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans in PPN solutions were investigated. METHODS: A commercial 3% amino acid and 7.5% glucose solution with electrolytes (AF) was used as the base solution to prepare test solutions (LAF, AFV, and LAFV) containing LE, MV, or both. Specifically, 20% LE was added to AF in a ratio of 1:9 to prepare LAF. MV was added to AF and LAF to prepare AFV and LAFV, respectively. A specified number of each microorganism was added to each 100 mL of AF, LAF, AFV, and LAFV in sterile plastic flasks, and all flasks were allowed to stand at room temperature. The number of colony forming units per mL of each microorganism was counted at 0, 24, and 48 hours after the addition of each microorganism. RESULTS: Both Bacillus cereus and Serratia marcescens increased rapidly in AF as well as in LAF, AFV, and LAFV. Staphylococcus aureus did not increased in AF, but increased slightly in LAF and increased rapidly in AFV and LAFV. Candida albicans increased slightly in AF and increased rapidly in LAF, AFV, and LAFV. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest the followings: if microbial contamination occurs, 1) Bacillus cereus and Serratia marcescens can grow rapidly in PPN solutions consisting of amino acids, glucose and electrolytes; 2) Staphylococcus aureus cannot grow without LE and MV, but can grow rapidly with MV; 3) Candida albicans can grow slowly without LE and MV, and the addition of LE or MV accelerates its growth.

TI  - Characterization and application of enterocin RM6, a bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Use of bacteriocins in food preservation has received great attention in recent years. The goal of this study is to characterize enterocin RM6 from Enterococcus faecalis OSY-RM6 and investigate its efficacy against Listeria monocytogenes in cottage cheese. Enterocin RM6 was purified from E. faecalis culture supernatant using ion exchange column, multiple C18-silica cartridges, followed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of enterocin RM6 is 7145.0823 as determined by mass spectrometry (MS). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis revealed that enterocin RM6 is a 70-residue cyclic peptide with a head-to-tail linkage between methionine and tryptophan residues. The peptide sequence of enterocin RM6 was further confirmed by sequencing the structural gene of the peptide. Enterocin RM6 is active against Gram-positive bacteria, including L. monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Enterocin RM6 (final concentration in cottage cheese, 80 AU/mL) caused a 4-log reduction in population of L. monocytogenes inoculated in cottage cheese within 30 min of treatment. Therefore, enterocin RM6 has potential applications as a potent antimicrobial peptide against foodborne pathogens in food.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of actinomycetes isolated from different soil samples of Sheopur (A city of central India).
AB  - The main objective of the present study was isolation, purification, and characterization of actinomycetes from soil samples, having antimicrobial activity against 12 selected pathogenic strains. Soils samples were taken from different niche habitats of Sheopur district, Madhya Pradesh, India. These samples were serially diluted and plated on actinomycete isolation agar media. Potential colonies were screened, purified, and stored in glycerol stock. Isolates were morphologically and biochemically characterized. These isolates were subjected to extraction for production of the antibacterial compound. Antibacterial activity and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the purified extract of isolates were evaluated. Totally 31 actinomycete isolates were tested for antagonistic activity against 12 pathogenic microorganisms. Isolates AS14, AS27, and AS28 were highly active, while AS1 showed less activity against the pathogenic microorganisms. Isolate AS7 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus (24 mm) and AS16 showed the highest activity against Enterococcus faecalis (21 mm). MIC was also determined for actinomycete isolates against all the tested microorganisms. MIC of actinomycete isolates was found to be 2.5 mg/ml against Shigella dysenteriae, Vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and was 1.25 mg/ml for Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus xylosus, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. All actinomycetes isolates showed antibacterial activity against S. aureus, while they showed less activity against S. dysenteriae. These isolates had antibacterial activity and could be used in the development of new antibiotics for pharmaceutical or agricultural purposes.
TI  - Bioinert membranes prepared from amphiphilic poly(vinyl chloride)-g-poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) graft copolymers.
AB  - Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) membrane was hydrophilically modified by grafting with poly(oxyethylene methacrylate) (POEM) using atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). The successful grafting of PVC main chain by POEM was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The molecular weight and hydrophilicity of membranes increased with the amount of POEM grafting, as characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and contact angle measurement, respectively. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis revealed the microphase-separated structure of PVC-g-POEM and the domain spacing increased from 59.3 to 86.1 nm with increasing grafting degree. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used for the direct visualization of the mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell and bacteria adhesion on the membrane surface. Protein adsorption and eukaryotic and prokaryotic cell adhesion tests showed that the bioinert properties of membranes were significantly increased with POEM content.
TI  - Evolutionary dynamics of the accessory genome of Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Listeria monocytogenes, a foodborne bacterial pathogen, is comprised of four phylogenetic lineages that vary with regard to their serotypes and distribution among sources. In order to characterize lineage-specific genomic diversity within L. monocytogenes, we sequenced the genomes of eight strains from several lineages and serotypes, and characterized the accessory genome, which was hypothesized to contribute to phenotypic differences across lineages. The eight L. monocytogenes genomes sequenced range in size from 2.85-3.14 Mb, encode 2,822-3,187 genes, and include the first publicly available sequenced representatives of serotypes 1/2c, 3a and 4c. Mapping of the distribution of accessory genes revealed two distinct regions of the L. monocytogenes chromosome: an accessory-rich region in the first 65 degrees adjacent to the origin of replication and a more stable region in the remaining 295 degrees . This pattern of genome organization is distinct from that of related bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. The accessory genome of all lineages is enriched for cell surface-related genes and phosphotransferase systems, and transcriptional regulators, highlighting the selective pressures faced by contemporary strains from their hosts, other microbes, and their environment. Phylogenetic analysis of O-antigen genes and gene clusters predicts that serotype 4 was ancestral in L. monocytogenes and serotype 1/2 associated gene clusters were putatively introduced through horizontal gene transfer in the ancestral population of L. monocytogenes lineage I and II.
TI  - [Isolation and purification of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) from transgenic rice and its antibacterial activities].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the isolation and purification of recombinant human lactoferrin (rhLF) from transgenic rice, and to check its antibacterial activities. METHODS: After isolated rhLF from transgenic rice via saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation, then purified it through CM Sepharose FF-exchange chromatography and molecular sieve chromatography Sephadex G25. The inhibition effects under different concentrations of rhLF (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 5.0 mg/ml) against Salmonella typhimurium, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes were observed, using broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The rhLF was obtained at a higher purity (about 90%) through successful isolation and purification. After Coomassie blue staining, Westernblot and mass spectrometer analysis, it was identified as the purpose protein with the molecular weight of approximately 79 kDa. The antibacterial experiments showed that 5 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml rhLF could inhibite Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus persistently, 2 mg/ml and 1 mg/ml rhLF showed a significant inhibitory effects in the later period; while 0.5 mg/ml or lower concentration, showed no inhibitory effects. As to Bacillus cereus, only 5 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml rhLF exhibited certain inhibitory effects within 18 hours. Listeria monocytogenes was inhibited within 18 hours just at 5 mg/ml rhLF. CONCLUSION: The rhLF could be successfully separated and purified from transgenic rice, and the purified protein still has significant antibacterial activities.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of some novel thiazole compounds as potential anti-inflammatory agents.
AB  - In the present investigation, furo[2,3-d]thiazol-5(2H)-one 5 was obtained from reaction of thiosemicarbazone derivative 2 with diethyl acetylene dicarboxylate. A series of newly synthesized 2-(hydrazinyl)thiazol-4(5H)-one 6, 7 &8 and 2-(4-(substituted)-thiazol-2-yl)hydrazono derivatives 9a, b &10 were synthesized from treatment of thiosemicarbazone derivative 2 with appropriate alpha-halogenated compounds. Also, a one pot synthesis of thiazole derivatives 13 &15 was achieved from three components reaction of hydrazone derivative 11 with phenyl isothiocyanate and alpha-halogenated compounds catalyzed by DMF/KOH. 4-(4-Morpholino phenyl) thiazol-2-amino 17 was obtained via the reaction of acetophenone derivative 1 with thiourea in presence of iodine. The reactivity of 2-aminothiazole 17 toward some electrophilic reagents was investigated. The structure of the newly compounds was confirmed on the basis of elemental analysis and spectral data. The antibacterial activity towards two Gram negative (Proteus mirabilis &Serratia marcesens) and two Gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus &Bacillus cereus) bacteria was investigated. The anti-inflammatory activity was also investigated and the inhibition of the carrageenin-induced oedema by these compounds was established.
TI  - Spectroscopic and solvatochromism studies along with antioxidant and antibacterial activities investigation of 2-((2-mercaptophenylimino)methyl)-4-(phenyldiazenyl)phenol.
AB  - The condensation reaction of 2-hydroxy-5-(aryldiazenyl)benzaldehyde (1a-d) with 2-aminothiophenole affored Schiff base compounds 2-((2-mercaptophenylimino)methyl-4-(-aryldiazenyl)phenol (2a-d). The structures of compounds (2a-d) were characterized by elemental analysis, mass, infrared, UV-vis and NMR spectroscopy. The 2a-d shows enol-keto tautomeric and positive solvatochromism. The antibacterial activities of 2a-d were also evaluated by disc diffusion method. Compound 2b displayed activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, 2a and 2c were active against B. cereus but 2d did not exhibit activity against the tested organisms. Among the tested compounds, 2b showed the best antioxidant properties as evaluated by free radical scavenging activity on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl and ferric reducing power determination.
TI  - Microbial toxicity of ethanolamines--multiwalled carbon nanotubes.
AB  - In the present study, antimicrobial activities of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) functionalized with ethanolamine (EA) groups were investigated. Therefore, MWCNT were first functionalized with mono-, di-, and triethanolamine (MEA, DEA, and TEA) under microwave technique. Development of functional groups on the MWCNT surface was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis. Morphological variation was investigated by transmission electron microscopy. Then, antimicrobial activities of pristine and functionalized MWCNT (MWCNT-MEA, -DEA, and -TEA) were tested against different bacteria species. The studies have been done on four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) as well as four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Streptococcus pneumonia). The results based on minimal inhibitory concentration and radial diffusion assay were shown that the antimicrobial activity of MWCNT-TEA > MWCNT-DEA > MWCNT-MEA > pristine MWCNT. Based on the results, it seems that EA groups could play an important role in antimicrobial activity of MWCNT.
TI  - Skin-associated Bacillus, staphylococcal and micrococcal species from the house dust mite, Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus and bacteriolytic enzymes.
AB  - Dust mites produce bacteriolytic enzymes, one of which belongs to the NlpC/P60 superfamily comprising bacterial and fungal proteins. Whether this enzyme is derived from the mite or from mite-associated microbes is unclear. To this end, the bacteriology of mites per se, and carpet and mattress dust from a group of asthmatic children and their parents was investigated. Dust from parents' and children's mattresses yielded significantly more colony forming units compared with dust from their corresponding carpets. Zymography demonstrated some dusts contained bacteriolytic enzymes, and in nine of the twelve dust samples from three of five houses examined, a prominent bacteriolytic band was obtained that corresponded to the mite band, although in one home, other lytic bands were detected. Fifty bacterial isolates were obtained from surface-sterilised, commercially obtained Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus. 16S rRNA, tuf and rpoB gene sequencing of nine Gram-positive isolates identified them as Bacillus cereus, B. licheniformis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. capitis and Micrococcus luteus, known human skin commensals. 16S rRNA sequence homologies of four of the nine isolates identified as B. licheniformis formed a distinct phylogenetic cluster. All species secreted lytic enzymes during culture although the lytic profiles obtained differed between the rods and the cocci, and none of the bands detected corresponded to those observed in dust or mites. In conclusion, mites harbour a variety of bacterial species often associated with human skin and house dusts contain bacteriolytic enzymes that may be mite-derived. The identification of a novel cluster of B. licheniformis isolates suggests an ecological adaptation to laboratory-reared D. pteronyssinus. It remains to be determined whether the previously described mite-associated 14 K lytic enzyme is derived from a microbial source.
TI  - Nucleation of platelets with blood-borne pathogens on Kupffer cells precedes other innate immunity and contributes to bacterial clearance.
AB  - Through the use of intravital imaging of the liver, we demonstrate a collaborative role for platelets with Kupffer cells (KCs) in eradicating blood-borne bacterial infection. Under basal conditions, platelets, via the platelet-adhesion receptor GPIb, formed transient 'touch-and-go' interactions with von Willebrand factor (vWF) constitutively expressed on KCs. Bacteria such as Bacillus cereus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were rapidly caught by KCs and triggered platelets to switch from 'touch-and-go' adhesion to sustained GPIIb-mediated adhesion on the KC surface to encase the bacterium. Infected GPIbalpha-deficient mice had more endothelial and KC damage than did their wild-type counterparts, which led to more fluid leakage, substantial polycythemia and rapid mortality. Our study identifies a previously unknown surveillance mechanism by which platelets survey macrophages that rapidly converts to a critical host response to blood-borne bacteria.
TI  - Microbiological quality of chicken- and pork-based street-vended foods from Taichung, Taiwan, and Laguna, Philippines.
AB  - The microbiological quality of chicken- and pork-based street-food samples from Taichung, Taiwan's night markets (50) and Laguna, Philippines' public places (69) was evaluated in comparison to a microbiological guideline for ready-to-eat foods. Different bacterial contamination patterns were observed between 'hot-grilled' and 'cold cooked/fried' food types from the two sampling locations with 'hot grilled' foods generally showing better microbiological quality. Several samples were found to be unsatisfactory due to high levels of aerobic plate count, coliform, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. The highest counts obtained were 8.2 log cfu g(-)(1), 5.4 log cfu g(-)(1), 4.4 log cfu g(-)(1), and 3.9 log cfu g(-)(1), respectively, suggesting poor food hygiene practices and poor sanitation. Salmonella was found in 8% and 7% of Taichung and Laguna samples, respectively, which made the samples potentially hazardous. None of the samples was found to be positive for Listeria monocytogenes and E. coli O157, but Bacillus cereus was detected at the unsatisfactory level of 4 log cfu g(-)(1) in one Laguna sample. Antimicrobial resistance was observed for Salmonella, E. coli, and S. aureus isolates. Food preparation, cooking, and food handling practices were considered to be contributors to the unacceptable microbiological quality of the street foods. Hence, providing training on food hygiene for the street vendors should result in the improvement of the microbiological quality of street foods. The data obtained in this study can be used as input to microbial risk assessments and in identifying science-based interventions to control the hazards.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of selected Malaysian honey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibacterial activity of honey is mainly dependent on a combination  of its peroxide activity and non-peroxide components. This study aims to investigate antibacterial activity of five varieties of Malaysian honey (three monofloral; acacia, gelam and pineapple, and two polyfloral; kelulut and tualang) against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. METHODS: Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) and Minimum Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) were performed for semi-quantitative evaluation. Agar well diffusion assay was used to investigate peroxide and non-peroxide activities of honey. RESULTS: The results showed that gelam honey possessed lowest MIC value against S. aureus with 5% (w/v) MIC and MBC of 6.25% (w/v). Highest MIC values were shown by pineapple honey against E. coli and P. aeruginosa as well as acacia honey against E. coli with 25% (w/v) MIC and 50% (w/v) MBC values. Agar inhibition assay showed kelulut honey to possess highest total antibacterial activity against S. aureus with 26.49 equivalent phenol concentrations (EPC) and non-peroxide activity of 25.74 EPC. Lowest antibacterial activity was observed in acacia honey against E. coli with total activity of 7.85 EPC and non-peroxide activity of 7.59 EPC. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between the total antibacterial activities and non-peroxide activities of Malaysian honey. The intraspecific correlation between MIC and EPC of E. coli (r = -0.8559) was high while that between MIC and EPC of P. aeruginosa was observed to be moderate (r = -0.6469). S. aureus recorded a smaller correlation towards the opposite direction (r = 0.5045). In contrast, B.cereus showed a very low intraspecific correlation between MIC and EPC (r = -0.1482). CONCLUSIONS: Malaysian honey, namely gelam, kelulut and tualang, have high antibacterial potency derived from total and non-peroxide activities, which implies that both peroxide and other constituents are mutually important as contributing factors to the antibacterial property of honey.
TI  - Bioactive phenylalanine derivatives and cytochalasins from the soft coral-derived fungus, Aspergillus elegans.
AB  - One new phenylalanine derivative 4'-OMe-asperphenamate (1), along with one known  phenylalanine derivative (2) and two new cytochalasins, aspochalasin A1 (3) and cytochalasin Z24 (4), as well as eight known cytochalasin analogues (5-12) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Aspergillus elegans ZJ-2008010, a fungus obtained from a soft coral Sarcophyton sp. collected from the South China Sea. Their structures and the relative configurations were elucidated using comprehensive spectroscopic methods. The absolute configuration of 1 was determined by chemical synthesis and Marfey's method. All isolated metabolites (1-12) were evaluated for their antifouling and antibacterial activities. Cytochalasins 5, 6, 8 and 9 showed strong antifouling activity against the larval settlement of the barnacle Balanus amphitrite, with the EC50 values ranging from 6.2 to 37 muM. This is the first report of antifouling activity for this class of metabolites. Additionally, 8 exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, especially against four pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus albus, S. aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of novel nanocomposite films of chitosan/phosphoramide/Fe3O4 NPs.
AB  - New nanocomposite films of chitosan/phosphoramide/1-5% Fe3O4 NPs were prepared. The Fe3O4 NPs were synthesized as core-shell NPs with starch as a capping agent. The phosphoramide compound was synthesized from the reaction of morpholine with N-4-nitrophenyl phosphoramidic dichloride. The XRD and SEM analysis of Fe3O4 NPs, chitosan (CS), phosphoramide (Ph), CS/Ph and CS/Fe3O4 NPs films as well as the nanocomposite films 1-5 containing CS/Ph/1-5% Fe3O4 NPs were investigated and the results confirmed the formation of the desired films. The in vitro antibacterial activities were evaluated against four bacteria including two Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) and two Gram-negative Escherchia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) bacteria. Results indicated greater antibacterial effects for the films against Gram-positive bacteria. In addition, nanocomposite films containing higher percent of Fe3O4 NPs displayed more antibacterial activities.
TI  - Plant-based hydrocarbon esters from Tragia involucrata possess antimicrobial and  anti-inflammatory activities.
AB  - Antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities of hydrocarbon esters obtained from Tragia involucrata were evaluated by disk-diffusion (250 microg/ml), and broth-dilution (500-7.8 microg/ml), methods against bacteria. Among the compounds, shellsol showed the most potent activity against Burkholderia pseudomallei (KHW), Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Interestingly, vinyl hexylether was active against food-spoilage bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris), 2, 4-methyl hexane also exerted antimicrobial activity against K. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, B. pseudomallei, Alcaligens viscolactis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane showed only weak activity. For example, shellsol showed bacteriostatic effect (MIC of 7.8 microg/ml) against A. hydrophila, vinyl hexylether (MIC of 15.6 microg/ml) against P. mirabilis, and 2, 4-methyl hexane (MIC of 31.25 microg/ml) on B. pseudomallei. Cytotoxic effects of compounds were assayed in human skin and monkey kidney cells (62.5-2000 microg/ml) by an XTT assay. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol did not show any toxicity up to 1000 microg/ml concentrations. The 2-methylnonane and 2, 6-dimethyl heptane induced morphological changes (e.g. cell disintegration and lysis) of both cell types at a 2000 microg/ml. The vinyl hexylether, 2, 4-dimethyl hexane and shellsol were devoid of toxic effects; however, 2-methylnonane induced weight loss and severe necrosis as evidenced by histopathological and serum biochemical analysis in rats. Interestingly, shellsol showed the maximum inhibition of carrageenan-induced, paw oedema in rats. In conclusion, findings of this study clearly indicate that biologically active hydrocarbon esters, such as shellsol, vinyl hexylether, and 2, 4-dimethyl hexane isolated from T. involucrata, may effectively control the growth of certain food-borne and food-spoilage pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial effectiveness of chitosan-propolis coated polypropylene films against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Antibacterial properties of chitosan are well documented in the literature. However its antibacterial effectiveness in the film form is controversial due to the methodological differences in test methods used. In this study, antibacterial effectiveness of chitosan-coated polypropylene films alone and incorporating ethanolic extract of propolis (EEP) were evaluated against six foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus) using the ISO 22196 method designed for the antibacterial treated plastic products. The results demonstrated that chitosan coated film exhibited the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity. Incorporation of EPP to coating at 10% (propolis resin/chitosan) enhanced antibacterial activity against all pathogens tested. Results of this study revealed that chitosan has antibacterial activity in the film form and that propolis is a promising antimicrobial for the food packaging applications.
TI  - Biological activity, design, synthesis and structure activity relationship of some novel derivatives of curcumin containing sulfonamides.
AB  - Five series of curcumin derivatives with sulfonamides 3a-3e, 4a-4e, 5a-5e, 6a-6e  and 7a-7e have been synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial activity against selected medically important gram-(+) and gram-(-) bacterial species viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli, and antifungal activity against few pathogenic fungal species viz. Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Trichoderma viride and Curvularia lunata. The cytotoxicity has been determined by measuring IC50 values against human cell lines HeLa, Hep G-2, QG-56 and HCT-116. Among the compounds screened, 3a-3e showed the most potent biological activity against tested bacteria and fungi. Compounds 3a-3e displayed higher cytotoxicity than curcumin. The curcumin derivatives were also evaluated for in vivo anti-inflammatory activity. In contrast, the compounds 6a-6e and 7a-7e showed dramatically decrease in biological activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius (Anacardiaceae).
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Schinus lentiscifolius Marchand (syn. Schinus weinmannifolius Engl) is a plant native to Rio Grande do Sul (Southern Brazil) and has been used in Brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. Although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two Gram positive bacteria, namely, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus spp, and six Gram negative bacteria, namely, Burkholderia cepacia, Providencia stuartii, Morganella morganii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Proteus mirabilis. RESULTS: The leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of Schinus lentiscifolius showed a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (MIC) against the tested bacteria and fungi. The n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against Candida albicans (MIC=25 mug/ml), Candida tropicalis (MIC=15.5 mug/ml), and Cryptococcus neoformans, (MIC=15.5 mug/ml). From the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of Schinus lentiscifolius. CONCLUSION: The antimicrobial activity and some constituents of Schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. The results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of Schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.
TI  - Potential applications for Annona squamosa leaf extract in the treatment and prevention of foodborne bacterial disease.
AB  - Foodborne disease is a major public health problem. The present study examined Annona squamosa leaves, which are traditionally used to treat diarrhea and other infections, for their potential to be used in modern food safety or medicine. Active constituents were partially purified by ethanol extraction and column chromatography. MICs of the extract were 62.5 to 125 microg/mL against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus, and 250 microg/mL against Campylobacter jejuni. In time-kill assays, 500 microg/mL of the extract reduced colony forming unit numbers of C. jejuni almost 10 000-fold within 12 hours. Similar decreases were seen against B. cereus, but over a longer time-frame. LC-MS analysis indicated the presence of reticuline and oxophoebine. Assessment of stability by MIC assay showed activity was heat-labile, with loss of activity greatest following high temperature treatments. Activity was relatively stable at refrigeration temperature. These results indicate A. squamosa has broad-spectrum but heat-labile activity against foodborne bacterial pathogens, and bactericidal activity against B. cereus and C. jejuni. This bactericidal activity is not sufficiently rapid for A. squamosa to be used as a food sanitizer, but the extract could potentially be developed as an additive for refrigerated foods, or a modern treatment for foodborne illness.
TI  - Effects of nisin-incorporated films on the microbiological and physicochemical quality of minimally processed mangoes.
AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the effects of nisin-incorporated cellulose films on the physicochemical and microbiological qualities of minimally processed mangoes. The use of antimicrobial films did not affect the physicochemical characteristics of mangoes and showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris and Bacillus cereus. The mango slices were inoculated with S. aureus and L. monocytogenes (10(7)CFU/g), and the viable cell numbers remained at 10(5) and 10(6)CFU/g, respectively, after 12days. In samples packed with antimicrobial films, the viable number of L. monocytogenes cells was reduced below the detection level after 4days. After 6days, a reduction of six log units was observed for S. aureus. In conclusion, nisin showed antimicrobial activity in mangoes without interfering with the organoleptic characteristics of the fruit. This result suggests that nisin could potentially be used in active packing to improve the safety of minimally processed mangoes.
TI  - Synergized antimicrobial activity of eugenol incorporated polyhydroxybutyrate films against food spoilage microorganisms in conjunction with pediocin.
AB  - Biopolymers and biopreservatives produced by microorganisms play an essential role in food technology. Polyhydroxyalkanoates and bacteriocins produced by bacteria are promising components to safeguard the environment and for food preservation applications. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-based antimicrobial films were prepared incorporating eugenol, from 10 to 200 mug/g of PHB. The films were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, spoilage bacteria, and fungi such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. The synergistic antimicrobial activity of the films in the presence of crude pediocin was also investigated. The broth system containing pediocin (soluble form) as well as antimicrobial PHB film demonstrated an extended lag phase and a significant growth reduction at the end of 24 h against the bacteria. Crude pediocin alone could not elicit antifungal activity, while inhibition of growth and sporulation were observed in the presence of antimicrobial PHB film containing eugenol (80 mug/g) until 7 days in the case of molds, i.e., A. niger, A. flavus, Penicillium sp., and Rhizopus sp. in potato dextrose broth. In the present study, we identified that use of pediocin containing broth in conjunction with eugenol incorporated PHB film could function in synergized form, providing effective hurdle toward food contaminating microorganisms. Furthermore, tensile strength, percent crystallinity, melting point, percent elongation to break, glass transition temperature, and seal strength of the PHB film with and without eugenol incorporation were investigated. The migration of eugenol on exposure to different liquid food simulants was also analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The study is expected to provide applications for pediocin in conjunction with eugenol containing PHB film to enhance the shelf life of foods in the food industry.
TI  - Study of the Interference between Plectranthus Species Essential Oils from Brazil and Aminoglycosides.
AB  - Plectranthus is one of the most representative genera of Lamiaceae family. In this study, the essential oils from Plectranthus amboinicus, Plectranthus ornatus, and Plectranthus barbatus were investigated for their chemical composition and antimicrobial and modulatory activities. The major components found were carvacrol (54.4%-P. amboinicus) and eugenol (22.9%-P. ornatus e 25.1%-P. barbatus). In vitro antimicrobial activity was conducted against Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus aureus (multiresistant) using microdilution method. The results of bioassay showed that all strains were sensitive to the oils, except P. aeruginosa that was resistant to P. amboinicus and P. ornatus. A synergistic effect of all essential oils combined with the aminoglycosides was demonstrated. These results show that P. amboinicus, P. ornatus, and P. barbatus inhibit the growth of pathogenic microorganism, and besides this they present antibiotic modifying activity, providing a new perspective against the problem of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.
TI  - Food safety knowledge and practices of abattoir and butchery shops and the microbial profile of meat in Mekelle City, Ethiopia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the food safety knowledge and practices in meat handling, and to determine microbial load and pathogenic organisms in meat at Mekelle city. METHODS: A descriptive survey design was used to answer questions concerning the current status of food hygiene and sanitation practiced in the abattoir and butcher shops. Workers from the abattoir and butcher shops were interviewed through a structured questionnaire to assess their food safety knowledge. Bacterial load was assessed by serial dilution method and the major bacterial pathogens were isolated by using standard procedures. RESULTS: 15.4% of the abattoir workers had no health certificate and there was no hot water, sterilizer and cooling facility in the abattoir. 11.3% of the butchers didn't use protective clothes. There was a food safety knowledge gap within the abattoir and butcher shop workers. The mean values of bacterial load of abattoir meat, butcher shops and street meat sale was found to be 1.1x10(5), 5.6x10(5) and 4.3x10(6) cfu/g, respectively. The major bacterial pathogens isolated were Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. CONCLUSIONS: The study revealed that there is a reasonable gap on food safety knowledge by abattoir and butcher shop workers. The microbial profile was also higher compared to standards set by World Health Organization. Due attention should be given by the government to improve the food safety knowledge and the quality standard of meat sold in the city.
TI  - Effect of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of various chemical decontaminants against pathogenic and spoilage bacteria on poultry.
AB  - The influence of the temperature of the dipping solution on the antimicrobial effectiveness of several chemical poultry decontaminants was assessed. A total of 765 poultry legs were inoculated with gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, or Brochothrix thermosphacta) or gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, or Pseudomonas fluorescens). Samples were dipped for 15 min in solutions (wt/vol) of trisodium phosphate (12%), acidified sodium chlorite (1,200 ppm), citric acid (2%), peroxyacids (220 ppm), chlorine dioxide (50 ppm), or tap water or were left untreated (control). The temperatures of the dipping solutions were 4, 20, or 50 degrees C. Microbiological analyses and pH determinations were carried out after 0, 1, 3, and 5 days of storage at 4 degrees C. In comparison with the control samples, all chemical solutions were effective for reducing microbial loads. The temperature of treatment affected the microbial reductions caused by all chemicals (P < 0.001). The lowest average bacterial reductions caused by trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids were observed at 4 degrees C, all sampling days and microbial groups being considered simultaneously. The highest and the lowest effectiveness for chlorine dioxide were observed at 4 and 50 degrees C, respectively. These results may be of use to meat processors for selecting the best conditions for decontamination treatments and may help the European Regulatory Authorities make their decisions for authorization of poultry decontamination treatments.
TI  - Biochemical composition, antimicrobial activities,and anti-quorum-sensing activities of ethanol and ethyl acetate extracts from Hypericum connatum Lam. (Guttiferae).
AB  - We studied the polyphenol composition and antioxidant activity of the ethanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of Hypericum connatum (Guttiferae), in addition to their antimicrobial and antiquorum-sensing (AQS) properties. The extracts exhibited a similar polyphenol content and a notable antioxidant activity, which was stronger in the ethanolic extract (EC50=3.2 mug/mL). Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography analyses revealed different polyphenol profiles, with rutin and apigen being the main components of the ethanolic extract and caffeic acid, (-)-epicatechin and p-coumaric acid being abundant in the ethyl acetate extract. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited a more effective antimicrobial activity than the ethanolic extract against the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For the first time, AQS activity was detected in H. connatum: the ethanolic extract inhibited the production of violacein, a quorum-sensing-regulated pigment, in a Chromobacterium violaceum tester strain, without interfering with its growth.
TI  - Biochemical Activities of Iranian Cymbopogon olivieri (Boiss) Bor. Essential Oil.
AB  - Cymbopogon olivieri essential oil from aerial parts was analyzed by gas chromotography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and led to the identification of 38 compounds. Piperitone (72.8%), 4-carene (11.8%) and beta-himachalene (7.6%) were found as the major components of the oil. The antimicrobial activity was achieved using disc-diffusion and microbroth dilution assays and microbicidal kinetics of oil was screened against different microorganisms. The possible antioxidant activity of oil was evaluated by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl free-radical scavenging system. The oil had excellent antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The oil exhibited inhibitory effect against Bacillus subtilis and fungi. Dvalues of oil were 12.5, 10 and 2.4 min for Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans, respectively. The IC50 value of Cymbopogon olivieri oil was 35 mg/ml and its antioxidant activity was lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene. Cymbopogon olivieri oil possesses compounds with antimicrobial properties that can be used as antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Volatile constituents of Pinus roxburghii from Nepal.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pinus roxburghii Sarg. Is one of 3 species of pine found in Nepal, the oil of which is traditionally used to treat cuts, wounds, boils, and blisters. OBJECTIVE: To obtain, analyze, and examine the anti-microbial and cytotoxic activities of the essential oils of P. roxburghii. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three plant parts (cone, needle, and bark) of Pinus roxburghii were collected in Biratnagar, Nepal. The essential oils were obtained by hydrodistillation, and the chemical compositions were determined by GC-MS. The needle and cone essential oils were screened for anti-microbial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Aspergillus niger; brine shrimp (Artemia salina) lethality; and in-vitro cytotoxicity against MCF-7 cells. RESULTS: GC-MS analysis for the cone oil revealed 81 compounds with 78 components being identified (95.5% of the oil) while 98.3% of needle oil was identified to contain 68 components and 98.6% of the bark oil (38 components) was identified. The 3 essential oils were dominated by sesquiterpenes, particularly (E)-caryophyllene (26.8%-34.5%) and alpha-humulene (5.0%-7.3%) as well as monoterpene alcohols terpinen-4-ol (4.1%-30.1%) and alpha-terpineol(2.8%-5.0%). The monoterpene delta-3-carene was present only in needle and cone essential oils (2.3% and 6.8%, respectively). Bio-activity assays of the cone essential oil of P. roxburghii showed remarkable cytotoxic activity (100% killing of MCF-7 cells at 100 mug/mL) along with notable brine shrimp lethality (LC50 =11.8 mug/mL). The cone essential oil did not show anti-bacterial activity, but it did exhibit anti-fungal activity against Aspergillus niger (MIC=39 mug/mL). CONCLUSION: The bioactivity of P. roxburghii essential oil is consistent with its traditional medicinal use.
TI  - Evaluation of the HACCP system in a university canteen: microbiological monitoring and internal auditing as verification tools.
AB  - Food safety is essential in mass catering. In Europe, Regulation (EC) No. 852/2004 requires food business operators to put in place, implement and maintain permanent procedures based on Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) principles. Each HACCP plan is specifically implemented for the processing plant and processing methods and requires a systematic collection of data on the incidence, elimination, prevention, and reduction of risks. In this five-year-study, the effectiveness of the HACCP plan of a University canteen was verified through periodic internal auditing and microbiological monitoring of meals, small equipment, cooking tools, working surfaces, as well as hands and white coats of the canteen staff. The data obtained revealed no safety risks for the consumers, since Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were never detected; however, a quite discontinuous microbiological quality of meals was revealed. The fluctuations in the microbial loads of mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and sulphite-reducing clostridia were mainly ascribed to inadequate handling or processing procedures, thus suggesting the need for an enhancement of staff training activities and for a reorganization of tasks. Due to the wide variety of the fields covered by internal auditing, the full conformance to all the requirements was never achieved, though high scores, determined by assigning one point to each answer which matched with the requirements, were achieved in all the years.
TI  - Reactive oxygen species and the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of isoconazole nitrate.
AB  - Bacterial superinfections often occur in dermatomycoses, resulting in greatly inflamed or eczematous skin. The objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of isoconazole nitrate (ISN), a broad-spectrum antimicrobial imidazole, commonly used to treat dermatomycoses. Several gram-positive bacteria minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for ISN (ISN solution or ISN-containing creams: Travogen or corticosteroid-containing Travocort) and ampicillin were obtained using the broth-dilution method. Speed of onset of the bactericidal effect was determined with bacterial killing curves. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were visualised by staining cells with singlet oxygen detector stain. Compared with ampicillin MICs, ISN MICs for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus and Staphylococcus hominis were lower and ISN MICs for Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum and Streptococcus salivarius were similar. Incubation with ISN led to a 50% kill rate for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA). Post-ISN incubation, 36% (30 min) and 90% (60 min) of S. aureus cells were positive for ROS. Isoconazole nitrate has a broad bacteriostatic and bactericidal action, also against a MRSA strain that was not reduced by the corticosteroid in the Travocort cream. Data suggest that the antibacterial effect of ISN may be ROS dependent. An antifungal agent with robust antibacterial activity can provide a therapeutic advantage in treating dermatomycoses with suspected bacterial superinfections.
TI  - Biogenesis of antibacterial silver nanoparticles using the endophytic bacterium Bacillus cereus isolated from Garcinia xanthochymus.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To synthesize the ecofriendly nanoparticles, which is viewed as an alternative to the chemical method which initiated the use of microbes like bacteria and fungi in their synthesis. METHODS: The current study uses the endophytic bacterium Bacillus cereus isolated from the Garcinia xanthochymus to synthesize the silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The AgNPs were synthesized by reduction of silver nitrate solution by the endophytic bacterium after incubation for 3-5 d at room temperature. The synthesis was initially observed by colour change from pale white to brown which was confirmed by UV-Vis spectroscopy. The AgNPs were further characterized using FTIR, SEM-EDX and TEM analyses. RESULTS: The synthesized nanoparticles were found to be spherical with the size in the range of 20-40 nm which showed a slight aggregation. The energy-dispersive spectra of the nanoparticle dispersion confirmed the presence of elemental silver. The AgNPs were found to have antibacterial activity against a few pathogenic bacteria like Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The endophytic bacteria identified as Bacillus cereus was able to synthesize silver nanoparticles with potential antibacterial activity.
TI  - Foodborne disease outbreaks caused by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus--United States, 1998-2008.
AB  - From 1998 to 2008, 1229 foodborne outbreaks caused by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus were reported in the United States; 39% were reported with a confirmed etiology. Vomiting was commonly reported in B. cereus (median, 75% of cases) and S. aureus outbreaks (median, 87%), but rarely in C. perfringens outbreaks (median, 9%). Meat or poultry dishes were commonly implicated in C. perfringens (63%) and S. aureus (55%) outbreaks, and rice dishes were commonly implicated in B. cereus outbreaks (50%). Errors in food processing and preparation were commonly reported (93%), regardless of etiology; contamination by a food worker was only common in S. aureus outbreaks (55%). Public health interventions should focus on these commonly reported errors to reduce the occurrence of outbreaks caused by B. cereus, C. perfringens, and S. aureus in the United States.
TI  - Biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles using actinobacterium Streptomyces albogriseolus and its antibacterial activity.
AB  - An eco-friendly approach to the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) by extracellular components of Streptomyces albogriseolus has been reported. The isolated actinobacteria were genotypically identified by 16S rRNA sequencing analysis, and the morphology was observed by high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. The preliminary characterization of synthesized nanoparticles was carried out using ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer. The maximum absorption spectra were found to be 409 nm at the 48th hour of incubation. The yield of AgNPs was found to be 72.64% as quantified by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The average size of AgNPs determined by the dynamic light scattering technique was 16.25 +/- 1.6 nm. The results from transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction confirmed the formation of spherical shaped and crystalline AgNPs. The interaction of protein with AgNPs was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. The biosynthesized AgNPs inhibited the growth of food pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus). Hence, the synthesis of AgNPs by S. albogriseolus could be employed as a probable antimicrobial agent to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms. This approach employed for the synthesis of nanoparticles paves a path for new biomaterial interfaces, which could be applied in different biomedical fields.
TI  - Microbiological assessment of indoor air of a teaching hospital in Nigeria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the quality of indoor air of different wards and units  of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, to ascertain their contribution to infection rate in the hospital. METHODS: The microbial quality of indoor air of nine wards/units of Olabisi Onabanjo University Teaching Hospital, Sagamu, Nigeria was conducted. Sedimentation technique using open Petri-dishes containing different culture media was employed and samplings were done twice daily, one in the morning shortly after cleaning and before influx of people/patients into the wards/units and the other in the evening when a lot of activities would have taken place in these wards. Isolates were identified according to standard methods. RESULTS: Results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (chi(2) = 6.016 7) in the bacteria population of the different sampling time whereas it was not so for fungi population (chi(2) = 0.285 7). Male medical ward (MMW) and male surgical general (MSG) recorded the highest bacterial and fungal growth while the operating theatre (OT) was almost free of microbial burden. The bacteria isolates were Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes and Serratia marscences while the fungi isolates included Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium sp., Fusarium sp., Candida albicans and Alternaria sp. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominantly isolated bacterium while Penicillium sp. was the most isolated fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Though most of the microbial isolates were potential and or opportunistic pathogens, there was no correlation between the isolates in this study and the surveillance report of nosocomial infection during the period of study, hence the contribution of the indoor air cannot be established. From the reduction noticed in the morning samples, stringent measures such as proper disinfection and regular cleaning, restriction of patient relatives' movement in and out of the wards/units need to be enforced so as to improve the quality of indoor air of our hospital wards/units.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of mangrove plant Sonneratia alba.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial property of mangrove plant Sonneratia alba (S. alba). METHODS: The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using disc diffusion and microdilution methods against six microorganisms. Soxhlet apparatus was used for extraction with a series of solvents, n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol in sequence of increasing polarity. RESULTS: Methanol extract appeared to be the most effective extract while n-hexane extract showed no activity. The antimicrobial activities were observed against the gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), the gram negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and the yeast Cryptococcus neoformans. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans appeared to be not sensitive to the concentrations tested since no inhibition zone was observed. E. coli (17.5 mm) appeared to be the most sensitive strain followed by S. aureus (12.5 mm) and B. cereus (12.5 mm). CONCLUSIONS: From this study, it can be concluded that S. alba exhibits antimicrobial activities against certain microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activity-guided purification and identification of a novel C-20 oxygenated ent-kaurane from Rabdosia serra (MAXIM.) HARA.
AB  - The objective of this work was to conduct an activity-guided isolation of antibacterial compounds from Rabdosia serra. The ethanol extracts of R. serra leaf and stem were partitioned sequentially into petroleum ether, ethyl acetate, butanol and water fractions, respectively. The ethanol extract of leaf evidenced broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacterial, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. The ethyl acetate fractions of leaf and stem exhibited strong inhibition against gram-positive bacteria, and were then purified further. On the basis of antibacterial assay-guided purification, three phenolic compounds (rosmarinic acid, methyl rosmarinate and pedalitin) and four C-20 oxygenated ent-kauranes (effusanin E, lasiodin, rabdosichuanin D and a new compound namely effusanin F) were obtained, whose contents were determined by HPLC analysis. The broth microdilution method confirmed the important inhibition potential of C-20 oxygenated ent-kauranes with low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values. Effusanin E, lasiodin and effusanin F could be useful for the development of new antibacterial agents.
TI  - Synthesis of amino acid conjugates of tetrahydrocurcumin and evaluation of their  antibacterial and anti-mutagenic properties.
AB  - Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), the hydrogenated and stable form of curcumin, exhibits  physiological and pharmacological activities similar to curcumin. A protocol has been developed for the synthesis of novel conjugates of THC with alanine (2a), isoleucine (2b), proline (2c), valine (2d), phenylalanine (2e), glycine (2f) and leucine (2g) in high yields (43-82%). All the derivatives of THC exhibited more potent anti-microbial activity than THC against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Yersinia enterocolitica. The MIC values of the derivatives were 24-37% of those for THC in case of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Derivatives 2g and 2d exhibited maximum anti-mutagenicity against Salmonella typhimurium TA 98 and TA 1538, respectively at a low concentration of 313 mug/plate, with comparable activity for THC evident only at 3750 mug/plate. These results clearly demonstrated that the conjugation of THC at the phenolic position with amino acids led to significant improvement of its in vitro biological attributes.
TI  - Microbiological examination of ready-to-eat foods and ready-to-bake frozen pastries from university canteens.
AB  - During a 10-year inspection survey (2001-2010), a microbiological study of ready-to-eat (RTE) foods and ready-to-bake frozen pastries from 15 canteens of the university campus was undertaken to determine their microbiological quality. The cumulative study revealed that the aerobic colony counts for the RTE product groups were as follows: from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/g for 50% of sandwiches; under the detection limit (<10 CFU/g) for 88.6% of oven baked pastries; <10(5) CFU/g for 86.5% of desserts oven baked; from 10(3) to 10(9) CFU/g for desserts with dairy cream. The highest mean Enterobacteriaceae counts were recorded for desserts with dairy cream. The highest percentages of foodborne pathogens were: 20% Listeria monocytogenes and 12.5% Staphylococcus aureus in desserts with dairy cream; 17.5% Salmonella spp. and 8.5% presumptive Escherichia coli O157 in sandwiches; 14.6% Bacillus cereus in oven baked pastries. Aerobic colony counts were in the range 10(7)-10(8) CFU/g for 48.8% of frozen pastries; whereas Enterobacteriaceae counts between 10(3) and 10(4) CFU/g were detected in 35.3%. Foodborne pathogens prevalences for frozen pastries were as follows: B. cereus, 31.8%; Salmonella spp., 28.6%; presumptive E. coli O157, 25%; S. aureus, 8.7%; L. monocytogenes, 8.7%. Improved sanitary conditions in the processing plants and precautionary measures are necessary for consumer protection.
TI  - In vitro assessment of functional properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from faecal microbiota of healthy dogs for potential use as probiotics.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were isolated and identified in the faeces of Chinese Crested and Yorkshire terrier pups and their probiotic features were investigated in vitro. Thirty seven isolates were identified as Lactobacillus or Enterococcus. Out of these isolates, 31 were lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and belonged to the species Lactobacillus reuteri (16/37; 43.3%), Lactobacillus animalis (7/37; 18.9%), Lactobacillus acidophilus (3/37; 8.1%), Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (2/37; 5.4%), Lactobacillus murinus (2/37; 5.4%), and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (1/37; 2.7%), while six other LAB isolates were Enterococcus spp. (6/37; 16.2%). Strains were tested for resistance to gastric acidity (pH 2.5 for 3 h) and bile salts (0.3% ox gall), cell surface hydrophobicity by microbial adhesion to solvents, antagonism against pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Listeria monocytogenes), production of hydrogen peroxide, and antibiotic susceptibility. Thirty four strains were highly resistant to acidic conditions with slight (18 strains) to moderate (16 strains) growth inhibition by bile salts. Seven isolates had highly hydrophobic cellular surfaces and 28 strains exhibited strong antagonism against the bacterial pathogens tested, although 8 isolates tested against Leptospira interrogans had no effect on pathogen growth. All isolates produced low rates of hydrogen peroxide. Based on these results, two Lactobacillus strains showed promising probiotic-related features and merit investigation as probiotics for dogs.
TI  - Synthesis of 1-isopropyl-3-acyl-5-methyl-benzimidazolone derivatives and their antimicrobial activity.
AB  - A series of N-acylated analogues of 1-isopropyl-3-acyl-5-methyl-benzimidazolone were synthesized. Bioassay results indicated that analogues 5-07 and 5-19 exhibited the most potency against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Analogues 5-02, 5-07, 5-12, 5-15, 5-19, 5-20 and 5-25 could effectively inhibit the spore germination of Botrytis cinerea. The relationship between structure and their antimicrobial activity (SAR) has also been discussed according to aliphatic acids and aromatic acids derivatives, respectively. This implied that the N-acylated derivatives of 5-methyl-benzimidazolone might be potential antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of mycelia of a medicinal mushroom from Taiwan, Taiwanofungus salmoneus (higher Basidiomycetes).
AB  - Taiwanofungus salmoneus (T.T. Chang et W.N. Chou) Sheng H. Wu et al. (shiang-shan-chih), is a medicinal fungus indigenous to Taiwan. The mycelium was prepared from submerged culture and its ethanolic and hot-water extracts were used to study its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. Gram-positive species (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative species (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium) of bacteria were used. In addition to the inhibitory zone, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) also were determined. The ethanolic extracts showed higher inhibitory and bactericidal activities (MIC and MBC: 6.25-12.50 mg/ml) than the hot-water extracts (MIC and MBC: 25-50 mg/mL). In the anti-inflammatory test, the extracts were tested on lipopolysaccharide-induced nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor- alpha production in RAW 264.7 cells. The values of the inhibition concentration at 50% of nitric oxide production were 18.2 and 14.2 mug/mL for the hot-water and ethanolic extracts, respectively. The 50% inhibitory concentration values of tumor necrosis factor- alpha production were 4.99 and 7.13 mug/mL for the hot-water and ethanolic extracts, respectively. On the basis of the results obtained, the mycelia could be used as an antibacterial and anti-inflammatory supplement.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of polyhalo isophthalonitrile derivatives.
AB  - A series of polyhalo isophthalonitrile derivatives (3 and 4) that incorporate a variety of substituents at the 2-, 4-, 5- and/or 6-positions of the isophthalonitrile moieties have been designed and synthesized. These derivatives were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus (Gram-positive bacteria), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative bacteria); and Candida albicans (Fungi). Compounds 3 and 4 showed stronger inhibition of Gram-positive bacteria and fungi growth, and the antimicrobial ability of compound 3j (a 4-(benzylamino)-5-chloro-2,6-difluoro analog, MIC[SA] = 0.5 mug/mL; MIC[BC] = 0.4 mug/mL; MIC[CA] = 0.5 mug/mL) were close to nofloxacin and fluconazole and identified as the most potent antimicrobial agents in the series. The preliminary analysis of structure-activity relationships is also discussed.
TI  - Synthesis, antimicrobial, antiquorum-sensing, antitumor and cytotoxic activities  of new series of fused [1,3,4]thiadiazoles.
AB  - New series of [1,3,4]thiadiazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidines, benzo[h][1,3,4]thiadiazolo[2,3-b]quinazolines, benzothiadiazolotriazocine, and imidazo[2,1-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles have been synthesized and characterized by analytical and spectrometrical methods (IR, MS, (1)H and (13)C NMR). Twenty of the synthesized compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. They were found to be either moderately active, slightly active or inactive against the tested microorganisms. The antifungal activity of these compounds were also tested against Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus 293 and Aspergillus flavus 3375. Compounds 3g, h showed potent antifungal activity against C. albicans. In addition, the same compounds were tested for antiquorum-sensing activity against Chromobacterium violacium ATCC 12472, where compounds 3b,c, 3f-h, 6b-d, 9, 10 and 12 demonstrated acceptable activity. Compounds 3d, 9 and 10 were screened for antitumor activity at National Cancer Institute, USA. The in vitro cytotoxic activity of eighteen of the synthesized compounds was studied by brine shrimp lethality bioassay, and results indicated that compounds 6c, 13, 3h, 6d and 3d have the highest cytotoxic activity.
TI  - Co-production of surfactin and a novel bacteriocin by Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis H4 isolated from Bikalga, an African alkaline Hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment.
AB  - Bikalga is a Hibiscus sabdariffa seed fermented condiment widely consumed in Burkina Faso and neighboring countries. The fermentation is dominated by Bacillus subtilis group species. Ten B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (six isolates) and Bacillus licheniformis (four isolates) isolated from traditional Bikalga were examined for their antimicrobial activity against a panel of 36 indicator organisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. The Bacillus spp. isolates showed variable inhibitory abilities depending on the method used. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were inhibited in the agar spot assay while only Gram-positive pathogens were inhibited in the agar well diffusion assay. Cell free supernatants (CFS) of pure cultures of 3 B. subtilis subsp. subtilis (G2, H4 and F1) strains inhibited growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, while CFS of 2 B. licheniformis (E3 and F9) strains only inhibited M. luteus. The antimicrobial substance(s) produced by B. subtilis subsp. subtilis H4 was further characterized. The antimicrobial substance(s) produced by H4 was detected from mid-exponential growth phase. The activity was sensitive to protease and trypsin, but resistant to the proteolytic action of proteinase K and papain. Treatment with alpha-amylase and lipase II resulted in a complete loss of antimicrobial effect, indicating that a sugar moiety and lipid moiety are necessary for the activity. Treatment with mercapto-ethanol resulted in a significant loss, indicative of the presence of disulfide bridges. The antimicrobial activity of H4 was heat resistant and active at pH3-10. PCR detection of yiwB, sboA, spoX, albA and spaS, etnS genes and genes coding for surfactins and plipastatins (fengycins) indicated a potential for subtilosin, subtilin and lipopeptide production, respectively. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was carried out and a single band of approximately 4kDa had antimicrobial activity. Ultra high performance liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-TOFMS) analysis of the 4kDa band allowed identification of surfactin and a protein with a monoisotopic mass of 3346.59Da, which is dissimilar in size to subtilosin and subtilin. Surfactin is a cyclic lipoheptapeptide, which contains a beta-hydroxy fatty acid, but no di-sulfide bridges or sugar residues. The complete loss of activity upon amylase treatment indicates that surfactin was not responsible for the observed antimicrobial effect. However, it cannot completely be ruled out that surfactin acts synergistically with the detected protein, though further investigations are needed to confirm this.
TI  - Airborne microbial composition in a high-throughput poultry slaughtering facility.
AB  - A high-throughput chicken slaughtering facility in Beijing was systematically investigated for numbers of airborne microorganisms. Samples were assessed for counts of aerobic bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella. During a 4-month period (September to December 2011), samples were collected for 10 min three times daily (preproduction, production, and postproduction). Samples were collected for three consecutive days of each month with an FA-1 sampler from six sampling sites: receiving-hanging, soaking-scalding and defeathering, evisceration, precooling, subdividing, and packing. Humidity, temperature, wind velocity, and airborne particulates also were recorded at each sampling site and time. The highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, i.e., the receiving-hanging and defeathering areas, with a definite decline toward the evisceration, prechilling, subdividing, and packing areas; the prechilling area had the lowest microbial counts of 2.4 x 10(3) CFU/m(3). Mean total coliforms counts ranged from 8.4 x 10(3) to 140 CFU/m(3). Maximum E. coli counts were 6.1 x 10(3) CFU/m(3) in the soaking-scalding and defeathering area. B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus represented only a small proportion of the microbial population (1,900 to 20 CFU/m(3)). L. monocytogenes and Salmonella were rarely detected in evisceration, precooling, subdividing, and packing areas. Our study identified the levels of bioaerosols that may affect chicken product quality. This finding could be useful for improved control of microbial contamination to ensure product quality.
TI  - Screening of solvent dependent antibacterial activity of Prunus domestica.
AB  - Fruit of Prunus domestica was extracted in ethanol. The ethanol extract was further extracted with two solvents ethyl acetate and chloroform. The crude ethanol extract and two fractions (ethyl acetate and chloroform) were screened for their antibacterial activity using the agar well diffusion method .They were tested against nine bacteria; five Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcuc intermedius, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus) and four Gram negative bacteria (Eschrichia coli, Proteus mirabilis Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi and Klebsiela pneumoniae). The susceptibility of microorganisms to all three fractions was compared with each other and with standard antibiotic (Ampicillin) Among all fractions ethyl acetate exhibited highest antibacterial activity (average zone of inhibition 34.57mm +/- 1.3) while ethyl alcohol exhibited least antibacterial activity (average zone of inhibition 17.42mm +/- 3.3). Minimum inhibitory concentration of ethanol, ethyl acetate and chloroform fractions was found in the range of 78 mu g/ml to 2500 mu gl/ml against gram positive and gram negative bacteria.
TI  - Microbial contamination associated with consumption and the growth in plastic bottled beverage.
AB  - Plastic bottles enable the storage of unfinished beverages, and most of microbial contamination has occurred in the unfinished beverage that was left. Therefore, we investigated microorganisms in various beverages contaminated by pouring and drinking directly by mouth from the bottle, and analyzed the growth of microorganisms in the beverages at room temperature. In the pouring test, microbial growth was detected in 60 of 320 samples, and 13 bacterial strains, 49 mold strains, and 8 yeast strains were isolated. Molds including Cladosporium spp., Tramets spp., Bjerkandera spp., and Penicillium spp. accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. In the drinking test, microbial growth was detected in 181 of 352 samples, and 225 bacterial strains, 27 mold strains and 77 yeast strains were isolated. Bacteria including Streptococcus spp. such as S. salivarius and Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus accounted for the majority of isolated microorganisms. Enterotoxin-producing S. aureus and Bacillus cereus were also isolated. The pH of the beverage influenced the growth of bacteria. The Brix values of the beverage did not correlate with the growth of microorganisms. These results revealed that various microorganisms including foodborne pathogens were able to grow in numerous types of beverages and that the storage of unfinished beverage in inappropriate condition, such as the storage at room temperature led microorganism to grow easily in beverage. Therefore, it is necessary to consume beverages as soon as possible after opening the bottle.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: AABB Standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) products for microbial contamination. To date, there is no automated blood culture system cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for this application. Our objective was to validate the VersaTREK system (TREK Diagnostic Systems) for sterility testing of apheresis HPC products. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Four aerobic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis, and Bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (Fusobacterium necrophorum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella loescheii, and Propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (Candida albicans) were spiked into apheresis HPC products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (CFUs)/mL. Aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. DNA was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. RESULTS: All aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (TTP) was significantly shorter with aerobic bottles. C. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. Anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. No bacteria were detected by using 16S rRNA gene amplification at 10(4) CFUs/mL. CONCLUSION: Compared to culture, 16S rRNA gene amplification of HPCs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for HPC sterility testing. The VersaTREK system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of apheresis HPC products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 CFUs/mL. Inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest TTP for all species tested.
TI  - Endophthalmitis.
AB  - Endophthalmitis means bacterial or fungal infection inside the eye involving the  vitreous and/or aqueous humors. Most cases are exogenous and occur after eye surgery, after penetrating ocular trauma, or as an extension of corneal infection. An increasing number of cases are occurring after intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medications. Endophthalmitis may also be endogenous, arising from bacteraemic or fungaemic seeding of the eye. The infected eye never serves as a source of bacteraemia or fungaemia, however. The most common pathogens in endophthalmitis vary by category. Coagulase-negative staphylococci are the most common causes of post-cataract endophthalmitis, and these bacteria and viridans streptococci cause most cases of post-intravitreal anti-VEGF injection endophthalmitis, Bacillus cereus is a major cause of post-traumatic endophthalmitis, and Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci are important causes of endogenous endophthalmitis associated with endocarditis. In Taiwan and other East Asian nations, Klebsiella pneumoniae causes most cases of endogenous endophthalmitis, in association with liver abscess. Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in hospitalized patients is usually caused by Candida species, particularly Candida albicans. Acute endophthalmitis is a medical emergency. The most important component of treatment is the intravitreal injection of antibiotics, along with vitrectomy in severe cases. Systemic antibiotics should be used in cases of endogenous endophthalmitis and exogenous fungal endophthalmitis, but their role in exogenous bacterial endophthalmitis is uncertain. Repeated intravitreal injections of antibiotics may be necessary if there is no response to the initial therapy. Many eyes that receive prompt and appropriate treatment will recover useful vision.
TI  - Microbiological quality and risk factors related to sandwiches served in bakeries, cafes, and sandwich bars in South Korea.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the microbiological quality of sandwiches produced on site and served in bakeries, cafes, and sandwich bars in South Korea and to determine the major risk factors affecting the sanitation level in each store (n = 1,120). The microbiological quality of the sandwiches was analyzed, and the sanitation level of each store was evaluated as satisfactory or unsatisfactory based on sanitation guidelines. Total coliforms were detected in 906 samples (80.9%), but only 3 samples (0.3%) contained confirmed Escherichia coli contamination. The detection rate was highest for Bacillus cereus (10.0%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (1.3%) and Salmonella (0.2%). Vibrio parahaemolyticus was not detected in any samples. The microbial contamination level was significantly lower in winter (P < 0.05) and in stores with a higher sanitation grade. Factors related to the microbiological quality of sandwiches were evaluated as the relative risk (RR) of coliform contamination, and the higher risk factors for sandwich contamination were improper holding temperature (RR = 8.75), cross-contamination (RR = 6.30), lack of proper ventilation systems (RR = 6.16), and the absence of clean and/or suitable outer garments (RR = 5.73). Most factors were related to the failure of food handlers to adhere to sanitation guidelines rather than to unsanitary environments. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between the microbiological quality of sandwiches served on-site and various risk factors. These results will help researchers establish guidelines for the sanitary management of sandwich shops.
TI  - A nanoporous membrane-based impedimetric immunosensor for label-free detection of pathogenic bacteria in whole milk.
AB  - We introduce a nanoporous membrane based impedimetric immunosensor for the label-free detection of bacterial pathogens in whole milk. A simple and rapid method to modify a commercially available alumina nanoporous membrane with hyaluronic acid (HA) effectively reduced the non-specific binding of biomolecules and other cells, and permitted successful immobilization of antibodies. Escherichia coli O157:H7, one of the most harmful food-borne pathogenic bacteria, was tested as a model pathogen in this study. The ionic impedance of electrolytes through nanopores, due to antibody-pathogen interactions, was monitored by impedance spectra and analyzed by normalized impedance change (NIC). The regression equation for the NIC at 1 kHz versus concentration of E. coli O157:H7 (10-10(5)cfu/ml) was obtained, and the detection limit found to be as low as 10 cfu/ml. In addition, the proposed immunosensor was successfully used for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in whole milk samples with the detection limit as low as 83.7 cfu/ml with 95% probability. The specificity of the immunosensor was also demonstrated using non-target bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and non pathogenic E. coli DH5alpha. This study shows that a HA-functionalized nanoporous membrane-based impedimetric sensor is capable of detecting pathogenic bacteria in whole milk without any pretreatment. This is a significant step for evaluating the safety of food and environmental samples and other medical diagnostics.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a new preservative for multiuse ophthalmic solutions.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial activity and the  preservative efficacy of a novel preservative solution containing sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (SHMG) and edetate disodium (EDTA), which is used for preservation of some commercial ophthalmic formulations. METHODS: In vitro susceptibility assays were performed against several gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria representative of the microbial flora of epithelial surfaces or colonizing the conjunctiva, as well as against Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger. Using different concentrations of SHMG alone or in combination with EDTA, the minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations against these organisms were assessed. In addition, 8 brands of multidose eye drops containing 0.002% SHMG and 0.1% EDTA as preservative were tested for antimicrobial activity using the antimicrobial effectiveness test recommended by the international pharmacopoeias. RESULTS: The minimal inhibitory and bactericidal/fungicidal concentration values of SHMG ranged from 0.0025% to 0.0125% for bacteria and from 0.125% to 0.50% for mold and yeast. Susceptibility testing demonstrated that the addition of EDTA substantially increased the SHMG activity against all bacterial and fungal strains. The preservative effectiveness test was applied to commercial eye drops. All the drop solutions met the criteria reported by the U.S. Pharmacopeia for parenteral and ophthalmic preparations. All products also satisfied the major acceptance criteria of the European Pharmacopeia with respect to the antifungal activity. With regard to the antibacterial activity, the less-stringent criteria of the European Pharmacopeia were fulfilled. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates the efficacy of a novel preservative for ophthalmic solutions (SHMG/EDTA) and its activity in protecting selected commercial artificial tears against microbial contamination.
TI  - Copper(II) triflate promoted multicomponent catalytic clubbing of piperazinyl-thiazoloquinolines and thiazolocoumarins as antimicrobials.
AB  - Step economical, multicomponent construction of two series based on quinoline and coumarin ring systems was carried out. Annulation towards the 2-piperazinylthiazole system was established in satisfactory yields, using copper(II) triflate. These multicomponent reaction products were examined for their potential inhibitory effect against two Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), three Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two fungal species (Aspergillus niger and Candida albicans). In vitro pharmacological screening data demonstrated that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad-spectrum antimicrobial (25-50 microg/mL of MIC) potential and the results were comparable to control drugs. The structural assignments of final products were done on the basis of IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) was explored to facilitate further development of this class of compounds.
TI  - Antiradical, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of commercial beetroot pomace.
AB  - The by-product of food processing is often utilized as feed, and for the preparation of dietary fiber and biofuel. However, these products are also promising sources of bioactive antioxidants and color giving compounds, which could be used as additives in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industry. The aim of this study was to investigate the phytochemical profile, and the antiradical, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of industrial beetroot pomace extract (BPE). The content of phenolics (45.68 mg gallic acid equivalents g(-1)), flavonoids (25.89 mg rutin equivalents g(-1)) and betalains (4.09 mg betanin g(-1); 7.32 mg vulgaxanthin I g(-1)) were determined spectrophotometrically. The antiradical activity on DPPH (EC(50)(DPPH.) = 0.0797 mg ml(-1)), hydroxyl (EC(50)(.OH) = 0.0655 mg ml(-1)) and superoxide anion (EC(50)(O2.-) = 1.0625 mg ml(-1)) radicals were measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The antimicrobial activity was determined using the agar-well diffusion method. Gram(-) bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii) and Gram(+) bacteria, (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus sciuri, Bacillus cereus) showed high susceptibility, while yeasts and moulds were resistant. BPE exhibits cytotoxic properties against Ehrlich carcinoma (EAC) cells in vivo due to induction of oxidative stress. The largest decreases in EAC cell numbers were observed in the pre-treated male (approximately 53%) and female (approximately 47%) mice, and also the EAC cell viability was decreased after administration of BPE. The activities of the antioxidant enzymes, xanthine oxidase (XOD) and peroxidase (Px), were significantly different between the untreated EAC control group and all other groups that were treated with BPE. The XOD and Px activities were very low in untreated malignant cells, but increased significantly after administration of BPE. Our results show that BPE holds promise in the food industry as a source of bioactive compounds.
TI  - Characterization of an atmospheric pressure plasma jet and its applications for disinfection and cancer treatment.
AB  - In this work an atmospheric pressure non-thermal resistive barrier (RB) plasma jet was constructed, characterized and was applied for biomedical applications. The RB plasma source can operate in both DC (battery) as well as in standard 60/50 Hz low frequency AC excitation, and it functions effectively in both direct and indirect plasma exposure configurations. The characteristics of the RB plasma jet such as electrical properties, plasma gas temperature and nitric oxides concentration were determined using voltage-current characterization, optical emission spectroscopy and gas analyzer diagnostic techniques. Plasma discharge power of 26.33 W was calculated from voltage-current characterization. An optical emission spectroscopy was applied and the gas temperature which is equivalent to the nitrogen rotational (T<inf>rot</inf>) temperatures was measured. The concentrations of the reactive oxygen species at different spatial distances from the tip of the plasma jet were measured and the ppm concentration of NO is at the preferred level for a wide range of standard biomedical treatment applications. The ppm values of nitric oxides after the cooling unit are observed to be of the same order of magnitude as compared to plasma jet. The portable RB plasma source was tested to be very effective for decontamination and disinfection of a wide range of foodborne and opportunistic nosocomial pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and the preliminary results are presented. The effects of indirect exposure of the portable RBP source on monocytic leukemia cancer cells (THP-1) were also tested and the results demonstrate that a preference for apoptosis in plasma treated THP-1 cells under particular plasma parameters and dosage levels.
TI  - [Analysis of bactericidal material generated by electrical devices advertising bactericidal ability against bacteria on the agar gel plates].
AB  - Several Japanese companies sell electrical devices advertised as effective in inactivating viruses and killing bacteria by releasing special materials, e.g., Plasmacluster ions, Nanoe particle and minus ions, into the air. These companies claim that their devices killed bacteria on plates in their own experiments. We tested device effectiveness using the same experiments from the Plasmacluster ioniser SHARP Co., Japan, the Nanoe generator Panasonic Co., Japan, and the Vion KING JIM Co., Japan, to test their advertising claims. Bactericidal ability on agar plate was tested, using Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis as follows: the medium containing a certain amount of each bacterium was put onto an agar plate and smeared. Plates were kept in a closed chamber (inner volume 14.4 m3) or a glove box (inner volume 0.2 m), with one of the devices run for 2 hours. Plates not exposed to any device were used as controls. Each plate was retrieved and put in an incubator to count the number of bacterial colonies formed on the plate. There was no significant difference in the number of colonies on plates exposed to devices compared to control, in the number for all devices, or in all bacteria tested in experiments in the 14.4 m3 chamber. These results strongly suggest that these devices have almost no bactericidal effect, at least in space exceeding this volume. Colony formation was suppressed in the glove box in all devices and in all bacteria tested except P. aeruginosa, although the degree of suppression differed among experiments. The colony formation suppression mechanism was analyzed, and indicated that:colony formation did not change even after the removal of Plasmacluster ions, Nanoe particles, or negative ions from the air, while colony formation was decreased drastically by the removal of ozone from space, which was revealed to be generated inevitably during device operation. These results strongly suggest that the bactericidal effect seen only on the agar plate in narrow space was explained by ozone released in space as a by-product, not by special materials as advertising claimed. It is thus important to analyze the effect of special materials such as those done in this study and to suggest the involvement of ozone as the true cause, as have been done in this study, in evaluating bactericidal effect or viral inactivation as advertised by these companies.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial evaluation of novel heterocyclic compounds containing a sulfonamido moiety.
AB  - Aiming for the synthesis of new heterocyclic compounds containing a sulfonamido moiety suitable for use as antibacterial agents, the precursor ethyl {[4-N-(4,6-dimethylpyrimidin-2-yl)sulfamoyl]phenylazo}cyanoacetate was reacted with a variety of active methylene compounds producing pyran, pyridine and pyridazine derivatives. Also, the reactivity of the precursor hydrazone towards hydrazine derivatives to give pyrazole and oxazole derivatives was studied. On the other hand, treatment of the same precursor with urea, thiourea and/or guanidine hydrochloride furnished pyrimidine and thiazine derivatives, respectively. The newly synthesized compounds were tested for antibacterial activity, whereby eight compounds were found to have high activities.
TI  - Screening antimicrobial activity of various extracts of Urtica dioica.
AB  - Urtica dioica or stinging nettle is traditionally used as an herbal medicine in Western Asia. The current study represents the investigation of antimicrobial activity of U. dioica from nine crude extracts that were prepared using different organic solvents, obtained from two extraction methods: the Soxhlet extractor (Method I), which included the use of four solvents with ethyl acetate and hexane, or the sequential partitions (Method II) with a five solvent system (butanol). The antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude extracts were tested against 28 bacteria, three yeast strains and seven fungal isolates by the disc diffusion and broth dilution methods. Amoxicillin was used as positive control for bacteria strains, vancomycin for Streptococcus sp., miconazole nitrate (30 microg/mL) as positive control for fungi and yeast, and pure methanol (v/v) as negative control. The disc diffusion assay was used to determine the sensitivity of the samples, whilst the broth dilution method was used for the determination of the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC). The ethyl acetate and hexane extract from extraction method I (EA I and HE I) exhibited highest inhibition against some pathogenic bacteria such as Bacillus cereus, MRSA and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. A selection of extracts that showed some activity was further tested for the MIC and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC). MIC values of Bacillus subtilis and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) using butanol extract of extraction method II (BE II) were 8.33 and 16.33mg/mL, respectively; while the MIC value using ethyl acetate extract of extraction method II (EAE II) for Vibrio parahaemolyticus was 0.13mg/mL. Our study showed that 47.06% of extracts inhibited Gram-negative (8 out of 17), and 63.63% of extracts also inhibited Gram-positive bacteria (7 out of 11); besides, statistically the frequency of antimicrobial activity was 13.45% (35 out of 342) which in this among 21.71% belongs to antimicrobial activity extracts from extraction method I (33 out of 152 of crude extracts) and 6.82% from extraction method II (13 out of 190 of crude extracts). However, crude extracts from method I exhibited better antimicrobial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria than the Gram-negative bacteria. The positive results on medicinal plants screening for antibacterial activity constitutes primary information for further phytochemical and pharmacological studies. Therefore, the extracts could be suitable as antimicrobial agents in pharmaceutical and food industry.
TI  - Design, synthesis, antimicrobial activity and anti-HIV activity evaluation of novel hybrid quinazoline-triazine derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel hybrid quinazoline-triazine derivatives was designed and synthesized from cyanuric chloride and anthranilic acid through sequential reactions, which contain different pharmacophores like quinazoline and substituted diaryl triazine (DATA) linked with ethylene diamine. All the newly synthesized compounds were characterized by infrared, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Further, we evaluated the in vitro anti-HIV activity of the newly synthesized compounds against HIV-1 (IIIB) and HIV-2 (ROD) viral strains and as well as in vitro antimicrobial activity against four bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and two fungi (Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) using the paper agar streak dilution method. The bioassay results indicate that four compounds namely 7d, 7n, 7r and 7s could be considered as possible potential agents.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of cinnamon powder on pathogen growth in laboratory media and oriental-style rice cakes (sulgidduk).
AB  - There has been an increasing interest in the use of natural plant materials as alternative food preservatives. We examined the antimicrobial effects of natural plant materials used as additives against foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and Sulgidduk, oriental-style rice cakes. Cinnamon, mugwort, and garlic powder solutions (3%) were tested for their antimicrobial activities against pathogens in laboratory media. Sulgidduk prepared with different amounts of cinnamon powder (1, 3, and 6%) was inoculated with a Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus cocktail. The samples were air or vacuum packaged and stored at 22 +/- 1 degrees C for 72 h, and microbial growth was determined. Cinnamon powder showed more inhibitory properties against pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, S. aureus, and B. cereus than did mugwort or garlic powder. The populations of S. aureus and B. cereus in Sulgidduk containing cinnamon powder were significantly lower than in the control during storage time. Different packaging methods did not result in a significant difference in pathogen growth. In a sensory evaluation, Sulgidduk containing 1 and 3% cinnamon powder did not significantly differ from the control sample in any of the attributes tested other than flavor. These results indicate that natural plant materials such as cinnamon powder could be used as food additives to improve the microbiological stability of rice cakes.
TI  - Changes in microbial contamination levels of porcine carcasses and fresh pork in  slaughterhouses, processing lines, retail outlets, and local markets by commercial distribution.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the changes in microbial contamination levels of each porcine carcass and fresh pork in a general distribution process. A total of 100 commercial pigs were sampled (six sampling sites per individual, total 600 samples) at four sequential stages: slaughterhouse (after carcass grading and boning), processing line, retail outlet, and local market. No significant differences were observed in the contaminant percentages among sampling sites and sample collection years (P>0.05) with the exception of Bacillus cereus. The contaminant percentage of B. cereus at 1st collection year was higher than these of 2nd collection year (28.31% vs. 12.26%, P<0.05). B. cereus and Listeria monocytogenes were the most frequently detected pathogenic bacteria in the slaughterhouse and markets, respectively. On the other hand, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Yersinia enterocolitica were not detected in carcasses or pork collected from any carcass sites and pork samples. However, the frequency of pathogenic bacteria in end-products at local markets was not highly related to the initial contamination of porcine carcasses in the slaughterhouse. Thus, the improvement of microbial safety for pork end-products requires hygienic control of porcine carcasses and meat cutting during all operations in the slaughterhouse, processing line, retail outlet, and local market.
TI  - The insect Galleria mellonella as a powerful infection model to investigate bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  - The study of bacterial virulence often requires a suitable animal model. Mammalian models of infection are costly and may raise ethical issues. The use of insects as infection models provides a valuable alternative. Compared to other non-vertebrate model hosts such as nematodes, insects have a relatively advanced system of antimicrobial defenses and are thus more likely to produce information relevant to the mammalian infection process. Like mammals, insects possess a complex innate immune system(1). Cells in the hemolymph are capable of phagocytosing or encapsulating microbial invaders, and humoral responses include the inducible production of lysozyme and small antibacterial peptides(2,3). In addition, analogies are found between the epithelial cells of insect larval midguts and intestinal cells of mammalian digestive systems. Finally, several basic components essential for the bacterial infection process such as cell adhesion, resistance to antimicrobial peptides, tissue degradation and adaptation to oxidative stress are likely to be important in both insects and mammals(1). Thus, insects are polyvalent tools for the identification and characterization of microbial virulence factors involved in mammalian infections. Larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella have been shown to provide a useful insight into the pathogenesis of a wide range of microbial infections including mammalian fungal (Fusarium oxysporum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans) and bacterial pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes or Enterococcus faecalis(4-7). Regardless of the bacterial species, results obtained with Galleria larvae infected by direct injection through the cuticle consistently correlate with those of similar mammalian studies: bacterial strains that are attenuated in mammalian models demonstrate lower virulence in Galleria, and strains causing severe human infections are also highly virulent in the Galleria model(8-11). Oral infection of Galleria is much less used and additional compounds, like specific toxins, are needed to reach mortality. G. mellonella larvae present several technical advantages: they are relatively large (last instar larvae before pupation are about 2 cm long and weight 250 mg), thus enabling the injection of defined doses of bacteria; they can be reared at various temperatures (20 degrees C to 30 degrees C) and infection studies can be conducted between 15 degrees C to above 37 degrees C(12,13), allowing experiments that mimic a mammalian environment. In addition, insect rearing is easy and relatively cheap. Infection of the larvae allows monitoring bacterial virulence by several means, including calculation of LD50(14), measurement of bacterial survival(15,16) and examination of the infection process(17). Here, we describe the rearing of the insects, covering all life stages of G. mellonella. We provide a detailed protocol of infection by two routes of inoculation: oral and intra haemocoelic. The bacterial model used in this protocol is Bacillus cereus, a Gram positive pathogen implicated in gastrointestinal as well as in other severe local or systemic opportunistic infections(18,19).
TI  - Supramolecular coordination and antimicrobial activities of constructed mixed ligand complexes.
AB  - A novel series of copper(II) and palladium(II) with 4-derivatives benzaldehyde pyrazolone (L(n)) were synthesized. The mixed ligand complexes were prepared by using 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) as second ligand. The structure of these complexes was identified and confirm by elemental analysis, molar conductivity, UV-Vis, IR and (1)H NMR spectroscopy and magnetic moment measurements as well as thermal analysis. The ligand behaves as a neutral bidentate ligand through ON donor sites. ESR spectra show the simultaneous presence of a planar trans and a nearly planar cis isomers in the 1:2 ratio for all N,O complexes [Cu(L(n))(2)]Cl(2)2H(2)O. Schiff bases (L(n)) were tested against bacterial species; namely two Gram positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungal species (Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporium, Penicillium italicum and Alternaria alternata). The tested compounds have antibacterial activity against S. aureus, B. cereus and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Synthesis, pharmacological activity evaluation and molecular modeling of new polynuclear heterocyclic compounds containing benzimidazole derivatives.
AB  - Novel heterocyclic compounds containing benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized from 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) acetonitrile (1) and arylhydrazononitrile derivative 2 was obtained via coupling of 1 with 4-methyl phenyldiazonium salt, which was then reacted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride to give amidooxime derivative 3. This product was cyclized into the corresponding oxadiazole derivative 4 upon reflux in acetic anhydride. Compound 4 was refluxed in DMF in the presence of triethylamine to give the corresponding 5-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)-2-p-tolyl-2H-1,2,3-triazol-4-amine 6. Treatment of compound 6 with ethyl chloroformate afforded 2,6-dihydro-2-(4-methylphenyl)-1,2,3-triazolo[4",5"-4',5']pyrimido[1,6-a]benzimid azole-5(4H)-one (8). 1,2-bis(2-cyanomethyl-1H-benzimidazol-1-yl)ethane-1,2-dione (10) was synthesized via the condensation reaction of 2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl) acetonitrile (1) and diethyloxalate. The reactivity of compound 10 towards some diamine reagents was studied. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the synthesized compounds was investigated against several pathogenic bacterial strains such as Escherichia coli O157, Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli O119, S. paratyphi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus. The results of MIC revealed that compounds 12a-c showed the most effective antimicrobial activity against tested strains. On the other hand, compounds 12a, b exhibited high activity against rotavirus Wa strain while compounds 12b, c exhibited high activity against adenovirus type 7. In silico target prediction, docking and validation of the compounds 12a-c were performed. The dialkylglycine decarboxylase bacterial enzyme was predicted as a potential bacterial target receptor using pharmacophore-based correspondence with previous leads; giving the highest normalized scores and a high correlation docking score with mean inhibition concentrations. A novel binding mechanism was predicted after docking using the MOE software and its validation.
TI  - Antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic studies of total saponin, alkaloid and sterols contents of decoction of Joshanda: identification of components through thin layer chromatography.
AB  - The current study was aimed to assess antibacterial, antioxidant and cytotoxic activity of total saponin, alkaloid and sterol contents of Joshanda decoction followed by its constituent's analysis via thin layer chromatography (TLC). Saponins and alkaloids showed prominent antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella pneumoniae whereas sterols only against S. aureus. Saponin and alkaloid contents of 97 and 108 microg/ml, respectively, showed prominent free radical scavenging activity against 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhidrazyl, with mild cytotoxicity in brine shrimp cytotoxic test. Under ultraviolet light at 254 nm, TLC of total saponins showed eight different compounds, total sterols comprising three while total alkaloids two compounds of various polarities. It is concluded that the various contents of Joshanda decoction possess outstanding susceptibility against bacteria implicating primarily upper respiratory tract infections augmented by strong antioxidant activity.
TI  - Variation in the annual unsatisfactory rates of selected pathogens and indicators in ready-to-eat food sampled from the point of sale or service in Wales, United Kingdom.
AB  - The Welsh Food Microbiological Forum "shopping basket" survey is a long running,  structured surveillance program examining ready-to-eat food randomly sampled from the point of sale or service in Wales, United Kingdom. The annual unsatisfactory rates for selected indicators and pathogens for 1998 through 2008 were examined. All the annual unsatisfactory rates for the selected pathogens were <0.5%, and no pattern with the annual rate was observed. There was also no discernible trend observed for the annual rates of Listeria spp. (not moncytogenes), with all rates <0.5%. However, there was a trend observed for Esherichia coli, with a decrease in rate between 1998 and 2003, rapid in the first few years, and then a gradual increase in rate up to 2008. It was concluded that there was no discernible pattern to the annual unsatisfactory rates for Listeria spp. (not monocytogenes), L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, but that a definite trend had been observed for E. coli.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal and antioxidant activities of the ethanol extract of the stem bark of Clausena heptaphylla.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is wide spread interest in drugs derived from plants as green medicine is believed to be safe and dependable, compared with costly synthetic drugs that have adverse effects. METHODS: We have attempted to evaluate the antioxidant, In vitro thrombolytic, antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic effects of Clausena heptaphylla (Rutaceae) stem bark extract ethanol extract. RESULTS: Ethanolic stem bark extract of Clausena heptaphylla (CHET) contains flavonoids, alkaloids, saponins and steroids but it lacks tannins, anthraquinones and resins. Phenol content of the extract was 13.42 mg/g and flavonoid content was 68.9 mg/g. CHET exhibited significant DPPH free radical scavenging activity with IC50 value of 3.11 mug/ml. Reducing power of CHET was also moderately stronger. In the cytotoxicity assay, LC50 and Chi-square value of the ethanolic extract against brine shrimp nauplii were 144.1461 mug/ml and 0.8533 demonstrating potent cytotoxic effect of the extract. In vitro thrombolytic activity of CHET is significant with 45.38% clot lysis capability compared to that of Streptokinase (65.78%). In antibacterial screening, moderate zone of inhibition (6.5-9.0 mm in diameter) was observed against gram-positive Bacillus subtilis ATCC 11774, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10876, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus polymyxa ATCC 842 and Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13578 and less promising zone of inhibition (3.0-4.5 mm in diameter) against gram-negative Salmonella typhi ATCC 65154, Shigella flexneri ATCC 12022, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 13315 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Shigella sonnei ATCC 8992 did not show any sensitivity. The MIC values against these bacteria were ranged from 2,000 to 3,500 mug/ml. The extract showed significant zone of inhibition against Rhizopus oryzae DSM 2200, Aspergillus niger DSM 737 and Aspergillus ochraceus DSM 824 in antifungal assay. CONCLUSIONS: Further advanced research is necessary to isolate and characterize the chemical components responsible for the therapeutic properties of the plant.
TI  - Probiotic potential of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from Brazilian regional ovine  cheese.
AB  - Twelve Lactobacillus isolates from Brazilian starter-free ovine cheeses were evaluated for their probiotic potential. The strains were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lactobacillus plantarum (7), Lb. brevis (2), Lb. casei (2) and Lb. parabuchneri (1). All strains showed variable resistance to gastric juices and relative tolerance to pancreatin and bile salts. Only five strains of Lb. plantarum could not deconjugate the sodium salt of taurodeoxycholic acid. Autoaggregation ability after 24 h was above 50% and hydrophobicity was higher than 60% for most strains. All lactobacilli could inhibit linolenic acid oxidation, except Lb. parabuchneri strain, whereas none of them could scavenge DPPH radical. beta-Galactosidase activity ranged from 47.7 to 2503 Miller units. Inhibition of food pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium was demonstrated and the production of organic acids could be associated with this effect. The Lactobacillus strains from Brazilian regional ovine cheese showed interesting functional characteristics, mainly the strains Lb. brevis SM-B and Lb. plantarum SM-I. Both presented high acid tolerance. In addition, Lb. brevis SM-B also displayed remarkable antioxidant activity and Lb. plantarum SM-I was the highest beta-galactosidase producer, exhibited high autoaggregation and hydrophobicity properties.
TI  - Design, structural and spectroscopic elucidation, and the in vitro biological activities of new diorganotin dithiocarbamates.
AB  - The reaction of 2,2-dimethoxy-N-methylethyllamine or 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane with  CS(2) in alkaline media produced two novel dithiocarbamate salts. Subsequent reactions with organotin halides yielded six new complexes: [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (1), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (2), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(1))(2)}(2)] (3), [SnMe(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (4), [Sn(n-Bu)(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (5), [SnPh(2){S(2)CNR(R(2))(2)}(2)] (6), where R = methyl, R(1) = CH(2)CH(OMe)(2), and R(2) = 2-methyl-1,3-dioxolane. All compounds were identified in terms of infrared, (1)H and (13)C NMR, and the complexes were also characterized using (119)Sn NMR, (119)Sn Mossbauer and X-ray crystallography. The biological activity of all derivatives has been screened in terms of IC(90) and IC(50) against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Penicillium citrinum, Curvularia senegalensis, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella typhimurium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the results correlated well with a performed study of structure-activity relationship (SAR). Complexes (3), (5) and (6) displayed the best IC(90) and IC(50) in the presence of the fungi, greater than that of miconazole, used as control drug.
TI  - Essential oil variation in the populations of Artemisia spicigera from northwest  of Iran: chemical composition and antibacterial activity.
AB  - CONTEXT: Artemisia spicigera C. Koch (Asteraceae) is a perennial shrubby herb and is generally distributed in Armenia, Iran, and Middle Anatolia. This species traditionally has been used in medicines. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this research is to study the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Artemisia spicigera populations in northwest of Iran. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The essential oil of A. spicigera was obtained by hydrodistillation from eight populations collected from different regions of East Azerbaijan and West Azerbaijan provinces (Iran) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antibacterial activity of the oils was investigated against four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria using MIC determinations and the agar-gel diffusion method. RESULTS: Fourteen compounds were identified as the main components of the essential oils and the most abundant constituents are 1,8-cineole, camphor, alpha-thujone, camphene, beta-thujone and p-cymene. Essential oil of population No. 1 showed the highest activity against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Serratia marcescens and Staphylococcus aureus but the highest activity against St. saprophyticus, Bacillus megaterium, and B. cereus was found with population No. 6 and for Citrobacter amalonaficus with population No. 5. MIC values of essential oils ranged from 6 microg/mL against Bacillus megaterium to 12 microg/mL against Citrobacter amalonaficus. DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates the occurrence of 1,8-cineole/camphor/camphene chemotype of A. spicigera but there is also significant chemical variation between the studied populations. The findings showed the studied oils have good antibacterial activity, and thus potential to be used as natural health products.
TI  - Bacterial quorum sensing: its role in virulence and possibilities for its control.
AB  - Quorum sensing is a process of cell-cell communication that allows bacteria to share information about cell density and adjust gene expression accordingly. This process enables bacteria to express energetically expensive processes as a collective only when the impact of those processes on the environment or on a host will be maximized. Among the many traits controlled by quorum sensing is the expression of virulence factors by pathogenic bacteria. Here we review the quorum-sensing circuits of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio cholerae. We outline these canonical quorum-sensing mechanisms and how each uniquely controls virulence factor production. Additionally, we examine recent efforts to inhibit quorum sensing in these pathogens with the goal of designing novel antimicrobial therapeutics.
TI  - Synthesis of quinoline derivatives of tetrahydrocurcumin and zingerone and evaluation of their antioxidant and antibacterial attributes.
AB  - Tetrahydrocurcumin (THC, 1) and zingerone (2) are biologically active molecules originating from the important spices turmeric and ginger, respectively. Novel quinoline derivatives of THC and zingerone have been synthesised by an efficient protocol involving their reaction with substituted 2-aminobenzophenones and 2-aminoacetophenone. Radical-scavenging activities (RSA) of THC, zingerone and their quinoline derivatives were evaluated. The amino-substituted quinoline derivative of THC, 1e, showed antioxidant activity superior to those of 1 and 1a. Derivatives 1b, 1c, 1d and 1f exhibited relatively lower RSA at equimolar concentrations ( approximately 50-55 mumol). A similar trend was also seen in zingerone (2) and its derivatives (2a-2e), with 2e displaying the best RSA. Derivatives of THC (1a-1f) showed stronger antimicrobial activity than THC (1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Also, derivatives of zingerone (2b-2e) exhibited lower minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values than zingerone (2) and its derivative, 2a for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The molecules may have potential pharmacological applications.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of ellagitannins from Acalypha wilkesiana var. macafeana hort.: surface morphology analysis with environmental scanning electron microscopy and synergy with antibiotics.
AB  - The present study served to gain further insight into the bactericidal effects of ellagitannins from Acalypha wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. against pathogenic bacteria. Ellagitannins from the aerial parts of A. wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. (EAW) inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Bacillus subtilis (ATCC 6633), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 11632) and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical strain with inhibition zones equal to 11.01 +/- 1.53 mm, 16.63 +/- 0.11 mm, 11.40 +/- 1.10 mm and 8.22 +/- 0.19 mm, respectively. The minimal inhibition concentration and the minimal bactericidal concentration of ellagitannins from A. wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. (EAW) against MRSA were 750 microg/mL and 3000 microg/mL, respectively. We then examined the synergistic effect of EAW with three antibiotics, i.e. ampicillin, streptomycin and tetracycline, via the checkerboard assay and time-kill assay and observed that EAW is synergistic with ampicillin against S. aureus (ATCC 11632). Environmental electron scanning microscopy analysis showed cell lysis against S. aureus (ATCC 11632) upon treatment with the ellagitannin fraction. The ellagitannin fraction from A. wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. is bactericidal against gram-positive bacteria tested and works synergistically with ampicillin against S. aureus. Morphology analysis of the cell suggests that the bactericidal property of the ellagitannin fraction mechanism involves lysis of the cell wall. In summary, our studies demonstrate that A. wilkesiana var. macafeana hort. produces bactericidal ellagitannins of clinical and/or cosmetological value.
TI  - Rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using GreenLight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria innocua) were analysed. For each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. Analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. CONCLUSION: The microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.
TI  - Chemical composition and antioxidative activity of Echinophora platyloba DC. essential oil, and its interaction with natural antimicrobials against food-borne pathogens and spoilage organisms.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the chemical composition and antioxidative capacity of Echinophora platyloba DC. essential oil, and its antimicrobial potency against Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Rhodotorula rubra, and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. The essential oil was analyzed by GC and GC-MS; and evaluated for its antioxidative and antimicrobial (singly or in combination with chitosan, nisin, monolaurin, or amphotericin B) activity. Thirty-three components were characterized representing 95.69% of the total oil composition in which thymol, trans-ocimene, carvacrol, and (E)-sesqui-lavandulol were the major constituents. The oil exhibited high scavenging (IC(50): 49.7 +/- 2.3 mug/mL) and relative antioxidative activity (RAA%: 85.21 +/- 0.4) in 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radicals and beta-carotene/linoleic acid bleaching assays, respectively. The oil showed antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes, B. cereus, B. subtilis, S. aureus, S. typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, C. tropicalis, R. Rubra, and R. mucilaginosa. Moreover, R. mucilaginosa and P. aeruginosa were the most susceptible and most resistant organisms, respectively. Regarding the checkerboard data, 47 fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICIs) (</= 0.5) indicated synergistic, whereas 7 FICIs (>0.5 to 1) indicated additive effect. Consequently, E. platyloba DC. essential oil could be used as a recommended natural antioxidant and antimicrobial substance for food preservation.
TI  - Postprocessing microflora of commercial attieke (a fermented cassava product) produced in the south of Cote d'Ivoire.
AB  - The distribution and presence of hygiene indicator and pathogenic micro-organisms in 375 samples of attieke marketed in Cote d'Ivoire, and their roles in the food poisoning were evaluated. Microbiological analyses were carried out, which included the total viable bacteria, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus spores, fungi and Clostridium perfringens. The results revealed that the viable bacteria counts ranged from 2.2 +/- 1.2 x 10(5) to 3.4 +/- 1.4 x 10(6) CFU g(-1), while the yeasts and the moulds counts ranged, respectively, from 2.4 +/- 0.12 x 10(4) to 9.8 +/- 0.4 x 10(5) CFU g(-1) and 1.3 +/- 0.7 x 10(1) to 1.7 +/- 0.7 x 10(2) CFU g(-1). Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundi, Enterobacter amnigenus, Citrobacter youngae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter agglomerans and Klebsiella oxytoca were the bacteria isolated, and Rhizopus spp., Mucor spp., Thamnidium spp., Fusarium spp., Moniliella spp. the fungi. Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not found. The occurrence of some bacteria and fungi illustrate that attieke collected in Cote d'Ivoire markets may act as a reservoir of pathogenic micro-organisms for human. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently on attieke and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system during the production. Attieke is especially a well-known product in West Africa; hence, it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health. Overall, the study highlighted the need for effective communication on microbiological food risks, proper instruction and supervision in food-handling procedures, greater education on food safety risks.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of Salvia x jamensis essential oil.
AB  - This is the first report about the composition of the essential oil of Salvia x jamensis. The major compounds identified by GC-MS were beta-caryophyllene (14.8 %), beta-pinene (6.8 %), caryophyllene oxide (6.0 %), delta-cadinene (5.5 %), alpha-pinene (5.2 %) and spatulenol (5.2 %). The oil showed antimicrobial activity against three Gram (+) bacteria: Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S. epidermidis, and three Candida strains: C. albicans, C. glabrata and C. tropicalis, while it was inactive against three Gram (-) bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Changes in microbial contamination levels and prevalence of foodborne pathogens in alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) during sprout production in manufacturing plants.
AB  - Samples were taken from three sprout processing plants at five different stages of production (a total of 20 investigations). Quantitative analyses comprised aerobic plate counts (APCs) and the measurement of coliforms and Bacillus cereus levels, whereas qualitative analyses involved assessing the levels of Escherichia coli and major foodborne pathogens (E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus). The APC for alfalfa seeds (3.71-4.61 log CFU g(-1)) and rapeseed (4.25-5.11 log CFU g(-1)) increased by approximately 3 log CFU g(-1) during sprouting, reaching 7.17-7.61 and 7.33-8.28 log CFU g(-1), respectively, by the final stage of production. Similarly, increasing trends were noted in the level of coliforms (0.58-4.03 log CFU g(-1) at the seed stage, increasing to 5.52-6.99 log CFU g(-1) by the sprout stage). Bacillus cereus was detected in eight alfalfa (40%) and 14 rapeseed (70%) sprouts, and L. monocytogenes was isolated from one pregermination soaked alfalfa seed. A slight reduction in the level of bacterial contamination was noted after washing the sprouts with water prior to storage, indicating that improvements to the current washing protocol, or other efficient intervention methods, may be needed. Taken together, these results suggest that improved hygiene control during production and processing and a more sanitary environment are needed. The present study provides comprehensive information regarding the microbiological safety of seeds and sprouts during manufacturing. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: The present study investigated the levels of microbial contamination present in alfalfa and rapeseed sprouts by examining the samples taken at different stages of the manufacturing process in three actual plants. The results provide detailed information regarding the levels of seed and sprout contamination during production. The results may be useful to those involved in the sprout industry and/or academic research in terms of developing hygienic control measures, efficient intervention methods and appropriate guidelines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and composition profile of grape (Vitis vinifera) pomace extracts obtained by supercritical fluids.
AB  - The possibility of increasing the aggregated value of the huge amount of residues generated by wineries around the world foment studies using the grape pomace - the residue from the wine production, composed by seed, skin and stems - to obtain functional ingredients. Nowadays, consumers in general prefer natural and safe products mainly for food and cosmetic fields, where the supercritical fluid extraction is of great importance due to the purity of the extracts provided. Therefore, the objective of this work is to evaluate the global extraction yield, the antimicrobial activity and the composition profile of Merlot and Syrah grape pomace extracts obtained by supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) and CO2 added with co-solvent at pressures up to 300 bar and temperatures of 50 and 60 degrees C. The results were compared with the ones obtained by Soxhlet and by ultrasound-assisted leaching extraction methods. The main components from the extracts, identified by HPLC, were gallic acid, p-OH-benzoic acid, vanillic acid and epicatechin. The antibacterial and antifungal activities of the extracts were evaluated using four strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and three fungi strains (Candida albicans, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei). Despite lower extraction yield results, the supercritical fluid extracts presented the highest antimicrobial effectiveness compared to the other grape pomace extracts due to the presence of antimicrobial active compounds. Syrah extracts were less efficient against the microorganisms tested and Merlot extracts were more active against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis of bacillithiol and the catalytic selectivity of FosB-type fosfomycin resistance proteins.
AB  - Bacillithiol (BSH) has been prepared on the gram scale from the inexpensive starting material, D-glucosamine hydrochloride, in 11 steps and 8-9% overall yield. The BSH was used to survey the substrate and metal-ion selectivity of FosB enzymes from four Gram-positive microorganisms associated with the deactivation of the antibiotic fosfomycin. The in vitro results indicate that the preferred thiol substrate and metal ion for the FosB from Staphylococcus aureus are BSH and Ni(II), respectively. However, the metal-ion selectivity is less distinct with FosB from Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus anthracis, or Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented Manzanilla Alorena green table olives.
AB  - Manzanilla Alorena (or Alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (DOP). The aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. A collection of 144 LAB obtained from Alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (SMEs) from Malaga (Spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. REP-PCR clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different SMEs were Lactobacillus pentosus. Pediococci were identified as Pediococcus parvulus (SME1) and leuconostocs as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (SME1 and SME4). Genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. Some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans and Salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees C and in the presence of 6.5% NaCl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. However, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. On the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low pH and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.
TI  - Comparison of sample preparation methods for the recovery of foodborne pathogens  from fresh produce.
AB  - Sample preparation methods (pummeling, pulsifying, sonication, and shaking by hand) were compared for achieving maximum recovery of foodborne pathogens from iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, green pepper, and cherry tomato. Antimicrobial and dehydration effects also were examined to investigate causes of poor recovery of pathogens. Each produce type was inoculated with Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus at 6.0 log CFU/cm(2), and samples were prepared using the four methods. Bacterial populations recovered from the five types of produce were significantly different (P < 0.05) according to sample preparation methods and produce type. The bacterial populations recovered from pummeled and pulsified samples were higher (P < 0.05) than those recovered from sonicated and hand-shaken samples, except for cherry tomato. The number of bacteria recovered from produce was reduced (P < 0.05) from that of the inoculum by 0.16 to 2.69 log CFU/cm(2). Although extracts of iceberg lettuce, perilla leaves, cucumber, and green pepper had no antimicrobial activity, the populations of E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, B. cereus, and L. monocytogenes in cherry tomato extract were slightly reduced after these treatments (P < 0.05). The pathogen populations on perilla leaves and cherry tomatoes decreased by >2 log CFU/cm(2) after exposure to 40% relative humidity for 1 h. No reduction was observed when the five pathogens were exposed to 90% relative humidity. These data suggest that pummeling and pulsifying are optimal sample preparation methods for detection of microorganisms. Acidic produce such as cherry tomato should be treated with a method that does not cause sample breakdown so that acid stress on the bacteria can be minimized. Dehydration stress also affects recovery of pathogens from produce.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - Influence of substituent effects on spectroscopic properties and antimicrobial activity of 5-(4'-substituted phenylazo)-2-thioxothiazolidinone derivatives.
AB  - 5-(4'-substituted phenylazo)-2-thioxothiazolidinone derivatives (HL(n)) have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, spectra (IR, electronic and (1)H NMR). The IR spectral data indicate that the compounds can exist in two resonance structures. The synthesized ligands were screened for their antimicrobial activity against four bacterial species, two Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) as well as against some species various of fungi; Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium italicum and Fusarium oxysporium. The results showed that most these ligands are good antibacterial agents against B. cereus and S. aureus and antifungal agents against A. niger and F. oxysporium. HL(3) was found to be the most effect compound against all tested microorganisms. The size of clear zone were ordered as follows p-(OCH(3) < CH(3) < H < Cl < NO(2)) as expected from Hammett's constant sigma(R).
TI  - Bio-based nanoemulsion formulation, characterization and antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens.
AB  - The current study deals with the formulation and characterization of bio-based oil in water nanoemulsion and its potential antibacterial activity. A typical v/v% of eucalyptus oil (16.66%), Tween 80 (16.66%), and water (68.68%) was prepared by ultrasonication method. The mean droplet size was 17.1 nm as confirmed by dynamic light scattering. Different concentrations of the formulation ranging from undiluted to 10-, 100-, and 1000-fold dilutions were used to check the antibacterial activity in three different microorganisms, namely, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive), and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative). All three species showed a 100% bactericidal at the 10-fold dilution of the nanoemulsion formulation in the following order: B. cereus at 0th min, S. aureus at 15 min and E. coli at 1 h, respectively. A 10-fold dilution of the nanoemulsion showed that, the cytoplasmic content leakage from the bacterial species was high for S. aureus when compared to B. cereus and E. coli as determined by UV-Vis spectroscopic method. Fluorescence microscopic technique further confirmed this study.
TI  - [The changes of ocular bacterial isolates and in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility in the past six years].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the changes of ocular bacterial isolates and their susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin and tobramycin in Henan Province in the past six years. METHODS: Retrospective study of ocular bacterial isolates and their in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility test results of Henan Eye Institute in the past six years. RESULTS: A total of 2044 bacterial isolates were classified into 39 kinds in the past six years, which were mainly from the conjunctival sac. Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. All kinds of the ocular bacteria had the highest susceptibility to gatifloxacin (92.3%) among the tested drugs. Rods were more sensitive to quinolone drugs than cocci and gram-positive rods were more sensitive to tobramycin than the other types of germs. The drug's susceptibility of the four kinds of quinolone except ciprofloxacin decreased year by year with a decreasing ladder fashion every two years in the susceptibility change of levofloxacin in the past six years, while the susceptibility of tobramycin increased slowly from 2004 to 2008 and then decreased. Staphylococcus epidermidis susceptibility to every drug had the similar trend with the general changes in the past six years, that is, their susceptibility to ofloxacin decreased significantly since 2008, their susceptibility to gatifloxacin and tobramycin reduced significantly in 2009. Although Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptibility to all the drugs had no significant change, for all gram-negative rods, their susceptibility to the four kinds of quinolone drugs were higher than their susceptibility to tobramycin while their susceptibility to levofloxacin and gatifloxacin reduced significantly as time passed by, especially from the year 2008 to 2009. CONCLUSIONS: The most common ocular bacterial isolates were Staphylococcus epidermidis, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ocular bacterial isolates' susceptibility to gatifloxacin in vitro was significantly higher than to other drugs in every year but decreased significantly in 2009 while their susceptibility to ofloxacin and levofloxacin decreased significantly since 2008. Their susceptibility to tobramycin increased slowly from 2004 to 2008 and then decreased.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of phosphates and polyphosphates with different chain length.
AB  - The aim of this study was to monitor the antibacterial effect of seven phosphate  salts on selected strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, which could be considered responsible for food-borne diseases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella enterica ser. Enteritidis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For these purposes, phosphates differing in chain length were used. The tested concentrations were in the range of 0.1-2.0% (wt v(-1)) applied at the model conditions. In the majority of cases the visible inhibitory effect on the growth of observed microorganisms could be seen. Due to the chemical structure of salts and their dissociation both the pH values of cultivation broth and similarly the growth characteristics of bacterial strains were affected. The inhibition of above mentioned bacteria was apparently supported by this dissociation. Phosphates obviously made the development of most Gram-positive bacteria impossible. Especially Micrococcus luteus was extremely sensitive to the presence of these substances. On the other hand, Gram-negative bacteria seemed to be resistant to the phosphate incidence. The exemption clause from the tested salts was represented by a high alkaline trisodium phosphate. It should be pointed out that generally the most significant antibacterial effects were shown by polyphosphates HEXA68 and HEXA70, trisodium phosphate undecahydrate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate and finally trisodium phosphate. By comparing the inhibitory effects of various phosphate salts can be concluded that the antibacterial activity was not determined only by the condensation degree but there was also proved the dependence on pH values.
TI  - Chemical composition, antibacterial and antifungal activities of essential oil from Cordia verbenacea DC leaves.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cordia verbenacea is a Brazilian coastal shrub popularly known as "erva baleeira". The essential oil from fresh leaves was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by CG/MS. The main components were identified as beta-caryophyllene (25.4%), bicyclogermacrene (11.3%), delta-cadinene (9.%) and alpha-pinene (9.5%). In this study, the antimicrobial activity of Cordia verbenacea was evaluated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the essential oil was obtained using the broth microdilution assay (from 512 to 8 mug/ml). RESULTS: The results showed that the essential oil presented fungistatic activity against Candida albicans and Candida krusei and antibacterial activity against Gram-positive strains (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and against multiresistant Gram-negative (Escherichia coli 27), in all tests the MIC was 64 mug/ml. When the essential oil was associated to aminoglycosides (subinhibitory concentrations, MIC/8), a synergic and antagonic activity was verified. The synergic effect was observed to the amikacin association (MIC reduction from 256 mlto 64 mug/ml) in all strains tested. CONCLUSION: The essential oil of Cordia verbenacea influences the activity of antibiotics and may be used as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy against respiratory tract bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Linum pubescens growing wild in Jordan.
AB  - The volatile constituents of the aerial flowering parts of Linum pubescens were collected by hydro-distillation and analysed by GC and GC/MS. Analysis allowed the identification of 68 components of which, geranyl isovalerate (18.93%), lauric acid (12.07%), germacrene D (10.61%), decanoic acid (8.07%), 6,10,14-trimethyl-2-pentadecanone (5.02%) and 1-hexanol (4.99%) were detected as major constituents. The isolated essential oil of the plant exhibited high antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus ATCC11778, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 2923) and showed moderate antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 13048 and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 10031).
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two novel antibacterial cyclic hexapeptides from Streptomyces alboflavus 313.
AB  - Two novel cyclic hexapeptides, designated NW-G08 (1) and NW-G09 (2), were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces alboflavus 313. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis, MS experiments, and chemical analysis. Their antibacterial activities against several strains of bacteria were evaluated by micro-broth dilution method. NW-G08 (1) and NW-G09 (2) were highly antibacterial against Gram-positive but not active against Gram-negative bactaria. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 1 against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus were 6.25, 6.25, and 1.56 mug/ml, respectively. It is worth noting that 1 and 2 exhibited much higher activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) than ampicillin, which implies that they might be potential candidates for the development of novel drugs against resistant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Exposure to Anacardiaceae volatile oils and their constituents induces lipid peroxidation within food-borne bacteria cells.
AB  - The chemical composition of the volatile oils from five Anacardiaceae species and their activities against Gram positive and negative bacteria were assessed. The peroxidative damage within bacterial cell membranes was determined through the breakdown product malondialdehyde (MDA). The major constituents in Anacardium humile leaves oil were (E)-caryophyllene (31.0%) and alpha-pinene (22.0%), and in Anacardium occidentale oil they were (E)-caryophyllene (15.4%) and germacrene-D (11.5%). Volatile oil from Astronium fraxinifolium leaves were dominated by (E)-beta-ocimene (44.1%) and alpha-terpinolene (15.2%), whilst the oil from Myracrodruon urundeuva contained an abundance of delta-3-carene (78.8%). However, Schinus terebinthifolius leaves oil collected in March and July presented different chemical compositions. The oils from all species, except the one from A. occidentale, exhibited varying levels of antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Oil extracted in July from S. terebinthifolius was more active against all bacterial strains than the corresponding oil extracted in March. The high antibacterial activity of the M. urundeuva oil could be ascribed to its high delta-3-carene content. The amounts of MDA generated within bacterial cells indicate that the volatile oils induce lipid peroxidation. The results suggest that one putative mechanism of antibacterial action of these volatile oils is pro-oxidant damage within bacterial cell membrane explaining in part their preservative properties.
TI  - Preparation, stability and antimicrobial activity of cationic cross-linked starch-iodine complexes.
AB  - Cationic cross-linked starch (CCS)-iodine complexes containing different amounts  of quaternary ammonium groups (different degrees of substitution (DS)) and iodine have been obtained by iodine adsorption on CCS from aqueous iodine potassium iodide solution. Equilibrium adsorption studies showed that with an increase of DS the amount of iodine adsorbed on CCS and the affinity of iodine to CCS increased linearly. The influences of the DS of CCS and the amount of adsorbed iodine on the stability of CCS-iodine complexes in a solution of 0.02M sodium acetate and reactivity toward l-tyrosine have been investigated. At the same DS, the stability of CCS-iodine complexes decreased with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. With increasing the DS, the stability of CCS-iodine complexes increased. The iodine consumption in the reaction with l-tyrosine increased significantly with an increase of the amount of adsorbed iodine. The influence of DS on iodine consumption was lower and depended on the amount of adsorbed iodine. The antibacterial activity of CCS-iodine complexes against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli was determined by the broth-dilution and spread-plate methods. The obtained results have demonstrated that an appropriate selection of the CCS-iodine complex composition (the DS of CCS and the amount of adsorbed iodine) could ensure good antimicrobial properties by keeping a low concentration of free iodine in the system. The main advantage of using CCS-iodine complexes as antimicrobial agents is the biodegradability of the polymeric matrix.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bioactive compounds and leaf extracts in Jatropha tanjorensis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Jatropha tanjorensis was investigated scientifically to generate evidence for the efficacies reported in traditional systems and the results are given here. METHODS: Different concentrations of the solvent extracts of leaves and four isolated compounds were tested against human pathogenic microorganisms such as gram-positive bacteria of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, gram-negative bacteria of Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella paratyphi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Vibrio alcaligenes, Vibrio cholerae and fungi of Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans, Microsporum gypseum and Trichophyton rubrum by agar-well diffusion and disk diffusion methods. RESULTS: In agar-well diffusion method, maximum activity was recorded in a concentration-dependent manner. The extracts recorded activity against bacteria such as 17-26, 15-25 and 13-24 mm to methanol extract and 15-24, 14-23 and 12-22 mm to chloroform extract at 50, 25 and 12.5 mg/ml respectively and fungi such as 9-15 mm to A. fumigatus and 5-16 mm to T. rubrum. Maximum activity was 30-46, 27-43 and 17-40 mm to friedelin and 23-46, 28-44 and 18-41 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against bacteria and 12-37, 8-34 and 31-33 mm to friedelin and 12-40, 11-35 and 10-33 mm to R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone against fungi at 10, 5 and 2.5mg respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The present study concludes that friedelin, beta-amyrin, stigmasterol and R (+) 4-hydroxy-2-pyrrolidinone present in the methanol extract could be responsible for the broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity and provide scientific evidence.
TI  - The constituents of essential oil: antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. from East Anatolia.
AB  - The chemical composition, antimicrobial activity, total phenol content, total antioxidant activity, and total oxidant status of the essential oil from Micromeria congesta Boiss. & Hausskn. ex Boiss. were investigated. Steam distillation was used to obtain the essential oil, and the chemical analyses were performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The antimicrobial activity was tested by an agar disc diffusion method against the tested microorganisms: Bacillus subtilis NRRL B-744, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12598, S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. aureus ATCC 25933, Escherichia coli 0157H7, E. coli ATCC25922, Micrococcus luteus NRLL B-4375, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Proteus vulgaris RSKK 96026, and Yersinia enterecolitica RSKK 1501. The major compounds found in volatiles of M. congesta were piperitone oxide, linalool oxide, veratrole, pulegone, dihydro carvone, naphthalene, iso-menthone, para-menthone, and cyclohexanone. Compared to that of reference antibiotics, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil is considered as significant. Results showed that M. congesta has the potential for being used in food and medicine depending on its antioxidant and antibacterial activity.
TI  - Manduca sexta gloverin binds microbial components and is active against bacteria  and fungi.
AB  - Hyalophora gloveri gloverin is a glycine-rich and heat stable antimicrobial protein with activity mainly against Escherichia coli. However, Spodoptera exigua gloverin is active against a Gram-positive bacterium but inactive against E. coli. In this study, we investigated expression profile, binding ability and antimicrobial activity of Manduca sexta gloverin (MsGlv). Msglv transcript was detected in several tissues of naive larvae with higher levels in the midgut and testis. Expression of Msglv mRNA in larvae was up-regulated by active Spatzle-C108 and peptidoglycans (PGs) of E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus, and the activation was blocked by pre-injection of antibody to M. sexta Toll, suggesting that Msglv expression is regulated by the Toll-Spatzle pathway. Recombinant MsGlv bound to the O-specific antigen and outer core carbohydrate of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Gram-positive lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and PG, and laminarin, but not to E. coli PG or mannan. MsGlv was active against Bacillus cereus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Cryptococcus neoformans, but was almost inactive against E. coli and S. aureus. Our results suggest that gloverins are active against some bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Modulation of cell surface hydrophobicity and attachment of bacteria to abiotic surfaces and shrimp by Malaysian herb extracts.
AB  - The use of simple crude water extracts of common herbs to reduce bacterial attachment may be a cost-effective way to control bacterial foodborne pathogens, particularly in developing countries. The ability of water extracts of three common Malaysian herbs (Andrographis paniculata, Eurycoma longifolia, and Garcinia atroviridis) to modulate hydrophobicity and attachment to surfaces of five food-related bacterial strains (Bacillus cereus ATCC 14576, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145, Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923) were determined. The bacterial attachment to hydrocarbon assay was used to determine bacterial hydrophobicity. Staining and direct microscopic counts were used to determine attachment of bacteria to glass and stainless steel. Plating on selective media was used to determine attachment of bacteria to shrimp. All extracts were capable of either significantly ( P < 0.05) increasing or decreasing bacterial surface hydrophobicity, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Bacterial attachment to all surfaces was either significantly (P < 0.05) increased or decreased, depending on the herb extract and bacteria combination. Overall, hydrophobicity did not show a significant correlation (P > 0.05) to bacterial attachment. For specific combinations of bacteria, surface material, and plant extract, significant correlations (R > 0.80) between hydrophobicity and attachment were observed. The highest of these was observed for S. aureus attachment to stainless steel and glass after treatment with the E. longifolia extract (R = 0.99, P < 0.01). The crude water herb extracts in this study were shown to have the potential to modulate specific bacterial and surface interactions and may, with further work, be useful for the simple and practical control of foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Detection and enumeration of four foodborne pathogens in raw commingled silo milk in the United States.
AB  - A nationwide survey was conducted to obtain qualitative and quantitative data on  bacterial contamination of raw commingled silo milk intended for pasteurization. The levels of total aerobic bacteria, total coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined using the TEMPO system. The prevalence rates and levels of presumptive Bacillus cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella spp. were determined in 214 samples. B. cereus was detected in 8.91% of samples, at 3.0 to 93 CFU/ml. E. coli O157:H7 was detected in 3.79 to 9.05% of samples, at <0.0055 to 1.1 CFU/ml, depending on the assay utilized. Salmonella spp. were recovered from 21.96 to 57.94% of samples, at <0.0055 to 60 CFU/ml. L. monocytogenes was detected in 50.00% of samples, at <0.0055 to 30 CFU/ml. The average log-transformed counts of total viable bacteria were slightly lower in samples containing no pathogens. No correlation was observed between the levels of organisms detected with the TEMPO system and the presence or levels of any pathogen except E. coli O157:H7. A higher average log-transformed count of total viable bacteria was observed in samples positive for this organism. The high prevalence rates of target pathogens may be attributed to a variety of factors, including detection methods, sample size, and commingling of the milk in the silo. The effects of commingling likely contributed to the high prevalence rates and low levels of target pathogens because of the inclusion of milk from multiple bulk tanks. The high prevalence rates also may be the result of analysis of larger sample volumes using more sensitive detection methods. These quantitative data could be utilized to perform more accurate risk assessments and to better estimate the appropriate level of protection for dairy products and processing technologies.
TI  - Prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in food samples associated with foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada from 2007 to 2010.
AB  - Consumption of foods containing Staphylococcus aureus can cause severe gastro-intestinal illness. Given the fact that over the past decade, Canada has seen increasing rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) carriage and infection, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA on foodborne illness in Alberta, Canada. Between January 2007 and December 2010, there were 693 food samples associated with foodborne investigations submitted to the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab). These foods were screened for: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, S. aureus, Aeromonas spp., Campylobacter spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Shigella spp., and Yersinia spp. S. aureus was identified in 10.5% (73/693) of samples, and of these, 59% (43/73) were co-contaminated with at least one other organism on the screening panel. The S. aureus positive samples included 29 meat, 20 prepared foods containing meat, 11 prepared foods not containing meat, 10 dairy, and three produce. Methicillin-resistance was not detected in any isolates tested. These findings indicate that the presence of S. aureus in food associated with foodborne investigations is a cause for concern, and although MRSA was not found, the potential for outbreaks exists, and ongoing surveillance should be sustained.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of dextran stabilized silver nanoparticles in aqueous medium.
AB  - A simple one-step rapid synthetic route is described for the preparation of silver nanoparticles by reduction of silver nitrate (AgNO3) using aqueous dextran solution which acts as both reducing and capping agent. The formation of silver nanoparticles is assured by characterization with UV-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The absorbance of the silver nanoparticles is observed at 423 nm. The AFM image clearly shows the surface morphology of the well-dispersed silver nanoparticles with size range of 10-60 nm. TEM images show that the nanoparticles are spherical in shape with approximately 5-10 nm dimensions. The crystallinity of Ag nanoparticles is assured by XRD analysis. The antimicrobial activity of as synthesized silver nanoparticles is tested against the bacteria, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The bacterial growth is inhibited by gradual reduction of the concentration of the silver nanoparticles.
TI  - A broad-range method to detect genomic DNA of multiple pathogenic bacteria based  on the aggregation strategy of gold nanorods.
AB  - It remains challenging to detect unknown pathogenic bacteria in diagnostic, clinical and environmental fields. This work describes the approach to the development of a sensitive, broad-range genosensing assay targeting the conserved 16S rDNA region existing in most bacteria, by monitoring the aggregation level of gold nanorods (GNRs)-based nanoprobes through their localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) property. In the quantitative detection of artificial sequence, the limit of detection (LOD) of such a bioassay is demonstrated to reach the 5 pM level. This pair of universal GNRs-based nanoprobes can further identify at least 6 species of bacteria that were most prevalent in platelet concentrates (PCs) and have no cross-reaction with other pathogens. Moreover, it also exhibits higher sensitivity than other broad-range methods in analysing Serratia marcescens-spiked PCs. Therefore, the presented strategy not only provides a novel and effective DNA analysis method to detect multiple bacterial contaminations in PCs, but also opens up possibilities for its future use of detecting unknown bacteria in other systems, such as food and water, even at ultralow levels.
TI  - [Diversity and antimicrobial activities of actinomycetes from pesticide-contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In order to study diversity and find antimicrobial activities of actinomycetes from pesticide-contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula. METHODS: The phylogenetic analysis of 154 isolated strains was done based on 16SrDNA sequences. Antimicrobial activities of 10 non-Streptomyces strains were tested by using cylinder-plate method and hypha growth rate method. RESULTS: Among the strains, 154 strains belonged to 7 families, 8 genera: Streptomyces (87.01%), Kocuria, Microbacterium, Nocardiopsis, Knoellia, Pseudonocardia, Micromonospora, Actinoplanes. The fermentation broths of 10 non-Streptomyces strains had inhibitory actives against all tested phytopathogenic fungi (Botrytis cinerea, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, Gibberella zeae, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Colletotrichum gloesporioides) and bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtills, Bacillus cereus, Escherichai coli, Pseudomonas aeruginos) , especially Microbacterium oxydans JN853773 and Kocuria rosea JN192402 had strong inhibitory effects. CONCLUSION: Abundant diversity of actinomycetes existed in pesticide contaminated spots in Shandong Peninsula. Microbacterium oxydans JN853773 and Kocuria rosea JN192402 showed high antimicrobial activities and could be further exploited.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Pseudoalteromonas in the coral holobiont.
AB  - Corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic populations. Bacterial communities residing in the coral mucus layer may be either pathogenic or symbiotic. Some species may produce antibiotics as a method of controlling populations of competing microbial species. The present study characterizes cultivable Pseudoalteromonas sp. isolated from the mucus layer of different coral species from the northern Gulf of Eilat, Red Sea, Israel. Six mucus-associated Pseudoalteromonas spp. obtained from different coral species were screened for antibacterial activity against 23 tester strains. Five of the six Pseudoalteromonas strains demonstrated extracellular antibacterial activity against Gram-positive-but not Gram-negative-tester strains. Active substances secreted into the cell-free supernatant are heat-tolerant and inhibit growth of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and of ten endogenous Gram-positive marine bacteria isolated from corals. The Pseudoalteromonas spp. isolated from Red sea corals aligned in a phylogenetic tree with previously isolated Pseudoalteromonas spp. of marine origin that demonstrated antimicrobial activity. These results suggest that coral mucus-associated Pseudoalteromonas may play a protective role in the coral holobiont's defense against potential Gram-positive coral pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological analysis of stuffed mussels sold in the streets.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food that sold by street venders in various countries. In the present study, samples of stuffed mussels were collected from various places in Ankara. The mussels were analyzed to show the microbiological risks for human health. Thirty samples (600 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Clostridium sp. In terms of Salmonella sp., approximately 50% of samples were not suitable for consumption. Besides, in accordance with Turkish Food Codex Microbiological Criteria Announcement in terms of E. coli 30%, in terms of B. cereus 80%, in terms of S. aureus 76.6%, in terms of Clostridium perfringens 13.3% of these samples were not suitable for consumption. The aim of this study is to discuss the microbiological quality of stuffed mussels as a ready-to-eat food according to Turkish Food Codex (TFC). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance and probiotic properties of dominant lactic microflora from Tungrymbai, an ethnic fermented soybean food of India.
AB  - The present investigation was conducted to assess lactic acid bacteria present in traditionally fermented food of ethnic tribes in India for probiotic properties, antibacterial activity, and antibiotic tolerance behavior. Enterococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp., and Lactococcus sp. showed antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus MTCC 430, Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus MTCC 740, and Salmonella enterica ser. paratyphi A MTCC 735. Lactococcus sp. and Lactobacillus sp. could tolerate acidic conditions (pH 2) and high bile salt concentration (4000 ppm). The lactic microflora were found to be sensitive to most common antibiotics, except for cloxacillin (5 mug), cephalexin (30 mug), and cephalothin (30 mug).
TI  - Identification of a new Bacillus licheniformis strain producing a bacteriocin-like substance.
AB  - The emergence of antibiotic resistance has spurred a great number of studies for  development of new antimicrobials in the past decade. The purpose of this study was to screen environmental samples for Bacillus strains producing potent antimicrobial agents. A new strain, which showed strong antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica ser. Pullorum, was isolated from soil and designated as B116. This new isolate was identified as Bacillus licheniformis by morphological, biochemical and genetic analyses. The production of bacteriocin-like substance (BLS) started at early exponential phase and achieved highest level at early stationary phase. The BLS was precipitated by ammonium sulfate and its molecular mass was determined as approximately 4 kDa by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Culture supernatant of the new isolate exhibited antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella spp. The BLS was resistant to heat, acid and alkaline treatment. Activity of the BLS was totally lost after digestion by pronase and partially lost after digestion by papain and lipase. The new isolate and relevant BLS are potentially useful in food and feed applications.
TI  - The phytochemical content and antimicrobial activities of Malaysian Calophyllum canum (stem bark).
AB  - Recently there was huge increase in using of 'herbal products'. These can be defined as plants, parts of plants or extracts from plants that are used for curing disease. However, Calophyllum species is a tropical plant and it has been used in traditional medicine, the limitation in safety and effectiveness information could lead to serious health problems. Providing information for communities by evaluating the phytochemical contents, antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities will improve the therapeutic values. Three main Calophyllum canum fractions (none - high polar) were tested to find out the phenolic, flavonoid, flavonol content, DPPH radical scavenging, reducing power and chelating iron ions. Also were tested against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Psedomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans. In addition, cytotoxic activity was assayed against lung cancer A549 cell line. The methanol fraction showed no bioactivity but achieved the highest amount of phenolic, flavonol and flavonoid contents, also it showed a significant result as antioxidant, reducing power and chelating agent. The n-hexane fraction achieved the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value 12.5 mug. mL(-1) against B. cereus while the MIC value for DCM fraction was 25 mug. mL(-1). The DCM fraction was more active against S. aureus where the result was 50 mug. mL(-1) while the n-hexane fraction was 100 mug. mL(-1). The three main fractions have shown no activity against gram negative bacterial and fungal. The n-hexane and DCM fractions have shown cytotoxicity against lung cancer cell line; the 50% inhibition concentration (IC(50)) was 22 +/- 2.64 and 32 +/- 3.78 mug. mL(-1) respectively. The results were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Among the results, C. canum fractions proved to be effective against gram positive bacterial and anti-proliferation activity. Also it showed antioxidant activity as well. The results provided beneficial information for communities as well as can help to search for alternative drugs, and will contribute to establish safe and effective use of phytomedicines in the treatment of diseases.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of antimicrobial activity of 4H-pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole, pyrazole and benzylidene derivatives of curcumin.
AB  - A novel, one-pot, simple, efficient procedure for 4H-pyrimido[2,1-b]benzothiazole (4a-h), pyrazole (6a-d) and benzylidene (7a-d) derivatives of curcumin under solvent and solvent free conditions in microwave with good yield is have been synthesized. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Providencia rettgeri and antifungal activity against fungi viz Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigates, Aspergillus flavus. Detailed mechanistic study shows reaction proceeds through Knoevenagel type intermediate 3a which has been suggested as key intermediate for reaction (Fig. 3).
TI  - Synthesis of a new class of antimicrobial agents incorporating the indolin-2-one  moiety.
AB  - New furanone derivatives incorporating the indolin-2-one moiety 3 were prepared via the Perkin reaction of isatins 1 with aroylpropionic acids 2 under conventional conditions or microwave irradiation. A series of functionally heterocyclic derivatives (e.g., pyridazines, pyrroles, and sulfonamides) incorporating the indolin-2-one moiety was achieved via reaction of 3 with different reagents under microwave irradiation conditions. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized on the basis of FTIR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and mass spectral studies. Some of the new synthesized compounds were screened for antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Shigilla flexneri) and antifungal activity against Aspergillus flavus and Candida albicans. Compound 8 j was equipotent to chloramphenicol in inhibiting the growth of E. coli minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC 2.5 mug/mL). Compound 8j may possibly be used as a lead compound for developing a new antibacterial agents. The antibacterial activity is expressed as the corresponding MIC (mug/mL) values.
TI  - Preliminary study on the antimicrobial activity of Enicostemma littorale using different solvents.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the antimicrobial activity of Enicostemma littorale (E. littorale) using different solvents. METHODS: Chloroform, methanol and acetone extracts of different parts of E. littorale (leaf, stem and root) were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using disc diffusion method against some gram-negative species such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi and gram-positive species Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and two fugal species viz., Aspergillus fumigates and Aspergillus flavus. RESULTS: The chloroform extracts showed the highest antibacterial activity. Among leaf, stem and root extracts, the stem extracts showed maximum antibacterial activity. All of the used extracts had no significant antifungal activity against Aspergillus fumigates and Aspergillus flavus. The chloroform stem extract showed highest activity (about 20 mm inhibition zone) against Bacillus subtilis (at 500 mg/mL) followed by the methanolic stem extract which showed highest activity against the same organism. The lowest antibacterial activity was observed by the acetone leaf extract (about 8 mm inhibition zone) against Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: The findings of the study indicate littorale could also be a new source for antibiotics discovery.
TI  - Detection of Foodborne Pathogens and Analysis of Aflatoxin Levels in Home-made Doenjang Samples.
AB  - Doenjang is a traditional Korean fermented soybean product that provides a major  source of protein. In this study, a total of 18 different home-made doenjang samples were examined for the presence of foodborne pathogens and the total aflatoxin levels. Using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to assess microbial quality and potential public health risk, we showed that total coliform levels in the doenjang samples ranged from 0 to 4.43+/-2.32 x10(6) CFU/g, and the maximum limit of Bacillus cereus was 4.67+/-2.0x10(5) CFU/g. However, other foodborne pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella spp., were not detected among the tested samples. One of the samples (S3) showed a maximum limit of 42.2+/-9.1 mug/kg for aflatoxin levels, which was above the safety limit allowed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) regulatory agency. Further research is necessary to determine whether and how doenjang safety can be improved via elimination/reduction of microbial contamination during fermentation and storage or using microbial starter cultures for its fermentation.
TI  - Inhibition of macrophage migration by C. botulinum exoenzyme C3.
AB  - C3-like exoenzymes are produced by various microorganism including Clostridium botulinum (C3bot), Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. C3bot is the prototype of C3-like exoenzymes that specifically ADP-ribosylates and thereby inactivates Rho(A/B/C). C3-like exoenzymes are not yet regarded as virulence factors, as the lack of cell entry domains results in a poor accessibility of the C3-like exoenzymes to cells. In this study, the sensitivity of various cell lines to C3bot has been reinvestigated. Primary monocytes as well as cultured macrophage-like cells including J774A.1 cells and RAW macrophages exhibit a tenfold higher sensitivity to C3bot than fibroblasts and epithelial cells. RhoA ADP-ribosylation by C3bot resulted in the formation of pronounced bipolar protrusions based on defective tail retraction. The formation of bipolar protrusion resulted in inhibited macrophage migration. These findings suggested that macrophages appear to be target cells of C3bot. Migration of macrophage is a prerequiste for their recruitment to the site of pathogen invasion or tissue damage. Inhibition of macrophage migration likely preserves the survival of C3-producing microorganisms. The observations of this study reinforce the paradigm of a role of C3-like exoenzymes as virulence factors.
TI  - Biologically active steroids from the aerial parts of Vernonia anthelmintica Willd.
AB  - A new steroid, vernoanthelsterone A (1), and five known steroids were isolated from the aerial parts of Vernonia anthelmintica Willd. Compound 1 possesses a Delta(8(14))-15-one moiety. To our best knowledge, few steroids with this moiety have been reported before. Compounds 1-6 were tested for their antibacterial activities and their effects on estrogen biosynthesis in human ovarian granulosa-like cells (KGN cells). Compound 2 showed the ability to promote estrogen biosynthesis with EC(50) of 56.95 mug/mL and also exhibited the antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphyloccocus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli with MICs ranging from 3.15 to 15.5 mug/mL. The structures of 1-6 were determined on the basis of IR, MS, 1D and 2D NMR.
TI  - Synthesis of s-triazine-based thiazolidinones as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A novel series of thiazolidinone derivatives, namely 4-{4-dimethylamino-6-[4-oxo-2-phenyl-5-(4-pyridin-2-yl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-thia zolidin-3-yl]-[1,3,5]-triazin-2-yloxy}-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-ones, have been synthesized from the key intermediate 4-(4-amino-6-dimethylamino-[1,3,5]-triazin-2-yloxy)-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-one (5). Compound 5 was condensed with various aldehydes to give Schiff base derivatives, which after cyclization gave thiazolidinones that were linked with 1-pyridin-2-yl-piperazine to obtain the target compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus).
TI  - Novel polymer anchored Cr(III) Schiff base complexes: synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial properties.
AB  - New polymer-bound Schiff bases and Cr(III) complexes have been synthesized by the reaction of 4-benzyloxybenzaldehyde, polymer-bound with 2-aminophenol, 2-amino-4-chlorophenol and 2-amino-4-methylphenol. The structure of polymeric-Schiff bases and their Cr(III) complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR, UV-Vis, TG-DTA and (1)H-NMR. All these compounds have also been investigated for antibacterial activity by the well-diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus (RSKK-07035), Shigella dysenteria type 10 (RSKK 1036), Listeria monocytogenes 4b(ATCC 19115, Escherichia coli (ATCC 1230), Salmonella typhi H (NCTC 901.8394), Staphylococcus epidermis (ATCC 12228), Brucella abortus (RSKK-03026), Micrococcs luteus (ATCC 93419, Bacillus cereus sp., Pseudomonas putida sp. and for antifungal activity against Candida albicans (Y-1200-NIH).
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activities of 1-alkyl-3-methacryloyl (acryloyl) of benzimidazolone (thione) derivatives.
AB  - A series of (28) 1-alkyl-3-methacryloyl (acryloyl)-benzimidazolone (thione) deriv-atives were synthesized. The structures of the new derivatives were confirmed by (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR and ESI-MS spectral analysis. The antibacterial activities of these compounds against several strains of bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were evaluated by methods of paper disc-diffusion and broth mciro-dilution. Methacryloyl derivatives displayed higher antibacterial activities against tested bacterial strains than those of acryloyl derivatives in in vitro tests. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study revealed that the presences of the methacryloyl moieties is essential to the antibacterial activities of the compounds.
TI  - Microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of poultry products sold in various localities of Hyderabad, India.
AB  - A study was carried out to identify microbiological hazards and assess their exposure associated with consumption of poultry based street food served in different localities of Hyderabad. The study indicated that chicken 65, chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, chicken Manchuria and chilly chicken are the most common recipes. A process flow diagram was developed to identify critical control points in the food item. After analysis of the samples at each level of preparation, it was observed that rice and noodles were kept at room temperature for about 5-6 hrs which was a critical control point. A total of 376 samples including chicken fried rice, chicken noodles, boiled noodles and boiled rice were collected from circle 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of Greater Hyderabad municipal corporation (GHMC) and analyzed for microbiological examination. The most prevalent pathogenic bacteria isolated were S. aureus (3.4 log 10 cfu/g) and B. cereus (3.4 log 10 cfu/g). Salmonella spp. was present in salads (3.2 log 10 cfu/g) and hand washings of the food handler (3.5 log 10 cfu/g). Salmonella contamination was found in salads served along with chicken fried rice and chicken noodles than in the food.
TI  - Rapid detection of bacterial contamination of platelet-rich plasma-derived platelet concentrates using flow cytometry.
AB  - Flow cytometry can be used to detect bacterial contamination of platelet products. In this study, we investigated whether the incubation of a minimal volume of platelet-rich plasma (PRP)-derived platelet concentrates (PCs) with growth medium improved the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry. Five bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) were used. Platelets were inoculated with 10, 10(2), and 10(3) CFUs per mL; 0.5 mL, 1.0 mL, and 2.0 mL aliquots of spiked platelets were incubated with growth medium at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. During the incubation period, the numbers of events were analyzed every 4 hours by flow cytometry. We could detect a low concentration (10 CFUs per mL) of bacteria in a small volume (minimum 0.5 mL) of PCs. Irrespective of spiking concentrations and incubation volumes, the detection times of S. aureus and S. epidermidis were 24 hours or less, while those of B. cereus, K. pneumoniae, and E. coli were 16 hours or less. A higher spiking concentration made it possible to shorten the detection time. The numbers of detected bacteria increased during the incubation. However, the graphs corresponding to K. pneumoniae and E. coli showed peak levels and decreasing patterns during the incubation period. The incubation of small volumes of PC with growth medium increased the analytical sensitivity of flow cytometry for bacterial detection. Therefore, flow cytometry can serve as a useful method for sterility testing using PRP-derived PCs with only low levels of consequent platelet loss.
TI  - Investigations of antimicrobial activity of some Cameroonian medicinal plant extracts against bacteria and yeast with gastrointestinal relevance.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Resistance against antibiotics of many bacteria is accumulating. Therefore, searches for new substances with antimicrobial activity have become an urgent necessity. Medicinal plants are frequently used in popular medicine as remedies for many infectious diseases (intestinal infection, malaria, tuberculosis, etc.). AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to determine the in vitro antimicrobial activity of hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from different parts (leaves, stem bark, entire plant) of five different plant species against bacteria and yeast of gastrointestinal relevance. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-one extracts from all the following plants (Albizia gummifera (leaf), Ficus exasperata (leaf and stem bark), Nauclea latifolia (leaf and stem bark), Ricinodendron heudelotii (stem bark), Senna hirsuta (entire plant) have been screened for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria species including Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and one yeast species (Candida albicans) using agar disc-diffusion, and microbroth dilution assays. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that F. exasperata and N. latifolia were active against the whole set of tested microorganisms. The methanol extract of N. latifolia (leaf and stem bark) was the most active against against C. albicans, E. coli, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2, 32, 64 and 64 mug/ml, respectively. The methanol extract of leaf of F. exasperata was also most active with significant inhibitory activity against E. coli, S. dysenteriae, S. Typhi and P. aeruginosa with MIC values of 128 mug/ml. Only the extract of N. latifolia (stem bark and leaf) showed anticandidal property. CONCLUSION: The results show that these plant extracts exhibit antimicrobial activity and N. latifolia proved to be most effective as an antibacterial and antifungal.
TI  - Sequence Analysis of Inducible Prophage phIS3501 Integrated into the Haemolysin II Gene of Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis ATCC35646.
AB  - Diarrheic food poisoning by bacteria of the Bacillus cereus group is mostly due to several toxins encoded in the genomes. One of them, cytotoxin K, was recently identified as responsible for severe necrotic syndromes. Cytotoxin K is similar to a class of proteins encoded by genes usually annotated as haemolysin II (hlyII) in the majority of genomes of the B. cereus group. The partially sequenced genome of Bacillus thuringiensis var israelensis ATCC35646 contains several potentially induced prophages, one of them integrated into the hlyII gene. We determined the complete sequence and established the genomic organization of this prophage-designated phIS3501. During induction of excision of this prophage with mitomycin C, intact hlyII gene is formed, thus providing to cells a genetic ability to synthesize the active toxin. Therefore, this prophage, upon its excision, can be implicated in the regulation of synthesis of the active toxin and thus in the virulence of bacterial host. A generality of selection for such systems in bacterial pathogens is indicated by the similarity of this genetic arrangement to that of Staphylococcus aureus beta-haemolysin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of platelet (PLT)-poor plasma, PLT-rich plasma, PLT gel, and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate biomaterials against wound bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) gels exhibit antimicrobial activity useful for wound healing. The nature of the antibacterial component(s) is unknown. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PLT-poor plasma (PPP), PLT-rich plasma (PRP), PLT gel (PG), and solvent/detergent-treated PLT lysate (S/D-PL) from two donors were evaluated either native or after complement heat inactivation. Materials were spiked at a 10% ratio (vol/vol) with approximately 10(7-8) colony-forming units/mL with four Gram-positive and four Gram-negative bacteria of the wound flora. Bacterial count was determined by plate assays at time of spiking and after 3 and 48 hours at 31 degrees C. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were also performed. RESULTS: There was no viable Escherichia coli colony for 48 hours after spiking to the plasma and PLT materials from both donors, corresponding to greater than 7.51 to greater than 9.05 log inactivation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were inactivated (approx. 4.7, 7, and 2 log, respectively) 3 hours after spiking to PRP, PPP, or S/D-PL from the first donor but less (1.1, 4.6, and 0.2 log, respectively) in PG, before a regrowth at 48 hours in all materials. Similar data were obtained with the second donor. No plasma and PLT material had antimicrobial activity against Enterobacter cloacae, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Complement-inactivated samples had no antimicrobial activity. CONCLUSION: Plasma complement is mostly responsible for the activity of plasma and PLT biomaterials against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, and S. aureus. Activation of the coagulation to prepare PG may reduce antimicrobial activity. These findings may help optimize the control of wound infections by blood biomaterials.
TI  - Antibacterial anthraquinone derivatives from a sea anemone-derived fungus Nigrospora sp.
AB  - Chemical investigation of a marine-derived fungus Nigrospora sp., isolated from an unidentified sea anemone, yielded two new hydroanthraquinone analogues, 4a-epi-9alpha-methoxydihydrodeoxybostrycin (1) and 10-deoxybostrycin (2), together with seven known anthraquinone derivatives (3-9). The structures of the two new compounds were established through extensive NMR spectroscopy as well as a single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis using Cu Kalpha radiation. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1-9 and 10 acetyl derivatives (6a, 7a, 8a-8g, 9a) were evaluated in vitro. Compound 6a, the acetylated derivative of 6, exhibited promising activity against Bacillus cereus with an MIC value of 48.8 nM, which was stronger than that of the positive control ciprofloxacin (MIC = 1250 nM). Analysis of the antibacterial screening data for the metabolites and their acetyl derivatives revealed the key structural features required for this activity.
TI  - Two piperazic acid-containing cyclic hexapeptides from Streptomyces alboflavus 313.
AB  - Two novel cyclic hexapeptides, designated NW-G10 (1) and NW-G11 (2), were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces alboflavus 313. Their relative structures were elucidated on the basis of extensive spectroscopic analysis, and the absolute configurations of several constituent amino acids were determined by Marfey's method. NW-G10 (1) and NW-G11 (2) exhibited significant activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), but they are not active against gram negatives.
TI  - Development of sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of Cronobacter muytjensii (formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii).
AB  - This study aimed to produce a polyclonal antibody against Cronobacter muytjensii  (C. muytjensii, formerly called Enterobacter sakazakii) and to develop an immunoassay for its detection. The optimum production of rabbit anti-C. muytjensii immunoglobulin G (IgG) and chicken anti-C. muytjensii IgY was reached in weeks 8 and 9, respectively. Purification of rabbit anti-C. muytjensii IgG from immunized rabbit sera was accomplished using the caprylic acid and ammonium sulfate precipitation method. As a result, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis produced two bands around 25 and 50 kDa, corresponding to a light and a heavy chain, respectively. The optimized conditions for sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were using rabbit anti-C. muytjensii IgG (1 mug/mL) as a detection antibody and chicken anti-C. muytjensii IgY (10 mug/mL) as a capture antibody. In this assay, no cross-reactivity was observed with the other genera of pathogenic bacteria tested, which included Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. The developed assay did not show cross-reactivity with other tested species of Cronobacter and Enterobacter genera such as C. turicensis, C. sakazakii, E. aerogenes, E. pulveris and E. helveticus. The detection limit of sandwich ELISA for C. muytjensii was found to be 2.0 x 10(4) colony forming units (CFU)/mL. In addition, detection of C. muytjensii in infant formula powder showed a low matrix effect on the detection curve of sandwich ELISA for C. muytjensii, the detection limit being found to be 6.3 x 10(4) CFU/mL. These findings demonstrate that the developed method is able to detect all strains of C. muytjensii. Hence, this ELISA technique has potent application for the rapid and accurate detection of C. muytjensii in dietary foods.
TI  - Synthesis of benzimidazolyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2ylthio-N-phenyl (benzothiazolyl) acetamides as antibacterial, antifungal and antituberculosis agents.
AB  - To affiliate multiple bioactivities in a compact heteronuclei, two series of benzimidazole based 1,3,4-oxadiazoles were synthesized and assessed in vitro for their efficacy as antimicrobial agents against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri), four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv and best results were observed amongst the N-benzothiazolyl aetamide series. The lipophilicity (LogP) influence on the biological profile (MICs) of the prepared products was also discussed. Upon biological screening, it was observed that the majority of the compounds were found to possess a significant broad spectrum antimicrobial (3.12-25 mug/mL of MIC) and antitubercular (6.25-25 mug/mL of MIC) potential. The structural assignments of the new products were done on the basis of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis.
TI  - Laccase- and chloroperoxidase-nanotube paint composites with bactericidal and sporicidal activity.
AB  - Laccase and chloroperoxidase (CPO) were separately immobilized onto multi-walled  carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) and subsequently mixed with a commercial eco-friendly paint to generate biocatalytic coatings. The laccase-nanotube based paints showed >99% bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (both challenged with 10(6) CFU/mL) within 30 min and >98% sporicidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus anthracis-DeltaSterne (initially challenged with 10(4) CFU/mL) within 120 min. The CPO-nanotube based paints also showed >99% antimicrobial activity within 30 min against E. coli and S. aureus (both challenged with 10(6) CFU/mL). These enzyme-nanotube based formulations provide an eco-friendly route to generate biocidal compounds, which can prevent the growth of a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including spores. These enzyme-containing paints may be envisioned to be applied as self-decontaminating coatings onto a wide range of surfaces, such as hospital infrastructure, medical devices and equipment, food processing and packaging, etc.; in all cases effective killing of a variety of infectious organisms is critical.
TI  - Invariant gly residue is important for alpha-defensin folding, dimerization, and  function: a case study of the human neutrophil alpha-defensin HNP1.
AB  - The human alpha-defensins (HNP) are synthesized in vivo as inactive prodefensins, and contain a conserved glycine, Gly(17), which is part of a beta-bulge structure. It had previously been shown that the glycine main chain torsion angles are in a D-configuration, and that d-amino acids but not L-alanine could be substituted at that position to yield correctly folded peptides without the help of a prodomain. In this study, the glycine to L-alanine mutant defensin was synthesized in the form of a prodefensin using native chemical ligation. The ligation product folded correctly and yielded an active peptide upon CNBr cleavage. The L-Ala(17)-HNP1 crystal structure depicted a beta-bulge identical to wild-type HNP1. However, dimerization was perturbed, causing one monomer to tilt with respect to the other in a dimerization model. Inhibitory activity against the anthrax lethal factor showed a 2-fold reduction relative to wild-type HNP1 as measured by the inhibitory concentration IC(50). Self-association was slightly reduced, as detected by surface plasmon resonance measurements. According to the results of the virtual colony count assay, the antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus exhibited a less than 2-fold reduction in virtual lethal dose values. Prodefensins with two other L-amino acid substitutions, Arg and Phe, at the same position did not fold, indicating that only small side chains are tolerable. These results further elucidate the factors governing the region of the beta-bulge structure that includes Gly(17), illuminating why glycine is conserved in all mammalian alpha-defensins.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles against bacterial cells adhered to  stainless steel surfaces.
AB  - Given the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the need to synthesize new antimicrobials, silver has attracted interest in the scientific community because of its recognized antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effects of silver nanoparticles (NP) obtained by a new method and tested at concentrations of 6 mug/ml and 60 mug/ml against the species Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Salmonella Choleraesuis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus. The ability of these nanoparticles to remove or kill vegetative cells adhered to stainless steel surfaces was also evaluated. We observed that the NP obtained with the new method, concentrated silver nanoparticles (CNP), and silver nanoparticles with added sodium chloride (NPNaCl) had high antimicrobial activities (P < 0.05). We also verified that the most effective condition for the removal of P. aeruginosa cells on stainless steel coupons (10 by 10 mm) was immersion of the surfaces in CNP. The CNP treatment produced a 5-log reduction of the microbial population after 30 to 60 min of immersion. The CNP treatment also performed better than water and sodium carbonate, a compound commonly applied in clean-in-place procedures in the food industry, in removing adherent B. cereus cells from stainless steel cylinders. Therefore, these results suggest that NP synthesized by a new procedure may be used as antimicrobials in the food industry, for example, for the sanitization of utensils that come into contact with foods.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of rare Streptomyces species against clinical resistant bacteria].
AB  - In the search for new antibiotics from Steptomyces, investigating extremes habitats enhances the probability of isolating novel producers. In this context, the antibacterial activity of four Streptomyces strains isolated from Ezzmoul saltpans was studied. Two of them showed antibacterial activity against antibiotic's resistant bacteria (Bacillus cereus: beta-lactamines and sulfamides resistant, Streptococcus faecalis: penicillin, tetracycline and cotrimoxazole resistant, and Staphylococcus aureus Mu 50: vancomycine resistant). The most active Streptomyces strain produces one type of polar bioactive molecules that resists to temperature variation and light exposition. Its activity appears in the first culture day and reaches its maximal value in the fourth day. The second strain presents themoresistant activity that reaches its maximal value in the first culture day. It produces two types of bioactive molecules, one is polar and the second is non polar (according to thin layer chromatography technique results).
TI  - A comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed UV radiation device.
AB  - Daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. However, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. This study evaluated a newly developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (UV) radiation device for its bactericidal activity in comparison with continuous UV-C, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin-resistant A. baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed UV or continuous UV-C. Pulsed UV and continuous UV-C required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2Log growth inhibition of all the species. The use of pulsed UV in daily disinfection of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. The new portable pulsed UV radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.
TI  - Semisynthesis and antimicrobial activity of novel guttiferone-A derivatives.
AB  - Six derivatives of guttiferone-A (LFQM-79, 80, 81, 82, 113 and 114) were synthesized and evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against the opportunistic or pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (ATCC 09548), Candida glabrata (ATCC 90030), Candida krusei (ATCC 6258), Candida parapsilosis (ATCC 69548), Candida tropicalis (ATCC 750), Cryptococcus neoformans (ATCC 90012), Trichophyton tonsurans, Microsporum gypseum and also against the opportunistic and pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 6538), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 9027), Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Proteus mirabilis (ATCC 25933). The antimicrobial activities of derivatives were compared with guttiferone-A and they presented to be more potent than the original molecule and sometimes greater than standard drugs established in therapeutics. The current study showed that derivatives of guttiferone-A possess potent antimicrobial activity and are relatively non-cytotoxic, which reveal these new molecules as promising new drug prototype candidates, with innovative structural pattern.
TI  - Antimicrobial and Safety Properties of Lactobacilli Isolated from two Cameroonian Traditional Fermented Foods.
AB  - Twenty-one Lactobacillus isolates from "Sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "Kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. These isolates were preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus plantarum (62%), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), Lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and Lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. Twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (Trypsin, Proteinase K) and inhibition of other Lactobacillus spp. These bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin G, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. The bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the World Health Organization, as well as Multidrug-resistant strains. These include Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare Typhi, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Shigella flexneri. These Lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.
TI  - Substituted salicylaldehydes as potential antimicrobial drugs: minimal inhibitory and microbicidal concentrations.
AB  - Substituted salicylaldehydes are potent antibacterial and antifungal agents and may have chemotherapeutic potential. In the clinical setting, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) as well as the minimal bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations (MBC and MFC, respectively) are of fundamental interest. Therefore, we have now, using a panel of five microbial species (Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Staphylococcus aureus), determined the MIC and MBC/MFC values of a total of 22 aromatic aldehydes, including 19 substituted salicylaldehydes and the unsubstituted parent compounds benzaldehyde and salicylaldehyde (2-hydroxybenzaldehyde). The results clearly indicate that both of the yeasts studied are remarkably sensitive to various salicylaldehydes and, especially, to halogenated ones. Some congeners clearly merit consideration as potential therapeutic agents for Candida infections. The MIC values of the most potent congeners are of roughly the same magnitude as that of amphotericin B, and the results of the MFC measurements indicate that the compounds are fungicidal. All of the bacteria studied are also sensitive to at least some of the compounds tested but, clearly, this class of antimicrobials has superior activity against yeasts. Structure-activity relationships are discussed for each microbial species and compared with each other. The comparison of the results of MIC and MBC/MFC measurements with those of agar diffusion tests revealed aspects that are of interest concerning the methodology of antimicrobial activity screening. Unexpectedly, it was found that some compounds that are completely devoid of activity in agar diffusion tests had potent activity in MIC tests, indicating that if only agar diffusion methodology is used in drug discovery, some highly active compounds may be missed.
TI  - Bioactives of microbes isolated from Western Ghat belt of Kerala show beta-lactamase inhibition along with wide spectrum antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The present study describes the exploitation of microbial biodiversity from Western Ghats of Kerala for screening of bioactives having beta-lactamase inhibitory activities. A total of 700 pure cultures were isolated and were screened for antibacterial activity against a beta-lactam resistant Bacillus cereus strain (PL 10) isolated from the same niche. Bioactive extracts made from 45 isolates showed inhibitory activities against PL 10, of which two strains showed inhibition of extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella ESBL1101 and three strains inhibited methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strain MRSA831. All these five strains showed wide spectrum antimicrobial activity against various fungi and bacteria. These five cultures were identified by 16S rRNA sequencing and biochemical tests and the preliminary characterizations of their bioactive extracts were carried out. This study suggests the potential of bioactives from two inhibitor-producer strains, NII 167 and NII 1054, for being developed as inhibitors against wide spectrum beta-lactam resistant strains.
TI  - Volatile organic compounds from Centaurium erythraea Rafn (Croatia) and the antimicrobial potential of its essential oil.
AB  - GC and MS were used for the analysis of Croatian Centaurium erythraea Rafn essential oil (obtained by hydrodistillation) and headspace (applying headspace solid-phase microextraction). The headspace contained numerous monoterpene hydrocarbons (the major ones were terpinene-4-ol, methone, p-cymene, gamma-terpinene and limonene). Oxygenated monoterpenes were present in the headspace and oil, while 1,8-cineole, bornyl acetate and verbenone were present only in the headspace. High headspace percentages of toluene and naphthalene were found, followed by hemimellitene. Lot of similarities were observed with Serbian C. erythraea oil [neophytadiene (1.4%), thymol (2.6%), carvacrol (6.1%) and hexadecanoic acid (5.7%)], but different features were also noted such as the presence of menthol, menthone and phytone. The oil fractionation enabled identification of other minor compounds not found in total oil such as norisoprenoides, alk-1-enes or chromolaenin. The essential oil showed antimicrobial potential on Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. On the other hand, no antibacterial activity of the oil was observed on Pseudomonas fluorescens and Lysteria monocytogenes.
TI  - Seasonal variations of phenolic compounds and biological properties in sage (Salvia officinalis L.).
AB  - The aim was to investigate the phenolic content, antioxidant capacity, and antibacterial activity of Dalmatian sage (Salvia officinalis L.) leaves collected during different vegetation periods. Separation and quantification of the individual phenols were performed by reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC coupled with a PDA (photodiode array) detector and using an internal standard, while the contents of total phenols, flavonoids, flavones, and flavonols were determined spectrophotometrically. The antioxidant properties of the sage leaf extracts were evaluated using five different antioxidant assays (FRAP, DPPH, ABTS, Briggs-Rauscher reaction, and beta-carotene bleaching). The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was tested against two Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and two Gram-negative (Salmonella Infantis and Escherichia coli) bacterial reference strains. All extracts were extremely rich in phenolic compounds, and provided good antioxidant and antibacterial properties, but the phenophase in which the leaves were collected affected the phenolic composition of the sage extracts and consequently their biological activity. The May Extract, the richest in total flavonoids, showed the best antioxidant properties and the highest antimicrobial activity. Thus, collection of the plants during May seems the best choice for further use of them in the pharmaceutical and food industry.
TI  - [The management of catheter related blood stream infection].
AB  - Catheter-related bloodstream infection causes severe complications and high mortality. CDC revised the guideline for the prevention of intravascular catheter-related infection in 2011, and various anti-infection devices were introduced. However, the most important deterrents of infection are basic procedures such as hand-hygiene and maximal barrier precautions. I would like to describe the points involving early detection, and its medical treatment and prevention.
TI  - Application of atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma for the in vitro eradication of bacterial biofilms.
AB  - The use of atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma represents an interesting and novel approach for the decontamination of surfaces colonized with microbial biofilms that exhibit enhanced tolerance to antimicrobial challenge. In this study, the influence of an atmospheric pressure nonthermal plasma jet, operated in a helium and oxygen gas mixture under ambient pressure, was evaluated against biofilms of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Within < 4 min of plasma exposure, complete eradication of the two gram-positive bacterial biofilms was achieved. Although gram-negative biofilms required longer treatment time, their complete eradication was still possible with 10 min of exposure. Whilst this study provides useful proof of concept data on the use of atmospheric pressure plasmas for the eradication of bacterial biofilms in vitro, it also demonstrates the critical need for improved understanding of the mechanisms and kinetics related to such a potentially significant approach.
TI  - New heterocyclic compounds from 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole class bearing diphenylsulfone moieties. Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - Some new 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(R)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3(4H)-thiones 4a,b; 5a,b and 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(R)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines 6a,b; 7a,b were obtained by cyclization of new N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-(R)-thiosemicarbazides 2a,b; 3a,b (X=H, Br). The 1,2,4-triazoles were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of acylthiosemicarbazides, in basic media. On the other hand, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles were obtained from same acylthiosemicarbazides, in acidic media. These new intermediates from thiosemicarbazide class were afforded by the reaction of 4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoic acids hydrazides (X=H, Br) 1a,b with 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl isothiocyanate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. All the new compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 13061, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 49141, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and essential oils of Curcuma aeruginosa, Curcuma mangga,  and Zingiber cassumunar from Malaysia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the chemical composition of the essential oils of Curcuma aeruginosa (C. aeruginosa), Curcuma mangga (C. mangga), and Zingiber cassumunar (Z. cassumunar), and study their antimicrobial activity. METHODS: Essential oils obtained by steam distillation were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The antimicrobial activity of the essential oils was evaluated against four bacteria: Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Escherichia coli (E. coli), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa); and two fungi: Candida albicans (C. albicans) and Cyptococcus neoformans (C. neoformans), using disc-diffusion and broth microdilution methods. RESULTS: Cycloisolongifolene, 8,9-dehydro formyl (35.29%) and dihydrocostunolide (22.51%) were the major compounds in C. aeruginosa oil; whereas caryophyllene oxide (18.71%) and caryophyllene (12.69%) were the major compounds in C. mangga oil; and 2,6,9,9-tetramethyl-2,6,10-cycloundecatrien-1-one (60.77%) and alpha-caryophyllene (23.92%) were abundant in Z. cassumunar oil. The essential oils displayed varying degrees of antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms. C. mangga oil had the highest and most broad-spectrum activity by inhibiting all microorganisms tested, with C. neoformans being the most sensitive microorganism by having the lowest minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values of 0.1 muL/mL. C. aeruginosa oil showed mild antimicrobial activity, whereas Z. cassumunar had very low or weak activity against the tested microorganisms. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results suggest promising antimicrobial properties of C. mangga and C. aeruginosa, which may be useful for food preservation, pharmaceutical treatment and natural therapies.
TI  - Novel bacterial lipoprotein structures conserved in low-GC content gram-positive  bacteria are recognized by Toll-like receptor 2.
AB  - Bacterial lipoproteins/lipopeptides inducing host innate immune responses are sensed by mammalian Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). These bacterial lipoproteins are structurally divided into two groups, diacylated or triacylated lipoproteins, by the absence or presence of an amide-linked fatty acid. The presence of diacylated lipoproteins has been predicted in low-GC content gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas based on the absence of one modification enzyme in their genomes; however, we recently determined triacylated structures in low-GC gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, raising questions about the actual lipoprotein structure in other low-GC content gram-positive bacteria. Here, through intensive MS analyses, we identified a novel and unique bacterial lipoprotein structure containing an N-acyl-S-monoacyl-glyceryl-cysteine (named the lyso structure) from low-GC gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Lactobacillus bulgaricus. Two of the purified native lyso-form lipoproteins induced proinflammatory cytokine production from mice macrophages in a TLR2-dependent and TLR1-independent manner but with a different dependence on TLR6. Additionally, two other new lipoprotein structures were identified. One is the "N-acetyl" lipoprotein structure containing N-acetyl-S-diacyl-glyceryl-cysteine, which was found in five gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis. The N-acetyl lipoproteins induced the proinflammatory cytokines through the TLR2/6 heterodimer. The other was identified in a mycoplasma strain and is an unusual diacyl lipoprotein structure containing two amino acids before the lipid-modified cysteine residue. Taken together, our results suggest the existence of novel TLR2-stimulating lyso and N-acetyl forms of lipoproteins that are conserved in low-GC content gram-positive bacteria and provide clear evidence for the presence of yet to be identified key enzymes involved in the bacterial lipoprotein biosynthesis.
TI  - Assessment of microbial quality of commercial and home-made tiger-nut beverages.
AB  - AIMS: We aimed to assess the microbiological quality of Spanish commercial tiger-nut beverages as well as home-made samples collected from supermarkets, street vendors, juice bars and ice-cream parlours located in Valencia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbiological analysis of 44 tiger-nut beverages samples were carried out according to International Standard Organization (ISO) norms and published works which included the total viable count, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus cereus, yeasts, moulds, Yersinia enterocolitca, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio spp. and Listeria monocytogenes. The obtained results indicated that all the commercial samples were below the detection limit for the viable microorganisms. Results of analysis of those home-made tiger-nut samples revealed that 67% (16 samples) harboured total plate counts while the rest of samples were free from these microorganisms. Enterobacteriaceae were detected in 62% (15 samples). E. coli were found in only one sample (4%), yeasts and moulds were detected in 62% (15 samples) each, Shigella was found in 21% (five samples); however, all samples were free from S. aureus, Salmonella, Y. enterocolotica, C. perfringens, Vibrio spp. and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: These results reflected that there exists a rather high contamination level in home-made tiger-nut beverages indicating the need to apply correct and strict HACCP system(s) during manufacturing and storage of these food products. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: This study demonstrates the great need to carry out microbiological tests frequently in these products and even more the need to apply correct HACCP system (s). Tiger-nut beverages are especially well-known products in Spain, hence it is extremely important to ensure an adequate microbiological quality to guarantee consumers health.
TI  - Milk microbiome signatures of subclinical mastitis-affected cattle analysed by shotgun sequencing.
AB  - AIMS: Metagenomic analysis of milk samples collected from Kankrej, Gir (Bos indicus) and crossbred (Bos taurus x B. indicus) cattle harbouring subclinical mastitis was carried out by next-generation sequencing 454 GS-FLX technology to elucidate the microbial community structure of cattle milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Milk samples from Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle were subjected to metagenomic profiling by pyrosequencing. The Metagenomic analysis produced 63.07, 11.09 and 7.87 million base pairs (Mb) of sequence data, assembled in 264 798, 56 114 and 36 762 sequences with an average read length of 238, 197 and 214 nucleotides in Kankrej, Gir and crossbred cattle, respectively. Phylogenetic and metabolic profiles by the web-based tool MG-RAST revealed that the members of Enterobacteriales were predominant in mastitic milk followed by Pseudomonadales, Bacillales and Lactobacillales. Around 56 different species with varying abundance were detected in the subclinically infected milk. Escherichia coli was found to be the most predominant species in Kankrej and Gir cattle followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas mendocina, Shigella flexneri and Bacillus cereus. In crossbred cattle, Staphylococcus aureus followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus epidermidis and E. coli were detected in descending order. Metabolic profiling indicated fluoroquinolones, methicillin, copper, cobalt-zinc-cadmium as the groups of antibiotics and toxic compounds to which the organisms showed resistance. Sequences indicating potential of organisms exhibiting multidrug resistance against antibiotics and resistance to toxic compounds were also present. Interestingly, presence of bacteriophages against Staph. aureus, E. coli, Enterobacter and Yersinia species was also observed. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis identified potential infectious organisms in mastitis, resistance of organisms to antibiotics and chemical compounds and the natural resistance potential of dairy cows. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The findings of this study may help in formulating strategies for the prevention and treatment of mastitis in dairy animals and consequently in reducing economic losses incurred because of it.
TI  - Antimicrobial prenylated acetophenones from berries of Harrisonia abyssinica.
AB  - The ripe berries of Harrisonia abyssinica yielded two new prenylated acetophenones, namely 5-(ethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 S-(1' S-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (1) and 5-(2'''-hydroxyethan-1'''-one)-4,6-dihydroxy-7-(3'',3''-dimethylallyl)-2 S-(1' S-hydroxy-1',5'-dimethylhex-4'-enyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (2), herein named harronin I and harronin II, respectively. The compounds were isolated following activity guided fractionation and the structures were determined using 1D, 2D NMR spectroscopic, CD and MS spectrometric techniques. The methanol-dichloromethane mixture (1 : 1 v/v) crude extract exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Lactobacillus casei. Harronin I (1) showed a MIC of 5 microg/mL against C. albicans, 6 microg/mL against B. cereus, and more than 20 microg/mL against other tested microorganisms. Harronin II (2) showed much weaker MIC values (> 100 microg/mL) against all the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial properties of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of non-polymeric phenolic (NP) and polymeric tannin (PT) constituents in the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of six brands of green, black, and herbal teas of Camellia sinensis were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Total phenolic content (TPC) and ascorbic acid equivalent antioxidant capacity (AEAC) were assessed using the Folin-Ciocalteu and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assays, respectively. Minimum inhibitory dose (MID) against Gram-positive Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative. Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa was assessed using the disc-diffusion method. Teas were extracted with hot water successively three times for one hour each time. The extracts were fractionated using Sephadex LH-20 column chromatography to obtain the NP and PT constituents. RESULTS: Extraction yields ranged from 12 to 23%. Yields of NP fractions (70-81%) were much higher than those of PT fractions (1-11%), suggesting that the former are the major tea components. Ranking of antioxidant properties of extracts was green tea>black tea>herbal tea. For all six teas, antioxidant properties of PT fractions were significantly higher than extracts and NP fractions. Extracts and fractions of all six teas showed no activity against the three Gram-negative bacteria. Green teas inhibited all three Gram-positive bacteria with S. aureus being the least susceptible. Black and herbal teas inhibited the growth of M. luteus and B. cereus, but not S. aureus. The most potent were the PT fractions of Boh Cameron Highlands and Ho Yan Hor with MID of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/disc against M. luteus. CONCLUSION: Results suggested that NP constituents are major contributors to the antioxidant and antibacterial properties of teas of C. sinensis. Although PT constituents have stronger antioxidant and antibacterial properties, they constitute only a minor component of the teas.
TI  - Synthesis, SAR and antibacterial activity of hybrid chloro, dichloro-phenylthiazolyl-s-triazines.
AB  - A series of hybrid novel chloro (1a-9a) and dichloro (10b-18b) phenylthiazolyl-s-triazine were synthesized and subsequently subjected to their antibacterial activity against three gram positive viz. Lactobacillus casei (NCIM-2651); Bacillus cereus (NCIM-2458); Staphylococcus aureus (NCIM-2120) and three gram negative viz Salmonella typhimurium (NCIM-2501); Escherichia coli (NCIM-2065); Klebsiella aerogenes (NCIM-2098). The SAR studies around the lead compound revealed that introduction of electron withdrawing groups and amino (-NH-) and mercapto (-S-) linker bridge seemed more promising towards antibacterial activity. Moreover, the virtual Molinspiration screenings are in compliance with Ghose's rule.
TI  - Naturally occurring medicinal mushroom-derived antimicrobials: a case-study using Lingzhi or Reishi Ganoderma lucidum (W. Curt.:Fr.) P. Karst. (higher Basidiomycetes).
AB  - Antibacterial activity of Lingzhi or Reishi medicinal mushroom, Ganoderma lucidum, collected from Central India was evaluated against four bacterial pathogens. Ethyl alcohol and water extracts of fruit body powder were tested using the disc diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It was noted that the aqueous extract inhibited growth of pathogenic bacteria. The combined effect of fruit body extract with synthetic antibiotic discs was found to increase the activity significantly more than the antibiotics alone. The present study is an attempt to assess antibacterial activity of extracts of G. lucidum singly and in combination. The combination of G. lucidum with commercial antibiotics proves that it enhances antibacterial activity.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of some thiazolidinones as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A novel series of thiazolidinone derivatives namely 4-(4-dimethylamino-6-{4-[5-(4-ethylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-oxo-2-phenylthiazolidi n-3-yl]-phenylamino}-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yloxy)-1-methyl-1H-quinolin-2-one have been synthesized from the key intermediate 4-[4-(4-aminophenylamino)-6-dimethylamino-[1,3,5]triazin-2-yloxy]-1-methyl-1H-qui nolin-2-one (7). Condensation reaction of compound 7 with different aldehyde derivatives were performed to obtain Schiff base derivatives, which after cyclization gave thiazolidinones and finally they were reacted with N-ethylpiperazine to get target compounds. The newly synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against eight bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneri) and four fungal strains (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus).
TI  - Anti-bacterial studies on Hemigraphis colorata (Blume) H.G. Hallier and Elephantopus scaber L.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the ethanol, aqueous, chloroform, benzene, acetone and petroleum ether extracts of, Hemigraphis colorata (H. colorata) leaves and stem and Elephantopus scaber (E. scaber) leaves, root and flower for the presence of phyto-constituents and screened the anti-bacterial activity against the selected pathogens. METHODS: The fresh materials were shade dried and powdered using the tissue blender. The dried and powered materials (50 g) were extracted successively with 200 mL of aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether by using Soxhlet extractor for 8 h at a temperature not exceeding the boiling point of the solvent. Aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts were prepared from powdered materials were used for preliminary phytochemical and antimicrobial studies using standard methods. RESULTS: The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root and H. colorata leaves and stem demonstrated that out of (5x6x12 = 360) tests for the presence or absence of the above compounds, 188 tests gave positive results and the remaining 172 gave negative results. The results of the phytochemical screening revealed that phenol (12/12), carbohydrates (9/12), steroids (8/12), saponins and coumarins (7/12), tannins (6/12), proteins (5/12), carboxylic acid and flavonoids (4/12), xanthoproteins (3/12) and alkaloids (2/12) presence in the crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts of H. colorata leaves and stem. The crude aqueous, acetone, benzene, chloroform, ethanol, and petroleum ether extracts E. scaber leaves, flower and root displayed the presence of phenol (18/18), tannin (17/18), carbohydrates (16/18), steroids (14/18), carboxylic acid and coumarins (12/18), saponins (10/18), xanthoprotein (9/18), flavonoids (7/18), protein (4/18) and alkaloids (2/18). The root ethanolic extracts of E. scaber illustrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) (24 mm), Escherichia coli (E. coli) (16 mm) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) (13 mm). The chlorofrom extracts of E. scaber showed the highest zone of inhibition against Bacillus cereus (B. cereus) (12 mm), The leaves ethanolic extracts of E. scaber demonstrated the highest zone of inhibition against three pathogens viz., Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) (18 mm), Proteus mirabilis (P. mirabilis) (17 mm), Salmonella Typhi (S. typhi) (14 mm) and Enterobacter sp. (11 mm) While the benzene extracts of H. colorata demonstrated maximum zone of inhibition against the pathogen Acinetobacter sp. (14 mm) and S. aureus (12 mm). CONCLUSIONS: It is hoped that this study would direct to the establishment of some compounds that could be used to invent new and more potent antimicrobial drugs of natural origin.
TI  - Chemical, antioxidant and antimicrobial investigations of Pinus cembra L. bark and needles.
AB  - The chemical constituents and biological activity of Pinus cembra L. (Pinaceae),  native to the Central European Alps and the Carpathian Mountains, are not well known. The aim of the present work was to examine the phenolic content, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of hydromethanolic extracts of Pinus cembra L. bark and needles. Bark extract had higher concentrations of total phenolics (299.3 vs. 78.22 mg gallic acid equivalents/g extract), flavonoids (125.3 vs. 19.84 mg catechin equivalents/g extract) and proanthocyanidins (74.3 vs. 12.7 mg cyanidin equivalents/g extract) than needle extract and was more active as a free radical scavenger, reducing agent and antimicrobial agent. The EC(5)(0) values in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) and reducing power assays were 71.1, 6.3 and 26 mg/mL for bark extract and 186.1, 24 and 104 mg/mL for needle extract, respectively. In addition, needle extract showed ferrous ions chelating effects (EC(5)(0) = 1,755 mug/mL). The antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans were assessed by the agar diffusion method. Both extracts (4 mg/well) were active against all the microorganisms tested; bark extract showed higher inhibition on all strains. These results indicate that Pinus cembra L. bark and needles are good sources of phytochemicals with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Quality parameters and antioxidant and antibacterial properties of some Mexican honeys.
AB  - A total of 14 Mexican honeys were screened for quality parameters including color, moisture, proline, and acidity. Antioxidant properties of complete honey and its methanolic extracts were evaluated by the DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP assays. In addition, the antimicrobial activity of complete honeys against Bacillus cereus ATCC 10876, Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, Salmonella Typhimurium ATCC 14028, and Sthapylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 was determined. Most of honeys analyzed showed values within quality parameters established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission in 2001. Eucalyptus flower honey and orange blossom honey showed the highest phenolic contents and antioxidant capacity. Bell flower, orange blossom, and eucalyptus flower honeys inhibited the growth of the 4 evaluated microorganisms. The remaining honeys affected at least 1 of the estimated growth parameters (increased lag phase, decreased growth rate, and/or maximum population density). Microorganism sensitivity to the antimicrobial activity of honeys followed the order B. cereus > L. monocytogenes > Salmonella Typhimurium > S. aureus. The monofloral honey samples from orange blossoms, and eucalyptus flowers demonstrated to be good sources of antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds. All the Mexican honey samples examined proved to be good sources of antioxidants and antimicrobial agents that might serve to maintain health and protect against several diseases. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: The results of the study showed that Mexican honeys display good quality parameters and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Mexican honey can be used as an additive in the food industry to increase the nutraceutical value of products.
TI  - A new depsidone and antibacterial activities of compounds from Usnea undulata Stirton.
AB  - Usnea undulata Stirton (Usneaaceae) is a fruticose lichen used locally in ethnoveterinary medicine to treat mammary infections in cattle while human beings use it for the treatment of wounds in Eastern Cape, South Africa. Bioactivity-guided fractionation of its extracts led to the isolation and characterization of a new depsidone, 2'-O-methylhypostictic acid (8), together with seven known compounds, i.e. methyl beta-orsellinate, norstictic acid, menegazziaic acid, (+) usnic acid, hypoconstictic acid, salazinic acid, and galbinic acid. The structures of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of their spectral analysis including homo- and hetero-nuclear correlation NMR experiments (COSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC) and mass spectra as well as by comparison with available data in the literature. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) values of the compounds against six bacteria were determined. Compound 8 showed inhibitory activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis with MICs of 31, 62.5, 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. (+) Usnic acid was most active against B. subtilis, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli with MICs of 8, 8, 31, and 31 mug/ml, respectively, while other compounds exhibited moderate activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of water-soluble extract from pine needles of Cedrus deodara.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of water-soluble extract from pine needles of Cedrus deodara (WEC) was evaluated on five food-borne bacteria, and its related mechanism was investigated by transmission electron microscope. In vitro antibacterial assay showed that WEC possesses a remarkable antibacterial activity against tested food-borne bacteria including Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus, with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values in the ranges of 0.78-12.5 mg/ml and 1.56-25mg/ml, respectively. In a food system of fresh-squeezed tomato juice, WEC was observed to possess an effective capacity to control the total counts of viable bacteria. Shikimic acid was isolated from WEC and identified as the main antibacterial compound. All results of our study suggested that WEC might be a new potential source of natural antibacterial agents applicable to food.
TI  - Impact of solvent/detergent treatment of plasma on transfusion-relevant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment in a medical device has been developed for pathogen reduction of plasma for transfusion. Impact of S/D on bacterial growth and on the capacity of complement to kill bacteria has been investigated in this study. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A pool of apheresis plasma from four donors was spiked with eight transfusion-relevant bacteria. Plasma was treated with 1% tri(n-butyl) phosphate and 1% Triton X-45 at 31 degrees C for 90 min and then extracted by oil at 31 degrees C for 70 min. Decomplemented plasma and Phosphate Buffer Saline were used as controls. Bacterial count was determined in samples taken immediately after spiking, or after S/D and oil treatment. Similar experiments were conducted using three individual recovered plasma donations. Bacteria growth inhibition tests were performed using discs soaked with plasma samples whether containing the S/D agents or not. RESULTS: The mean reduction factors of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae due to complement during S/D treatment were >8.75, 4.71, and 4.18 log in pooled plasma and >7.42, 2.24 and >6.08 log in individual plasmas, respectively. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were inactivated by S/D (>7.04 and 1.60 log in pooled, and >6.06 and 2.39 in individual plasmas, respectively). Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterobacter cloacae did not multiply during S/D treatment of plasma. Growth inhibition tests revealed an inhibition of three gram-negative bacteria by complement and all gram-positive by S/D. CONCLUSION: The S/D treatment of plasma does not alter the bactericidal activity of complement, and inactivates some gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Metal complexes of diisopropylthiourea: synthesis, characterization and antibacterial studies.
AB  - Co(II), Cu(II), Zn(II) and Fe(III) complexes of diisopropylthiourea have been synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, molar conductivity, magnetic susceptibility, FTIR and electronic spectroscopy. The compounds are non-electrolytes in solution and spectroscopic data of the complexes are consistent with 4-coordinate geometry for the metal(II) complexes and six coordinate octahedral for Fe(III) complex. The complexes were screened for their antibacterial activities against six bacteria: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas auriginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus pumilus. The complexes showed varied antibacterial activities and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined.
TI  - Exploration of in vitro time point quantitative evaluation of newly synthesized benzimidazole and benzothiazole derivatives as potential antibacterial agents.
AB  - Present communication deals with the in vitro time point quantitative antibacterial evaluation of newly synthesized 1,2-disubstituted benzimidazoles (3a-p) and 2-substituted benzothiazoles (5a-h) against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Gram-negative bacteria Vibrio cholerae, Shigella dysenteriae and Escherichia coli. These compounds were synthesized under mild reaction conditions using Al(2)O(3)-Fe(2)O(3) nanocrystals as heterogeneous catalyst. Bio-evaluation studies revealed that, compounds 3a, 5a and 5d exhibited moderate to good antibacterial activity against all the tested bacterial stains. The compounds 3a, 3f and 5a have shown enhanced inhibitory activity compared with standard antibacterial drug ciprofloxacin against V. cholerae, B. cereus, and S. dysenteriae, respectively. Additionally, the compounds 3a, 3e, 3f, 3h and 5b displayed complete bactericidal activity within 24 h, whereas ciprofloxacin took 48 h to kill those bacteria completely.
TI  - [Etiological aspects of acute gastroenteritis--a ten-year review (1.01. 2001-31.12.2010)].
AB  - Acute gastroentritis is one of the most common diseases in humans, and continues  to be a significant cause of morbidity worldwide. AIMS: To determine the bacterial pathogens associated with gastroenteritis in patients admitted to the Iasi Infectious Diseases Hospital in the last ten years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40481 stool samples were examined using conventional methods. RESULTS: Bacteria were found in 7.36% of cases, and parasites in 9.64%; 83% of the cases were viral, micotic, or disbiotic. The bacterial etiology was dominated by Salmonella spp. (58.34%), Shigella spp. (27.08%), Yersinia enterocolitica 03 (8.53%), Campylobacter spp. (1.31%), other bacterial pathogens (EPEC, Aeromonas hydrophilla/caviae/sobria, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, etc) being detected in 3.74% of the cases. Of the Salmonella species, group B (51.99%) followed by group D (45.23%) were most common. Shigella sonnei and Shigella flexneri were found in almost the same proportion (49.45% and 49.70%, respectively); Shigella boydii was isolated in only 0.85% of cases. The trend of gastroenteritis caused by bacterial pathogens is decreasing: from 355 cases in 2001 to 105 cases in 2010; three peaks have been recorded in 2002, 2005 (when Salmonella typhi was isolated in a patient), and 2008 (469, 409, and 252 cases, respectively). Bacterial gastroenteritis affected both sexes almost equally (122 males and 118 females). The most affected age groups were: 0 - 4 years, 15 - 24 years, 5 - 14 years and 25 - 39 years. CONCLUSIONS: Laboratory investigations are essential in determining the etiology of gastroenteritis. Its unpredictable incidence justifies the human and material efforts aimed at controlling the spread of potentially epidemic acute gastroenteritis.
TI  - Salt sensitivity of minimal twin arginine translocases.
AB  - Bacterial twin arginine translocation (Tat) pathways have evolved to facilitate transport of folded proteins across membranes. Gram-negative bacteria contain a TatABC translocase composed of three subunits named TatA, TatB, and TatC. In contrast, the Tat translocases of most Gram-positive bacteria consist of only TatA and TatC subunits. In these minimal TatAC translocases, a bifunctional TatA subunit fulfils the roles of both TatA and TatB. Here we have probed the importance of conserved residues in the bifunctional TatAy subunit of Bacillus subtilis by site-specific mutagenesis. A set of engineered TatAy proteins with mutations in the cytoplasmic hinge and amphipathic helix regions were found to be inactive in protein translocation under standard growth conditions for B. subtilis or when heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. Nevertheless, these mutated TatAy proteins did assemble into TatAy and TatAyCy complexes, and they facilitated membrane association of twin arginine precursor proteins in E. coli. Interestingly, most of the mutated TatAyCy translocases were salt-sensitive in B. subtilis. Similarly, the TatAC translocases of Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were salt-sensitive when expressed in B. subtilis. Taken together, our present observations imply that salt-sensitive electrostatic interactions have critical roles in the preprotein translocation activity of certain TatAC type translocases from Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Hyicin 3682, a bioactive peptide produced by Staphylococcus hyicus 3682 with potential applications for food preservation.
AB  - Bacteriocins are peptides produced by bacteria and having inhibitory activity against other bacteria. Many of these substances may be useful as antibacterial agents for practical applications. In this study, 21 Staphylococcus spp. isolated from pigs, dogs and bovine milk in different states of Brazil were investigated for staphylococcin production. Hyicin 3682, a bacteriocin produced by one such strain, inhibited almost all strains tested, including Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. PCR experiments showed that hyicin 3682 is lantibiotic-related, but not identical, to both epidermin and Bsa. The maximum production of hyicin 3682 (6,400 AU/ml) was observed after 24 h of growth in BHI medium at 37 degrees C. Hyicin 3682 proved to be a cationic, small antimicrobial peptide with a molecular mass of 2,139 Da. It exhibited resistance to low pH and to heating at 65 degrees C, and partial sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes. Taken together, these results suggest that hyicin 3682, the first bacteriocin characterized in Staphylococcus hyicus, has potential biotechnological applications as a food preservative. Moreover, hyicin 3682 was able to inhibit its producer strain, suggesting that an effective immune system for specific protection against hyicin 3682 is not found in its producer strain, a characteristic not described thus far for other staphylococcins.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity, cytotoxicity, and phytochemical screening of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. leaf extract (Apocynaceae).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the antibacterial, antifungal, antiprotozoal, cytotoxic,  and phytochemical properties of ethanol extracts of leaves of Voacanga globosa (Blanco) Merr. (V. globosa). METHODS: The extracts were tested against bacteria and fungus through disc diffusion assay; against protozoa through growth curve determination, antiprotozoal and cytotoxicity assays. RESULTS: The extract revealed antibacterial activities, inhibiting the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus luteus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Antifungal assay showed that it inhibited Candida albicans. The antiprotozoal assay against Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica showed that V. globosa can inhibit the parasites, wherein the action can be comparable to metronidazole. With the in situ cell death detection kit, Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica exposed to V. globosa leaf extract was observed to fluoresce simultaneously in red and yellow signals signifying apoptotic-like changes. Preliminary phytochemical screening revealed the chemical composition of plant extract containing alkaloids, saponins, 2-deoxysugars, and hydrolysable tannins. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this study provides scientific evidence on the traditional use of V. globosa leaf extract in treating microbial diseases. Further, the leaf extract can possibly be used to produce alternative forms of antimicrobials.
TI  - A new sesquiterpene from endophytic fungus Aspergillus sp.
AB  - A fungal strain named YLF-14 was isolated from the leaf of Altingia yunnunensis.  Based on the sequence at the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the strain was identified as an Aspergillus sp.. A new sesquiterpene 5beta,8abeta-dimethyl-3,4,4abeta,5,6,7,8,8a-octahydronaphthalene-1,2,5alpha-trime thanol (1) and a known compound 12-N-methylcyclo-(L-tryptophyl-L-phenylalanyl) (2) were isolated from the culture of this strain. Bioassay experiments showed that the two compounds had no obvious effect on the growth of tested bacteria and nematodes.
TI  - Defense role of the cocoon in the silk worm Bombyx mori L.
AB  - Silk from the domesticated silk worm Bombyx mori procures foreign body response naturally, so it has been utilized as a biomaterial for decades. In India the prime focus of the sericulture industry is to improve silk production with high quality silk. Naturally, the silk worm builds its cocoon not only with silk proteins, but also with antimicrobial proteins to avoid infection since the cocoon is non-motile and non-feeding. The aim of the present study is to elucidate the antimicrobial proteins that persist in the cocoon of the silk worm Bombyx mori. At the pupal stage, the silk worm cocoon shell extract was prepared from the day of pupation (P0) to the day of natural rupture of the cocoon for the eclosion of moth (NR). Using the cocoon shell extract a microbial susceptibility test was performed by the disc diffusion method against the microbes Escherchia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The development of a zone of inhibition against the microbes confirmed the presence of antimicrobial/immunogenic activity of the cocoon shell extract. For further analysis, the cocoon shell extract was subjected to 7-15% sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The protein profile of the cocoon extract revealed the coomassie blue stained bands resolved from the 150-15 kDa molecular range. Interestingly, a polypeptide localized at around 29 kDa showed remarkable expressional changes during the development of pupa. To characterize the 29 kDa protein, it was eluted from the gel, digested with trypsin and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The trypsin-digested peptide peaks were analyzed through MASCOT and peptides were matched with the NCBI nr database. The peptides were very well matched with the 18 wheeler protein, which is reported to be responsible for innate immunity, belonging to the Toll family in insects and responsible for cellular mediated immunity.
TI  - Bacterial inactivation using silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles as functional antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The ability for silver nanoparticles to function as an antibacterial agent while  being separable from the target fluids is important for bacterial inactivation in biological fluids. This report describes the analysis of the antimicrobial activities of silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles synthesized by wet chemical methods. The bacterial inactivation of several types of bacteria was analyzed, including Gram-positive bacteria ( Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus ) and Gram-negative bacteria ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterobacter cloacae , and Escherichia coli ). The results have demonstrated the viability of the silver-coated magnetic nanoparticles for achieving effective bacterial inactivation efficiency comparable to and better than that of silver nanoparticles conventionally used. The bacteria inactivation efficiency of our silver-coated MnZn ferrite (MZF@Ag) nanoparticles was also determined for blood platelets samples, demonstrating the potential of utilization in inactivating bacterial growth in platelets prior to transfusion to ensure blood product safety, which also has important implications for enabling the capability of effective separation, delivery, and targeting of the antibacterial agents.
TI  - Antibacterial characteristics and activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives  prepared by the Maillard reaction.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of water-soluble chitosan derivatives prepared by Maillard reactions against Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Shigella dysenteriae, and Salmonella typhimurium was examined. Relatively high antibacterial activity against various microorganisms was noted for the chitosan-glucosamine derivative as compared to the acid-soluble chitosan. In addition, it was found that the susceptibility of the test organisms to the water-soluble chitosan derivative was higher in deionized water than in saline solution. Metal ions were also found to reduce the antibacterial activity of the water-soluble chitosan derivative on S. aureus. The marked increase in glucose level, protein content and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was observed in the cell supernatant of S. aureus exposed to the water-soluble chitosan derivative in deionized water. The results suggest that the water-soluble chitosan produced by Maillard reaction may be a promising commercial substitute for acid-soluble chitosan.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oil of Achillea cretica L. (Asteraceae) from Turkey.
AB  - Hydrodistilled volatile oil from the aerial parts of Achillea cretica L. (Asteraceae) was analysed by a combination of GC and GC/MS. Seventy-six components were identified, constituting 86.4% of the oil. The main constituents of the essential oil were caryophylladienol-II (13.4%), beta-maaliene (6.1%), neo-intermedeol (6.0%), carvone (4.9%), spathulenol (4.5%), palmitic acid (3.3%) and selina-3,11-dien-6alpha-ol (3.2%). The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the broth-dilution method on nine microbial strains and showed to be quite strong against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. The antibacterial properties of A. cretica justify its use in traditional medicine for the treatment of wounds, contaminated through bacterial infections.
TI  - Effect of povidone-iodine concentration and exposure time on bacteria isolated from endophthalmitis cases.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the in vitro susceptibility of post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis bacterial isolates to different concentrations of povidone-iodine at different exposure times. SETTING: Poostchi Ophthalmology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran. DESIGN: Experimental study. METHODS: Ocular-fluid samples obtained from patients diagnosed with postoperative endophthalmitis were submitted to a microbiology laboratory for culture. One milliliter of microbial isolate suspension with a McFarland standard turbidity of 0.5 was mixed with 1 mL of 1%, 2%, 5%, and 10% povidone-iodine solutions. After 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 15 minutes of exposure at 37 degrees C, each solution was transferred to appropriate culture media and incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. RESULTS: Organisms were isolated in 30 (68%) of the 44 patients evaluated. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus was identified in 14 cases (47%), Streptococcus species in 8 cases (27%), Staphylococcus aureus in 5 cases (17%), Bacillus cereus in 2 cases (6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 1 case (3%). Higher povidone-iodine concentrations and longer exposure times were more effective than lower povidone-iodine concentrations or shorter exposure in preventing growth of bacterial isolates. The most effective regimens were 5% povidone-iodine for 15 minutes and 10% povidone-iodine for at least 5 minutes. With a high bacterial load, 13% of bacterial isolates remain viable after exposure to 10% povidone-iodine, even with a long exposure time. CONCLUSION: Results indicate that using 5% povidone-iodine for 15 minutes or 10% povidone-iodine for 5 minutes can prevent the growth of most post-cataract surgery endophthalmitis bacterial isolates.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of various leaf extracts of Merremia emarginata.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antibacterial activity and phytochemical screening  of the aqueous, methanol and petroleum ether leaf extracts of Merremia emarginata (M. emarginata). METHODS: The antibacterial activity of leaf extracts of M. emarginata were evaluated by agar well diffusion method against four selected bacterial species. RESULTS: The presence of tannins, flavonoids, amino acids, starch, glycosides and carbohydrates in the different leaf extracts was established. The methanol extract was more effective against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli, whereas aqueous extract was more effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: : The results in the present study suggest that M. emarginata leaf can be used in treating diseases caused by the tested organisms.
TI  - Fluorinated s-triazinyl piperazines as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - A series of 1,3,5-triazine derivatives that contain 4-amino-2-trifluoromethyl-benzonitrile, 8-hydroxyquinoline, and different piperazines as substituents at the carbon atoms of the triazine ring have been synthesized by a simple and efficient synthetic protocol. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated with the aid of IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the compounds was tested against seven bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus MTCC 96, Bacillus cereus MTCC 619, Escherichia coli MTCC 739, Pseudomonas aeruginosa MTCC 741, Klebsiella pneumoniae MTCC 109, Salmonella typhi MTCC 733, Proteus vulgaris MTCC 1771) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger MTCC 282, Aspergillus fumigatus MTCC 343, Aspergillus clavatus MTCC 1323, Candida albicans MTCC 183). The results indicate that some of the novel s-triazines have noteworthy activity in minimum inhibitory concentration as well as agar diffusion tests.
TI  - Efficacy of intravascular catheter lock solutions containing preservatives in the prevention of microbial colonization.
AB  - There is little published evidence regarding whether heparin lock solutions containing preservatives prevent catheter-related infections. However, adverse effects from preservative-containing flushes have been documented in neonates, leading many hospitals to avoid their use altogether. Infection control records from 1982 to 2008 at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) were reviewed regarding the incidence of catheter-related infections and the use of preservative-containing intravenous locks. In addition, the antimicrobial activities of heparin lock solution containing the preservatives parabens (0.165%) or benzyl alcohol (0.9%), and 70% ethanol were examined against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, and compared with preservative-free saline with and without heparin. Growth was assessed after exposure to test solutions for 0, 2, 4 and 24h at 35 degrees C. The activities of preservatives were assessed against both planktonic (free-floating) and sessile (biofilm-embedded) micro-organisms using the MBEC Assay. Infection control records revealed two periods of increased catheter-related infections, corresponding with two intervals when preservative-free heparin was used at SJCRH. Heparin solution containing preservatives demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile forms of all six microbial species. Ethanol demonstrated the greatest antimicrobial activity, especially following short incubation periods. Heparin lock solutions containing the preservatives parabens or benzyl alcohol, and 70% ethanol demonstrated significant antimicrobial activity against both planktonic and sessile micro-organisms commonly responsible for catheter-related infections. These findings, together with the authors' historical infection control experience, support the use of preservatives in intravenous lock solutions to reduce catheter related infections in patients beyond the neonatal period.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of hydrogen peroxide and its activation by a novel heterogeneous Fenton's-like modified PAN catalyst.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the potential activation of hydrogen peroxide by a novel catalyst, reducing the concentration of hydrogen peroxide required and the time taken for microbial inactivation. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial properties of an iron-based novel heterogeneous polyacrylonitrile catalyst in combination with hydrogen peroxide were examined against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus using a modified version of the European suspension test. Antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis endospores was also investigated. Bactericidal activity was significantly increased when the polyacrylonitrile catalyst was combined with hydrogen peroxide. 0.2, 0.5 and 1% w/v hydrogen peroxide resulted in average log reductions of 4.76, 5.59 and 5.37 for E. coli, Ps. aeruginosa and Staph. aureus, respectively, after 60 min exposure at room temperature. The catalyst also significantly increased the activity of hydrogen peroxide against B. subtilis and B. cereus endospores. CONCLUSIONS: These studies have demonstrated the potential biocidal use of the novel polyacrylonitrile catalyst when combined with hydrogen peroxide. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first publication to demonstrate the enhanced activity gained using the novel heterogeneous catalyst to potentiate the activity of hydrogen peroxide as a biocide.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Seseli globiferum essential oil.
AB  - The essential oil from aerial parts of Seseli globiferum Vis. obtained by hydrodistillation with Clevenger-type apparatus was analyzed by GC-MS. Twenty-eight compounds were identified, representing 99.4% of the total oil. The main components of the oil were sabinene (38.0%), alpha-pinene (21.2%) and beta-phellandrene (13.5%). The microbial growth inhibitory properties of the isolated essential oil were determined using the broth microdilution method against seven bacterial species: Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 13311), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Enterobacter cloacae (clinical isolates), Bacillus cereus (clinical isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 12228), Micrococcus flavus (ATCC 10240) and three fungal species: Aspergillus niger (ATCC 6275), Aspergillus versicolor (ATCC 11730), Trichoderma viride (IAM 5061) and Penicillium funiculosum (ATCC 36839). The essential oil showed activity against bacteria P. aeruginosa, followed by M flavus, L. monocytigenes and E. coli, and all investigated fungal species.
TI  - Preparation and antimicrobial activity of poly (vinyl chloride)/gelatin/montmorillonite biocomposite films.
AB  - The aim of this study was using a novel antimicrobial thermoplastic plasticizer based on aliphatic anhydride derivative dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DSA) for blending poly (vinyl chloride), PVC, with gelatin in presence of montmorillonite (MMT) using Brabender via polymer melting technique. This anhydride-based plasticizer blended the membrane ingredients homogenously under melting process. The used plasticizer exhibited high performance antimicrobial potency for some biomedical and industrial applications. The prepared biocomposite films were evaluated for antimicrobial activity using agar disc diffusion method against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria such as: Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia), Bacillus cereus (B. cereus), Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). The majority of these biocomposites, except the plasticized PVC with DOP, have shown inhibitory effect at different concentrations (1.0-20) mg/ml against all above mentioned bacteria. However, C. albicans and A. niger were the most resistant strains.
TI  - Protection activity of a novel probiotic strain of Bacillus subtilis against Salmonella Enteritidis infection.
AB  - The activity of 240 bacterial isolates screened from the gastrointestinal tracts  of native chickens were evaluated for use as a potential probiotic in food animal production in order to protect against animal diseases and reduce pathogenic contamination of human food products. In observing the antagonistic activity of 117 bacilli isolates, 10 of these isolates exhibited higher growth inhibition of seven foodborne pathogens, including Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Vibrio cholerae. Beneficial probiotic criteria from these isolates - which included non-pathogenicity, acid and bile salt tolerance, hydrophobicity, and adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells - exhibited that one isolate of NC11 had the most potential as a probiotic. 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that this NC11 isolate was Bacillus subtilis. This B. subtilis NC11 was sensitive to all antibiotics and was not cytotoxic to intestinal epithelial cells. Reduction of S. Enteritidis attachment to the surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells via action of a cultured medium from B. subtilis NC11 was observed by scanning electron microscopy. B. subtilis NC11 cells, as well as the bacterial cultured medium or the cultured medium adjusted to pH 7, significantly inhibited S. Enteritidis invasion (P<0.01) of intestinal epithelial cells. This study indicates that B. subtilis NC11 has characteristics of a potential probiotic, and exhibits strong inhibition activity against S. Enteritidis infection to intestinal epithelial cells.
TI  - Chitosan and silver nanoparticles as pudding with raisins with antimicrobial properties.
AB  - Chitosan nanoparticles (CS-NP) containing small silver nanoparticles are reported (Ag@CS-NP). CS-NP was synthesized using tripolyphosphate (TPP) as a polyanionic template. TPP also served to electrostatically attract Ag(+) inside CS-NP, where it was reduced by the terminal glucosamine units of the biopolymer. This procedure is environmental friendly, inexpensive, and permits the synthesis of very small AgNP (0.93-1.7 nm), with only a discrete dependence from the amount of silver nitrate used (5-200mg). The obtained hybrid nanocomposites Ag@CS-NP were characterized by DLS, HRTEM, and HAADF-STEM presenting a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 78 nm. The antimicrobial activity of Ag@CS-NP against Candida glabrata, Sacharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus corresponded to MIC values lower than for AgNO(3).
TI  - A novel pathogen-binding gC1qR homolog, FcgC1qR, in the Chinese white shrimp, Fenneropenaeus chinensis.
AB  - In vertebrates, the globular "head" of complement component C1q receptor (gC1qR)  is a versatile, multiligand binding protein. However, research on its function in invertebrates is limited. In the present study, a full-length cDNA sequence of a novel gC1qR homolog, FcgC1qR, from the Chinese white shrimp Fenneropenaeus chinensis was cloned. Semi-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected FcgC1qR in all examined tissues, with the highest level detected in the intestine. Western blot assay further revealed that the FcgC1qR protein was distributed in all tested tissues except the cell-free hemolymph of normal Chinese white shrimp. In the expression pattern study, quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that the transcripts of FcgC1qR were up-regulated when challenged with bacteria (Vibrio anguillarum or Staphylococcus aureus) and white spot syndrome virus. Subsequently, FcgC1qR was over-expressed in Escherichia coli, and the polyclonal antibody was prepared with the purified recombinant protein. Microorganism binding was examined using Western blot assay, and revealed that FcgC1qR could bind to Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, S. aureus, V. anguillarum, Vibrioharveyi, and Candida albicans. FcgC1qR was also proven able to bind to S. aureus in a concentration-dependent manner, and this binding activity was partly inhibited by the polyclonal antibody. These results suggest that FcgC1qR may be involved in defending against bacterial infections in the Chinese white shrimp.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of three medicinal Thai plants against Campylobacter jejuni and other foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Leaves of Adenanthera pavonina, Moringa oleifera and Annona squamosa are used in  traditional Thai medicine to treat dysentery and other diseases. This study investigated the antibacterial activity of these plants against six species of foodborne pathogen. Methods and solvents employed to extract active constituents were optimised using the disc diffusion assay. Phytochemical analysis of the optimised extracts was performed by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined by broth microdilution. A. pavonina contained flavonoids, terpines and tannins, and was the most active extract against Campylobacter jejuni, inhibiting growth at 62.5-125 microg mL(-1). The A. squamosa extract contained flavonoids, terpines, tannins and alkaloids, and had the broadest spectrum of antibacterial activity, inhibiting Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and C. jejuni between 62.5 and 500 microg mL(-1). MBCs were 2- to 4-fold higher than MICs against C. jejuni and B. cereus, suggesting the extracts are bactericidal against these species. Negligible activity was detected from M. oleifera. The data presented here show that A. pavonina and A. squamosa could potentially be used in modern applications aimed at the treatment or prevention of foodborne diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from Nunavik collections of the macroalgae Fucus evanescens C. Agardh (Fucaceae).
AB  - This study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga Fucus evanescens in cell culture. Accessions were collected on the Arctic coast of Ungava Bay, Nunavik, Quebec. The crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against Hemophilus influenzae , Legionella pneumophila , Propionibacterium acnes (ATCC and clinical isolate), and Streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/mL. This algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) Clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , whereas Bacillus cereus , Escherichia coli , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. Further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against Propionibacterium acnes showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/mL. The main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl O-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an MIC(100) of 50 microg/mL but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/mL. Therefore, the semipurified F. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different degree of hydrolysis of palm kernel expeller  peptides against spore-forming and non-spore-forming bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to determine inhibitory effect of palm kernel expeller (PKE) peptides of different degree of hydrolysis (DH %) against spore-forming bacteria Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Clostridium perfringens; and non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli, Lisinibacillus sphaericus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A range of DH % (50-100) of PKE peptides was prepared using alcalase, and hydrolysis conditions were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). The influence of pH (6.5-10.5), temperature (35-65 degrees C), enzyme/substrate ratio (1-5%) and substrate concentration (1-2%) were studied on the response of the DH. The antibacterial activity of different DH % of PKE peptides was tested by using disc diffusion assay and micro-broth dilution assay. According to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test on each of the PKE peptides of different DH %, the 70 DH % PKE peptide showed greater inhibitory effect compared to the 100 DH % PKE peptide against B. cereus, B. coagulans, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. stearothermophillus, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Cl. perfringens, Lisinibacillus sphaericus and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The 70 DH % PKE peptides exhibited greatest overall antibacterial effect of the various peptides of PKE evaluated. Further research is needed to determine the mode of action of PKE peptides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Palm kernel expeller peptides, a natural plant product, effectively inhibited the growth of spore-forming and non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. Potentially, PKE peptides could be used in food preservation and developed as antibacterial agent in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antibacterial activity of Melastoma malabathricum L.
AB  - The aqueous methanolic extracts of Melastoma malabathricum L. exhibited antibacterial activity when assayed against seven microorganisms by the agar diffusion method. Solvent fractionation afforded active chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions from the leaves and the flowers, respectively. A phytochemical study resulted in the identification of ursolic acid (1), 2alpha-hydroxyursolic acid (2), asiatic acid (3), beta-sitosterol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4) and the glycolipid glycerol 1,2-dilinolenyl-3-O-beta-D-galactopyanoside (5) from the chloroform fraction. Kaempferol (6), kaempferol 3-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranoside (7), kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (8), kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-galactopyranoside (9), kaempferol 3-O-(2'',6''-di-O-E-p-coumaryl)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (10), quercetin (11) and ellagic acid (12) were found in the ethyl acetate fraction. The structures of these compounds were determined by chemical and spectral analyses. Compounds 1-4, the flavonols (6 and 11) and ellagic acid (12) were found to be active against some of the tested microorganisms, while the kaempferol 3-O-glycosides (7-9) did not show any activity, indicating the role of the free 3-OH for antibacterial activity. Addition of p-coumaryl groups results in mild activity for 10 against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Compounds 2-5, 7 and 9-12 are reported for the first time from M. malabathricum. Compound 10 is rare, being reported only once before from a plant, without assignment of the double bond geometry in the p-coumaryl moiety.
TI  - Investigation of the antimicrobial activity of Rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.).
AB  - The aim of the study was to determine antimicrobial activity of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil extracts. MATERIAL AND METHODS. Ethanol extract from the leaves of rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) was produced at the Department of Food Technology, Kaunas University of Technology. The antimicrobial activity of the viscous extract or rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil was evaluated using standard microorganism cultures (bacteria Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035 and fungi Candida albicans ATCC 60193). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the examined preparations was determined. RESULTS. Both studied preparations - rhaponticum (Rhaponticum carthamoides D.C. Iljin) and shrubby cinquefoil (Potentilla fruticosa L.) - demonstrated similar antimicrobial activity. The highest sensitivity to the studied preparations was observed in microbes with eukaryotic cell structure: Candida albicans, which is a fungus, and a spore-forming prokaryotic bacterium, Bacillus cereus. The highest resistance was observed in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS. The studied preparations - viscous extracts of rhaponticum and shrubby cinquefoil - are substances with antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) bacteria, spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus), and fungi (Candida albicans).
TI  - Survival and growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens in fermenting dough of wadi, a legume-based indigenous food.
AB  - Wadi is a hollow, brittle, ball- or cone-shaped popular traditional legume-based  product of many countries in the Indian Subcontinent. To prepare wadi, blackgram (Phaseolus mungo L.) dhal (dehusked split seeds) was soaked, ground to a soft dough, fermented for 10 h in a closed container, moulded into balls or cones and dried for ~60 h (repeating a cycle of 8 h sun-drying at 29-33 degrees C and then 16 h shade-drying at 28-30 degrees C). This study aims at understanding the fate of some selected foodborne bacterial pathogens during a chance contamination of blackgram dough at the time of preparing wadi. Uninoculated dough, during the course of its processing to wadi, remained free from Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, but got contained by Bacillus cereus during the first 10 h of fermentation and also the next 24 h of drying wadi. B. cereus, when spiked into freshly prepared dough at a load of 5.2 log cfu/g, also diminished after 24 h of drying (detection limit (DL), 100 cfu/g). S. aureus (DL, 100 cfu/g) and E. coli (DL, 10 cfu/g) reached below the DL after 36 h of drying. After 10 h of fermentation and 36 h of drying, the moisture content decreased from initial 61.9 to 33.5%, and the pH declined from 6.0 to 4.8.
TI  - Synthesis and studies of novel 2-(4-cyano-3-trifluoromethylphenyl amino)-4-(quinoline-4-yloxy)-6-(piperazinyl/piperidinyl)-s-triazines as potential antimicrobial, antimycobacterial and anticancer agents.
AB  - A series of novel s-triazine analogs were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (19)F NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. Preliminary screening of target compounds against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneria), four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv indicated that 5d, 5h, 5n, 5p, 5q, 5r, 5s, 5t and 5u were the most active compounds among twenty one studied. Thus, they were further subjected to in vitro biological evaluation against human prostate cancer cell line (DU-145) and the results indicate that two compounds 5n and 5s were markedly active.
TI  - Antioxidant, electrochemical, thermal, antimicrobial and alkane oxidation properties of tridentate Schiff base ligands and their metal complexes.
AB  - In this study, two Schiff base ligands (HL(1) and HL(2)) and their Cu(II), Co(II), Ni(II), Pd(II) and Ru(III) metal complexes were synthesized and characterized by the analytical and spectroscopic methods. Alkane oxidation activities of the metal complexes were studied on cyclohexane as substrate. The ligands and their metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against Corynebacterium xerosis, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus and Enterococcus faecalis (as gram-positive bacteria) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Klebsiella fragilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Candida albicans (as gram-negative bacteria). The antioxidant properties of the Schiff base ligands were evaluated in a series of in vitro tests: 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging and reducing power activity of superoxide anion radical generated non-enzymatic systems. Electrochemical and thermal properties of the compounds were investigated.
TI  - A new class of 2-(4-cyanophenyl amino)-4-(6-bromo-4-quinolinyloxy)-6-piperazinyl  (piperidinyl)-1,3,5-triazine analogues with antimicrobial/antimycobacterial activity.
AB  - This study presents the synthesis and in vitro pharmacological evaluations of novel 2-(4-cyanophenyl amino)-4-(6-bromo-4-quinolinyloxy)-6-piperazinyl (piperidinyl)-1,3,5-triazines. The title compounds were assayed for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against eight bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi, Proteus vulgaris, Shigella flexneria) and four fungi (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus clavatus, Candida albicans) using paper disc diffusion and agar streak dilution method as well as against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain using BACTEC MGIT and Lowenstein-Jensen MIC method. The bioassay results indicate that nine compounds namely 5d, 5h, 5n, 5p, 5q, 5r, 5s, 5t and 5u could be considered as possible potential agents with dual antimicrobial and antimycobacterial activities. The structures of the compounds were elucidated with the aid of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, (19)F NMR spectroscopy and CHN analysis.
TI  - Hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  - In order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the Greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). In all cold meat preparations Clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and other Clostridium sp lec(-), as well as Lactobacillus, Bacillus sp. and Salmonella sp. were recovered. For instance Bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. L. monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter lari were absent. Differences in the occurrence of S. aureus, Salmonella sp., E. coli and spore forms of C. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). Antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. A multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. Albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. Antibiotics commonly used for therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. Systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.
TI  - Detection, cellular localization and antibacterial activity of two lytic enzymes  of Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8042.
AB  - AIM: In Pediococcus acidilactici ATCC 8042, two activities of peptidoglycan hydrolase (PGH) with lytic effect against Micrococcus lysodeikticus and Staphylococcus aureus have been detected. This work intends to elucidate the growth phase of maximum lytic activity, the localization and the effectiveness of the activity against pathogenic Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cells were grown in MRS medium and collected at different growth stages, and the proteins were extracted. The highest PGH activity was found during the logarithmic growth phase in the protein fraction bound to the cell membrane. From this fraction, two distinct proteins bands (110- and 99-kDa) in SDS-PAGE were partially purified with a three-step procedure. Both bands showed lytic activity against M. lysodeikticus. Mass spectrometry analysis (LC/ESI-MS/MS) indicated that the 110-kDa band corresponded to a protein of unknown function. The 99-kDa band corresponded to a N-acetylmuramidase that harboured catalytic sites with N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase and N-acetylglucosaminidase activities. Both proteins are reported in the Ped. acidilactici 7_4 genome. The fraction containing the concentrated proteins (110 and 99 kDa) inhibited the growth of several pathogenic strains as: Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium. The growth of S. aureus was diminished by 3 logarithmic units as early as 0.5 h of growth, while inhibition of Escherichia coli and Ped. acidilactici was observed after 18 and 8 h, respectively (both in one logarithmic unit). The minimum inhibitory concentration against S. aureus was 10 mug ml(-1). CONCLUSION: Pediococcus acidilactici harbours at least two lytic enzymes, one of them recognized as PGH for the first time, which exert antibacterial activity against several bacterial strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Both PGH activities have a broad growth inhibition spectrum and could be used to control pathogenic bacteria. Because this activity comes from a lactic acid bacterium, it could be safely used in manufacturing processes of fermented foods.
TI  - Anti-proliferative activity of meroditerpenoids isolated from the brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme against several cancer cell lines.
AB  - The sea constitutes one of the most promising sources of novel compounds with potential application in human therapeutics. In particular, algae have proved to be an interesting source of new bioactive compounds. In this work, six meroditerpenoids (epitaondiol, epitaondiol diacetate, epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate, 14-ketostypodiol diacetate and stypodiol) isolated from the brown alga Stypopodium flabelliforme were tested for their cell proliferation inhibitory activity in five cell lines. Cell lines tested included human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2), human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y), rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3), murine macrophages (RAW.267) and Chinese hamster fibroblasts (V79). Antimicrobial activity of the compounds was also evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Micrococcus luteus. Overall, the compounds showed good activity against all cell lines, with SH-SY5Y and RAW.267 being the most susceptible. Antimicrobial capacity was observed for epitaondiol monoacetate, stypotriol triacetate and stypodiol, with the first being the most active. The results suggest that these molecules deserve further studies in order to evaluate their potential as therapeutic agents.
TI  - Examining the genetic variation of reference microbial cultures used within food  and environmental laboratories using fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis.
AB  - Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) analysis was applied to genetically fingerprint 'working culture control strains' used by accredited food microbiology laboratories. A working culture control strain is defined as a subculture from a strain initially obtained from an authenticated source [such as the National Collection of Type Cultures (NCTC)] that is maintained for use with routine testing within the laboratory. Working culture control strains from eight food examination laboratories, representing four bacterial species, were analysed by FAFLP; these were Salmonella Nottingham, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus. The resultant FAFLP profiles of the eight working culture control strains for each of these species were compared against the appropriate freeze-dried ampoules obtained directly from NCTC. FAFLP results demonstrated that within 50% of working cultures analysed, several laboratories were routinely using working cultures that were genetically different from the original reference NCTC strains. This study highlights the need for laboratories to review the protocols used to process and maintain control strains and working cultures, with a potential view to utilize single-use quality control materials.
TI  - Phytochemical analysis and antimicrobial activities of methanolic extracts of leaf, stem and root from different varieties of Labisa pumila Benth.
AB  - A local herb, Kacip Fatimah, is famous amongst Malay women for its uses in parturition; however, its phytochemical contents have not been fully documented. Therefore, a study was performed to evaluate the phenolics, flavonoids, and total saponin contents, and antibacterial and antifungal properties of the leaf, stem and root of three varieties of Labisia pumila Benth. Total saponins were found to be higher in the leaves of all three varieties, compared to the roots and stems. Leaves of var. pumila exhibited significantly higher total saponin content than var. alata and lanceolata, with values of 56.4, 43.6 and 42.3 mg diosgenin equivalent/g dry weight, respectively. HPLC analyses of phenolics and flavonoids in all three varieties revealed the presence of gallic acid, caffeic acid, rutin, and myricetin in all plant parts. Higher levels of flavonoids (rutin, quercitin, kaempferol) were observed in var. pumila compared with alata and lanceolata, whereas higher accumulation of phenolics (gallic acid, pyrogallol) was recorded in var. alata, followed by pumila and lanceolata. Antibacterial activities of leaf, stem and root extracts of all varieties determined against both Gram positive (Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis B145, Bacillus cereus B43, Staphylococcus aureus S1431) and Gram negative (Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumonia K36, Escherichia coli E256, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI96) pathogens showed that crude methanolic extracts are active against these bacteria at low concentrations, albeit with lower antibacterial activity compared to kanamycin used as the control. Antifungal activity of methanolic extracts of all plant parts against Fusarium sp., Candida sp. and Mucor using the agar diffusion disc exhibited moderate to appreciable antifungal activities compared to streptomycin used as positive control.
TI  - Preparation of mucoadhesive oral patches containing tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol for treatment of local mouth bacterial infections and candidiasis.
AB  - The specific aim of this work was to prepare mucoadhesive patches containing tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol in an attempt to develop a novel oral drug delivery system for the treatment of mouth infections. The bilayered patches were prepared using ethyl cellulose as a backing layer and carbopol 934 as a matrix mucoadhesive layer. Patches were prepared with different loading amounts of tetracycline hydrochloride and carvacrol. The antimicrobial activity was assessed for the prepared patches using the disc-diffusion method against the yeast Candida albicans and five bacterial strains, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus bronchispti. In this work, we highlighted the possibility of occurrence of a synergistic action between carvacrol and tetracycline. The best formulation was selected based on microbiological tests, drug release, ex-vivo mucoadhesive performance, and swelling index. Physical characteristics of the selected formulations were determined. These included pH, patch thickness, weight uniformity, content uniformity, folding endurance, and patch stability.
TI  - Natural resistance of rose petals to microbial attack.
AB  - Petals of red, yellow and white roses (Rosa damascene Mill.) of the family Rosaceae were extracted with (1:1) methylene chloride/methanol and tested for their antimicrobial activities against four species of Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus and Staphylococcus aureus), five species of Gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marcescens) and five species of fungi (Penicillium notatum, Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus stolonifer, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum). All of the crude extracts showed a wide range of antimicrobial activities according to the tested organism and rose's type. Micrococcus luteus was found to be the most susceptible bacteria to all crude extracts. Red and yellow petal extracts showed much higher antibacterial activity than the white petals extract. Bacillus subtilis was found to be the least susceptible to all extracts. The fungus, Penicillium notatum was found to be the most susceptible with white petal extract being the most effective. Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Fusarium oxysporum were the least susceptible to all extracts. White roses extract showed much higher antifungal activities against Penicillium notatum than red or yellow roses, therefore, it was subjected to several bioassay guided chromatographic fractionations and purification to isolate the active chemical(s) responsible for the antifungal activity. Chemical structure of the isolated antifungal compounds were identified by spectroscopy techniques and found to be a gamma-sitosterol and (Z,Z)-9,12-octadecadienoic acid. Antibacterial activity of the various types of rose extracts were due to complex mixtures of organic compounds which are still under chemical investigation and will be published later.
TI  - Bacterial load of fresh vegetables and their resistance to the currently used antibiotics in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - This study was carried out to describe the bacterial load and the occurrence of some disease-causing enteric bacteria on raw vegetables sold in Saudi markets. The study further aimed to analyze antibiotic resistance rates, production of extended-spectrum beta lactamase, and plasmid carriage among bacterial population of raw vegetables. Results revealed that none of them contained Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, and Escherichia coli O157:H7. However, Staphylococcus aureus and Shigella were detected in 11.8% and 4.4% of the samples, respectively. The bacterial loads ranged from 3 to 8 log(10) CFUg(-1) for aerobic bacteria and 1 to 4 log(10) CFUg(-1) for coliforms as well as Enterobacteriaceae. The isolates exhibited resistance in decreasing order for ampicillin (76.5%), cephalothin (69.5%), trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole (36.7%), aminoglycosides (21.9%), tetracycline (17.2%), fluoroquinolones (17.2%), amoxycillin-clavulanic acid (13.3%), and chloramphenicol (7.8%). Maximum resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics occurred in 14.8% of isolates and the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was achieved by 2.3% of isolates. Multiple resistances to four or more antimicrobial agents along with plasmid with varied sizes were documented. These investigations indicate the occurrence of antibiotic resistance and plasmid carriage among bacterial isolates populating raw vegetables.
TI  - Isolation of glucosidase and phospholipase positive Bacillus circulans on ALOA medium.
AB  - AIM: To report the growth of glucosidase and phospholipase positive bacteria on agar Listeria according to Ottaviani and Agosti (ALOA) different from Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus. METHODS AND RESULTS: Raw water-buffalo milk was analysed according to EN ISO 11290. Streaking of Fraser broth on ALOA resulted in green colonies with an opaque halo after 48 h at 30 degrees C. Colonies were transferred onto Tryptone soya yeast extract agar and showed cultural characteristics atypical for L. monocytogenes. Results of confirmation tests according to EN ISO 11290 method: negative haemolysis test, weak positive camp test in correspondence with Staphylococcus aureus, no fermentation of rhamnose, fermentation of xylose. Gram staining showed tapered, curved, Gram-positive rods with subterminal to terminal ellipsoidal spores, 0.5-0.7 mum diameter 4-5 mum. API 50CH CHB kit (99.9% percentage of identification) and the sequence of the 833 bp PCR product (portion of 16S rRNA, generic primers 1492-r; p27-f) showed 97% identity with Bacillus circulans ATCC 4513 (GenBank AY724690). CONCLUSIONS: Some B. circulans strains can grow on ALOA, according to ISO 11290, confirmation tests readily differentiate B. circulans from L. monocytogenes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The different morphology of the colonies must be kept in mind to select true L. monocytogenes for confirmation test and to avoid overestimation of L. monocytogenes count.
TI  - Antibacterial peptides derived from caprine whey proteins, by digestion with human gastrointestinal juice.
AB  - Peptides in caprine whey were identified after in vitro digestion with human gastrointestinal enzymes in order to determine their antibacterial effect. The digestion was performed in two continuing steps using human gastric juice (pH 2.5) and human duodenal juice (pH 8) at 37 degrees C. After digestion the hydrolysate was fractionated and 106 peptides were identified. From these results, twenty-two peptides, located in the protein molecules, were synthesised and antibacterial activity examined. Strong activity of the hydrolysates was detected against Escherichia coli K12, Bacillus cereus RT INF01 and Listeria monocytogenes, less activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25 923 and no effect on Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG. The pure peptides showed less antibacterial effect than the hydrolysates. When comparing the peptide sequences from human gastrointestinal enzymes with previously identified peptides from non-human enzymes, only two peptides, beta-lactoglobulin f(92-100) and beta-casein f(191-205) matched. No peptides corresponded to the antibacterial caprine lactoferricin f(14-42) or lactoferrampin C f(268-284). Human gastrointestinal enzymes seem to be more complex and have different cleavage points in their protein chains compared with purified non-human enzymes. Multiple sequence alignment of nineteen peptides showed proline-rich sequences, neighbouring leucines, resulting in a consensus sequence LTPVPELK. In such a way proline and leucine may restrict further proteolytic processing. The present study showed that human gastrointestinal enzymes generated different peptides from caprine whey compared with non-human enzymes and a stronger antibacterial effect of the hydrolysates than the pure peptides was shown. Antimicrobial activity against pathogens but not against probiotics indicate a possible host-protective activity of whey.
TI  - Occurrence of microorganisms of public health and spoilage significance in fruit  juices sold in retail markets in Greece.
AB  - Fruit juices are an important part of the modern diet in many countries. However, few data are available concerning the microbiological quality of the fruit juices sold in Greece. Using standard microbiological procedures, we conducted a bacteriological survey of commercially sold, pasteurized, shelf-stable fruit juices from retail markets. A total of 120 samples of fruit juices sold in various retail markets were examined for their bacteriological quality. The pH of the tested juices was 2.4-4.8. Bacteria were isolated from 51 samples (42.5%) and fungi from 78 samples (65%). Escherichia coli O157:H7 was detected in four of the analyzed samples (3.34%), and Staphylococcus aureus was detected in four different samples (3.34%). In 11 samples (9.1%), the total number of microorganisms detected was as high as 125 colony-forming units (CFU). Acidophilic microorganisms were isolated from 26 samples (21.7%) and Blastomyces was detected in 46 samples (38.3%). All samples were negative for Lactobacillus, Clostridium perfrigens, Salmonella spp., Bacillus cereus, total coliforms, E. coli, and Listeria monocytogenes. Many of the microorganisms detected may cause disease in humans; thus, a number of the tested samples did not meet the Greek guidelines for the microbiological quality of juices. Use of a Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) system should be generally introduced into the juice industry sector to improve the quality of fruit juices, as well as other manufactured foods.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activities of hexahydroimidazo[1,5-a]pyridinium bromides with varying benzyl substituents.
AB  - Variously substituted benzyl bromides were employed to quaternize hexahydrobenzylimidazo[1,5-a]pyridine (A) and the resulting bromides (1-11) were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against 10 pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumonia, Candida albicans and Candida krusei. Antimicrobial activities were surprisingly high (MIC: 0.78-400 mug/mL) and the sensitivity of the salts tested has been found to depend strongly both on the benzyl substituents and the microorganisms used. However, the correlation observed between antimicrobial activity and calculated partition coefficient (ClogP) was poor. Acute toxicity assessment of these salts showed LD(50) of 757-2000 mg/kg, after oral administration in mice in 24h.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial activity of 3-butenyl, 4-pentenyl, 2-phenylethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanate in Brassica vegetables.
AB  - This study investigated antibacterial activities of 4 isothiocyanates (3-butenyl, 4-phentenyl, 2-phenylethyl, and benzyl isothiocyanate) against 4 Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) and 7 Gram-negative bacteria (Aeromonas hydrophila, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella choleaesuis, Salmonella enterica, Serratia marcescens, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) by an agar disc diffusion assay. Benzyl isothiocyanate (> 90.00 mm inhibition zone diameter at 0.1 muL/mL) and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (58.33 mm at 0.2 muL/mL) showed large inhibition zones especially against B. cereus. Also, 3-butenyl isothiocyanate (21.67 mm at 1.0 muL/mL) and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate (19.67 mm at 1.0 muL/mL) displayed potent antibacterial activity against A. hydrophila. Benzyl and 2-phenylethyl isothiocyanate indicated higher activity against most of the pathogenic bacteria than 3-butenyl and 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate, and were more effective against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis, antibacterial activity and quantum-chemical studies of novel 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole analogues.
AB  - A new series of 2-arylidenehydrazinyl-4-arylthiazole derivatives (2a-k) was designed and synthesized through a rapid, simple, and efficient methodology in excellent isolated yield. These compounds were screened for in vitro antimicrobial activities against eight bacteria, e.g. Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, and three fungi e.g. Aspergillus oryzae, Candida albicans, and Saccharomyces cerevis. The results indicate that some of the compounds exhibit strong antibacterial activity, depending on the bacterial strain, but show virtually no antifungal activity. The structure-antibacterial activity relationships were studied using some physicochemical and quantum-chemical parameters with the ab initio Hartree-Fock model at the RHF/6-31G level of theory. A good qualitative correlation between predicted lipophilic parameters and antibacterial activity has been found.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different honeys against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - To study the antimicrobial activity of honey, 60 samples of various botanical origin were evaluated for their antimicrobial activities against 16 clinical pathogens and their respective reference strains. The microbiological quality of honeys and the antibiotic susceptibility of the various isolates were also examined. The bioassay applied for determining the antimicrobial effect employs the well-agar diffusion method and the estimation of minimum active dilution which produces a 1mm diameter inhibition zone. All honey samples, despite their origin (coniferous, citrus, thyme or polyfloral), showed antibacterial activity against the pathogenic and their respective reference strains at variable levels. Coniferous and thyme honeys showed the highest activity with an average minimum dilution of 17.4 and 19.2% (w/v) followed by citrus and polyfloral honeys with 20.8 and 23.8% respectively. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica subsp. Enterica, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were proven to be up to 60% more resistant than their equal reference strains thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey and the need for further research.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Blumea balsamifera (Lin.) DC. extracts and essential oil.
AB  - Leaves of Blumea balsamifera (Lin.) DC. are used in traditional Thai and Chinese  medicine for the treatment of septic wounds and other infections. In this study, the essential oil, hexane, dichloromethane and methanol extracts of these leaves were evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities using the disc diffusion assay and agar microdilution method. The essential oil was the most potent, with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 150 microg mL(-)(1) against Bacillus cereus and an MIC of 1.2 mg mL(-)(1) against Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. Activity was also detected from the hexane extract against Enterobacter cloacae and S. aureus. Minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentrations were typically equal to or two-fold higher than the MICs for both extracts, indicating microbicidal activity. The present data show that B. balsamifera extracts have activity against various infectious and toxin-producing microorganisms. This plant's active constituents could potentially be developed for use in the treatment and/or prevention of microbial disease.
TI  - Phenolic composition and antimicrobial and antiquorum sensing activity of an ethanolic extract of peels from the apple cultivar Annurca.
AB  - This study investigated the phenolic composition and antioxidant capacity of an ethanolic extract from the peel of the Annurca (Malus domestica var. Annurca), which is widespread in the Campania region of southern Italy. The antimicrobial effect of the extract on different pathogens was also examined. The potential antiquorum sensing activity of the extract was tested by using the microorganism Chromobacterium violaceum. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography revealed that rutin, epicatechin, dicaffeoylquinic acid, and caffeic acid were the most abundant phenolic compounds in the extract; these compounds constituted 27.43%, 24.93%, 16.14%, and 15.3% of the total phenols, respectively. The test for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl free radical-scavenging activity showed that the extract possessed an impressive antioxidant capacity (50% effective concentration of 2.50 mug/g of product). Furthermore, the extract clearly exhibited antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus (11- to 14-mm diameter of inhibition halo, depending on the strain) and Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 (10-mm diameter of inhibition halo). No activity was observed against the probiotic lactobacilli tested or against Staphylococcus aureus. Antiquorum sensing activity was reported for the first time for apple extracts. In conclusion, these results indicate the potential of this extract for treating some microbial infections through cell growth inhibition or quorum sensing antagonism, thereby validating the health benefits of apples.
TI  - Antagonistic bacteria from live corals, Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India.
AB  - The objective of this study is to isolate and production of secondary metabolites with bioactive substances by coral reef (Acropora formosa and Favia palida) associated bacteria was carried out from the Tuticorin coastal waters, Southeastern India. The isolated coral associated bacteria were found to have an antagonistic effect against 10 human pathogens. The pathogens were Escherichia coli, Shigella dysentriae, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aerogenosa, Vibrio cholerae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. faecalis and Bacillus cereus. It was observed that, out of the total 689 bacterial strains isolated, 10 and 13% of isolates from A. formosa and Favia palida, respectively were found to have antagonistic activity against the pathogens, A higher percentage of antagonistic strains were conferred from Favia palida with 13%. It was observed that all antagonistic strains were able to inhibit at least two of the human pathogens.
TI  - An eight-year report on the implementation of HACCP in a university canteen: impact on the microbiological quality of meals.
AB  - An investigation aimed at assessing the microbiological quality of meals consumed at a university canteen after implementation of the HACCP system and personnel training was carried out. Cooked and warm-served products (74 samples), cooked and cold-served products (92 samples) and cold gastronomy products (63 samples) sampled from 2000 to 2007 underwent microbiological analyses. All the samples were tested for: Samonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, total mesophilic aerobes, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and sulphite-reducing clostridia. The microbiological contamination of work surfaces (tables, tablewares, cutters, ladles, slicing machines, wash-basins, etc.), hands and white coats of members of the canteen staff was also assessed. The microbiological results clearly demonstrated the success of the HACCP plan implementation, through a general improvement of the hygiene conditions of both meals and work surfaces.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by two Lactobacilus strains with probiotic properties.
AB  - The probiotic characteristics of Lactobacillus brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33, isolated from traditional Turkish Tulum cheese were assessed. These two bacteriocinproducer strains exhibited good probiotic characteristics such as resistance in media containing 0.3% bile salt, pepsin (3 mg mL(-)(1)), and pancreatine (1 mg mL(-)(1)) as well as acid resistance at pH 2. They were also adhered to Caco-2 epithelial cells in a manner comparable to Escherichia coli LMG3083 (ETEC) and Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344. The strains produced a heat-stable antimicrobial compound that was shown to be proteinaceous in nature, and therefore, referred to as bacteriocins. The bacteriocins were able to inhibit growth of a number grampositive bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Tricine-SDS-PAGE of the active fraction resulted in single bands with estimated molecular masses of 2.5 kDA and 2.7 kDA for Lb. brevis BG18 and Lb. plantarum BG33 bacteriocins, respectively.
TI  - Maklamicin, an antibacterial polyketide from an endophytic Micromonospora sp.
AB  - A new spirotetronate-class polyketide, maklamicin (1), was isolated from the culture extract of an endophytic actinomycete of the genus Micromonospora. The structure and relative configuration of 1 were elucidated by interpretation of NMR and other spectroscopic data, and the absolute configuration was determined using the modified Mosher method. Maklamicin (1) showed strong to modest antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Pathogen detection using a liquid array technology.
AB  - Low concentrations of microbial pathogens in pure and mixed samples were detected using a bead-based, liquid array technology. A 20-bp sequence in the 23S rRNA gene, rrl, was amplified in four microorganisms: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica and Staphylococcus aureus. PCR products were positively identified with the Luminex((R)) 100 system. The system could detect very low amounts of DNA and the instrument response was proportional to the input concentration. The lower limit of detection (LLD) was determined to be 0.5 ng for B. cereus and E. coli and 2 ng for S. enterica. The LLD for S. aureus was not determined as the instrument response was still above the threshold when quantities of DNA as low as 0.25 ng were used. The platform positively identified organisms present in mixed samples even when the minor component was overshadowed by a 10-fold excess of the major component.
TI  - Comparative analysis of antimicrobial activities of valinomycin and cereulide, the Bacillus cereus emetic toxin.
AB  - Cereulide and valinomycin are highly similar cyclic dodecadepsipeptides with potassium ionophoric properties. Cereulide, produced by members of the Bacillus cereus group, is known mostly as emetic toxin, and no ecological function has been assigned. A comparative analysis of the antimicrobial activity of valinomycin produced by Streptomyces spp. and cereulide was performed at a pH range of pH 5.5 to pH 9.5, under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. Both compounds display pH-dependent activity against selected Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987. Notably, B. cereus strain ATCC 14579 and the emetic B. cereus strains F4810/72 and A529 showed reduced sensitivity to both compounds, with the latter two strains displaying full resistance to cereulide. Both compounds showed no activity against the selected Gram-negative bacteria. Antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria was highest at alkaline pH values, where the membrane potential (DeltaPsi) is the main component of the proton motive force (PMF). Furthermore, inhibition of growth was observed in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Determination of the DeltaPsi, using the membrane potential probe DiOC(2)(3) (in the presence of 50 mM KCl) in combination with flow cytometry, demonstrated for the first time the ability of cereulide to dissipate the DeltaPsi in sensitive Gram-positive bacteria. The putative role of cereulide production in the ecology of emetic B. cereus is discussed.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of raw and processed honey.
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activity of methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate extracts  of raw and processed honey was tested against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Micrococcus luteus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhi). Both types of honey showed antibacterial activity against tested organisms with the zone of inhibition (ZOI) ranging from 6.94 to 37.94 mm, while E. coli, S. typhi, and P. aeruginosa showed that sensibility towards all the extracts with ZOI ranges between 13.09 to 37.94 mm. The methanol extract showed more potent activity than other organic extracts. Gram-negative bacteria were found to be more susceptible as compared to Gram-positive bacteria except E. faecalis. The broth microdilution assay gave minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) value of 625 mug/mL, while the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranges between 625 mug/mL 2500 mug/mL. The study showed that honey has antibacterial activity (bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect), similar to antibiotics, against test organisms and provides alternative therapy against certain bacteria.
TI  - Effectiveness of chitosan against mature biofilms formed by food related bacteria.
AB  - Chitosan has proven antimicrobial properties against planktonic cell growth. Little is known, however, about its effects on already established biofilms. Oriented for application in food industry disinfection, the effectiveness of both medium molecular weight (MMW) chitosan and its enzymatically hydrolyzed product was tested against mature biofilms of four pathogenic strains, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica, and a food spoilage species, Pseudomonas fluorescens. Unexpectedly, log reductions were in some cases higher for biofilm than for planktonic cells. One hour exposure to MMW chitosan (1% w/v) caused a 6 log viable cell reduction on L. monocytogenes monospecies mature biofilms and reduced significantly (3-5 log reductions) the attached population of the other organisms tested, except S. aureus. Pronase-treated chitosan was more effective than MMW chitosan on all tested microorganisms, also with the exception of S. aureus, offering best results (8 log units) against the attached cells of B. cereus. These treatments open a new possibility to fight against mature biofilms in the food industry.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - Inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (Mangifera indica L.).
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-O-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. The MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs of gallotannins against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium botulinum, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. The use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of S. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. Supplementation of LB medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against Staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of S. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. Hepta-O-galloylglucose sensitized Lactobacillus plantarum TMW1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (MDR) transporter HorA. Carbohydrate metabolism of Lactococcus lactis MG1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-O-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. In conclusion, the inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.
TI  - The effect of lemongrass oil and its major components on clinical isolate mastitis pathogens and their mechanisms of action on Staphylococcus aureus DMST 4745.
AB  - The aims of this study were to investigate the antibacterial activity of lemongrass oil (LG) and its major components which were citral, geraniol and myrcene, against four strains of clinically isolated bovine mastitis pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli by the broth microdilution method, as well as their activity on S. aureus biofilm formation. Attempts to clarify their mechanisms of action by investigation of the effects on intracellular material leakage and morphological changes of S. aureus DMST 4745 were also made. The results demonstrate that S. agalactiae and B. cereus are more susceptible to LG, citral and geraniol than S. aureus and E. coli. Moreover, they also inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation and exhibit effective killing activities on preformed biofilms. The LG appears to have multiple targets in the bacterial cell, depending on concentration used as well as the amount of its components.
TI  - Preparation, characterization and in vitro release study of carvacrol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles.
AB  - The fabrication of carvacrol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles was achieved by a two-step method, i.e., oil-in-water emulsion and ionic gelation of chitosan with pentasodium tripolyphosphate. The obtained particles possessed encapsulation efficiency (EE) and loading capacity (LC) in the ranges of 14-31% and 3-21%, respectively, when the initial carvacrol content was 0.25-1.25 g/g of chitosan. The individual particles exhibited a spherical shape with an average diameter of 40-80 nm, and a positively charged surface with a zeta potential value of 25-29 mV. The increment of initial carvacrol content caused a reduction of surface charge. Carvacrol-loaded chitosan nanoparticles showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli with an MIC of 0.257 mg/mL. The release of carvacrol from chitosan nanoparticles reached plateau level on day 30, with release amounts of 53% in acetate buffer solution with pH of 3, and 23% and 33% in phosphate buffer solutions with pH of 7 and 11, respectively. The release mechanism followed a Fickian behavior. The release rate was superior in an acidic medium to either alkaline or neutral media, respectively.
TI  - Carijodienone from the octocoral Carijoa multiflora. A spiropregnane-based steroid.
AB  - Two new steroids (1 and 2) and the known pregna-1,4,20-trien-3-one (3) have been  isolated from the Pacific octocoral Carijoa multiflora. Compound 1 possesses a novel spiropregnane-based steroidal skeleton. The photochemical transformation of 3 into 1 allowed the assignment of the absolute configuration at C-10 of 1. The antibacterial activities of compounds 1 and 3 were evaluated against a panel of bacterial strains.
TI  - The effects of Korean propolis against foodborne pathogens and transmission electron microscopic examination.
AB  - This study was performed to evaluate the effects of Korean propolis against foodborne pathogens and spores of Bacillus cereus and to investigate the antimicrobial activity against B. cereus structure by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The antimicrobial effects of the Korean propolis were tested against foodborne pathogens including Gram-positive (B. cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescence) bacteria by agar diffusion assay. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than were Gram-negative bacteria. The vegetative cells of B. cereus were the most sensitive among the pathogens tested with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.036 mg/mul of propolis on agar medium. Based on MIC, sensitivity of vegetative cells of B. cereus and its spores was tested in a nutrient broth with different concentrations of propolis at 37 degrees C. In liquid broth, treatment with 1.8 mg/ml propolis showed bactericidal effect against B. cereus. B. cereus vegetative cells exposed to 7.2mg/ml of propolis lost their viability within 20 min. Against spores of B. cereus, propolis inhibited germination of spores up to 30 hours, compared to control at higher concentration than vegetative cells yet acted sporostatically. The bactericidal and sporostatic action of propolis were dependent on the concentration of propolis used and treatment time. Electron microscopic investigation of propolis-treated B. cereus revealed substantial structural damage at the cellular level and irreversible cell membrane rupture at a number of locations with the apparent leakage of intracellular contents. The antimicrobial effect of propolis in this study suggests potential use of propolis in foods.
TI  - Essential oil of Galinsoga parviflora leaves from Colombia.
AB  - The chemical composition of the volatile compounds from the leaves of Galinsoga parviflora Cav. (Asteraceae) from Colombia was studied by GC and GC/MS. Eighty-eight volatile compounds were identified, of which the major ones were (Z)-3-hexen-1-ol (21.7%), beta-caryophyllene (12.4%), and 6-demethoxy-ageratochrome (14%). The leaf oil presented antimicrobial activities against the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Synergistic effects of sodium hypochlorite and ultraviolet radiation in reducing  the levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatment would produce synergistic effects to facilitate the sterilization of food products during production relative to single treatment. To assess this hypothesis, we investigated the bactericidal effects of ultraviolet (UV) irradiation and a commercial chemical disinfectant, sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), on Bacillus cereus F4810/72, Cronobacter sakazakii KCTC 2949, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 35556, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, and Salmonella Typhimurium novobiocin/nalidixic acid in vitro. Various concentrations of NaClO (20, 60, 100, and 200 ppm NaClO) were tested along with exposure to UV radiation at various doses (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mW s/cm(2)). The combined NaClO/UV treatments resulted in greater reductions in bacterial counts than either treatment alone. The synergy values against B. cereus, C. sakazakii, S. aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and E. coli were 0.25-1.17, 0.33-1.97, 0.42-1.72, 0.02-1.44, and 0.01-0.85 log(10) CFU/mL, respectively. The results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combined NaClO/UV processing against food-borne pathogenic bacteria in vitro.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the efficacy of 4 denture cleanser tabs against oral bacteria.

TI  - Cell viability effects and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Tunisian date syrup (Rub El Tamer) polyphenolic extracts.
AB  - The aqueous-acetone polyphenolic extract of the traditionally derived date syrup, known as "Rub El Tamer", was analyzed using RP-HPLC-DAD and ESI-MS. The phenolic content of the extract was 394.53 +/- 1.13 mg per 100 g of syrup with caffeoylsinapylquinic acid as the most abundant compound (72.23%). The extract exhibited strong antioxidant activities as evaluated using the ABTS (2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)), DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) methods. The extract antimicrobial potential against a range of microorganism strains showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus were the most sensitive bacteria with MBC in the range of 0.5-0.05 mg/mL. Furthermore, in the presence of the syrup extract (8.18-131 mug/mL), the Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma and the 3T3 fibroblast cell lines showed dissimilar reduction of viability suggesting a higher cytotoxic effect against tumorigenic cells. Our results provide new insights into date syrup characterization which should stimulate further studies of this hot desert resource.
TI  - Microbiological assessment in strawberry production and recommendations to establish a good agricultural practice system.
AB  - This study conducted microbiological assessment in tunnel style strawberry greenhouses and packaging centers and suggested recommendations to establish a good agricultural practice for strawberry production. The samples from irrigation water, workers' gloves, harvest bins, soil, strawberry leaves and strawberries in greenhouses, packers' gloves, conveyor belts, packaging tables, and door knobs of entrances in packaging centers were collected. Bacterial cell counts of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were then enumerated on appropriate selective media. In general, bacterial populations were similar (p >/= 0.05) among strawberry greenhouses but not among packaging houses. E. coli and E. coli O157:H7 were negative in all samples, and low levels of Salmonella and B. cereus were detected. However, high bacterial cell counts of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, and S. aureus were found in most samples. These results suggest that food safety practice in strawberry greenhouses and packaging centers should be improved, and the results may be useful in the establishment of a good agricultural practice system for strawberry production.
TI  - A subtractively optimized DNA microarray using non-sequenced genomic probes for the detection of food-borne pathogens.
AB  - In this study, we present the successful detection of food-borne pathogens using  randomly selected non-sequenced genomic DNA probes-based DNA microarray chips. Three food-borne pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), and Bacillus cereus, were subjected for the preparation of the DNA microarray probes. Initially, about 50 DNA probes selected randomly from non-sequenced genomic DNA of each pathogen were prepared by using a set of restriction enzyme pairs. The proto-type of DNA microarray chip for detecting three different pathogens simultaneously was fabricated by using those DNA probes prepared for each pathogen. This proto-type DNA microarray has been tested with three target pathogens and additional seven bacteria, and successfully verified with a few cross-hybridized probes. After this primary verification of the DNA microarray hybridization, this proto-type DNA microarray chip was redesigned and successfully optimized by eliminating a few cross-hybridized probes. The specificity of this redesigned DNA microarray chip to each pathogen was confirmed without any serious cross-hybridizations, and its multiplexing capability in its pathogen detection was found to be possible. This randomly selected non-sequenced genomic DNA probes-based DNA microarray was successfully proved to be the high-throughput simultaneous detection chip for the detection of food-borne pathogens, without knowing the exact sequence information of the target bacteria. This could be the first fabrication of DNA microarray chip for the simultaneous detection of different kinds of food-borne pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LBM 5006 is enhanced in the  presence of Escherichia coli.
AB  - Increased antimicrobial activity was observed when Bacillus amyloliquefaciens LBM 5006 strain was cultivated in the presence of thermally inactivated cells of Escherichia coli, but not with Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, or Bacillus cereus. E. coli also enhanced the antimicrobial activity when it was added to the medium in the form of living cells or as cell debris after cellular fractionation. No inducing activity was observed with addition of cell-free supernatant of E. coli cultures, suggesting that inducing factor is associated to the cells. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that additional peptide bands are secreted when B. amyloliquefaciens was cultivated in the presence of cell debris of E. coli. These results suggest that the presence of intact or inactivated E. coli enhanced the synthesis of antimicrobial peptides by B. amyloliquefaciens LBM 5006.
TI  - Biological and docking studies of topoisomerase IV inhibition by thiosemicarbazides.
AB  - 4-Benzoyl-1-(4-methyl-imidazol-5-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (1) was synthesized, and its antibacterial and type IIA topoisomerase (DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV) activity evaluated. (1) was found to have high therapeutic potential against opportunistic Gram-positive bacteria, and inhibitory activity against topoisomerase IV (IC(50)=90 muM) but not against DNA gyrase. An increase in activity against topoisomerase IV (IC(50)=14 muM) was observed when the imidazole moiety of (1) was replaced with the indole group in 4-benzoyl-1-(indol-2-yl)-carbonylthiosemicarbazide (2). However, (2) showed only weak antibacterial activity. Although the results of the bacterial type IIA topoisomerases inhibition study did not parallel antibacterial activities, our observations strongly imply that a 4-benzoylthiosemicarbazide scaffold can be developed into an efficient Gram-positive antibacterial targeting topoisomerase IV. The difference in activity against type IIA topoisomerases between (1) and (2) was further investigated by docking studies, which suggested that these compounds target the ATP binding pocket.
TI  - A large foodborne outbreak on a small Pacific island.
AB  - On March 25, 2009, the Ebeye Leroj Kitlang Memorial Health Center on the island of Ebeye in the Republic of the Marshall Islands was overwhelmed with over 100 patients presenting for vomiting and diarrhea. Epidemiologic investigation revealed that there were 174 cases among 187 attendees at a local funeral earlier in the day. Most cases had eaten served sandwiches containing egg products that had undergone severe time-temperature abuse. While no causal agents were identified, the epidemiology and clinical presentation is compatible with foodborne toxins, most likely enterotoxins of either Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus. Mitigation measures undertaken by public health centered on education of food preparers and the general public regarding safe food preparation practices. This large outbreak serves to remind us that, while there are simple and highly effective measures to prevent such foodborne disease outbreaks, we in the public health sector have a duty to improve the community's knowledge and understanding of these measures.
TI  - Probiotic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and Taiwanese pickled cabbage.
AB  - This study assessed potential probiotic Lactobacillus strains isolated from the feces of breast-fed infants and from Taiwanese pickled cabbage for their possible use in probiotic fermented foods by evaluating their (i) in vitro adhesive ability, resistance to biotic stress, resistance to pathogenic bacteria, and production of beta-galactosidase; (ii) milk technological properties; and (iii) in vivo adhesive ability, intestinal survival and microbial changes during and after treatment. Five Lactobacillus isolates identified as Lactobacillus reuteri F03, Lactobacillus paracasei F08, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F14, Lactobacillus plantarum C06, and Lactobacillus acidophilus C11 that showed resistance to gastric juice and bile salts were selected for further evaluation of their probiotic properties. All the strains demonstrated the ability to adhere to Caco-2 cells, particularly, strain L. plantarum C06 and L. reuteri F03 showed satisfactory abilities, which were similar to that of the reference strain L. rhamnosus GG. The strains L. paracasei F08 and L. acidophilus C11 had the highest beta-galactosidase activity. Most of the strains were resistant to aminoglycosides and vancomycin but sensitive to ampicillin, erythromycin, and penicillin. All the 5 strains elicited antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus) and -negative (Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica) pathogens. Moreover, the strains L. reuteri F03, L. paracasei F08, and L. plantarum C06 could grow rapidly in milk without nutrient supplementation and reached 10(8) cfu/mL after 24 h of fermentation at 37 degrees C. The viable cell counts of the 3 strains remained above 10(7) cfu/mL after 21 d of storage at 4 degrees C. In the animal feeding trial, the number of intestinal lactobacilli increased significantly after administration of milk fermented with the 3 strains, and the counts of fecal coliforms and Clostridium perfringens were markedly reduced. Lactobacillus strains could also survive in the ileal intestinal tissue of the treated rats. Technologically interesting Lactobacillus isolates may be used in the future as probiotic starter cultures for manufacturing novel fermented foods.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activity of 4-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide; a novel bioactive compound from Moringa oleifera seed extract.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of crude seed extract of Moringa oleifera was investigated by thin layer chromatography bioassay against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Cladosporium cladosporioides, and Penicillium sclerotigenum; most of them were prominently inhibited by an isolate with R(F) 0.92-0.96. Characterization and identification of the extract revealed the occurrence of three bioactive compounds: 4-(alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl isothiocyanate, methyl N-4-(alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy) benzyl carbamate (both known compounds), and 4-(beta-D-glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)-benzyl thiocarboxamide, existence of which in any Moringa spp. or plant is reported for the first time. The UV spectrum of the novel compound showed maximum absorption at 273 and 225 nm in MeOH while the IR spectrum revealed several characteristic bands at 3100, 2900, 1700, 1500, 1300, 1100 and 1000 cm(-1). The (1)H-NMR showed signals at 1.2 and 3.77 ppm and the (13)C-NMR presented signals at 155, 122, 91.7 and 98.4 ppm. All the compounds at 5 mg/L had very high bactericidal activity against some of test pathogens even at contact period 1-2 h. 4-(beta-D-Glucopyranosyl-1-->4-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyloxy)benzyl thiocarboxamide was the most potent, with 99.2 % inhibition toward Shigella dysenteriae and 100 % toward Bacillus cereus, E. coli and Salmonella typhi within 4 h of contact.
TI  - Potential interaction between the volatile and non-volatile fractions on the in vitro antimicrobial activity of three South African Pelargonium (Geraniaceae) species.
AB  - Previous studies have reported promising antimicrobial efficacy for the essential oils and solvent extracts of several indigenous Pelargonium species. This study aimed to determine if any pharmacological interaction (e.g. synergism or antagonism) exists between the volatile and non-volatile components when the different fractions were investigated. The antimicrobial activity of the following fractions were tested; the essential oil prepared by hydrodistillation (EO), non-volatile fraction (NV), prepared by extraction of plant material remaining in the distilling apparatus (having no or negligible volatile constituents) and solvent extracts prepared from fresh (FC) and dried (DC) plant material containing both volatile and non-volatile constituents. Pelargonium quercifolium oil was dominated by p-cymene (42.1%) and viridiflorol (16.9%), while P. graveolens and P. tomentosum oil had high levels of isomenthone (84.0 and 58.8%, respectively). Menthone was noted as a major constituent in the P. tomentosum EO sample. It was evident from the results that the presence of volatile constituents in the three species; P. graveolens, P. quercifolium and P. tomentosum is generally not a pre-requisite for antimicrobial activity. The most significant variations of antimicrobial activity were noted for P. tomentosum where poorer activity was noted for the FC and EO fractions against Bacillus cereus and Candida albicans. Studies on Staphylococcus aureus, however, showed the converse, where best activity was noted for the FC fraction (3.0 mg/mL). For P. quercifolium, the DC fraction indicated a notable increase in anti-staphylococcal activity (2.0 mg/mL) when compared with the FC (8.0 mg/mL) and EO (16.0 mg/mL) fractions. For P. tomentosum, the FC fraction indicated much lower antimicrobial activity (against both B. cereus and C. albicans) when compared with all other fractions, suggesting that the essential oils may impact negatively on the antimicrobial activity when tested against these two pathogens.
TI  - Chemical composition, olfactory evaluation and antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and absolutes from Morocco.
AB  - The chemical compositions of selected essential oils from North Africa, especially Morocco, of geranium, wild Moroccan chamomile and rosemary as well as absolutes of rose and geranium were determined using GC/FID and GC/MS. These oils and absolutes were tested concerning their antimicrobial activity against some food spoilage strains obtained from fresh milk and minced meat products, like sausages and pork fillet, in accordance with ISO testing procedures. Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Salmonella abony and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) strains were used, as well as the yeast Candida albicans. Using a serial broth dilution method, all samples demonstrated weak antimicrobial activity against the Gram-negative bacteria and the yeast, compared with the activity towards the Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antioxidant, cytoprotective and antibacterial effects of Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) leaves.
AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the antioxidant, cytoprotective  and antibacterial effects of aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of Hippophae rhamnoides L. (Sea buckthorn) (SBT) leaves by using various in vitro systems and analysis of marker compounds by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). The chemical composition of the leaf extracts was quantified by colorimetric reaction in terms of total phenol and flavonoids contents. Further, some of its bioactive phenolic constituents, such as quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol and isorhamnetin were also quantified in both SBT leaf extracts by RP-HPLC. The SBT leaf extracts exhibited potent antioxidant activity determined by 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assays. Further, both extracts were observed to have cytoprotective activity against hydrogen peroxide and hypoxanthine-xanthine oxidase induced damage to BHK-21 cell line. The SBT leaf extracts showed growth inhibiting effect against Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. These observations suggest that aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of Sea buckthorn leaves have marked antioxidant, cytoprotective and antibacterial activities.
TI  - An efficient approach for the isolation, identification and evaluation of antimicrobial plant components on an analytical scale, demonstrated by the example of Radix imperatoriae.
AB  - Using Radix imperatoriae (the root of masterwort) as an example, we describe an efficient approach for the isolation, identification and evaluation of bioactive plant components on an analytical scale. The extraction of Radix imperatoriae with ethyl acetate was enhanced by the application of ultrasound oscillations. This rhizome extract was applied to three pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) to determine its antimicrobial activity. Disk diffusion was utilized to determine susceptibility. The extract components were separated using a series of chromatography approaches (semi-preparative RP-HPLC, or RP-HPLC on an analytical scale), followed by testing. All fractions were analyzed by LC-UV-ESI-MS and 600 MHz microcoil (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Among other findings, in the fraction with the highest antibacterial activity we were able to identify oxypeucedanin and oxypeucedanin hydrate. Subsequent analysis revealed that only oxypeucedanin hydrate had antibacterial activity, whereas oxypeucedanin itself was inactive at the concentrations applied. Furthermore, oxypeucedanin hydrate appears to be largely, or exclusively, a by-product of sample preparation, since it is either not synthesized by the plant as a second metabolite or is produced by it in only very small quantities.
TI  - Prevalence of microorganisms of hygienic interest in an organized abattoir in Mumbai, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The magnitude of food-borne illnesses in India is unknown because of  lack of surveillance networks. Monitoring the prevalence of food-borne pathogens and indicators of contamination in primary production at abattoirs is imperative for creating a data bank and for effective control of such pathogens before they enter the food chain. METHODOLOGY: Microorganisms of hygienic interest were screened for their prevalence at Deonar Abattoir, Mumbai. Swab samples from 96 sheep/goat carcass sites were collected and analyzed for Staphylococcus spp., Bacillaceae, Clostridiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae. RESULTS: Average Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis counts were 3.15 +/- 0.18 and 3.46 +/- 0.17 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Clostridium spp. counts were 3.10 +/- 0.08, 3.41 +/- 0.19 and 0.76 +/- 0.06 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. The Escherichia coli count was 3.54 +/- 0.06 and the Klebsiella aerogenes count was 3.22 +/- 0.22 log10 CFU/cm(2). Counts for Proteus vulgaris and Proteus mirabilis were 3.44 +/- 0.14 log10 CFU/cm(2) and 3.71 +/- 0.12 log10 CFU/cm(2), respectively. S. epidermidis had the highest percentage prevalence at (41.6%), followed by K. aerogenes (31.9%), B. subtilis (28.2%) and P. vulgaris (23.6%). Salmonella spp. were not isolated. CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate high prevalence and diversity of micro flora on carcasses in the primary Indian production facility, which might be attributed to either human handling or improper dressing especially during evisceration process. Appropriate training for personal and production hygiene is essential for workers in Indian meat production facilities.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of 1,4-benzoquinones and wheat germ extract.
AB  - We evaluated the antibacterial activities of selected edible Korean plant seeds against the food-borne pathogens Staphylococcus aureus KCTC1927, Escherichia coli KCTC2593, Salmonella typhimurium KCTC2054, and Bacillus cereus KCTC1014. While screening for antibacterial agents, we discovered that wheat germ extract contains 2,6-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ) and is highly inhibitory to S. aureus and B. cereus. This is the first report of the antibacterial activity of wheat germ extract. We also investigated the antibacterial activities of the 1,4- benzoquinone standards 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), hydroquinone (HQ), methoxybenzoquinone (MBQ), and 2,6-dimethoxy- 1,4-benzoquinone (DMBQ). DMBQ and BQ were the most highly inhibitory to S. aureus and S. typhimurium, followed by MBQ and HQ. MICs for DMBQ and BQ ranged between 8 and 64 microgram/ml against the four foodborne pathogens tested. DMBQ and BQ showed significant antibacterial activity; the most sensitive organism was S. aureus with an MIC of 8 microgram/ml. BQ exhibited good activity against S. typhimurium (32 microgram/ml) and B. cereus (32 microgram/ml). The results suggest that wheat germ extract has potential for the development of natural antimicrobials and food preservatives for controlling foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Lycopersicon esculentum seeds: an industrial byproduct as an antimicrobial agent.
AB  - Lycopersicon esculentum (tomato) fruit is a widely studied matrix. However, only  few works focus their attention on its seeds, which constitute a major byproduct of the tomato processing industry. In this study the antimicrobial potential of ten different tomato seed extracts from "Bull's heart" and "Cherry" varieties were analyzed against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacteria and fungi (Candida albicans, Aspergillus fumigatus and Trichophyton rubrum). Regarding antibacterial capacity, the different extracts were revealed to be active only against Gram-positive bacteria, E. faecalis being the most susceptible one (MIC: 2.5-10 mg/mL). Concerning antifungal activity, "Bull's heart" extracts were the most active. In a general way C. albicans was the most susceptible species (MIC: 5-10 mg/mL). The chemical composition of the extracts was also pursued, concerning organic acids, phenolics and fatty acids, in order to establish a possible relationship with the observed antimicrobial effect.
TI  - Spectral, thermal and in vitro antimicrobial studies of cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate transition metal complexes.
AB  - Transition metal complexes of the type [M(L)(2)] and those containing monodentate phosphines of the type [M(L)(2)(PPh(3))] {M=Ni, Co, Cu and Zn; L=cyclohexylamine-N-dithiocarbamate; PPh(3)=triphenylphosphine} have been synthesized. The complexes were characterized using IR, UV-vis, NMR spectroscopy, and thermal analysis (TGA). The (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and (31)P NMR showed the expected signals for the dithiocarbamate and triphenylphosphine moieties. The spectral studies in all compounds revealed that the coordination of metals occurs via the sulphur atom of the dithiocarbamate ligand in a bidentate fashion. Thermal behavior of the complexes showed that the complexes were more stable than their parent ligands. The ligand moiety is lost in the first step and the rest of the organic moiety decomposes in the subsequent steps. Furthermore, the ligand and their metal complexes were screened in vitro for their antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus and antifungal activities against Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus carbonarius, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus. The metal complexes exhibited higher antimicrobial activity than the parent ligands. Generally, the zinc complexes were effective against the growth of bacteria with Zn(L)(2) displaying broad spectrum bacteriocidal activity at concentrations of 50microg/mL; and Ni(L)(2) was more effective against the growth of fungi at concentrations of 100-400microg/mL under laboratory conditions.
TI  - Antibacterial properties of essential oils and methanol extracts of sweet basil Ocimum basilicum occurring in Bangladesh.
AB  - The antibacterial potential of essential oils and methanol extracts of sweet basil Ocimum basilicum L. (Lamiaceae) was evaluated for controlling the growth range of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. Essential oils extracted by hydrodistillation from the leaves and stems were analyzed by GC-MS. Fifty-seven compounds representing 94.9 and 96.1% of the total leaf and stem oils, respectively, were identified, of which methyl chavicol (36.7 and 29.9%), gitoxigenin (9.3 and 10.2%), trimethoquinol (10.3 and 8.4%), beta-guaiene (3.7 and 4.1%), aciphyllene (3.4 and 3.0%), alizarin (3.2 and 4.4%), naphthaline (2.2 and 3.8%), (-)-caryophyllene (2.0 and 1.9%), and mequinol (1.6 and 1.8%) were the major compounds. The essential oils (10 microL/disc of 1:5, v/v dilution with methanol) and methanol extracts (300 microg/disc) of O. basilicum displayed a great potential of antibacterial activity against Bacillius cereus, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Shigella boydii, S. dysenteriae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, V. mimicus, and Salmonella typhi with their respective zones of inhibition of 11.2-21.1 mm and MIC values of 62.5-500 microg/mL. The results of this study suggest that the natural products derived from O. basilicum may have potential use in the food and/or pharmaceutical industries as antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Post-antibacterial effect of thymol.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of thymol has been well established and reported in the scientific literature. Continued suppression of bacterial growth following limited exposure to antimicrobial compounds at different concentrations greater than or equal to the minimum inhibitory concentration level (MIC) and at concentrations less than the MIC can be used as an indicator of biological activity, and are respectively referred to as a post-antibacterial effect (PAE) and a post-antibiotic sub-MIC effect (PA-SME). In this study, the PAE and the PA-SME of thymol against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus were investigated. A spectrophotometric method was used to determine the PAE and the PA-SME of thymol against the selected test strains. Thymol exhibited a considerable PAE and PA-SME at MIC and sub-MIC concentrations against test strains. The greatest duration of both the PAE and the PA-SME was observed for thymol against E. coli and P. aeruginosa. The PAE and PA-SME times for E. coli were 12 and 8 h, respectively, and for P. aeruginosa were 11 and 7.5 h, respectively. The duration of the PAE and PA-SME observed for S. aureus and B. cereus was shorter than for Gram-negative strains.
TI  - Food contamination in fast food restaurants in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria: Implications for food hygiene and safety.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of food contamination in the fast food restaurants operating in Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty food handlers were selected by means of a systematic sampling method and interviewed using a semi-structured researcher-administered questionnaire. One hundred and sixty-eight samples of ready-to-eat food and 45 stool samples were collected and analysed in the laboratory for the presence of bacteria (excluding anaerobic bacteria). RESULTS: More than half of the respondents (n=184, 52.6%) had no training in food hygiene and safety. Only 149 (42.6%) respondents knew that micro-organisms can contaminate food. The prevalence of food contamination in the fast food restaurants was found to be 37.5%. Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were the most commonly isolated bacteria, while salad, meat pie and fried rice were the most commonly contaminated foods. CONCLUSION: There is need for the relevant local authorities to ensure that the food sold to consumers in fast food restaurants is safe, wholesome and fit for human consumption in order to prevent outbreaks of food-borne illnesses. Also, there should be regular training/retraining and health education of these food handlers in all aspects of food hygiene and safety.
TI  - Antioxidant and antibacterial activities on foodborne pathogens of Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. (Moraceae) leaves extracts.
AB  - Total water extract, ethyl acetate, and aqueous fractions from the leaves of Artocarpus heterophyllus were evaluated for phenolic content, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities against some foodborne pathogens such as E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enterica, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) of extract and fractions determined by the agar dilution method were ranged from 221.9 microg/mL for ethyl acetate fraction to 488.1 microg/mL for total extract. In the agar diffusion method the diameters of inhibition were 12.2 for the total extract, 10.7 and 11.5 for ethyl acetate and aqueous fractions, respectively. A. heterophyllus showed significant antioxidant activity tested in different in vitro systems (DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and Fe(2+) chelating activity assay). In particular, in DPPH assay A. heterophyllus total extract exhibited a strong antiradical activity with an IC(50) value of 73.5 microg/mL while aqueous fraction exerted the highest activity in FRAP assay (IC(50) value of 72.0 microg/mL). The total phenols content by Folin-Ciocalteau method was determined with the purpose of testing its relationship with the antioxidant and antibacterial activities.
TI  - Aureocins 4185, bacteriocins produced by Staphylococcus aureus 4185: potential application in food preservation.
AB  - In the present study, the bacteriocins produced by Staphylococcus aureus 4185, a  strain isolated from bovine mastitis, were purified and partially characterized. After purification by ammonium sulfate precipitation, cation-exchange chromatography, and five runs of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), antimicrobial activity was recovered with 40% and 80% isopropanol, suggesting that more than one antimicrobial peptide, named aureocins 4185, is produced by S. aureus 4185. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed three peptides eluted with 40% isopropanol: peptide A (2,305.3 +/-1.5 Da), peptide B (2,327.3 +/-1.5 Da), and peptide C (3,005.5 +/-1.5 Da), and two peptides eluted with 80% isopropanol: peptide D (6,413.5 +/-1.5 Da) and peptide E (12,834.5 +/-1.5 Da). Although five peptides have been detected, only four small peptide sequences were obtained by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF)/TOF mass spectrometry analyses: SLLEQFTGK (eluted with 40% isopropanol), ALLYDER, NNTSHNLPLGWFNVK, and NNLAQGTFNATK (eluted with 80% isopropanol). The sequences SLLEQFTGK and ALLYDER revealed identity with hypothetical peptides with unknown function. The sequences NNTSHNLPLGWFNVK and NNLAQGTFNATK showed similarity to a segment of a precursor of staphylococcal autolysins. The antimicrobial activity detected in the supernatant of strain 4185 proved to be resistant to heat treatment at 65 degrees C; however, treatment at 80 degrees C abolished completely its antimicrobial properties. The concentrated supernatant containing aureocins 4185 exhibited a strong bacteriolytic activity toward Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698. Additionally, aureocins 4185 exhibited antagonistic activity against important foodborne pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, thus showing a potential application in food preservation.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 blood culture system].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA). METHODS: A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. RESULTS: The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of novel schiff bases of 3-amino-2-methyl  quinazolin 4-(3H)-one.
AB  - In the present study, novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes. The 3-amino-2-methyl quinazolin-4-(3H)-one was synthesized from anthranilic acid via the 2-methyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by means of Infrared (IR), (1)H-NMR, (13)C-NMR, Mass spectral, and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 11298)) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC 9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 46645) activities, using the paper disk diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by the agar streak dilution method. Most of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. Among the synthesized compounds, 3-(4-hydroxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4g and 4c was found to exhibit the highest anti-bacterial activity and 3-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy benzylideneamino)-2-methyl quinazolin-4(3H)-one 4k exhibited the highest anti-fungal activity.
TI  - Cell-based biosensor for rapid screening of pathogens and toxins.
AB  - Development and validation of a mammalian cell-based biosensor for application in food defense and food safety was investigated. Three prototypes of the biosensor capable of handling different sample types were developed and tested with food and beverages. The sensing element is a B lymphocyte Ped-2E9 cell-line, encapsulated in collagen matrix in 3D scaffold. The uniqueness of this biosensor is that it detects analyte interaction with mammalian cells and is able to distinguish pathogenic from non-pathogenic and active from inactive toxins, rendering accurate estimation of the risk associated with the agents. This sensor gave positive signal for a broad range of bacterial pathogens; Listeria monocytogenes, enterotoxigenic Bacillus, Vibrio, Micrococcus and Serratia, and toxins; alpha-hemolysin from Staphylococcus aureus, phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens, cytolysin from sea anemone Stoichactis helianthus, listeriolysin O from L. monocytogenes, and enterotoxin from Bacillus. Detection limit for toxins was 10-40 ng in 2 h while for a model bacterial pathogen, L. monocytogenes, 10(3)-10(4) CFU/ml in 4-6 h, even in the presence of a mixture of higher concentrations of non-pathogenic species of the same genera or common background microflora. With inoculated food and beverage, the sensor detected L. monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus at a low initial concentration of 10(2)-10(4) CFU/g from ready-to-eat meat and rice, and only active toxins at nanogram quantities from rice, milk and water samples. Though all the three prototypes performed well with beverages, Devices II & III are most suitable for testing particulate foods. These data present promising evidence for possible application of this biosensor for rapid detection of multiple pathogens or toxins for food defense and food safety application.
TI  - Growth of microorganisms in total parenteral nutrition solutions containing lipid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify the microorganisms that can grow rapidly in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions, we investigated the growth of the major causes of catheter-related blood stream infection (Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans) in TPN solutions containing lipid. METHODS: The pH value of a TPN solution containing lipid (pH 6.0, containing 20 ppm of NaHSO(3)) was adjusted by the addition of HCl to 5.7, 5.4, or 4.9. The pH value of another TPN solution (pH5.5, containing 400 ppm of NaHSO(3)) was adjusted by the addition of NaOH to 5.9, 6.3, or 6.8. A specific number of each microorganism was added to 10 mL of each test solution and incubated at room temperature. The number of microorganisms was counted as colony forming units at 0, 24, and 48 hrs later. RESULTS: C albicans increased similarly at any pH values in the TPN solution. The bacterial species also increased rapidly at pH6.0 in the solution containing 20 ppm of NaHSO(3), but growth was suppressed as the pH value was reduced, with growth halted at pH4.9. However, these bacterial species did not increase, even at pH5.9, in the other solution containing 400 ppm of NaHSO(3). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Candida species can grow rapidly in almost all TPN solutions regardless of the acidity, lipid, and NaHSO(3); also, some bacterial species may grow in TPN solutions containing lipid unless the pH value is 5.0 or less. Therefore, each TPN solution should be examined whether or not the bacterial species can proliferate.
TI  - An independent in vitro comparison of povidone iodine and SteriLid.
AB  - AIM: Povidone iodine (PI) and SteriLid (SL) are biocides used to decrease bacterial load on the eyelid margin. We compared the antibacterial activity of PI and SL to determine the better antiseptic. METHODS: Time-kill studies of PI and SL against a battery of bacteria that included Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis were conducted at time points 1, 2, 10, and 30 min. The comparative outcome measures were based on 90% and 99.9% decreases in bacterial colony counts. RESULTS: PI was more effective at a 90% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (8/9 vs. 7/9), 2 min (9/9 vs. 6/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 8/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 8/9). PI was more effective at a 99.9% kill than SL at time points, 1 min (5/9 vs. 3/9), 2 min (7/9 vs. 4/9), 10 min (9/9 vs. 4/9), and 30 min (9/9 vs. 6/9). CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports PI as an effective antiseptic for decreasing the bacterial load that can exist on the eyelid margin. SL appears to be a less effective alternative.
TI  - Generation of chitin-derived oligosaccharides toxic to pathogenic bacteria using  ChiA74, an endochitinase native to Bacillus thuringiensis.
AB  - AIMS: To demonstrate that an endochitinase (ChiA74) native to Bacillus thuringiensis can be used to generate chitin-derived oligosaccharides (OGS) with antibacterial activity against a number of aetiological agents of disease, including bacteria that cause diarrhoeal and emetic syndromes in humans. METHODS AND RESULTS: The intact chiA74 with its cis elements was cloned into high and moderately high copy number Escherichia coli expression vectors. Functionally secreted ChiA74 was produced, and the endochitinase cleaved substrate colloidal chitin to produce OGS with 3, 5 and 6 degrees of polymerization. The enzyme was active for an extended period of incubation (24 h), but its activity showed a decrement of 73% and 87%, respectively, after 24 h of incubation at 37 and 55 degrees C. OGS showed inhibitory activity against Bacillus cereus, Listeria inoccua, E. coli, Staphylococcus xylosus, Salmonella species, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomona aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, and Proteus vulgaris. CONCLUSIONS: Endochitinase ChiA74 is able to stably maintain hydrolytic activity during prolonged incubation in a mix reaction with chitin to produce bioactive OGS with inhibitory activity against important food-borne pathogenic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study showing that an endochitinase (ChiA74) native of the most important bioinsecticide used worldwide (B. thuringiensis), but here produced in E. coli, is able to generate chitin-derived OGS with antibacterial activity against clinically significant food-borne pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Novel family of antimicrobial peptides from the skin of Rana shuchinae.
AB  - So far numerous antimicrobial peptides have been characterized from amphibians. In this work, a new family of antimicrobial peptides, named shuchin, was purified and characterized from skin secretions of the frog, Rana shuchinae that lives in freezing mountains. Totally two members of shuchin (shuchin 1 and 2) were identified with the amino acid sequence of NALSMPRNKCNRALMCFG and NALSSPRNKCDRASSCFG, respectively. cDNAs encoding shuchins were cloned from the skin cDNA library of R. shuchinae. The precursors of shuchin are composed of 62 amino acid residues including the conserved signal peptides, acidic propieces, and mature antimicrobial peptides. Synthetic shuchins showed strong and broad antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus; MICs<12.5 microg/ml), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; most MICs from 3.1 to 12.5 microg/ml), and yeast (Candida albicans; MICs of 6.25 microg/ml), but no hemolytic activity under the effective concentration, thereby provide more leading templates for designing novel anti-infection agents.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a novel analyte from Bacillus subtilis SC-8 antagonistic to Bacillus cereus.
AB  - In this study, an effective substance was isolated from Bacillus subtilis SC-8, which was obtained from traditionally fermented soybean paste, cheonggukjang. The substance was purified by HPLC, and its properties were analyzed. It had an adequate antagonistic effect on Bacilluscereus, and its spectrum of activity was narrow. When tested on several gram-negative and gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella enterica, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, no antagonistic effect was observed. Applying the derivative from B. subtilis SC-8 within the same genus did not inhibit the growth of major soybean-fermenting bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, and Bacillus amyloquefaciens. The range of pH stability of the purified antagonistic substance was wide (from 4.0 to >10.0), and the substance was thermally stable up to 60 degrees C. In the various enzyme treatments, the antagonistic activity of the purified substance was reduced with proteinase K, protease, and lipase; its activity was partially destroyed with esterase. Spores of B. cereus did not grow at all in the presence of 5mug/mL of the purified antagonistic substance. The isolated antagonistic substance was thought to be an antibiotic-like lipopeptidal compound and was tentatively named BSAP-254 because it absorbed to UV radiation at 254nm.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils from flowers of Senecio othonnae, s. racemosus, and s. nemorensis.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils of Senecio othonnae, S. racemosus, and S. nemorensis obtained by hydrodistillation of fresh flowers were analysed by GC-FID and GC-MS. A total of seventy-six compounds were identified, constituting over 83.1%, 97.7% and 86.8% of the total oil composition of the flowers of S. othonnae, S. racemosus, and S. nemorensis. The main components of the oils were caryophyllene oxide (18.6%), (E)-beta-farnesene (21.6%), and gamma-curcumene (42.8%), respectively. Sesquiterpene hydrocarbons were the main group of constituents of all three species, forming 34.6%, 73.2%, and 81.8% of the oils, respectively. The oils of S. othonnae, and S. nemorensis showed antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida tropicalis, but that of S. racemosus was only active against Candida tropicalis.
TI  - Rapid analysis of Gram-positive bacteria in water via membrane filtration coupled with nanoprobe-based MALDI-MS.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS) is challenging when it is directly applied to identify bacteria in water. This study demonstrates a rapid, sensitive, and selective technique for detection of Gram-positive bacteria in water. It involves a combination of membrane filtration (MF) and vancomycin-conjugated magnetite nanoparticles (VNPs) to selectively separate and concentrate Gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water, followed by rapid analysis of the isolates using whole-cell MALDI-MS. VNPs specifically recognize cells of Gram-positive bacteria, which serves as a basis for affinity capture of target Gram-positive bacteria. A two-step procedure of surface modification of bare magnetite nanoparticles was applied to synthesize VNPs. MF prior to VNP-based magnetic separation can effectively increase the enrichment factor and detection sensitivity and reduce time-consuming culture steps and the matrix effect for analysis of bacteria in MALDI-MS. The enrichment factor for the MF-VNP technique is about 6 x 10(4). A variety of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecium, were successfully analyzed from aqueous solutions and their mixtures with Gram-negative bacteria. The optimal conditions of the VNP/MALDI-MS technique, including selection of the MALDI matrix, the choice of cell-washing solution, and the VNP concentration, were also investigated. The capture efficiencies of Gram-positive bacteria with VNPs were 26.7-33.3%. The mass variations of characteristic peaks of the captured bacteria were within +/-5 Da, which indicated good reproducibility of the proposed technique. The technique was applied to detect Gram-positive bacteria in tap water and reservoir water with an analysis time of around 2 h. The detection limit for Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus was 5 x 10(2) cfu/ml for 2.0-l water samples.
TI  - Synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of schiff bases of 4-(2-aminophenyl)-morpholines.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of 4-(2-aminophenyl)morpholines were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were screened for analgesic (100 and 200 mg/kg), antiinflammatory (200 and 400 mg/kg), antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. N-benzylidine-2-morpholoino benzenamine (1) and N-(3-nitro benzylidine)-2-morpholino benzenamine (3) exhibited significant analgesic, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities.
TI  - Antioxidant, antibacterial and antigiardial activities of Walsura robusta Roxb.
AB  - Walsura robusta Roxb. (Family: Meliaceae) is a well-known multi-purpose medicinal plant, and has been employed for a wide range of disease conditions without documented scientific data. In the current study, four pure isolated compounds, 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside (1), turpinionoside A (2), (+)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3) and (-)-lyoniresinol 3alpha-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), were isolated from the leaves and twigs of W. robusta. Biological evaluation for free radical scavenging, antibacterial and antigiardial activities was performed. We investigated antioxidant effects of the crude extracts as well as the isolated compounds using 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH), hydroxyl radical (OH), and superoxide anion (O(2)) scavenging assays. Three phenolic glucosides (1, 3 and 4) were found to possess strong antioxidant activity. They scavenged DPPH(*) with IC(50) values in the range of 51.5-86.6 microM. We also detected the superoxide dismutase-like activities in compounds 3 and 4 which are lignan glucosides, demonstrating potent superoxide scavenging activity with IC(50) values in the range of 0.8 and 0.7 microM, respectively. Other biological activities including antibacterial and antigiardial assays were carried out. Preliminary results demonstrated that most extracts, except the diethyl ether extract, exhibited inhibition zones against all Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, and S. pyogenes. Aqueous extracts of this plant species could inhibit Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Shigella sonnei. However, the determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of W. robusta on all tested bacterial strains showed only weak activity, and their MBCs were greater than 25 mg mL(-1). For antigiardial activity, incubation with 2 x 10(5) trophozoites mL(-1) of the culture medium with the crude extracts at concentration ranged from 31.25 to 1000 microg mL(-1) demonstrated no activity (MIC > 1000 microg mL(-1)).
TI  - Novel 6,8-dibromo-4(3H)quinazolinone derivatives of anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities.
AB  - Starting from 4-(6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl-4-oxo-(4H)-quinazolin-3-yl)-benzoic acid ethyl ester (II) and its acid hydrazide III, a new series of Schiff bases IV and their cyclized products, thiazolidinones V, oxadiazole VIII, pyrazoles X-XII, pyrroles XIII-XV and other related products were synthesized. These compounds were screened for their anti-bacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Legionella monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) and anti-fungal activity (Candida albicans and Aspergillus flavus) using paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 2-(4-(2-phenyl-6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-(4H)quinazolin-3-yl)-N-ethylamido benzoic acid hydrazide VIIa was found to exhibits the most potent in vitro anti-microbial activity with the MICs of 1.56, 3.125, 1.56, 25, 25 and 25 microg/ml against E. coli, S. typhimurium, L. monocytogenes, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and B. cereus respectively. Compound 2-(4-(2-phenyl-6,8-dibromo-4-oxo-(4H)quinazolin-3-yl)-N-methyl thioamido benzoic acid hydrazide VIIc was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro anti-fungal activity with MICs 0.78 and 0.097 microg/ml against C. albicans and A. flavus.
TI  - Blechnum orientale Linn - a fern with potential as antioxidant, anticancer and antibacterial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blechnum orientale Linn. (Blechnaceae) is used ethnomedicinally for the treatment of various skin diseases, stomach pain, urinary bladder complaints and sterilization of women. The aim of the study was to evaluate antioxidant, anticancer and antibacterial activity of five solvent fractions obtained from the methanol extract of the leaves of Blechnum orientale Linn. METHODS: Five solvent fractions were obtained from the methanol extract of B. orientale through successive partitioning with petroleum ether, chloroform, ethyl acetate, butanol and water. Total phenolic content was assessed using Folin-Ciocalteu's method. The antioxidant activity was determined by measuring the scavenging activity of DPPH radicals. Cytotoxic activity was tested against four cancer cell lines and a non-malignant cell using MTT assay. Antibacterial activity was assessed using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution assays. Standard phytochemical screening tests for saponins, tannins, terpenoids, flavonoids and alkaloids were also conducted. RESULTS: The ethyl acetate, butanol and water fractions possessed strong radical scavenging activity (IC50 8.6-13.0 microg/ml) and cytotoxic activity towards human colon cancer cell HT-29 (IC50 27.5-42.8 microg/ml). The three extracts were also effective against all Gram-positive bacteria tested: Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Stapylococcus epidermidis(minimum inhibitory concentration MIC 15.6-250 mug/ml; minimum bactericidal concentration MBC 15.6-250 microg/ml). Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids, terpenoids and tannins. Ethyl acetate and butanol fractions showed highest total phenolic content (675-804 mg gallic acid equivalent/g). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that this fern is a potential candidate to be used as an antioxidant agent, for colon cancer therapy and for treatment of MRSA infections and other MSSA/Gram-positive bacterial infectious diseases.
TI  - Phytochemical and biological investigations of Elaeodendron schlechteranum.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: Elaeodendron schlechteranum (Loes.) Loes. is a shrub or tree belonging to the family Celastraceae. In Tanzania, in addition to ethnopharmacological claims in treating various non-infectious diseases, the root and stem bark powder is applied on septic wounds, and the leaf paste is used for treatment of boils and carbuncles. The aim of this study was to identify the putative active constituents of the plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dried and powdered root bark was extracted and subjected to bioassay-guided fractionation, based on antibacterial, antiparasitic and anti-HIV activity. Isolated compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods, and evaluated for biological activity. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Bioassay-guided isolation led to the identification of tingenin B (22beta-hydroxytingenone) as the main antibacterial constituent. It was active against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (IC(50)<0.25 microg/mL). Furthermore, antiparasitic activity was observed against Trypanosoma cruzi (IC(50)<0.25 microg/mL), Trypanosoma brucei (<0.25 microg/mL), Leishmania infantum (0.51 microg/mL), and Plasmodium falciparum (0.36 microg/mL). Tingenin B was highly cytotoxic to MRC-5 cells (CC(50) 0.45 microg/mL), indicating a poor selectivity. Two inactive triterpenes, 3beta,29-dihydroxyglutin-5-ene and cangoronine methyl ester were also obtained. Phytochemical investigation of the anti-HIV active fractions led to the isolation and identification of three phenolic compounds, namely 4'-O-methylepigallocatechin, 4'-O-methylgallocatechin, and a new procyanidin dimer, i.e. 4',4'''-di-O-methyl-prodelphinidin B(4) or 4'-O-methylgallocatechin-(4alpha-->8)-4'-O-methylepigallocatechin. However, none of these showed anti-HIV activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial, cytotoxicity and phytochemical screening of Jordanian plants used  in traditional medicine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of fifty one extracts of different parts  of 14 plants were studied. Ethanol, methanol, aqueous, butanol, and n-hexane extracts were tested against three gram negative, two gram positive bacteria, and two fungi. Cytotoxicity and phytochemical screening were determined using MTT and TLC assays, respectively. Of the fifty one extracts, twenty two showed activities against different microorganisms with MICs ranging from 62.5 to 1000 microg/mL. The highest activity (100% inhibition) was for a butanol extract of Rosa damascena receptacles against Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus cereus (MIC of 62.5 and 250 microg/mL) respectively. Butanol extract of Narcissus tazetta aerial parts and aqueous extract of Rosa damascena receptacles were both active against Candida albicans (MIC of 125 microg/mL). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by butanol, aqueous extracts of Rosa damascena receptacles and butanol extract of Inula viscosa flowers (MIC of 500, 500, and 250 microg/mL) respectively. Rosa damascena receptacles and Verbascum sinaiticum flowers ethanol extract showed lowest cytotoxicity against Vero cell line (IC50 of 454.11 and 367.11). Most toxic was the ethanol extract of Ononis hirta aerial parts (IC50 72.50 microg/mL). Flavonoids and terpenoids were present in all plants. Ononis hirta and Narcissus tazetta contained alkaloids. The results validate the use of these plants and report for the first time bioactivity of Rosa damascena receptacles and further justifies the use of such screening programs in the quest for new drugs.
TI  - [Preparation of a 96-microwell plate DNA diagnostic chip for detection of foodborne bacteria and its application in an incident of food poisoning].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a 96-microwell plate DNA diagnostic chip for simultaneous detection of 9 major foodborne bacteria. METHODS: Type-specific PCR primers labeled with biotin and oligonucleotide probes were designed according to the conservative genes of 9 major foodborne bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7 (Stx1 and Stx2), Shigella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. A one-tube multiplex PCR system for simultaneous amplification of these bacteria was established, and the DNA probes were spotted and immobilized in the wells of the plate in 5x5 array format. Stable hybridization system between PCR products and oligonucleotide probes in the microwell was established after condition optimization. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin and NBT/BCIP were used to detect the hybridized PCR products. RESULTS: Twenty standard bacteria strains were used to validate the 96 microwell plate DNA diagnostic chip and highly specific and stable experiment results were obtained. Using this chip assay, the causal pathogen Staphylococcus aureus was identified within 12 h after the sampling from an incident of food poisoning, and the result was consistent with that obtained using conventional bacterial culture and biochemical identification. CONCLUSION: The novel 96 microwell plate DNA diagnostic chip allows rapid, accurate, automated and high-throughput bacterial detection and is especially valuable for quick response to such public health emergencies as food poisoning.
TI  - An assessment of the antibacterial activity in larval excretion/secretion of four species of insects recorded in association with corpses, using Lucilia sericata Meigen as the marker species.
AB  - The relative antibacterial activities of excretion/secretion (ES) from two carrion-feeding insects, Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy and Dermestes maculatus DeGeer, and a detritivore, Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus, were compared to that of Lucilia sericata Meigen, a species with ES of known antibacterial capacity, in order to explore the antimicrobial potential of other carrion and detritivore species. Viable counts were used to assess time-kill of ES against five bacterial species, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus mirabilis. Antibacterial activity was recorded in all four insect species although T. molitor and D. maculatus were the most effective in controlling growth of P. mirabilis. The blowflies were more effective in controlling a wider range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The larval ES from all species was shown to reduce bacterial growth rate although differences in antibacterial spectrum were noted and the degree of potency varied between the four species. These differences may be explained ecologically by the different colonisation times of each insect species on the corpse. Overall, this study demonstrates that research into other carrion-feeding insect species has potential to provide an increased source of antimicrobial chemicals to broaden the range of bacterial species beyond that currently controlled using L. sericata.
TI  - Synergistic effects of ethanol and UV radiation to reduce levels of selected foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether combined treatments would produce synergistic disinfection effects on food products during food processing compared with single treatments. We investigated the bactericidal effects of a commercial chemical disinfectant (ethanol) and of UV radiation on Bacillus cereus F4810/72, Cronobacter sakazakii KCTC 2949, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 35556, Escherichia coli ATCC 10536, and Salmonella enterica Typhimurium NO/NA in vitro. Various concentrations of ethanol (10, 30, 40, and 50%) were tested with various exposure doses of UV radiation (6, 96, 216, 360, and 504 mWs/cm(2)) with a UV lamp. The combined ethanol-UV treatments resulted in greater reductions in bacterial counts than did either treatment alone. The synergistic effect values for B. cereus, C. sakazakii, S. aureus, S. enterica Typhimurium NO/NA, and E. coli were 0.40 to 1.52, 0.52 to 1.74, 0.20 to 2.32, 0.07 to 1.14, and 0.02 to 1.75 log CFU/ml, respectively. The results of this study suggest that a significant synergistic benefit results from combining ethanol and UV treatments against foodborne pathogens in vitro.
TI  - A new prenylated flavanoid with antibacterial activity from propolis collected in Egypt.
AB  - A novel prenylated flavanoid, isonymphaeol-D (1), together with two known compounds, isonymphaeol-B (2) and nymphaeol-B (3), were isolated from Egyptian propolis. The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by various spectroscopic methods. 1 exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative strains (Serratia sp., Pseudomonos sp., Escherichia coli).
TI  - Synthesis and Antibacterial Assessment of N-[4-(4-substituted phenyl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl]-1,3,5-triazin-2-amine.
AB  - In a wide search program towards new and efficient antibacterial agents, we assessed the extent to which physicochemical properties can be exploited to promote antibacterial activity associated with a series of substituted s-triazine. The synthesized compounds (1a-12b) were subsequently screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against three gram positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus) and three Gram-negative microorganism (Salmonella typhi, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella aerogenes) by the broth dilution technique, recommended by European Committee for antimicrobial susceptibility testing with reference to streptomycin.
TI  - Evaluation of diffusion and dilution methods to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extracts.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate diffusion and dilution methods for determining the antibacterial activity of plant extracts and their mixtures. Several methods for measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of a plant extract are available, but there is no standard procedure as there is for antibiotics. We tested different plant extracts, their mixtures and phenolic acids on selected gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Infantis, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli) with the disk diffusion, agar dilution, broth microdilution and macrodilution methods. The disk diffusion method was appropriate only as a preliminary screening test prior to quantitative MIC determination with dilution methods. A comparison of the results for MIC obtained by agar dilution and broth microdilution was possible only for gram-positive bacteria, and indicated the latter as the most accurate way of assessing the antimicrobial effect. The microdilution method with TTC (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) or INT (2-p-iodophenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride) to indicate the viability of aerobic bacteria was found to be the best alternative approach, while only ATP determination was appropriate for microaerophilic Campylobacter spp. Using survival curves the kinetics of bacterial inactivation on plant extract exposure was followed for 24h and in this way the MIC values determined by the microdilution method were confirmed as the concentrations of extracts that inhibited bacterial growth. We suggest evaluation of the antibacterial activity of plant extracts using the broth microdilution method as a fast screening method for MIC determination and the macrodilution method at selected MIC values to confirm bacterial inactivation. Campylobacter spp. showed a similar sensitivity to plant extracts as the tested gram-positive bacteria, but S. Infantis and E. coli O157:H7 were more resistant.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological studies on the new symmetric Schiff base  derived from 2,6-diformyl-4-methylphenol with N-aminopyrimidine.
AB  - A phenol based novel Schiff base polydentate symmetric ligand was prepared. The complexes were prepared by reacting ligand and the metal chlorides of Cu (II), Ni(II), Co(II) and Fe(II) in methanol to get a series of mononuclear complexes. The complexes were characterized by elemental analyses, conductivity measurements, magnetic susceptibility data, IR, UV-Vis, NMR and API-ES mass spectral data. The mononuclear structure of the complexes was confirmed on the basis of elemental analyses, magnetic susceptibility and API-ES mass spectral data. The ligand and all the metal complexes were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, S. aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064 and Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9345), one Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli ATCC 4230), and three yeast (Candida albicans ATCC 14053, Candida krusei ATCC 6258 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019) strains. Therefore, newly synthesized the ligand and two complexes [(Cu(II) and Co(II)] showed good biological activity against all tested bacteria and yeast strains.
TI  - The swaposin-like domain of potato aspartic protease (StAsp-PSI) exerts antimicrobial activity on plant and human pathogens.
AB  - Plant-specific insert domain (PSI) is a region of approximately 100 amino acid residues present in most plant aspartic protease (AP) precursors. PSI is not a true saposin domain; it is the exchange of the N- and C-terminal portions of the saposin like domain. Hence, PSI is called a swaposin domain. Here, we report the cloned, heterologous expression and purification of PSI from StAsp 1 (Solanum tuberosum aspartic protease 1), called StAsp-PSI. Results obtained here show that StAsp-PSI is able to kill spores of two potato pathogens in a dose-dependent manner without any deleterious effect on plant cells. As reported for StAPs (S. tuberosum aspartic proteases), the StAsp-PSI ability to kill microbial pathogens is dependent on the direct interaction of the protein with the microbial cell wall/or membrane, leading to increased permeability and lysis. Additionally, we demonstrated that, like proteins of the SAPLIP family, StAsp-PSI and StAPs are cytotoxic to Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria in a dose dependent manner. The amino acid residues conserved in SP_B (pulmonary surfactant protein B) and StAsp-PSI could explain the cytotoxic activity exerted by StAsp-PSI and StAPs against Gram-positive bacteria. These results and data previously reported suggest that the presence of the PSI domain in mature StAPs could be related to their antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of carvacrol and 2-nitro-1-propanol against single and mixed populations of foodborne pathogenic bacteria in corn flour dough.
AB  - Cereal doughs are an important part of human diet, but at the same time can act as vehicles for the transmission of human pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, four pathogenic or toxinogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) were inoculated in a dough made from corn flour in combination with the single antimicrobial compounds carvacrol and 2-Nitro-1-propanol (2NPOH). Survival of single and mixed populations in the treated doughs incubated at 37 degrees C was followed by culture-dependent and independent methods (TTGE). All strains were completely inactivated within 24 h by the tested compounds at 5% final concentration, but showed variable inhibition at lower concentrations of 0.5% and 2%. Sensitivity to antimicrobial compounds was in general modified when strains were tested in cocultures compared with single cultures. B. cereus was more sensitive to carvacrol (minimum bactericidal concentration, MBC, 0.5%) in coculture with S. aureus. It was also more sensitive to 2NPOH in cocultures with S. aureus and with S. enterica (MBC, 2% in both cases). S. aureus was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with B. cereus, E. coli, as well as S. enterica. However, sensitivity to 2NPOH was not modified in any of the coculture experiments (MBC, 2%). E. coli was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with S. aureus and with S. enterica. Resistance of E. coli to 2NPOH also increased in cocultures with B. cereus (MBC, 5%) and with S. aureus (MBC, 2%), but not with S. enterica (MBC, 0.5%). S. enterica was more resistant to carvacrol (MBC, 5%) in cocultures with E. coli, but it was more sensitive to 2NPOH in cocultures with B. cereus as well as with S. aureus (MBC, 2% in both cases). TTGE analysis of survivors from cocultures treated with 2NPOH or carvacrol allowed a good estimation of the identity of survivors according to their DNA band patterns. Results from this study indicate that the efficacy of antimicrobials such as carvacrol and 2NPOH is greatly influenced by the complexity of the microbial populations under target and the relationships between individual populations.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum coatings containing green tea extracts in fruit-based salads, romaine hearts and pork slices.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of edible coatings based on a tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum (dHG) matrix with various green tea extracts (GTEs) were evaluated. Its effect on the shelf-life extension of fruit-based salads, romaine hearts, and pork slices were investigated as well. Three types of GTEs from hot water (80 degrees C) (W), 40% (E4) and 80% (E8) ethanol were prepared. It was found that all GTEs showed pronounced inhibition on Gram positive bacteria in agar media, including Staphylococcus aureus BCRC 10781, Bacillus cereus BCRC 11778 and Listeria monocytogenes BCRC 14848, but not on Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli DH10beta and Salmonella enteria BCRC 10747. The antimicrobial activities increased with increasing GTEs concentration (1, 2 and 5%), but did not differentiate significantly in terms of the effect of extraction solvents. When various GTEs (1%) were added to an edible coating formulation based on 1.35% tapioca starch +0.15% dHG +0.225% glycerol, pronounced antimicrobial activity on Gram positive bacteria was also observed as evaluated by using cylinder diffusion and antimicrobial migration tests. It was believed that the active compounds in green tea extracts could leave the coating matrix and migrate to increase the non-growth area. When being sprayed on various real food models, all tapioca starch/dHG coatings containing GTEs could successfully reduce the aerobic counting and growth of yeasts/molds by 1 to 2 log cycles in fruit-based salads, as compared to the control sample. Furthermore, during refrigerated storage of romaine hearts and pork slices for 48h, tapioca starch/dHG coatings with E4 extracts demonstrated pronounced antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (4-6 log cycles reduction), followed by W extracts and E8 extracts in a decreasing order. Such results implied the high efficacy of antimicrobial migration of tapioca starch/dHG coatings containing GTEs and their application potentials on foods.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of minerals from ores indigenous to Korea.
AB  - We tested the antibacterial properties of a mix of minerals consisting mainly of  sericite, talc, and halloysite from Korea. The preparation showed clear growth inhibition of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Bacillus cereus, as well as the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes. These results indicate that this preparation, made from ore minerals indigenous to Korea, could be used to develop new antibacterial reagents.
TI  - Growth of microorganisms in total parenteral nutrition solutions without lipid.
AB  - BACKGROUND: To identify the microorganisms that can grow rapidly in total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solutions, we investigated the growth of the major causes of catheter-related blood stream infection (Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans) in TPN solutions without lipid. METHODS: Experiment 1: A commercial TPN solution without lipid containing multivitamins (pH5.6) was used. A specific number of each test microorganism was added to each 10 mL of the TPN solution and incubated at room temperature. An aliquot of test solution was sampled and inoculated to SCD agar plates at 0, 24, and 48 hrs after the addition of the microorganisms. The number of microorganisms was counted as colony forming units. Experiment 2: The other 2 commercial TPN solutions without lipid (pH5.5) were supplemented with multivitamins. The pH values of the solutions were adjusted to about 6.0, 6.5, or 7.0 using 0.5 mol/L NaOH. The addition of microorganisms, incubation, and counting were performed in the same manner. RESULTS: Experiment 1: S. aureus, S. marcescens, and B. cereus did not increase in the TPN solution without lipid containing multivitamins (pH5.6), but C. albicans increased rapidly. Experiment 2: The 3 bacterial species did not increase even at pH6.0, but increased at pH6.5 and increased rapidly at pH7.0 in both TPN solutions. C. albicans increased similarly at any pH. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that bacterial species cannot grow in TPN solutions without lipid due to the acidity (pH5.6 or lower), but Candida species can grow regardless of the acidity.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus Faecium Fair-E 198 against gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - This study investigated the antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus faecium FAIR-E 198 against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Using the critical-dilution method, the bacteriocin produced by E. faecium FAIR-E 198 inhibited all L. monocytogenes strains evaluated (1,600 to 19,200 AU mL(-1)). However, none of the B. cereus and S. aureus strains investigated were inhibited. The maximum activity of this bacteriocin (800 AU mL(-1)) was observed in MRS broth, while the activity in milk was 100 AU mL(-1). In the co-cultivation test in milk, B. cereus K1-B041 was reduced to below the detection limit (1.00 log CFU mL(-1)) after 48 h. E. faecium reduced the initial L. monocytogenes Scott A population by 1 log CFU mL(-1) after 3 h at 35 degrees C, However, the pathogen regained growth, reaching 3.68 log CFU mL(-1) after 48 h. E. faecium did not influence the growth of S. aureus ATCC 27154 during the 48 h of co-cultivation, Therefore, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of the antimicrobial activity of E. faecium FAIR-E 198 is strictly related to the species and strain of the target microorganism and to the culture medium.
TI  - [Myonecrosis in users of injecting drugs (a clinical case)].
AB  - Myonecrosis remains one of the severest manifestations of skin and soft tissue infections. Clostridia (C. perfringens, C. novyi, C. septicum, C. sordellii, C. histolyticum) are dominant and Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Bacteriodes fragilis are much less in the etiology of myonecrosis. Cases of gas gangrene have recently become more frequent among injection drug users all over the world. Russia has become the largest opiate market in Europe and consumption of these narcotic drugs is annually growing. In the Russian Federation, a larger number of injection drug users uniquely results in a rise of cases of Clostridium- and mixed flora-induced myonecrosis. Gas gangrene in HIV-positive drug abusers seems to rapidly progress to multiple organ failure and to show high death rates, rather than to develop a localized form. The analyzed case of mixed flora-induced gas gangrene is of interest to physicians of any specialties who can encounter this wound infection in HIV-positive patients.
TI  - Photodynamic antimicrobial activity of avian eggshell pigments.
AB  - Pigmentation in avian eggshells appears to be associated with shell strength, temperature regulation, and camouflage. The pigments found in eggshells are mainly porphyrins, which have been utilized therapeutically as photosensitizers. Here, we examined the photoinactivation of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis) by hen eggshells and their pigments. The results indicated that eggshells have a light-dependent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive, but not gram-negative, bacteria. Our results indicate the possibility that the natural pigments used therapeutically have evolved in nature as a defence system.
TI  - A pilot study of the microbiological quality of culturally diverse, ready-to-eat  foods from selected retail establishments in Melbourne, Australia.
AB  - In recent years, there has been an increasing number of foodborne outbreaks linked to the consumption of culturally diverse foods. This appears to be because of the increasing quantity of culturally diverse foods available and a preference to store these foods, some of which are considered potentially hazardous, at ambient temperature. This practice may contravene temperature requirements defined by the Food Standards Code. A lack of understanding of the hazardous nature of some culturally prepared foods also poses difficulties in applying the Australian food safety legislation by regulators. This pilot study examined the normal microbiota of four culturally diverse foods: nem chua, che dau trang, kueh talam, and banh tet nhan man, which are traditionally stored and consumed at ambient temperature. Challenge testing was conducted to investigate the ability of these foods to support the growth of foodborne bacterial pathogens. Two of the products (kueh talam and che dau) were found to be microbiologically unsatisfactory because of the high standard plate counts. Challenge testing indicated that kueh talam, che dau, and banh tet nhan man were able to support the growth of Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella (1-2 log increases over 6 hours at 25 degrees C), suggesting that these foods may require temperature control during storage. However, nem chua was unable to support the growth of test bacteria, probably because of its acidic nature (pH 4.5), suggesting that ambient storage of this food may be safe. This study provided some preliminary evidence to support the need for further sampling and challenge testing of these products.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of the stem bark of Saraca indica (Caesalpiniaceae).
AB  - Chloroform, methanol, aqueous and ethanolic extracts of the stem bark of Saraca indica were investigated for their antibacterial and antifungal activity against standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhimurium and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the fungi: Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus. Methanolic and aqueous extract exhibited antimicrobial activity with MIC ranging from 0.5-2% and 1-3% respectively. Methanolic extract exhibited the strongest activity against both bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Application of the bactericidal activity of epsilon-poly-l-lysine to the storage  of human platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: epsilon-Poly-l-lysine (epsilon-PLL) is a polypeptide comprising approximately 30 l-lysine subunits generated by bond formation between alpha-carboxy and epsilon-amino groups. It is an approved antimicrobial food preservative in Japan. However, the efficacy of epsilon-PLL as an antibacterial additive for storage of human platelet concentrates (PCs) is not known. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Klebsiella oxytoca (20 colony-forming units/mL) were inoculated into 100% plasma PCs or PCs containing 80% platelet (PLT) additive solution with 5.0 mmol/L potassium and 1.5 mmol/L magnesium (PAS-IIIM) and 20% plasma (PAS-IIIM PCs). Next, a range of epsilon-PLL concentrations up to 200 and 50 microg/mL were added to plasma PCs and PAS-IIIM PCs, respectively, and the bacterial count was determined on Days 1, 2, 5, and 8. The quality of the PCs was also determined. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was inhibited at epsilon-PLL concentrations of 200 and 50 microg/mL in the plasma and PAS-IIIM PCs after 8 days of incubation. The percentage of CD62P-positive PLTs was higher in plasma PCs treated with 200 microg/mL epsilon-PLL and in PAS-IIIM PCs treated with 50 microg/mL epsilon-PLL than in the respective controls without epsilon-PLL. There were no remarkable differences in the other variables, that is, PLT number, mean PLT volume, pH, aggregability, percentage of PAC-1-positive cells, lactate dehydrogenase release, and plasma K and Na concentrations between the epsilon-PLL-treated PCs and the controls. CONCLUSIONS: epsilon-PLL inhibited the growth of bacteria in the PCs and did not considerably affect the quality of PCs, except CD62P expression. Further studies are required to estimate the in vivo effectiveness and safety of epsilon-PLL-treated PCs.
TI  - Synergistic effects of the Lactobacillus acidophilus surface layer and nisin on bacterial growth.
AB  - We have previously described a murein hydrolase activity for the surface layer (S-layer) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356. Here we show that, in combination with nisin, this S-layer acts synergistically to inhibit the growth of pathogenic Gram-negative Salmonella enterica and potential pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. In addition, bacteriolytic effects were observed for the Gram-positive species tested. We postulate that the S-layer enhances the access of nisin into the cell membrane by enabling it to cross the cell wall, while nisin provides the sudden ion-nonspecific dissipation of the proton motive force required to enhance the S-layer murein hydrolase activity.
TI  - Assessment of microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its public health significance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the microbiological quality of sachet-packaged drinking water in Western Nigeria and its impact on public health. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional microbiological testing. METHODS: Ninety-two sachet-packaged water samples were analysed for microbiological and metal qualities. Total bacterial and coliform counts were determined, and the presence of Escherichia coli, an important water quality indicator, was tested. The level of conformity of the water processors with the guidelines of Nigeria's quality regulatory agency was also determined. RESULTS: Varying levels of microbial contamination were recorded in samples from the different sampling locations. The total bacteria count ranged between 2.86 and 3.45log colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. The highest coliform count recorded was 1.62log cfu/ml. Faecal coliform E. coli was detected in one sample from Oke-Iho and one sample from Okaka, representing 2.2% of total samples. Lead and manganese were not found in any of the samples. However, iron was detected and the highest iron concentration (0.10mg/l) was detected in samples from Ikorodu. The bacteria that were identified from the water samples included E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis, Aeromonas sp. and Micrococcus luteum. Many of the water processors did not comply with the guidelines of the quality regulatory agency. CONCLUSIONS: Some of the sachet-packaged samples of drinking water were of poor quality. The results indicate a need for Nigeria's quality regulatory agency to take appropriate measures in safeguarding public health.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a novel antibacterial peptide, avian beta-defensin 2 from ducks.
AB  - In this study, a novel avian beta-defensin (AvBD) was isolated from duck pancreas. The complete nucleotide sequence of the gene contained an 195 bp open reading frame encoding 64 amino acids. Homology, characterization and comparison of the gene with AvBD from other avian species confirmed that it was duck AvBD2. The mRNA expression of the gene was analyzed in 17 tissues from 21-day-old ducks. AvBD2 was highly expressed in the trachea, crop, heart, bone marrow, and pancreas; moderately expressed in the muscular stomach, small intestine, kidney, spleen, thymus, and bursa of Fabricius; and weakly expressed in skin. We produced and purified recombinant AvBD2 by expressing the gene in Escherichia coli. As expected, the recombinant peptide exhibited strong bactericidal properties against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pasteurella multocida, and weak bactericidal properties against E. coli and Salmonella choleraesuis. In addition, the recombinant protein retained antimicrobial activity against S. aureus under different temperatures (range, -20 degrees C to 100 degrees C) and pH values (range, 3 to 12).
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the extracts of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) fruits from different regions.
AB  - Structural properties (using gas chromatographic analyses: gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry) of some compounds (pure chemicals, essential oils, extracts, etc.) and systematic investigation of antimicrobial activities (with agar dilution and agar diffusion disc methods) were determined in the fruits of Kefe cumin (Laser trilobum L.) obtained from different regions (Germany, India, and Turkey). The main components were established as limonene (41.03-72.24%) and perillaldehyde (4.23-32.75%) in the essential oils determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Mineral contents in the fruits were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer. It was determined that the fruits were rich in potassium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, arsenic and aluminium minerals. The highest sodium content was found to be 9,261.28 mg/kg in the samples obtained from Turkey, but the potassium content of the samples from Germany and India was higher than that of Kefe cumin fruits obtained from Turkey. The fruit extracts had a significant antimicrobial effect on pathogen bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris (FMC 1), Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus (FMC 19), Aeromonas hydrophila (ATCC 7965), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 15753), Klebsiella pneumoniae (FMC 5), Salmonella typhimurium, Enterobacter aerogenes (CCM 2531) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 8739), whereas no significant antimicrobial effect of the essential oils was observed.
TI  - New cyclopentenones from strain Trichoderma sp. YLF-3.
AB  - Two new cyclopentenones, trichodermone A (1) and trichodermone B (2), together with a known compound, 3-(3-oxocyclopent-1-enyl) propanoic acid (3), were isolated from the strain Trichoderma sp. YLF-3. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of their spectroscopic data. All compounds were assayed for antibacterial activity. Compound 3 showed activity against Staphyloccocus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - In vitro effects on bacterial growth of phenoloxidase reaction products.
AB  - An active phenoloxidase preparation from the freshwater crayfish Pacifastacus leniusculus exhibited a strong antibacterial effect in vitro on the bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae whereas a weaker but still significant effect against Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In most cases reduction of bacterial growth was stronger when dopamine was used as substrate as compared to L-dopa. The effect on bacteria was abolished if no substrate was available for the phenoloxidase or in the presence of the phenoloxidase inhibitor phenylthiourea.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oregano (Origanum vulgare Linn.) against gram positive  bacteria.
AB  - The present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of infusion, decoction and essential oil of oregano (Origanum vulgare) against 111 Gram-positive bacterial isolates belonging to 23 different species related to 3 genera. Infusion and essential oil exhibited antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus saprophyticus, S. aureus, Micrococcus roseus, M. kristinae, M. nishinomiyaensis, M. lylae, M. luteus, M. sedentarius, M. varians, Bacillus megaterium, B. thuringiensis, B. alvei, B. circulans, B. brevis, B. coagulans, B. pumilus, B. laterosporus, B. polymyxa, B. macerans, B. subtilis, B. firmus, B. cereus and B. lichiniformis. The infusion exhibited maximum activity against B. laterosporus (17.5 mm mean zone of inhibition+/-1.5 Standard deviation) followed by B. polymyxa (17.0 mm+/-2.0 SD) and essential oil of oregano exhibited maximum activity against S. saprophyticus (16.8 mm+/-1.8 SD) followed by B. circulans (14.5 mm+/-0.5 SD). While all these tested isolates were found resistant to decoction of oregano.
TI  - Expression of recombinant antibacterial lactoferricin-related peptides from Pichia pastoris expression system.
AB  - Four recombinant antimicrobial peptide (rAMP) cDNAs, constructed from two goat lactoferricin-related peptide cDNAs (GLFcin and GLFcin II) with/without (His)(6)-Tag, were cloned into pPICZalphaC and transformed into Pichia pastoris SMD1168H. After methanol induction, these rAMPs were expressed and secreted into broth. They were purified after CM-Sepharose (without His-tg), HisTrap (with His-tg) and Sephadex G-25 chromatographies. The yield of purified rAMP was 0.15 mg/mL of broth. These 4 rAMPs were thermal-stable and with high antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli BCRC 11549, Pseudomonas aeruginosa BCRC 12450, Bacillus cereus BCRC 10603, Staphylococcus aureus BCRC 25923, Propioni bacterium acnes BCRC 10723, and Listera monocytogenes BCRC 14845. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of rAMPs against these indicators ranged from 4.07 to 16.00 mg/mL.
TI  - Study on the antibiotic activity of microcapsule curcumin against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Curcumin as an edible natural pigment has several biological activities but its use as a food colorant and preservative is restricted due to low stability and insolubility in water. Stabilizing it with microencapsulation to obtain microcapsule curcumin can improve its stability and solubility. The microcapsule curcumin was studied for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against some foodborne pathogens and spoilage microbe such as Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Aspergillus niger, Penicllium notatum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It exhibited broad spectrum inhibitory effect against all organisms by Oxford cup methods, and its minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were determined by agar dilution method and ranged from 15.7 to 250 microg/mL. For the selected microorganisms, its antibacterial activity was more pronounced against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, its antifungal activity is much better than antibacterial activity. Microcapsule curcumin remains in antibacterial and antifungal activities after microencapsulation, which can be potential colorant and preservative in food industry.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial peptides as novel bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A single cost-effective pathogen inactivation approach would help to  improve the safety of our nation's blood supply. Several methods and technologies are currently being studied to help reduce bacterial contamination of blood components. There is clearly need for simple and easy-to-use pathogen inactivation techniques specific to plasma, platelets (PLTs), and red blood cells. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this report, we introduce a novel proof of concept: using known therapeutic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as bactericidal agents for room temperature-stored PLT concentrates (PCs). Nine synthetic AMPs, four from PLT microbicidal protein-derived peptides (PD1-4) and five Arg-Trp (RW) repeat peptides containing one to five repeats, were tested for bactericidal activity in plasma and PC samples spiked with Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacillus cereus. A 3-log reduction of viable bacteria was considered as the bactericidal activity of a given peptide. RESULTS: In both plasma alone and PCs, RW3 peptide demonstrated bactericidal activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and K. pneumoniae; PD4 and RW2 against P. aeruginosa; and RW4 against K. pneumoniae. The activity of each of these four peptides against the remaining bacterial species in the test panel resulted in less than a 3-log reduction in the number of viable bacteria and hence considered ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a new approach to improving the safety of blood components, demonstrating the potential usefulness of screening therapeutic AMPs against selected bacteria to identify suitable bactericidal agents for stored plasma, PCs, and other blood products.
TI  - Volatile constituents and antibacterial screening of the essential oil of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. growing in Nigeria.
AB  - The essential oil of the aerial parts of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. has been isolated by hydrodistillation and analyzed using GC-MS. The major components were found to be alpha-terpinene (63.1%), p-cymene (26.4%) and ascaridole (3.9%). The oil displayed no antibacterial activity against either Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus, or the Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli (MIC=1250 microg/mL). A cluster analysis of C. ambrosioides essential oils reveals at least seven distinct chemotypes: ascaridole, alpha-terpinene, alpha-pinene, p-cymene, carvacrol, alpha-terpinyl acetate, and limonene.
TI  - Assay of enterocin AS-48 for inhibition of foodborne pathogens in desserts.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes in different kinds of desserts. The highest activity against S. aureus was detected in baker cream. However, in yogurt-type soy-based desserts and in gelatin pudding, AS-48 (175 arbitrary units [AU]/g) reduced viable cell counts of S. aureus by only 1.5 to 1.8 log units at most. The efficacy of AS-48 in puddings greatly depended on inoculum size, and viable S. aureus counts decreased below detection levels within 24 h for inocula lower than 4 to 5.5 log CFU/g. For L. monocytogenes, bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 to 87.5 AU/g reduced viable counts below detection levels and avoided regrowth of survivors. The lowest activity was detected in yogurt-type desserts. For B. cereus, viable cell counts were reduced below detection levels for bacteriocin concentrations of 52.5 AU/g in instant pudding without soy or by 175 AU/g in the soy pudding. In gelatin pudding, AS-48 (175 AU/g) reduced viable cell counts of B. cereus below detection levels after 8 h at 10 degrees C or after 48 h at 22 degrees C. Bacteriocin addition also inhibited gelatin liquefaction caused by the proteolytic activity of B. cereus.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of pathogenic B. cereus, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes by multiplex PCR.
AB  - Three important foodborne pathogens, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and  Staphylococcus aureus are of major concern for food safety in terms of frequency and seriousness of the disease. The occurrence these three important pathogens and their coexistence in food matrices are predominant. Moreover, symptoms associated with B. cereus and S. aureus food poisoning not only closely resembles each other but can also be overlapping with other foodborne infections. In this context, detection of these three pathogens simultaneously in food samples by a single multiplex PCR (mPCR) would have advantages in terms of rapidity and cost saving, when compared with single organism specific PCRs. mPCR has been standardized by targeting three major diarrheal enterotoxin genes hbl A, cyt K and nhe A of B. cereus, virulence associated nuc and Ent B genes of S. aureus and virulence associated hly and iap genes of L. monocytogenes along with internal amplification control (IAC). The results showed that mPCR accurately identified all the three organisms individually or in combination without non-specificity. The mPCR was able to detect as low as 10 to 100 organisms per ml of growth following overnight enrichment of spiked food samples (vegetable biriyani and milk) and their presence in naturally contaminated samples also. The high throughput and cost effective multiplex PCR method developed in this study could provide a powerful tool for simultaneous, rapid and reliable detection of B. cereus, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes in food samples.
TI  - Effect of mixed antimicrobial agents and flavors in active packaging films.
AB  - Active packaging is an emerging food technology to improve the quality and safety of food products. Many works have been developed to study the antimicrobial activity of essential oils. Essential oils have been traditionally used as flavorings in food, so they have an important odor impact but they have as well antimicrobial properties that could be used to protect the food. Recent developments in antimicrobial active packaging showed the efficiency of essential oils versus bread and bakery products among other applications. However, one of the main problems to face is the odor and taste they could provide to the packaged food. Using some aromas to mask the odor could be a good approach. That is why the main objective of this paper is to develop an antimicrobial packaging material based on the combination of the most active compounds of essential oils (hydrocinnamaldehyde, oregano essential oil, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol) together with some aromas commonly used in the food industry. A study of the concentration required to get the antimicrobial properties, the organoleptic compatibility with typical aroma present in many food systems (vanilla, banana, and strawberry), and the right combination of both systems has been carried out. Antimicrobial tests of both the mentioned aromas, the main components of some essential oils, and the combination of both groups were carried out against bacteria (Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella choleraesuis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Escherichia coli), yeasts (Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii), and molds (Botrytis cinerae, Aspergillus flavus, Penicillium roqueforti, Eurotium repens, Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium commune, Penicillium nalgiovensis). The sensory properties of the combinations were evaluated with a triangular test and classification was by an order test; the odor threshold of the aroma compounds was also studied. The results reveal that none of the aromas had antimicrobial properties. The most antimicrobial compounds are thymol, carvacrol, and cinnamaldehyde, but none of them could be combined with banana aroma, whereas only thymol with strawberry aroma gave the right combined organoleptic profile. All of the antimicrobials under study could be combined with vanilla aroma, providing both antimicrobial property and the odor expected.
TI  - Differential transfer dynamics of pAW63 plasmid among members of the Bacillus cereus group in food microcosms.
AB  - AIM: To assess the dynamics of plasmid transfer between Bacillus thuringiensis and B. cereus in various food microcosms using the B. thuringiensis pAW63 and Staphylococcus aureus pUB110 plasmids as models. METHODS AND RESULTS: The conjugative behaviour of pAW63, which resembles the B. anthracis virulence plasmid pXO2, and the mobilization of pUB110 were investigated using kinetics studies performed in reference LB (lysogeny broth) medium, full-cream and skimmed milks, soya milk and rice milk. Transfers of pAW63 and pUB110 were found to occur in the five tested media, with higher frequencies observed in food matrices, most notably in full-cream milk, skimmed milk and soya milk, where the mean transfer frequencies reached 10(-3) transconjugants per recipient cell. The most notable observations were that the higher transfer frequencies obtained in foodstuffs compared to those observed in LB were because of an earlier onset of conjugation in combination with a higher transfer rate and/or a longer mating period. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that not only the potential for plasmid transfer but also the overall timing of conjugation is affected by each of these food matrices. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new approach to study plasmid transfer provides insights for a better understanding of conjugation in food microcosms from both animal and vegetable origins among members of the B. cereus group.
TI  - Growth and gaseous emissions of pure and mixed small intestinal bacterial cultures: Effects of bile and vancomycin.
AB  - Simultaneous cultivations in anaerobiosis, aerobiosis and with microaerobic gas mixture were used to clarify the bile (oxgall) effects on the pure and mixed cultures of enterobacterial strains in simulations in Portable Microbe Enrichment Unit (PMEU) linked with ChemPro100i((R)) gas detector. The effects of vancomycin were evaluated in aerobic cultures. Growth and metabolic activity of cultures were also followed by measuring sugar consumption, pH alterations, and colony counts on BD CHROMagar Orientation plates. Results showed that the two fermentatively different strains of facultative anaerobes, Escherichia coli E 17 and Klebsiella mobilis ATCC 13048 grew in balance regardless of oxygen level, bile acid concentration or other components of the mixed cultures, Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus. When the evaporations of the mixed cultures of E. coli, K. mobilis and S. aureus were compared with the emissions of the corresponding pure cultures by ChemPro100i((R)) gas sensing detector, the pure cultures of bile resistant E. coli and K. mobilis produced more gaseous components than the mixed culture indicating that these organisms cooperate and use the substrate more effectively together than separately. A survey of the aseptic bacterial isolations from the bile tract in a big University Hospital, (Salzburg, Austria) during 3 years, showed that these bacterial groups dominated. Only 13.24% of the 287 patient samples were sterile, and around 180 strains of both E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter groups were found amongst 973 isolates from 249 patients (together 35.57%). Enterococcus sp. accounted for 246 isolates being the largest group of strains (24.25% of all the isolates). In anaerobiosis it was shown that Klebsiella neutralized the acids produced in the mixed acid fermentation of the E. coli. The ethanol produced from both groups evaporated in the gas stream of the PMEU culturing step and its formation also removes excess acidity from the cultures. The synergistic behaviour and symbiotic function between E. coli and Klebsiella/Enterobacter strains is suggested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of ethanol extracts of seaweeds against fish bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Crude extracts were prepared using the solvent ethanol from the seaweeds viz., Gracilaria edulis, Calorpha peltada and Hydroclothres sp. and screening for their antibacterial activity against six bacterial pathogens were also carried out. The test bacterial strains were Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. Ethanol extract of Gracilaria edulis inhibited growth of all the test organisms except Bacillus cereus and Enterobacter aerogenes. Seaweed extract of Calorpha peltada was found effective against a number of Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis. Hydroclothres sp. extract inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa only out of the six tested pathogens.
TI  - Characterization of Lactobacillus spp. isolated from the feces of breast-feeding  piglets.
AB  - Lactobacillus spp., referred to as IJ-1 and IJ-2, were isolated from the feces of breast-feeding piglets and analyzed for probiotic properties. According to the analyses of 16S rDNA sequence, Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 showed greater than 99% homology with Lactobacillus reuteri DSM 20016(T), and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 had greater than 99% homology with the L. gasseri ATCC 33323(T) and L. johnsonii ATCC 33200(T). The pH changes in the culture media of Lactobacillus sp. IJ-1 and Lactobacillus sp. IJ-2 were from 6.5 to 4.2 and 4.6, respectively. Their respective resistance against artificial gastric acid and artificial bile acid led to survival rates of nearly 186+/-44% and 13+/-5%. Neither strain produced the carcinogenic enzyme beta-glucuronidase. Both strains inhibited the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, such as Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19111, Salmonella enterica KCTC 12401, Salmonella enteritidis ATCC 13076, Staphylococcus aureus KCTC 3881, and Bacillus cereus 3711, within 24 h of growth.
TI  - Structure and applications of a rhamnolipid surfactant produced in soybean oil waste.
AB  - Soybean oil soapstock was utilized as an alternative carbon source for the production of rhamnolipids by Pseudomonas aeruginosa LBI strain. The chemical composition and properties of the rhamnolipid mixture obtained were determined to define its potential applications. The chemical characterization of the rhamnolipid has revealed the presence of ten different homologues. The monorhamnolipid RhaC10C1) and the dirhamnolipid Rha2C10C10 were the main components of the mixture that showed predominance of 44% and 29%, respectively, after 144-h of cultivation. The biosurfactant was able to form stable emulsions with several hydrocarbons and showed excellent emulsification for soybean oil and chicken fat (100%). The rhamnolipid removed 67% of crude oil present in sand samples and presented antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Mucor miehei at 64 microg/mL and inhibition of Neurospora crassa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Micrococcus luteus at 256 microg/mL. The results demonstrated that the rhamnolipid produced in soybean oil soapstock can be useful in environmental and food industry applications.
TI  - Detection of Enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a DNA microarray.
AB  - Pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (PIF). An obstacle associated with PIF microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. We have developed a rapid, DNA microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with PIF contamination based on the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and wzy (O antigen polymerase) gene. Using this procedure, Enterobacter sakazakii, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157 were identified. One hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). Twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic DNA or 10(4) CFU/ml). Twenty-one real PIF samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. The data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - Bacteriocin production by Staphylococcus aureus involved in bovine mastitis in Brazil.
AB  - In the present study, 257 Staphylococcus spp. strains were isolated from bovine mastitis cases in 56 different Brazilian dairy herds located in the southeast region of the country and tested for antimicrobial substance (AMS) production. Forty-six strains (17.9%) exhibited AMS production and their identification as Staphylococcus aureus was based on the presence of Gram-positive cocci and on positive results in tests for the ability to coagulate rabbit plasma, to ferment mannitol, and to produce acetoin. The AMS were characterized as bacteriocins (Bac) by their sensitivity to proteolytic enzymes. The Bac(+) strains were tested for resistance to 14 antimicrobial agents showing different profiles. Eighteen strains (39.0%) expressed a multiple antibiotic resistance phenotype. Forty-five strains exhibited at least one plasmid DNA. Cross-immunity analysis against strain S. aureus A70, which produces aureocin A70, amplification of the aurABCD operon (which encodes aureocin A70) or detection of this same operon by DNA/DNA hybridization revealed that 34 strains produce bacteriocins either identical or similar to aureocin A70. The remaining 12 Bac(+) strains produce antimicrobial peptides that seem to be distinct from the best characterized staphylococcal bacteriocins described thus far. The bacteriocin produced by strain 4185 may possess potential practical applications, since it was able to inhibit important pathogens such as Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus spp. isolated from nosocomial infections.
TI  - Seasonal variation and bioactivity in the leaf oil of Liriodendron tulipifera growing in Huntsville, Alabama.
AB  - The seasonal variation in the chemical composition of the leaf essential oil of Liriodendron tulipifera has been analyzed by GC-MS. Two individual trees were sampled five times during the course of the growing season. Twenty components were identified in the leaf oils, which were dominated by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, principally germacrene D and beta-elemene, in the early part of the season (42-44% and 18-23%, respectively,) but monoterpene hydrocarbons, largely (Z)-beta-ocimene, dominated the later season leaf oils (40-60%). The leaf oils exhibited in-vitro antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus as well as cytotoxic activity on MDA-MB-231 and Hs 578T human breast tumor cells.
TI  - Differentiation of whole bacterial cells based on high-throughput microarray chip printing and infrared microspectroscopic readout.
AB  - Using robotic automation, a microarray printing protocol for whole bacterial cells was developed for subsequent label-free and nondestructive infrared microspectroscopic detection. Using this contact microspotting system, 24 microorganisms were printed on zinc selenide slides; these were 6 species of Listeria, 10 species of Vibrio, 2 strains of Photobacterium damselae, Yersinia enterocolitica 289, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14529, Staphylococcus aureus, ATCC 19075 (serotype 104 B), Shigella sonnei 20143, Klebsiella pneumoniae KP73, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii 200, and Escherichia coli. Microarrays consisting of separate spots of bacterial deposits gave consistent and reproducible infrared spectra, which were differentiated by unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms. Two multivariate analysis algorithms, principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis, successfully separated most, but not all, the bacteria investigated down to the species level.
TI  - Antimicrobial, mechanical, and barrier properties of cassava starch-chitosan films incorporated with oregano essential oil.
AB  - The physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of starch-chitosan films incorporated with oregano essential oil (OEO) have been investigated. The antimicrobial effects of starch-chitosan-OEO films against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by the disk inhibition zone method. The film mechanical properties, water vapor permeability (WVP), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), and thermograms (TGA) were also determined. Films added with OEO effectively inhibited the four microorganisms tested and demonstrated improved barrier properties. The presence of OEO in starch-chitosan films led to the formation of more flexible films. Chitosan was not effective against the tested organisms, but it decreased film rigidity and WVP. TGA analysis demonstrated that the addition of chitosan and OEO did not affect the thermal stability of the films.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - Simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and Escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex PCR.
AB  - The objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (CE-SSCP) coupled with multiplex PCR. Specific primers for multiplex PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enterica, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their PCR products in subsequent analysis by CE-SSCP. Multiplex PCR conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of PCR cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection of all target foodborne bacteria. The diagnostic system using CE-SSCP combined with multiplex PCR developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. The simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.
TI  - Survival of foodborne pathogens in grain products and the effect of catechins.
AB  - We investigated the survival of bacterial pathogens in grain products. Salmonella Enteritidis and Staphylococcus aureus survived for more than 3 weeks in grain flakes. Although S. Enteritidis in grain flakes reached a level of less than 10(2) CFU/g, the surviving organisms grew rapidly in milk and reached 10(9) CFU/g after 25-hr incubation. When catechins were present on the grain flakes, the numbers of S. Enteritidis and S. aureus were significantly decreased. In addition, catechins reduced the survival and growth of S. Enteritidis, S. aureus and Bacillus cereus when added to cooked grain products. This study indicates that S. Enteritidis, S. aureus and Bacillus can survive for a long time in grain products and that catechins impair their survival and growth.
TI  - Pharmacognostic, Phytochemical and Anti-microbial studies of Solanum indicum leaves.
AB  - The leaves of Solanum indicum showed the presence of stellate trichome. Ethanolic extract of leaves Solanum indicum showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli where as chloroform extract, acetone extract and ethanol showed anti bacterial against pseudomonas. The aqueous extract did not show any anti microbial activity towards the tested organism. None of the extract showed anti fungal activity.
TI  - Infections in patients with aplastic anemia.
AB  - Infection is a major cause of death in patients with aplastic anemia (AA). There  are differences between the immunocompromised state of a patient with AA and the patient who is neutropenic due to chemotherapy and this leads to a difference in the infections that they incur. Prolonged neutropenia is one of the largest risk factors for the development of infections with the invasive mycoses and bacteria. Recovery from neutropenia is directly related to survival, and supportive care plays a large role in protection while the patient is in a neutropenic state. The most common invasive mycoses include the Aspergillus species, Zygomycetes, Candida spp., and Fusarium spp. Bacterial infections that are seen in patients with AA include gram-positive coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, Enterococcus, Staphylococus aureus, Clostridium spp., Micrococcus, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus. Gram-negative infections including gram-negative bacilli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Bacteroides fragilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumonia, Aeromonas hydrophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Vibrio vulnificus. Viral infections are much less common but include those that belong to the Herpesviridae family, community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the viral hepatitides A, B, and C. Evidence of the parasite Strongyloides stercoralis has also been documented. This review discusses the major invasive fungal infections, bacterial pathogens, parasites, and viral infections that are found in patients with AA who are treated with immunosuppressive therapy. The specific immune impairment and current treatment parameters for each of these classes of infection will also be discussed.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, antimicrobial activity and structure-activity relationships of new aryldisulfonamides.
AB  - A series of aromatic disulfonamide (1-8) derivatives and 4-methylbenzenesulfonyl  hydrazide (9) were synthesized and characterized. All compounds were evaluated in vitro for their antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Bacillus cereus ATCC 6633, Bacillus magaterium RSKK 5117, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, Salmonella enterititis ATCC 13076 by microdilution and disc diffusion methods. Antimicrobial activity of the aromatic disulfonamides decreased as the length of the carbon chain increased. An analysis of the structure- activity relationship (SAR) along with computational studies showed that the most active compound (9) possessed low lipophilicity (AlogP=0.59) and high solubility (logS = -1.33).
TI  - Assessment of the microbiological safety of salad vegetables and sauces from kebab take-away restaurants in the United Kingdom.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish the microbiological safety of salad vegetables and sauces served in kebab take-away restaurants. Comparison with published microbiological guidelines revealed that 4.7% of 1213 salad vegetable samples were of unsatisfactory microbiological quality due to Escherichia coli and/or Staphylococcus aureus levels at > or =10(2) cfu g(-1). Another 0.3% of salad samples were of unacceptable quality due to S. aureus at > or =10(4) cfu g(-1) (2 samples) or the presence of Salmonella Kentucky (1 sample). Cucumber was the most contaminated salad vegetable with regards to unsatisfactory levels of E. coli (6.0%) or S. aureus (4.5%). Five percent of 1208 sauce samples were of unsatisfactory microbiological quality due to E. coli, S. aureus at > or =10(2) cfu g(-1) and/or Bacillus cereus and other Bacillus spp. at > or =10(4) cfu g(-1). A further 0.6% of sauce samples were of unacceptable quality due to Bacillus spp. (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus licheniformis) at > or =10(5) cfu g(-1) or the presence of Salmonella Agbeni (1 sample). More samples of chili sauce (8.7%) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable microbiological quality than any other sauce types. The results emphasize the need for good hygiene practices in kebab take-away restaurants handling these types of ready-to-eat products.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of commercial green tea and rosemary leaf powders on the growth of foodborne pathogens in laboratory media and oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  - The antimicrobial effects of green tea and rosemary added to foods as antagonists to foodborne pathogens were determined in laboratory media and oriental-style rice cakes. The growth of each pathogen (Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Typhimurium, Enterobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes) in tryptic soy broth or rice cake with or without addition of green tea or rosemary leaf powders before autoclaving or cooking, respectively, was investigated after inoculation. The addition of 1% green tea or rosemary produced similar results for inhibiting the growth of pathogens in tryptic soy broth. However, green tea was more effective than rosemary for inhibiting the growth of L. monocytogenes. Both botanicals had inhibitory effects against all pathogens tested in this study. Green tea was particularly effective against B. cereus, S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes, and rosemary was strongly inhibitory against B. cereus and S. aureus. The addition of 1 or 3% green tea or rosemary to rice cakes did not significantly reduce total aerobic counts; however, levels of B. cereus and S. aureus were significantly reduced in rice cakes stored for 3 days at room temperature (22 degrees C). The order of antimicrobial activities against B. cereus in rice cake was 1% rosemary < 1% green tea < 3% rosemary = 3% green tea. These results indicate that the use of natural plant materials such as green tea and rosemary could improve the microbial quality of foods in addition to their functional properties.
TI  - Rapid detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples by an improved reverse dot blot method.
AB  - AIM: To develop a new, rapid and accurate reverse dot blot (RDB) method for the detection of intestinal pathogens in fecal samples. METHODS: The 12 intestinal pathogens tested were Salmonella spp., Brucella spp., Escherichia coli O157:H7, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. The two universal primers were designed to amplify two variable regions of bacterial 16S and 23S rDNA genes from all of the 12 bacterial species tested. Five hundred and forty fecal samples from the diarrhea patients were detected using the improved RDB assay. RESULTS: The methods could identify the 12 intestinal pathogens specifically, and the detection limit was as low as 103 CFUs. The consistent detection rate of the improved RDB assay compared with the traditional culture method was up to 88.75%. CONCLUSION: The hybridization results indicated that the improved RDB assay developed was a reliable method for the detection of intestinal pathogen in fecal samples.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of benzophenones and extracts from the fruits of Garcinia  brasiliensis.
AB  - The pericarp and seeds from fruits of Garcinia brasiliensis were subjected to extraction with hexane and ethanol. The pericarp hexane extract (PHE) and seed ethanol extract (SEE) were purified by silica gel column chromatography, which permitted isolation of the prenylated benzophenones 7-epiclusianone (1) and guttiferone-A (2), respectively. The antimicrobial activity of PHE, SEE, and compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated against Candida albicans, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus cultures. The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were established. The substances presented activity against S. aureus and B. cereus as follows: PHE, 4.0 microg/mL and 2.4 microg/mL; SEE, 10.0 microg/mL and 12.6 microg/mL; 7-epiclusianone, 1.2 microg/mL and 0.6 microg/mL; and guttiferone-A, 2.4 microg/mL and 2.4 microg/mL, respectively. The direct relationship between the lipophilic character of the structure and activity in Gram-positive bacteria was specifically observed. Therefore these extracts and prenylated benzophenones represent an interesting topic for further studies and open possibilities for an alternative control of diseases associated with Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Interventions for control of Salmonella: clearance of microbial growth from rubber picker fingers.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine if a surface material with antimicrobial properties combined with an effective disinfectant could achieve total clearance of bacterial contamination. Before beginning the project, new rubber picker fingers collected from 3 processing facilities were tested for endogenous microflora. Five species of bacteria common to soil and human handling were present: Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Bacillus cereus/thuringiensis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis ssp. novobiosepticus, and Staphylococcus intermedius. In separate experiments, new (unused) rubber picker fingers from 3 manufacturers were exposed to broiler carcass rinses, and the kinetics of bacterial attachment to finger material was determined. Turbidity of the bacterial suspensions at varying dilutions containing picker finger sections was compared hourly with controls to evaluate inhibition. New rubber finger material from the 3 manufacturers significantly inhibited bacterial growth (P < 0.05), without the aid of antibacterial additives. We improved an assay for screening disinfectants against growth of pathogens and determined the activity of 5 disinfectant compounds. Two of the compounds were most effective against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli, and one of the compounds was selected for further study with Salmonella Enteritidis. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed the levels of Salmonella Enteritidis before and after treatment. The most effective compound was nontoxic and completely cleared Salmonella Enteritidis contamination from the rubber picker finger surface.
TI  - Antibacterial protection by enterocin AS-48 in sport and energy drinks with less  acidic pH values.
AB  - The low pH and acid content found in sports and energy drinks are a matter of concern in dental health. Raising the pH may solve this problem, but at the same time increase the risks of spoilage or presence of pathogenic bacteria. In the present study, commercial energy drinks were adjusted to pH 5.0 and challenged with Listeria monocytogenes (drinks A to F), Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus licheniformis (drink A) during storage at 37 degrees C. L. monocytogenes was able to grow in drink A and survived in drinks D and F for at least 2 days. Addition of enterocin AS-48 (1 microg/ml final concentration) rapidly inactivated L. monocytogenes in all drinks tested. S. aureus and B. cereus also survived quite well in drink A, and were completely inactivated by 12.5 microg/ml enterocin AS-48 after 2 days of storage or by 25 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. B. licheniformis was able to multiply in drink A, but it was completely inactivated by 5 microg/ml enterocin AS-48 after 2 days of storage or by 12.5 microg/ml bacteriocin after 1 day. Results from the present study suggest that enterocin AS-48 could be used as a natural preservative against these target bacteria in less acidic sport and energy drinks.
TI  - Synthesis, spectral characterization, in-vitro microbiological evaluation and cytotoxic activities of novel macrocyclic bis hydrazone.
AB  - A macrocyclic hydrazone Schiff base was synthesized by reacting 1,4-dicarbonyl phenyl dihydrazide with 2,6-diformyl-4-methyl phenol and a series of metal complexes with this new Schiff base were synthesized by reaction with Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) metal salts. The Schiff base and its complexes have been characterized by elemental analyses, IR, (1)H NMR, UV-vis, FAB mass, ESR spectra, fluorescence, thermal, magnetic and molar conductance data. The analytical data reveal that the Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes possess 2:1 metal-ligand ratios. All the complexes are non-electrolytes in DMF and DMSO due to their low molar conductance values. Infrared spectral data suggest that the hydrazone Schiff base behaves as a hexadentate ligand with NON NON donor sequence towards the metal ions. The ESR spectral data shows that the metal-ligand bond has considerable covalent character. The electrochemical behavior of the copper(II) complex was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. The Schiff base and its complexes have also been screened for their antibacterial (Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella dysentery, Micrococcus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and antifungal activities (Aspergillus niger, Penicillium and Candida albicans) by MIC method. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - An overlap between the control of programmed cell death in Bacillus anthracis and sporulation.
AB  - The Staphylococcus aureus cid and lrg operons have been shown to control cell death and lysis in a manner thought to be analogous to programmed cell death (apoptosis) in eukaryotic organisms. Although orthologous operons are present in a wide variety of bacterial species, members of the Bacillus cereus group are unique in that they have a total of four cid-/lrg-like operons. Two of these operons are similar to the S. aureus cid and lrg operons, while the other two (designated clhAB(1) and clhAB(2)) are unique to this group. In the present study, the functions and regulation of these loci were examined. Interestingly, the Bacillus anthracis lrgAB mutant displayed decreased stationary-phase survival, whereas the clhAB(2) mutant exhibited increased stationary-phase survival compared to the parental and complementation strains. However, neither mutation had a dramatic effect on murein hydrolase activity or autolysis. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of the sporulation efficiency revealed that both mutants formed fewer spores than did the parental strain. Similar to S. aureus, B. anthracis lrgAB transcription was shown to be induced by gramicidin and CCCP, agents known to dissipate the proton motive force, in a lytSR-dependent manner. Northern blot analyses also demonstrated a positive role for lytSR in the clhAB(2) transcription. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate that B. anthracis lrgAB and clhAB(2) play important roles in the control of cell death and lysis and reveal a previously unrecognized role of this system in sporulation.
TI  - Disinfection methods used in decontamination of bottles used for feeding powdered infant formula.
AB  - Infant susceptibility and the risks posed by infections associated with bottle-fed powdered infant formula (PIF) have received increased attention in recent years. Intrinsic contamination of PIF with pathogens has been reported and extrinsic contamination can be introduced from the handler or the environment during reconstitution. Recommended disinfection advice and bottle decontamination have changed in recent years and the aim of this study was to validate the efficacy of four current disinfection methods using bottles that had contained reconstituted PIF spiked with either a representative mixed bacterial culture or specific pathogens. Initially, bottles (n = 6) of reconstituted formula were spiked with 10(5) cfu/ml representative mixed culture. For subsequent experiments, reconstituted formula was spiked with either 10(2) and 10(4) cfu/ml of Enterobacter sakazakii (Cronobacter), Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Before disinfection, bottles were cleaned according to recommended guidelines. Disinfection procedures tested included a hypochlorite-based chemical solution and three heat-based methods. Bottles were sampled in four sites. Before cleaning and disinfection, the inner screw cap and inner-teat were the most heavily contaminated sites with 1.6-7.4 x 10(3) cfu/per-area-sampled; the bottle interior was more contaminated overall with 1.2 x 10(4) cfu/per-area-sampled. After disinfection, adherence to recommended procedures (combined with good hygiene) enabled effective decontamination to be achieved using all methods. Small differences in disinfection ability were not significant (p > 0.05). Cumulatively, 800 sites were sampled and no B. cereus or E. sakazakii were isolated. S. aureus was isolated from 0.1% of sites with one site exceeding 1 cfu/ml. Findings indicate the potential for bottle contamination and that strict adherence to four currently used methods allowed effective decontamination. This highlights the importance of effective consumer education by health care professionals.
TI  - Construction of a recombinant intergenus multidomain chimeric protein for simultaneous expression of haemolysin BL of Bacillus cereus, listeriolysin O of Listeria monocytogenes and enterotoxin B of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Haemolysin BL (HBL) of Bacillus cereus, listeriolysin O (LLO) of Listeria monocytogenes and enterotoxin B (SEB) of Staphylococcus aureus are among the major toxin components contributing to the pathogenicity of these organisms in foodborne illnesses. In this study, an intergenus non-toxic multidomain fusion protein (r-HLE) was generated with specificity for HBL, LLO and SEB. The fusion gene (r-hle) comprising the conserved regions of hblD and the hly and entB genes was codon-optimized for expression in Escherichia coli and encoded a 50 kDa recombinant multidomain chimeric protein (r-HLE). Hyperimmune antiserum raised against r-HLE specifically reacted with the L1 (38 kDa) component of the HBL complex of B. cereus, LLO (58 kDa) of L. monocytogenes and SEB (28 kDa) of S. aureus during Western blot analysis when tested on standard strains. During testing on isolates, the antiserum again identified the appropriate toxin molecules and was highly specific to the relevant bacterial species. The antigenicity of the SEB component of the r-HLE protein was also confirmed using a commercially available TECRA kit. The described procedure of creating a single antigenic molecule carrying components of three different toxins whilst still retaining the original antigenic determinants of individual toxins will be highly advantageous in the development of rapid, reliable and cost-effective immunoassays.
TI  - Engineered SERS substrates with multiscale signal enhancement: nanoparticle cluster arrays.
AB  - Defined nanoparticle cluster arrays (NCAs) with total lateral dimensions of up to 25.4 microm x 25.4 microm have been fabricated on top of a 10 nm thin gold film using template-guided self-assembly. This approach provides precise control of the structural parameters in the arrays, allowing a systematic variation of the average number of nanoparticles in the clusters (n) and the edge-to-edge separation (Lambda) between 1 < n < 20 and 50 nm < or = Lambda < or = 1000 nm, respectively. Investigations of the Rayleigh scattering spectra and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signal intensities as a function of n and Lambda reveal direct near-field coupling between the particles within individual clusters, whose strength increases with the cluster size (n) until it saturates at around n = 4. Our analysis shows that strong near-field interactions between individual clusters significantly affect the SERS signal enhancement for edge-to-edge separations Lambda < 200 nm. The observed dependencies of the Raman signals on n and Lambda indicate that NCAs support a multiscale signal enhancement which originates from simultaneous inter- and intracluster coupling and |E|-field enhancement. The NCAs provide strong and reproducible SERS signals not only from small molecules but also from whole bacterial cells, which enabled a rapid spectral discrimination between three tested bacteria species: Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Microbiological quality of spices marketed in the city of Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - The aim of this work was to assess the microbiological quality of spices sold in  Botucatu, Sao Paulo, Brazil. A total of 233 samples were analyzed for mesophilic bacteria, thermotolerant coliforms, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella. Data showed that 21 and 5.6% of these samples were not in agreement with the standards of Brazilian law, due to an excess of coliforms and to the presence of Salmonella, respectively. Black pepper and cumin exhibited the lowest microbiological quality, whereas bay leaf showed the highest quality. It was concluded that the seasonings possessed poor microbiological quality, and new alternatives should be taken in the primary production in order to improve this quality. Irradiation may also be a tool to assure the safety of these products.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of Dodonaea viscosa using contact bioautography technique.
AB  - The crude ethanolic extract and n-hexane, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, n-butanol and aqueous fractions of Dodonaea viscosa were analyzed for antibacterial potential against four Gram positive bacteria: Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and three Gram negative bacteria: Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Preliminary screening showed inhibition against Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The thin layer chromatograms of the fractions were then subjected to contact bioautography, which showed inhibition zone at different R(f) values against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating the presence of antibacterial components. The MIC of each fraction was determined through a 96-well micro-titer plate method. The non-viability of the organisms was ascertained by determining the MBC of the fractions.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne and pathogenic bacteria by conjugated linoleic acid.
AB  - The influence of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on the growth of some foodborne and pathogenic bacteria was examined. A potassium salt of CLA (CLA-K) was tested against three Gram-positive strains ( Bacillus cereus , Staphylococcus aureus , and Streptococcus mutans ) and five Gram-negative strains ( Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Salmonella typhimurium , Vibrio parahemolyticus , Klebsiella pneumoniae , and Proteus mirabilis ). CLA-K-mediated growth inhibition was evident for all tested strains, particularly the Gram-positive strains. The IC(50) value of CLA-K was 0.3 mM for B. cereus, 1.2 mM for S. aureus, and 0.3 mM for S. mutans, whereas the value was 1.2 mM for K. pneumoniae, 1.2 mM for P. aeruginosa, 1.8 mM for S. typhimurium, 1.8 mM for V. parahemolyticus, and 2.4 mM for P. mirabilis. The CLA-K delayed the growth of all the tested strains at lower CLA-K concentrations, but completely inhibited the growth at higher concentrations. All cells grown in the medium containing CLA-K contained CLA in their membranes and exhibited irregular cell surface and cell disruption, which were greater in Gram-positive than Gram-negative strains. Higher lactic dehydrogenase activity (LDH), protein content, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evident in Gram-positive strains than in Gram-negative strains. These results suggest that the broad spectrum of growth inhibition by CLA mediated through the lipid peroxidation of CLA in the membranes and in the medium.
TI  - Rhodomyrtone: a new candidate as natural antibacterial drug from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa.
AB  - Rhodomyrtone [6,8-dihydroxy-2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-7-(3-methyl-1-oxobutyl)-9-(2-methylpropyl)-4,9 -dihydro-1H-xanthene-1,3(2H)-di-one] from Rhodomyrtus tomentosa (Aiton) Hassk. displayed significant antibacterial activities against gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus salivarius. Especially noteworthy was the activity against MRSA with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) ranging from 0.39 to 0.78 microg/ml. As shown for S. pyogenes, no surviving cells were detected within 5 and 6h after treatment with the compound at 8MBC and 4MBC concentrations, respectively. Rhodomyrtone displays no bacteriolytic activity, as determined by measurement of the optical density at 620 nm. A rhodomyrtone killing test with S. mutans using phase contrast microscopy showed that this compound caused a few morphological changes as the treated cells were slightly changed in color and bigger than the control when they were killed. Taken together, the results support the view that rhodomyrtone has a strong bactericidal activity on gram-positive bacteria, including major pathogens.
TI  - Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin with a broad inhibitory spectrum produced by Lactobacillus plantarum lp 31 strain isolated from dry-fermented sausage.
AB  - AIMS: Characterization and purification of a new bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain, isolated from Argentinian dry-fermented sausage. METHODS AND RESULTS: Lactobacillus plantarum LP 31 strain produces an antimicrobial compound that inhibits the growth of food-borne pathogenic bacteria. It was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, was stable to heat and catalase and exhibited maximum activity in the pH range from 5.0 to 6.0. Consequently, it was characterized as a bacteriocin. It was purified by RP (reverse-phase) solid-phase extraction, gel filtration chromatography and RP-HPLC. Plantaricin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 is a peptide with a molecular weight of 1558.85 Da as determined by Maldi-Tof mass spectrometry and contains 14 amino acid residues. It was shown to have a bactericidal effect against Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriocin produced by Lact. plantarum LP 31 may be considered as a new plantaricin according to its low molecular weight and particular amino acid composition. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In view of the interesting inhibitory spectrum of this bacteriocin and because of its good technological properties (resistance to heat and activity at acidic pH), this bacteriocin has potential applications as a biopreservative to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens and food spoilage bacteria in certain food products.
TI  - Isolation, structure elucidation and antibacterial activities of streptothricin acids.
AB  - Five streptothricin acids (compounds 1-5) were isolated by ion-exchange resin chromatography and preparative RP-HPLC from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis. Their structures were elucidated mainly by analyses of the IR, HR-EIS-MS and NMR spectral data. They were deduced as two known compounds, streptothricin F acid (1) and streptothricin D acid (2), and three new compounds, 12-carbamoylstreptothricin E acid (3), 12-carbamoylstreptothricin D acid (4) and N-acetyl-streptothricin D acid (5), respectively. The antibacterial activities of 1-5 against Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were assayed by micro-broth dilution. Comparison of the MICs with streptothricin F and D showed that the antimicrobial activities of 1-5 were decreased significantly but varied with the structures.
TI  - The diterpenoid ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid acts as an uncoupler of the bacterial respiratory chain.
AB  - ent-16-Kauren-19-oic acid is a bacteriolytic diterpenoid present in the resin of  the medicinal plant Pseudognaphalium vira vira. The compound and its methyl ester showed strong activity against gram-positive bacteria, whereas the derivative 3beta-hydroxy-ent-kauren-19-oic acid was inactive against all assayed bacteria at the maximal concentration used (250 microg/mL). The bacteriolytic effect of ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid (5 microg/mL) was confirmed with cultures of Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, whereas the methyl derivative (12 microg/mL) showed only a bacteriostatic effect. Both compounds stimulated oxygen consumption and proton conduction of whole cells, as reflected by an abrupt increase in the extracellular pH. These results indicate that ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid acts as a respiratory chain uncoupler, and that this function is strongly affected by minor structural substitutions, suggesting a tight activity-structure relationship. The ultimate effect of the uncoupling mechanism demonstrated by ent-16-kauren-19-oic acid is bacterial lysis. The disruption of the bacterial membrane integrity caused by the diterpenoid compound was determined using SYTOX Green stain and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.
TI  - In vitro synergistic antibacterial activities of helvolic acid on multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An agar plate method was established to screen synergistic antibacterial agents other than beta-lactamase inhibitors. By using this method, a strain Aspergillus sp136 was selected for further studies. From the metabolites of this strain, a synergistic antibacterial compound was isolated by bioautographic TLC assay-guided fractionation and identified as helvolic acid. The synergistic effect of helvolic acid to penicillin was about 3 times that of clavulanic acid to penicillin in agar diffusion assay on Bacillus cereus. In checkerboard studies, helvolic acid exhibited synergistic effects with erythromycin on all tested multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus and with penicillin and tetracycline on some multi-drug resistant S. aureus. A pattern of enhanced killing was also found in time-kill studies on multi-drug resistant S. aureus.
TI  - NW-G01, a novel cyclic hexadepsipeptide antibiotic, produced by Streptomyces alboflavus 313: I. Taxonomy, fermentation, isolation, physicochemical properties and antibacterial activities.
AB  - NW-G01, a novel cyclic hexadepsipeptide antibiotic, was isolated by macroporous resin and silica gel column chromatography and HPLC from the fermentation broth of strain no. 313. The producing strain was identified as Streptomyces alboflavus on the basis of the morphological characteristics, physiological property and 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis. NW-G01 exhibited strong antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and their MIC values were 3.90, 3.90, 7.81 and 7.81 microg ml(-1), respectively.
TI  - [Diarrhea from the infectologist's point of view].
AB  - Gastroenteritis is a nonspecific term for various pathologic states of the gastrointestinal tract. Gastroenteritis causing pathogens are the second leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the developed countries diarrhea is the most common reason for missing work, while in the developing world, it is a leading cause of death. Internationally, the mortality rate is 5-10 million deaths each year. "Traveller's diarrhea" is a polyetiologic common health problem of international travellers which affects travellers generally for days, but it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome as well. Infectious agents usually cause acute gastroenteritis either by adherence of the intestinal mucosa, or by mucosal invasion, enterotoxin production, and/or cytotoxin production. The incubation period can often suggest the cause of etiology. When symptoms occur within 6 hours of eating, ingestion of preformed toxin of S. aureus or Bacillus cereus should be suspected. The incidence of hypervirulent C. difficile associated colitis is an emerging problem as a healthcare system associated infection. While infectious agents do not commonly cause chronic diarrhea, those that do include C. difficile, Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium, Aeromonas and Yersinia . Amoebiasis is the second to malaria as a protozoal cause of death. Infection with HIV is also a common cause of diarrhea.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food served in schools in Wales, United Kingdom.
AB  - A survey of the general microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food served in schools was undertaken across Wales, United Kingdom. Of the 2,351 samples taken, four were identified as containing unsatisfactory counts of Escherichia coli, four contained unsatisfactory counts of Staphylococcus aureus, and one contained an unacceptable count of Bacillus cereus when compared with guidelines for the microbiological quality of ready-to-eat food published by the United Kingdom Public Health Laboratory Service in 2000. No samples contained detectable levels of Salmonella, Listeria species, or Clostridium perfringens. When compared with data on the general microbiological quality of food available in Wales, the food sampled from schools was of relatively better microbiological quality.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some macrophytes from Lake Manzalah (Egypt).
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of aqueous and organic solvents (chloroform, ethanol and methanol) extracts of four plants Ceratophyllum demersum L., Eichhornia crassipes, Potamogeton crispus and Potamogeton pectinatus were tested in vitro against seventeen different microorganisms including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and fungi. Nine of these identified organisms were obtained from different sources, Bacillus subtilis 1020, Bacillus cereus 1080, Staphylococcus aureus, Erwinia carotovora NCPPB 312, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum and Penicillium italicum. The other eight organisms were isolated from Manzalah lake water and identified using API 20E strip system (BioMereux). One hundred pathogenic bacterial isolates representing eight genera were identified to species level. These organisms are Escherichia coli (20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Salmonella colerasuis (13%), Shigella sp. (11%), Serratia liquefaciens (10%), Proteus vulgaris (9%) and Brenneria nigrifluens (7%). The extracts of all tested plants demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the used organisms. The efficiency of the extracts varied with, solvent used in the extraction as well as plant species and the part of plant used. The aqueous extract appeared to be the highly effective extract against all tested organisms especially Fusarium oxysporum causing inhibition zone 48 +/- 0.01 mm, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 59 +/- 0.02 mm and Salmonella cholerasuis 55 +/- 0.01 mm when using P. crispus, P. pectinatus and C. demersum, respectively. Ethanol extracts of C. demersum, P. crispus and E. crassipes root showed antimicrobial activities against all tested organisms except Aspergillus niger. At the same time the extract of P. pectinatus had no effect also on Fusarium oxysporum and the extract of E. crassipes leaves have no effect on Penicillium italicum. On using chloroform extracts Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger and Penicillium italicum showed resistance. Comparing the effect of different plants extracts C. demersum appeared to be the most effective followed by P. pectinatus. Furthermore, the extracts of E. crassipes leaves being more effective than that, of its roots. Elemental analysis were also takes place in water and plant samples and the results revealed the presence of Mn and Pb in higher concentration in P. pectinatus (Mn 603 +/- 4.243 ppm and Pb 44 +/- 2.828 ppm), at the same time the highest values of Fe 1680 +/- 2.2 ppm, Zn 31.5 +/- 2.1 ppm and Cu 26.5 +/- 2.1 ppm were recorded for C. demersum. Comparing the two parts of E. crassipes (leaves and roots), the roots have the highest values of all studied metals.
TI  - Isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The aerial parts of Thymus kotschyanus Boiss. and Hohen. (Lamiaceae) and flower buds of Dianthus caryophyllus L. (Caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: Two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. The isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thymol MIC values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and B. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a MIC value of 15.6 microg/ml. Eugenol achieved stronger MIC values against most tested pathogens and the best MIC value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and K. pneumoniae whereas, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and E. coli were inhibited with a MIC value of 31.2 microg/ml. Combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against P. mirabilis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of two antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.
TI  - Spontaneous fermentation of traditional sago starch in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Sago starch is an important dietary carbohydrate in lowland Papua New Guinea (PNG). An investigation was conducted to determine whether microbes play a role in its preservation using traditional methods. In 12 stored sago samples collected from PNG villages, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were present (> or = 3.6 x 10(4)cfu/g) and pH ranged from 6.8 to 4.2. Acetic and propionic acids were detected in all samples, while butyric, lactic and valeric acids were present in six or more. In freshly prepared sago, held in sealed containers in the laboratory at 30 degrees C, spontaneous fermentation by endogenous microflora of sago starch was observed. This was evident by increasing concentrations of acetic, butyric and lactic acids over 4 weeks, and pH reducing from 4.9 to 3.1: both LAB and yeasts were involved. Survival of potential bacterial pathogens was monitored by seeding sago starch with approximately 10(4)/g of selected organisms. Numbers of Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus fell to < 30/g within 7 days. Salmonella sp. was present only in low numbers after 7 days (< 36/g), but Escherichia coli was still detectable after three weeks (> 10(2)/g). Fermentation appeared to increase the storability and safety of the product.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of some thiourea derivatives and their nickel and copper complexes.
AB  - Five thiourea derivative ligands and their Ni(2+) and Cu(2+) complexes have been  synthesized. The compounds were screened for their in vitro anti-bacterial activity using Gram-positive bacteria (two different standard strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Esherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter aerogenes) and in vitro anti-yeast activity (Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis). The minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for all ligands and their complexes. In vitro anti-yeast activity of both ligands and their metal complexes is greater than their in vitro anti-bacterial activity. The effect of the structure of the investigated compounds on the antimicrobial activity is discussed.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts. STUDY OBJECT AND METHODS: Antimicrobial activity of soft and purified propolis extracts was determined with reference cultures of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33499, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Proteus mirabilis ATCC 12459, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Bacillus cereus ATCC 8035, and fungus Candida albicans ATCC 60193. Microbiological tests were performed under aseptic conditions. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)--the highest dilution of preparation (the lowest concentration of preparation) that suppresses growth of reference microorganisms--was determined. RESULTS: Concentration of phenolic compounds in soft propolis extract that possesses antimicrobial activity against gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis) is 0.587+/-0.054 mg and 0.587+/-0.054-0.394+/-0.022 mg (P>0.05) and in purified propolis extract--0.427+/-0.044 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to soft propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.119+/- 0.152 mg and to purified propolis extract when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 1.013+/-0.189 mg (P>0.05). Spore-forming Bacillus subtilis bacteria are more sensitive to soft and purified propolis extracts when the concentration of phenolic compounds is 0.134+/-0.002 mg and 0.075+/-0.025 mg, respectively, and Bacillus cereus--when the concentration is 0.394+/-0.022 mg and 0.256+/-0.02 mg (P>0.05). Sensitivity of fungus Candida albicans to soft and purified propolis extracts is the same as Bacillus subtilis. Encapsulated bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is most resistant to antimicrobial action of soft and purified propolis extracts as compared with gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis bacteria (P<0.05), gram-negative Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis (P<0.05), spore-forming Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus bacteria (P<0.05), and fungus Candida albicans (P<0.05). There is no statistically significant difference between antimicrobial effect of soft propolis extract and purified propolis extract on gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, spore-forming bacteria, encapsulated bacteria, and Candida fungus. CONCLUSIONS: Soft and purified propolis extracts possess antimicrobial activity. They could be recommended as natural preservatives in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.
TI  - Efficiency of KrCl excilamp (222 nm) for inactivation of bacteria in suspension.
AB  - AIMS: To examine the killing efficiency of UV KrCl excilamp against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes at initial populations from 10(2) to 10(7) colony-forming units (CFU) ml(-1) were treated by KrCl excilamp in sterile Ringer's solution with and without H(2)O(2). The number of viable cells was determined using spread plating techniques and nutrient agar method with subsequent incubation at 28 degrees C or 37 degrees C for 24 h. At estimated populations of 10(2)-10(5) CFU ml(-1) E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive and showed 100% disinfection within 15 s (29.2 mJ cm(-2)). Bacillus subtilis was more sensitive to UV treatment than B. cereus. The UV/H(2)O(2) inactivation rate coefficients within this population range were two times higher than those observed for UV treatment alone. No effect of H(2)O(2) was observed at 10(7) CFU ml(-1) for Bacillus sp. and Strep. pyogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The narrow-band UV radiation at 222 nm was effective in the rapid disinfection of bacteria in aqueous suspensions. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: KrCl excilamps represent UV sources which can be applied for disinfection of drinking water in advanced oxidation processes.
TI  - The science of salsa: antimicrobial properties of salsa components to learn scientific methodology.
AB  - Most ethnic foods and cooking practices have incorporated the use of spices and other food additives. Many common spices have crossed cultural boundaries and appear in multiple ethnic cuisines. Recent studies have demonstrated that many of these ingredients possess antimicrobial properties against common food spoilage microorganisms. We developed a laboratory exercise that promotes the use of scientific methodology to evaluate the effectiveness of salsa components at inhibiting the growth of undesirable microorganisms. Tomato, onion, garlic, cilantro, and jalapeno were tested for antimicrobial properties against a representative fungus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the common food spoilage bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Escherichia coli. Each component was ethanol extracted and a modification of the Kirby-Bauer method of antimicrobial sensitivity was employed. Garlic demonstrated the greatest inhibitory effects against all organisms tested. Onion demonstrated a slight inhibition of all four organisms, while cilantro showed some inhibition of all three bacteria but no effect against the fungus. Jalapeno may have slightly inhibited E. coli and S. aureus, as evidenced by a consistently measured increase in the zone of inhibition that was not statistically significant when compared to that of the control. Following the initial exercise, students were given the opportunity to repeat the exercise using other spices such as cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and coriander. Student learning outcomes were evaluated using preliminary and secondary surveys, mainly focusing on definitions of science and hypothesis as well as the process of science. Students enjoyed this exercise and met the learning goals of understanding the process and methodology of science, as well as the interdisciplinarity inherent in the sciences. Student learning was evidenced by an increase in the number of correct responses on the secondary survey in comparison to the preliminary.
TI  - [Effect of phytosubstances with antioxidant activity on persistence properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The in vitro effect of phytosubstances containing flavonoids and phenylpropanoids on the antilysozyme activity of varioous groups of microorganisms, such as staphylococci, bacilli, enterobacteria and nonfermenting bacteria was studied. The second fraction of the pink carbonic acid extract showed high antioxidant activity and most efficiently inhibited the ability of various microorganisms to inactivate the host lysozyme. The selected phytosubstance could be useful in clinical practice as an additional antimicrobial agent in etiotropic therapy or prophylaxis of some infections.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid in ground beef and apple juice.
AB  - The antibacterial effects of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against food spoilage bacteria Salmonella typhimurium DT104, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were examined. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts and protocatechuic acid against these bacteria were in the range of 112-144, 72-96, and 24-44 microg/mL, respectively. Protocatechuic acid content in roselle calyx aqueous and ethanol extracts was 2.8 +/- 0.7 and 11.9 +/- 1.2 mg/g, respectively. Antibacterial activity of roselle calyx ethanol extract and protocatechuic acid was not affected by heat treatments from 25 degrees to 75 degrees C and 25 degrees to 100 degrees C, respectively. After 3 days storage at 25 degrees C, the addition of roselle calyx extracts and protocatechuic acid exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory effects against test bacteria in ground beef and apple juice, in which the roselle calyx ethanol extract showed greater antibacterial effects than the aqueous extract. These data suggest that roselle calyx ethanol extract and protocatechuic acid might be potent agents as food additives to prevent contamination from these bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of anti-Listeria bacteriocins isolated from shellfish: potential antimicrobials to control non-fermented seafood.
AB  - This work had as main objectives to characterize two bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) previously isolated from non-fermented seafood, in order to evaluate their potential as new food protective agents. The two bacteriocinogenic isolates were identified by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) using genus- and species-specific primers, and confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing, as Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus pentosaceus. The antimicrobial spectrum of each strain included several indicator microorganisms, some of them also isolated from seafood. Growth of Listeria innocua, L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and other LAB species were inhibited, although no inhibition of Gram-negative microorganisms was observed. Proteolytic, but not lipolytic or glycolytic enzymes, completely inactivated the antimicrobial effect of both cell-free supernatants confirming the proteinaceous nature of the inhibitors. The antimicrobial activity was maintained after treatment with NaCl, SDS, Triton X-100, Tween 20, Tween 80 and EDTA after 2 h or 5 h of exposure and both bacteriocins were stable over a wide range of pH and temperatures. Production of bacteriocin by E. faecium (bacALP7) was detected initially at exponential phase and reached a maximum activity of 25,600 AU/ml in the early stationary phase, whereas bacteriocin production by P. pentosaceus ALP57 (bacALP57) reached the maximum at exponential phase with 12,800 AU/ml. The bacteriocins did not kill L. monocytogenes ESB54 nor L. innocua 2030c however, cellular growth was reduced. The partially purified bacteriocins, bacALP7 and bacALP57, were below 6.5 kDa in size as determined by Tricine-SDS gel electrophoresis. E. faecium and P. pentosaceus contained DNA fragments corresponding in size to those recorded for enterocin B and pediocin PA-1, respectively. Sequencing of the fragments from both bacteriocins confirmed the homology. To our knowledge, for the first time two LAB producing bacteriocins similar to pediocin PA-1 and enterocin B, were isolated from non-fermented shellfish. The adaptation of the cultures to seafood matrices may be advantageous in terms of application as a biopreservation strategy for reduction of L. monocytogenes levels in seafood products.
TI  - Antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of Kenyan medicinal plants.
AB  - Seven medicinal plant extracts traditionally used in Kenya, mainly for management of infectious conditions, were chosen and screened for their antibacterial activity against Gram-negative (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) bacteria. Antibacterial activity was tested using the broth dilution method. Harrisonia abyssinica and Terminalia kilimandscharica extracts showed significant activity against Gram+ and Gram- bacteria. The methanolic extracts of T. kilimandscharica bark and H. abyssinica bark and leaves showed minimum inhibitory activity against all tested bacteria, with minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 25-150 mg/mL. Ajuga remota and Amaranthus hybridus, which are lethal to brine shrimp nauplii, showed significantly lower antibacterial activity than those that were relatively non-toxic.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Pentanema divaricatum and its active constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of ethanol and chloroform extracts of Pentanema divaricatum Cass. was studied using the conventional disk diffusion method. The extracts' highest antimicrobial activity was observed against Aspergillus niger. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the crude extract by preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC) showed one antimicrobial fraction which was especially effective against Aspergillus niger. By conventional spectroscopy the active fraction was identified as 4alpha,5alpha-epoxy-10alpha,14H-1-epi-inuviscolide. This compound represented the most potent antimicrobial candidate, with MIC values of <25 microg/disk against A. niger strains and 200 microg/disk against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - One-pot synthesis of 5-phenylimino, 5-thieno or 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles and evaluation of their antimicrobial and antitumor activity.
AB  - We here report the synthesis and biological evaluation of rare 4-substituted-5-phenylimino, 5-thieno- and 5-oxo-1,2,3-dithiazoles. Dithiazoles were selectively obtained in moderate to high yields (25-73%) via a one-pot reaction from various ethanoneoximes with sulfur monochloride, pyridine in acetonitrile followed by treatment by corresponding nucleophiles (aniline, thioacetamide and formic acid). All the synthesized compounds were screened for their antibacterial (against bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonellaenterica serovar Typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus and Listeria inocua), antifungal (against pathogenic strains Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Candida tropicalis and Issatchenkia orientalis) and antitumor (on human cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231) activity. 4-(2-Pyridinyl)-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione and 4-ethylcarboxyl-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole-5-thione (5d, 5h) that are active against Gram-positive bacteria are significantly active against fungi. 4-(2-Benzofuranyl)-5-phenylimino-5H-1,2,3-dithiazole (4e) exerts antiproliferative activity.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acalypha indica L.
AB  - Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and methanol extracts from the leaves of Acalypha indica were tested against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity against Gram-positive organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) between 0.156 to 2.5 mg/ml. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, only the Pseudomonas aeruginosa was susceptible to the extracts.
TI  - Bacterial contamination in drinking water: a case study in rural areas of northern Rajasthan, India.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial contaminations in drinking water samples collected form some rural habitations of northern Rajasthan, India. A total of ten bacterial species: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella sp, Proteus vulgaris, Alcaligenes faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus lactis and Micrococcus luteum were identified form drinking water samples. The bacteria belonging to the family enterobacteriaceae (coliforms) showed the maximum occurrences in water samples. The total coliforms count, i.e. TTC(m) (m = MPN index/100 ml) in drinking water samples was in the ranges of 25 TTC(m) (village Naiwala)-41 TTC(m) (village Meharwala). The data suggested that the drinking water quality deterioration in rural habitations of this region was due to poor sanitation and unawareness about personal hygienic practices. The occurrences some pathogenic bacteria in drinking water may increase the risks of water-related diseases and health problems in local residents.
TI  - Structure-activity relationship of antibacterial chalcones.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of 31 chalcones was tested against bacterial strains,  Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Some of the tested chalcones showed fair to significant activity against Gram-positive bacteria. By comparison of the results obtained, the antibacterial activity can be related to features such as the presence of a C-4 hydroxyl group, a C-4' oxygenated substituent or a C-3' isoprenoid side chain, while the C-2' hydroxyl group might have importance for the stability of the molecule. The inhibitory effect of chalcones on human pathogenic microorganisms can be correlated with the substitution patterns of the aromatics rings.
TI  - Crystal structure and enantiomer selection by D-alanyl carrier protein ligase DltA from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Ubiquitous D-alanylation of lipoteichoic acids modulates the surface charge and ligand binding of the gram-positive cell wall. Disruption of the bacterial DltABCD gene involved in teichoic acid alanylation, as well as inhibition of the DltA protein, has been shown to increase a gram-positive bacterium's susceptibility to antibiotics. The DltA D-alanyl carrier protein ligase promotes a two-step process starting with adenylation of D-alanine. We have determined the 2.0 A resolution crystal structure of a DltA protein from Bacillus cereus in complex with the D-alanine adenylate intermediate of the first reaction. Despite the low level of sequence similarity, the DltA structure resembles known structures of adenylation domains such as the acetyl-CoA synthetase. The enantiomer selection appears to be enhanced by the medium-sized side chain of Cys-269. The Ala-269 mutant protein shows marked loss of such selection. The network of noncovalent interactions between the D-alanine adenylate and DltA provides structure-based rationale for aiding the design of tight-binding DltA inhibitors for combating infectious gram-positive bacteria such as the notorious methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of xanthorrhizol isolated from Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb.  against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Xanthorrhizol, isolated from the ethanol extract of Curcuma xanthorrhiza Roxb., is a sesquiterpene compound with a molecular weight of 218. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of xanthorrhizol against foodborne pathogens. The antibacterial activity of xanthorrhizol was measured in terms of the MIC and the MBC. MICs and MBCs of xanthorrhizol against Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus were 8, 16, 8, 8, 16, 8 microg/ml and 16, 32, 16, 16, 16, 16 microg/ml, respectively. The bactericidal study, as determined by the viable cell count method, revealed that xanthorrhizol treatment at 4 x MIC reduced viable cells by at least 6 to 8 log for all six foodborne pathogens in 4 h. Xanthorrhizol maintained its antibacterial activity after thermal treatments (121 degrees C, 15 min) under various pH ranges (pH 3.0, 7.0, and 11.0). These results strongly suggest that xanthorrhizol, conferring strong antibacterial activity with thermal and pH stability, can be effectively used as a natural preservative to prevent the growth of foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Efficacy of plant essential oils against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria associated with ready-to-eat vegetables: antimicrobial and sensory screening.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils (EOs) against foodborne pathogens and key spoilage bacteria pertinent to ready-to-eat vegetables and to screen the selected EOs for sensory acceptability. The EOs basil, caraway, fennel, lemon balm, marjoram, nutmeg, oregano, parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme were evaluated. The bacteria evaluated were Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, Enterobacter spp., Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas spp. Quantitative antimicrobial analyses were performed using an absorbance-based microplate assay. Efficacy was compared using MIC, the half maximum inhibitory concentration, and the increase in lag phase. Generally, gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to EOs than were gram-negative bacteria, and Listeria monocytogenes strains were among the most sensitive. Of the spoilage organisms, Pseudomonas spp. were the most resistant. Oregano and thyme EOs had the highest activity against all the tested bacteria. Marjoram and basil EOs had selectively high activity against B. cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. coli, and Salmonella, and lemon balm and sage EOs had adequate activity against L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. Within bacterial species, EO efficacy was dependent on strain and in some cases the origin of the strain. On a carrot model product, basil, lemon balm, marjoram, oregano, and thyme EOs were deemed organoleptically acceptable, but only oregano and marjoram EOs were deemed acceptable for lettuce. Selected EOs may be useful as natural and safe additives for promoting the safety and quality of ready-to-eat vegetables.
TI  - Antimicrobial effects of Turkish propolis, pollen, and laurel on spoilage and pathogenic food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of propolis extract, pollen extract, and essential oil of laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) at concentrations from 0.02% to 2.5% (vol/vol) were investigated on bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida rugosa), and molds (Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus oryzae). Pollen has no antimicrobial effects on the bacteria and fungi tested in the concentrations used. Propolis showed a bactericidal effect at 0.02% on B. cereus and B. subtilis, at 1.0% on S. aureus and E. faecalis, and at 0.2% on L. monocytogenes. The minimum inhibitory concentration of propolis for fungi was 2.5%. Propolis and laurel were ineffective against E. coli and S. typhimurium at the concentrations tested. The results showed that the antimicrobial activity were concentration dependent. Propolis and essential oil of laurel may be used as biopreservative agents in food processing and preservation.
TI  - Wound healing, anti-microbial and antioxidant potential of Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh.
AB  - Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f) Ettingsh (Loranthaceae) of the order Santalales, is used ethnomedicinally for treating ulcers, asthma, impotence, paralysis, skin diseases, and wounds. In this context, validations of the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in wound healing activity was studied, besides anti-microbial activity and antioxidant activity were performed to understand the mechanism of wound healing potency. The ethanolic extract of aerial parts of Dendrophthoe falcata ethanolic extract (DFEE) was investigated for the evaluation of its healing efficiency on excision and incision wound models in rats. The results showed that Dendrophthoe falcata extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. Hydroxyproline and hexosamine expressions were also well correlative with the healing pattern observed. Three of the fractions A-C (petroleum ether, chloroform and ethanol, respectively) obtained from the extract exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against the organisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Serratia marcescens, and five fungi Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis: dimorphic fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger: systemic fungi, and some infectious bacteria Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhi. The results also indicated that DFEE possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase levels and increased the catalase activity.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of Datura innoxia (thorn-apple) for potential antibacterial activity.
AB  - Various parts of Datura innoxia were examined for potential antibacterial activity by preparing their crude aqueous and organic extracts against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi) and Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus). The results of agar well diffusion assay indicated that the pattern of inhibition depends largely upon the plant part, solvent used for extraction and the organism tested. Extracts prepared from leaves were shown to have better efficacy than stem and root extracts. Organic extracts provided potent antibacterial activity as compared to aqueous extracts. Among all the extracts, methanolic extract was found most active against almost all the bacterial species tested. Gram-positive bacteria were found most sensitive as compared to Gram-negative bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus was signifi cantly inhibited by almost all the extracts even at very low MIC followed by other Gram-positives. For Escherichia coli (a Gram-negative bacterium), the end point was not reached for ethyl acetate extract while it was very high for other extracts. The study promises an interesting future for designing a potentially active antibacterial agent from Datura innoxia.
TI  - Effects of pulsed electric fields on pathogenic microorganisms of major concern in fluid foods: a review.
AB  - Pathogenic microorganisms such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni have been implicated in foodborne diseases and outbreaks worldwide. These bacteria have been associated with the consumption of fresh fruit juices, milk, and dairy products, which are foodstuff, highly demanded by consumers in retails and supermarkets. Nowadays, consumers require high quality, fresh-like, and safe foods. Pulsed electric field (PEF) is a non-thermal preservation method, able to inactivate pathogenic microorganisms without significant loss of the organoleptic and nutritional properties of food. The PEF treatment effectiveness to destroy bacteria such as Listeria innocua, E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli 8739 at pasteurization levels (> or = 5.0 log(10) cycles) in some fluid foods was reported. However, data on the inactivation of some microorganisms such as Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni in fluid foods by PEF processing is very limited. Therefore, future works should be focused toward the inactivation of these pathogenic bacteria in real foods.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against foodborne bacterial strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of aqueous, methanol, hexane, and ethyl acetate extracts from edible wild and cultivated mushrooms against nine foodborne pathogenic bacterial strains (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Enteritidis, Shigella sonnei, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) was screened with a disk diffusion assay. Twenty-nine of the 48 species tested had antimicrobial activity. Methanol, ethyl acetate, and aqueous extracts accounted for 92.8% of the positive assays, whereas the hexane extracts accounted for only 7.2%. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive than gram-negative bacteria to fungal extracts, and C. perfringens was the most sensitive microorganism. Aqueous extracts from Clitocybe geotropa and Lentinula edodes had the highest antimicrobial activity against all the bacterial strains tested.
TI  - [The regulation of sigmaB activity and its role in some gram-positive food-borne  pathogens--a review].
AB  - The alternative sigma factor sigmaB modulates the stress response of several Gram-positive bacteria. Not only does sigmaB play a prominent role in sporulation in the Gram-positive model organism Bacillus subtilis, but it also contributes both directly and indirectly to bacterial virulence in the food-borne human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. As sigmaB has been shown to regulate expression of both virulence and virulence-associated genes, it indicates that sigmaB is a key player in pathogen ecophysiology.
TI  - Antibacterial iridoid glucosides from Eremostachys laciniata.
AB  - Eremostachys laciniata (L) Bunge (family: Lamiaceae alt. Labiatae; subfamily: Lamioideae) is one of the 15 endemic Iranian herbs of the genus Eremostachys. A decoction of the roots and flowers of E. laciniata has traditionally been taken orally for the treatment of allergies, headache and liver diseases. Three antibacterial iridoid glucosides, phloyoside I (1), phlomiol (2) and pulchelloside I (3) have been isolated from the rhizomes of this plant. The structures of these compounds were elucidated unequivocally by a series of 1D and 2D NMR analyses. The antibacterial activity and brine shrimp toxicity of these compounds were assessed using the resazurin microtitre assay and the brine shrimp lethality assay, respectively. All three iridoid glycosides 1-3 exhibited from low to moderate levels (MIC = 0.05-0.50 mg/mL) of antibacterial activity. Of these compounds, compound 3 was the most active, and displayed antibacterial activity against 9 of 12 different strains tested. The most noteworthy activity of 3 was against Bacillus cereus, penicillin-resistant Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Staphylococcus aureus with an MIC value of 0.05 mg/mL.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activities of the essential oil from the seeds of Enterolobium contortisiliquum (leguminosae).
AB  - Seeds of Enterolobium contortisiliquum were subjected to steam distillation to obtain a light yellow essential oil in a yield of 3 ml/kg of seeds. The major components of the oil were identified using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and were furfural, limonene, linalool, estragole, carvone, and apiole with carvone representing more than 50% of the total composition. Antimicrobial activities of the essential oil were determined against four species of gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus) and two gram negative bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia Marcescencs). The essential oil inhibited the growth of all tested bacteria but was most effective against the gram positive bacteria. Chemicals that are responsible for the antibacterial effect of the essential oil were determined using the bio-autography thin layer chromatography (TLC) technique. The active compounds responsible for the activity were found to be carvone and estragole.
TI  - Mitracarpus frigidus aerial parts exhibited potent antimicrobial, antileishmanial, and antioxidant effects.
AB  - The crude extract and the hexane, CH(2)Cl(2), EtOAc, n-BuOH, and hydromethanolic  fractions of the aerial parts of Mitracarpus frigidus were evaluated against promastigote forms of two species of Leishmania (L. chagasi and L. amazonensis), 11 strains of bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica sorovar Tythimurium, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacillus cereus) and two yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). The antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging activity and reducing power), cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, and the contents of phenolics and flavonoids were determined. Phytochemical analysis of the major groups of phytoconstituents is also reported. All samples showed antioxidant activity which was positively correlated to the content of phenolic compounds. S. sonnei, B. cereus and C. neoformans were susceptible to all extracts tested, except for the n-BuOH and hydromethanolic fractions, which demonstrated no antimicrobial activity. The lowest MIC was recorded for the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction against C. neoformans (MIC of 10 microg/ml), followed by B. cereus, S. sonnei, and E. cloacae (MIC of 20, 39 and 39 microg/ml, respectively). The CH(2)Cl(2) fraction was the most effective against L. chagasi (IC(50) of 6.7 microg/ml), and the hydromethanolic fraction exhibited the best activity against L. amazonensis (IC(50) of 9 microg/ml). A cytotoxic effect on mammalian cells was observed only for the crude extract and CH(2)Cl(2) fraction at the concentrations of 130 and 31 microg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that M. frigidus has interesting antimicrobial, antileishmanial and antioxidant activities.
TI  - The in vitro pharmacological activities of 12 South African Hermannia species.
AB  - Hermannia species are widely used in traditional medicine in southern Africa, however no extensive study has been conducted on this genus. The acetone extracts of 12 indigenous Hermannia species (flowers, stems and leaves combined) were evaluated for various pharmacological activities. All investigated species displayed promising antimicrobial activity, with Hermannia saccifera being the most active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=19.5 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC=19.5 microg/ml) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC=125 microg/ml). Time-kill studies on H. saccifera against S. aureus indicated bacteriostatic activity at 1.25, 2.5 and 5.0%, and a concentration of 7.5% achieved complete bactericidal activity after 4h. Ten of the 12 species indicated good free radical scavenging activity, with H. cuneifolia demonstrating the most promising activity in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH():IC(50)=10.26 microg/ml) and 2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethyl-benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(+)/TEAC: IC(50)=10.32 microg/ml) assays. In addition, all species exhibited moderate anti-inflammatory activity in the 5-lipoxygenase assay with the exception of H. cuneifolia (IC(50)=15.32 microg/ml). Overall, the selected species were low in cytotoxicity, except for H. saccifera and H. trifurca. Several Hermannia species indicated promising in vitro biological activity which relate to their traditional use in treating a number of disease states.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a Congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  - Thirty one bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the Congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. Using species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as L. plantarum and L. fermentum, respectively. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed two main groups (G1 and G2) plus the L. fermentum isolate C4-13. Group G1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (G1-1, G1-2) each with several branches, plus the L. plantarum isolate C11. Group G2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. Using PCR amplification with specific primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in L. plantarum C11 were identified in the isolates. The number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. The L. fermentum isolate EC11 also contained the plnDEFG genes. PCR amplification of DNA from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with DNA from the control strain L. plantarum WCFS1. Amplification products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with HindIII, EcoRI and KpnI in separate reactions. Cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for EcoRI and HindII digest profiles, and an identical profile for all KpnI digests. The L. fermentum EC11 isolate clustered with L. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. The results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. However, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. Because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Enterobacter aerogenes, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial studies of novel 1-benzhydryl-piperazine sulfonamide  and carboxamide derivatives.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-benzhydryl-piperazine sulfonamide 8(a-f) and benzamides 9(a-h) were synthesized and their antimicrobial activities evaluated in vitro by paper disc diffusion and micro dilution method against standard strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Staphylococcus epidermis 25212, Bacillus cereus 11778, Bacillus substilis 6051) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 2853 and Salmonella typhi ATCC 9484) bacteria. Among the synthesized new compounds 8d, 8e, 9c, 9e, 9f and 9 h showed potent antimicrobial activities compared to the standard drug streptomycin.
TI  - Enteric bacteria isolated from acute diarrheal patients in the Republic of Korea  between the year 2004 and 2006.
AB  - In an epidemiological survey of human enterobacterial infections in the Republic  of Korea during three years from 2004 to 2006, we isolated 1,784 (6.2%, isolation rate of enteropathogens from stool samples) in 2004, 2,547 (9.5%) in 2005 and 3,506 bacteria (12.3%) from people who visited clinics. Among the isolated bacteria, pathogenic Escherichia coli, especially, EAEC was the most frequently identified pathogen in both urban and rural regions followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella species, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, and Shigella species. Distinct seasonality was found in V. parahaemolyticus species, while this pathogen showed no age-specific patterns. However, other bacteria, i.e., pathogenic E. coli, S. aureus, Salmonella spp., and B. cereus showed similar seasonality throughout the year, showing a slight increase in the infection rate during the summer months and high prevalence among children under 10 years of age and elder-age people. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus showed high resistance to penicillins. However, both pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella spp. were susceptible to several cephems, imipenem, and amikacin. Moreover, S. aureus strains resistant to vancomycin were not found. In conclusion, these surveillances can play an important role for the control and prevention to the diseases originated by enteritis bacteria.
TI  - Synthesis and anti-microbial screening of some Schiff bases of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones.
AB  - In the present study, a series of novel Schiff bases were synthesized by condensation of 3-amino-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-ones with different aromatic aldehydes via cyclized intermediate 6,8-dibromo-2-phenyl benzoxazin-4-one. The chemical structures were confirmed by means of IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, Mass spectral and Elemental analysis. These compounds were screened for anti-bacterial (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC-9144, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC-155, Micrococcus luteus ATCC-4698, Bacillus cereus ATCC-11778, Escherichia coli ATCC-25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-2853, and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-11298) and anti-fungal (Aspergillus niger ATCC-9029 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC-46645) activities by paper disc diffusion technique. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. Among the synthesized compounds 3-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzylideneamino)-6,8-dibromo-2-phenylquinazolin-4(3H)-one 10 was found to be the most potent anti-microbial activity with MICs of 18.9, 19.1, 18.8, 21.7, 18.2, 19.3, 16.7, 8.6 and 10.1 microg/ml against above mentioned respective strains. Compounds were found to exhibit more anti-fungal than anti-bacterial activity.
TI  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  - Risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an Excel-based software program, Risk Ranger. It is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. Therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. Risk scores provided by the tool were characterized as low, medium and high. Also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. Low risk scores were obtained for Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) for low risk population. High risk scores were obtained for hepatitis E virus (HEV) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). Moderate risk scores for Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). Scores for Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for S. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. Campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas Y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. High risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes (high risk population), EHEC (high risk population) or S. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by L. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with Campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and HEV (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). Salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. Preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. Only Salmonella spp., L. monocytogenes and E. coli EHEC gave moderate risk ratings in case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. These results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a Food Safety Management System.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and chemical composition of the essential oil of  Foeniculum vulgare Mill.
AB  - In our study, four samples of volatile oil from Foeniculum vulgare, cultivated in different pedoclimatic conditions, were investigated for their antimicrobial activity and chemical composition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Organisms. Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Candida albicans were included in the report. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests. The comparative inhibitory activity of volatile oil samples with other antimicrobial agents was quantitative determined by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Oil samples are the volatile oils extracted by steam distillation, from two ecological vegetative populations of Foeniculum vulgare. Gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to determine the chemical composition of the essential oils. RESULTS: All oil samples have a good activity against E. coli and S. aureus at low concentrations. Against B. cereus and P. aeruginosa these oil samples are less active. The oil samples were generally bactericidal at a concentration up to twofold or fourfold higher than the MIC value. Significantly synergic activity with amoxicillin or tetracycline showed all fennel samples against E. coli, Sarcina lutea and B. subtilis strains. Fennel oil samples have shown high activity against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: No significant antimicrobial activity variations were observed for Foeniculum vulgare volatile oil samples obtained after two or three years cultivation period. The most important identified compounds in all samples of fennel volatile oils were trans-anethole, estragole, fenchone, limonene, alpha-pinene and gamma-terpinene.
TI  - Screening of some Tanzanian medicinal plants from Bunda district for antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral activities.
AB  - Extracts from 50 plant parts obtained from 39 different plants belonging to 22 families used to treat infectious diseases in Bunda district, Tanzania, were screened against twelve microorganisms, including the bacteria Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Salmonella typhimurium, the fungi Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, and the viruses Herpes Simplex Virus type 1, Vesicular Stomatitis Virus T2, Coxsackie B2 and Semliki Forest A7. The highest activity was obtained for the n-hexane extract of Elaeodendron schlechteranum root bark against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus (MIC 0.97 microg/ml and MBC 1.95 microg/ml) and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 3.90 microg/ml and MBC 31.25 microg/ml). Gram-negative bacteria were less sensitive. Only Balanites aegyptiaca stem bark exhibited a high antifungal activity against Candida albicans (MIC 125 microg/ml and MFC 250 microg/ml). Extracts from four plants; Lannea schweinfurthii, Combretum adenogonium, Ficus sycomorus and Terminalia mollis showed strong antiviral activity with RF values of 10(3) and 10(4) against Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 at various concentrations. Our results support, at least in part, the use of most plants as claimed by traditional healers/informants especially against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of labdane diterpenoids from Stemodia foliosa.
AB  - As part of a continuing interest in exploring the chemistry of Brazilian medicinal plants, three new labdane diterpenoids, 6alpha-acetoxymanoyl oxide (1), 6alpha-malonyloxymanoyl oxide (2), and 6alpha-malonyloxy-n-butyl ester manoyl oxide (3), together with the known betulinic acid, lupeol, sitosterol, and stigmasterol, were isolated from the aerial parts of Stemodia foliosa. The structures of 1-3 were established on the basis of interpretation of spectroscopic data, including HRESIMS, and 1D and 2D NMR techniques. All compounds were tested against a bacteria panel consisting of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, B. anthracis, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and M. phlei. Compound 2 showed moderate activity against these strains, with MIC values in the range 7-20 microg/mL.
TI  - Challenge testing the lactoperoxidase system against a range of bacteria using different activation agents.
AB  - Lactoperoxidase (LP) exerts antimicrobial effects in combination with H(2)O(2) and either thiocyanate (SCN(-)) or a halide (e.g., I(-)). Garlic extract in the presence of ethanol has also been used to activate the LP system. This study aimed to determine the effects of 3 LP activation systems (LP+SCN(-)+H(2)O(2); LP+I(-)+H(2)O(2); LP + garlic extract + ethanol) on the growth and activity of 3 test organisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus). Sterilized milk was used as the reaction medium, and the growth pattern of the organisms and a range of keeping quality (KQ) indicators (pH, titratable acidity, ethanol stability, clot on boiling) were monitored during storage at the respective optimum growth temperature for each organism. The LP+I(-)+ H(2)O(2) system reduced bacterial counts below the detection limit shortly after treatment for all 3 organisms, and no bacteria could be detected for the duration of the experiment (35 to 55 h). The KQ data confirmed that the milk remained unspoiled at the end of the experiments. The LP + garlic extract + ethanol system, on the other hand, had no effect on the growth or KQ with P. aeruginosa, but showed a small retardation of growth of the other 2 organisms, accompanied by small increases (5 to 10 h) in KQ. The effects of the LP+SCN(-)+H(2)O(2) system were intermediate between those of the other 2 systems and differed between organisms. With P. aeruginosa, the system exerted total inhibition within 10 h of incubation, but the bacteria regained viability after a further 5 h, following a logarithmic growth curve. This was reflected in the KQ indicators, which implied an extension of 15 h. With the other 2 bacterial species, LP+SCN(-)+H(2)O(2) exerted an obvious inhibitory effect, giving a lag phase in the growth curve of 5 to 10 h and KQ extension of 10 to 15 h. When used in combination, I(-) and SCN(-) displayed negative synergy.
TI  - Evaluation and control of the risk of foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria present in Awa-Uirou, a sticky rice cake containing sweet red bean paste.
AB  - The risk of food poisoning and growth of spoilage bacteria in Awa-Uirou, a sticky rice cake containing sweet red bean paste, was evaluated. Toxin-producing bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus are the main causes of food poisoning linked to this kind of food. The water activity in this product is in the range suitable for growth of S. aureus, B. cereus, and B. subtilis. The viable count of S. aureus or B. cereus spore cocktail was significantly reduced to 2.3 log colony-forming units (CFU)/g after 70 minutes steaming treatment at 100 degrees C. However, the heat-resistant endospores of B. subtilis germinated during storage at 30 degrees C to cause appreciable syneresis of the starch gel matrix in 4 days. The addition of 0.5% glycine before steaming treatment was found to effectively suppress the growth of B. cereus but was not effective in controlling S. aureus throughout the 7 days incubation period at 30 degrees C. On the other hand, S. aureus and B. cereus could grow > 5.0 log CFU/g in an inoculated sample without glycine within 3 days when stored at 30 degrees C. Moreover, addition of 0.5% glycine before the steaming process did not have any significant effect on color, texture, or taste of sticky rice cake. Therefore, results of this study demonstrated that the addition of 0.5% glycine before the steaming process could inhibit B. cereus and B. subtilis multiplication in the steamed rice confection which in turn may help reduce the risk of food poisoning or quality loss.
TI  - Antimicrobial protein from Streptomyces fulvissimus inhibitory to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Fermented culture of Streptomyces fulvissimus was found to secrete an antibacterial protein inhibitory to Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains. The extracellular protein from the fermented culture on concentration revealed a high molecular weight peptide of 63kDa on SDS-PAGE gel and the region on gel displayed inhibitory activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Bioactivity of the extra cellular protein was non-sensitive to proteinase K, alpha chymotrypsin, protease, EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid), PMSF (phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride) and DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) but partially susceptible to amylase and heat. Glycoprotein nature of the proteinaceous compound was confirmed by periodic acid schiffs (PAS) staining. The secretary protein of S. fulvissimus demonstrated a significant activity against MRSA strain. It could be an important source for developing new drugs to control multidrug resistant gram positive bacteria.
TI  - Method for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial preservatives in cosmetic  wet wipes.
AB  - Many cosmetic formulations are now available in the form of wet wipes packaged in sealed sachets or packets. Like the majority of cosmetic products having an aqueous phase, wipes are susceptible to microbial contamination and require the addition of preservatives. The efficacy of such preservatives can be evaluated using a standard challenge test performed on the wetting liquid but this test cannot be regarded as representative for this new type of formulation. The method presented here evaluates the efficacy of preservatives used in wet wipes kept in their original packaging. Dried inoculums were prepared by membrane filtration followed by drying in an incubator. The method is applicable to bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis), Bacillus cereus spores and fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger). These inoculated carriers were inserted between two wipes in the original package, which was then re-sealed immediately. The test requires one dry inoculum per packet and one packet for each control or test. After incubation at 22.5 degrees C for 1, 2, 7, 14 or 28 days and, for the control, immediately after insertion of the membrane (time 0), microorganism counts were performed on the germ-carrier membranes as well as on adjacent wipes, after transfer into a suitable neutralizing agent. The membranes were shaken in the presence of glass beads and microorganisms were dissociated from the wipes by means of a Stomacher. The supernatants recovered after being left to stand for 20 min are counted by pour plate method or membrane filtration. The feasibility of the method was demonstrated for each of the seven above-mentioned strains. The repeatability and reproducibility of the results obtained is similar to that obtained for preservative efficacy tests in the Pharmacopoeias. The lethal rate of microorganisms during the preparation of dry inoculums ranges from 50 to 90% depending on the strain and the test (generally, a spontaneous reduction of about 1 log up to a maximum of 2 log). The recovery rate for microorganisms from dry inoculums (on membranes) at time 0 (control = T(0)) is around 90%, regardless of the strain or the test. The number of microorganisms recovered from the wipes (W(0)) is between 2 and 10% of the number recovered from membranes (T(0)) and may be considered negligible. Application of this method to different types of wipes demonstrates that the efficacy of preservatives, expressed as the logarithmic reduction in the number of microorganisms at each time point, depends on the type of wipe and on the strain tested. The results obtained are considerably different from those found with the standard challenge tests applied to wetting liquids for wipes. The differences found confirm the need for a specific method applicable to wipes.
TI  - Structure-Activity Relationships for Some Diamine, Triamine and Schiff Base Derivatives and Their Copper(II) Complexes.
AB  - Ethylenediamine (en), putrescine (pu), diethylenetriamine (dien), dipropylenetriamine (dpta), spermidine (spmd) and their Cu(II) compounds as well as the Schiff bases with 2-furaldehyde (dienOO), 2- thiophenecarboxaldehyde (dienSS) and pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (dienNN) of dien and that of dpta with 2- thiophenecarboxaldehyde (dptaSS), were prepared and characterised. They were tested against Bacillus substilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris and Xanthomonas campestris as antibacterial reagents, the highest activity being exhibited by Cu(dptaSS)(NO(3))(2) complex, which acts as antibiotic. In the antiproliferative tests (vs. T(47)D,L(929) and BHK(21/c13) cell lines) the best results were obtained with Cu(dptaSS)(2+) and Cu(dienSS)(2+). Electronic structure calculations gave for dptaSS and dienSS the higher negative charges on the N atoms. The counter-ions (Br(-), NO(3) (-) and SO(4) (2-)) play an important role by modulating the reagent's selectivity versus the bacteria [Gram(+) or Gram(-)], but they have no effect on the antiproliferative activity.
TI  - Absolute configuration and antimicrobial activity of acylhomoserine lactones.
AB  - (S)-N-Heptanoylhomoserine lactone is an uncommon acyl odd-chain natural product employed by many Gram-negative bacteria as a signaling substance in chemical communication mechanisms known as quorum sensing. The absolute configuration determination of the metabolite produced by the phytopathogen Pantoea ananatis Serrano is reported herein. As with all other substances of this class, the lactone moiety possesses S configuration, corroborating the hypothesis that it shares the same biosynthetic pathway as the (S)-N-hexanoylhomoserine lactone and also that some LuxI homologues can accept both hexanoyl- and heptanoyl-ACP as precursors. Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of enantiomeric acylhomoserine lactones against three Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus) revealed important features between absolute configuration and antimicrobial activity. The N-heptanoylhomoserine lactone was considerably less active than the 3-oxo derivatives. Surprisingly, non-natural (R)-N-(3-oxo-octanoyl)homoserine lactone was as active as the S enantiomer against B. cereus, while the synthetic racemic product was less active than either enantiomer.
TI  - A structure-activity study of antibacterial diterpenoids.
AB  - An analysis of the antibacterial activities of 15 terpenoids, eleven of which were previously described by us and four were extracted from the literature, suggested two structural requirements for activity of these and related compounds: a hydrophobic moiety,consisting of a substituted decalin skeleton, and a hydrophilic region possessing one hydrogen-bond-donor group. These structural requirements are responsible for an optimal insertion of these and related compounds into cell membranes, as suggested by the results of docking some of these compounds into a model phospholipid bilayer.
TI  - Oleanane-type triterpenes from the flowers and roots of Saussurea muliensis.
AB  - Six new oleanane-type triterpenes (1- 6), along with five known compounds, were isolated from the flowers and roots of Saussurea muliensis. On the basis of spectroscopic methods, with special emphasis on 1D and 2D NMR techniques, the structures of the new compounds were characterized as 3beta,22alpha-dihydroxyolean-12-en-30-oic acid (1), 3alpha-(E)-caffeoyloxyolean-12-en-30-oic acid (2), 3alpha-(E)-coumaroyloxyolean-12-en-30-oic acid (3), 3alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-20beta,21alpha,29-trihydroxy-30-norolean-12-ene (4), 3alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-21alpha,29-dihydroxy-20beta-methoxy-30-norolean-12-ene (5), and 3alpha,22alpha-diacetoxy-20beta,21alpha-dihydroxy-29-palmityloxy-30-norolean-12-e ne (6). The isolated compounds (1- 6) were not active against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans.
TI  - Two new antibacterial norabietane diterpenoids from cyanobacteria, Microcoleous lacustris.
AB  - Two abietane diterpenes were isolated from cyanobacteria Microcoleous lacustris,  20-nor-3alpha-acetoxyabieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene and 20-nor-3alpha-acetoxy-12-hydroxy-abieta-5,7,9,11,13-pentaene. These compounds were assayed against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Salmonella typhi, Vibrio cholerae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Both compounds showed activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. typhi, and V. cholerae, but not against the other bacteria.
TI  - Interactions of some common pathogenic bacteria with Acanthamoeba polyphaga.
AB  - Protozoan grazing is a major trophic pathway whereby the biomass re-enters the food web. Nonetheless, not all bacteria are digested by protozoa and the number known to evade digestion, resulting in their environmental augmentation, is increasing. We investigated the interactions of Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC), Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with the amoeba, Acanthamoeba polyphaga. There was evidence of predation of all bacterial species except L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, where extracellular numbers were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae compared with growth in the absence of amoebae. Intracellular growth kinetic experiments and fluorescent confocal microscopy suggest that S. aureus survived and may even multiply within A. polyphaga, whereas there was no apparent intra-amoebal replication of L. monocytogenes and higher numbers were likely sustained on metabolic waste products released during coculture.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of stuffed mussels.
AB  - Stuffed mussel is a traditional food, sold by street vendors in coastal parts of  Turkey and other Mediterranean countries. In the present study, the microbiological quality of not only the stuffing mixture, but also the outer surface of the stuffed mussels was evaluated for 1 year, and the effect of the ambient temperatures on the prevalence and the count levels of the microorganisms were evaluated. Fifty samples (750 stuffed mussels in total) were collected periodically, and microbiological analyses were performed by standard procedures for aerobic plate count, coliforms, fecal coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Vibrio spp. Aerobic plate counts above 5 log CFU/g were obtained in 16 and 72% of stuffing mixture samples at high and low ambient temperatures, respectively, and average aerobic plate counts of outer surface samples at high and low ambient temperatures were 3.21 and 4.34 log CFU/ml, respectively. The prevalence and the count levels of coliforms, fecal coliforms, Enterobacteriaceae, and Vibrio spp. (except for the prevalence of Vibrio spp. in stuffing mixture samples) in the samples at high ambient temperatures were considerably higher compared with those at low ambient temperatures (P < 0.05). High frequencies of pathogens S. aureus and B. cereus were found in stuffing mixture samples at high ambient temperatures, with averages of 2.84 and 2.94 log CFU/g, respectively (P < 0.05). The result of this investigation indicates that stuffed mussels as a street food may constitute a potential health hazard, especially at high ambient temperatures, depending on contamination level and lack of sanitary practices, and therefore, handling practices should require more attention and improvement.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Miconia species (Melastomataceae).
AB  - This work evaluated the antimicrobial activity of the methanol and chloroform extracts of the leaves of Miconia cabucu, Miconia rubiginosa, and Miconia stenostachya using the disc-diffusion method. The results obtained showed that the methanol extracts of the leaves of M. rubiginosa and M. stenostachya and the chloroform extract of the leaves of M. cabucu presented antimicrobial activity against the tested microorganisms.
TI  - Iron(III) complexes: preparation, characterization, antibacterial activity and DNA-binding.
AB  - Iron(III) have been combined to well known quinolones (ciprofloxacin) and some Schiff bases with the help of coordination approach. Characterization of these compounds have been done using elemental analysis, magnetic measurements, thermogravimetric analysis, IR, UV-VIS, (1)H NMR and (13)C NMR spectral investigation. Analytical studies suggest that the iron(III)-quinolone complexes assume a six-coordinated dimeric distorted octahedral geometry. All the compounds show a good antibacterial activity against broad range of bacteria like Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi and Serratia marcescens, whereas no significant inhibition towards growth of fungal strains like Aspergillus Niger, Aspergillus flavus and Lasiodiplodia theobromae. Analyses of all these compounds show effective sperm herring DNA inhibition.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and biological aspects of novel five-coordinated dimeric-Cu(II) systems.
AB  - The structural and spectroscopic properties of novel five-coordinated dimeric-Cu(II) system have been investigated. The biocidal activities of all eight compounds, ligands, cupric nitrate and standard drugs against six bacteria and three fungi were determined. The DNA interaction activity of complexes was studied using spectrophotometry and electrophoresis. The superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of the complexes was compared with previously reported monomeric- and dimeric copper complexes. The results support the five-coordinated dimeric square pyramidal geometry for the quinolone-Cu(II) system.
TI  - The effect of silver ions and chlorine on the survival of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus in dishwater.
AB  - This paper investigates the effect of chlorine and silver ion solutions on the survival of Bacillus cereus (vegetative phase) and Staphylococcus aureus in batch cultures, representing dishwater. Dishwater contains organic matter and bacteria and bacterial activities are partly reduced by high pH (11-12) and temperature (55-65 degrees C) in professional and domestic dishwashers. In manual dishwashing, temperature and pH are kept lower (45 degrees C and pH 7), which is less sufficient for the reduction of bacteria. In a broth, organic loaded in order to mimic dishwater, solutions of Ag or hypochlorite were added at 45 degrees C and pH 7 and samples were withdrawn for a period of 40 minutes. 1 ppm Ag+ was required to obtain a 1 to 2 log unit reduction of B. cereus and S. aureus in 10 minutes. An addition of 160 ppm hypochlorite reduced B. cereus and S. aureus by 4 log units in two minutes, whereas 16 ppm of hypochlorite had no effect on the survival of S. aureus. The level of free residual chlorine varied with the COD value of the cultured solutions. We found that both silver and hypochlorite can be used as antibacterial agents in dishwater. The disadvantage with the use of hypochlorite is that the COD value determines the antibacterial effect. Using Ag+ solutions to reduce bacteria has the drawback that they are toxic to water-living organisms and are considered to develop Ag+ resistant bacteria. To reduce the risk of cross-contamination from dishwater to dishware high temperature and detergent with high pH is to be preferred.
TI  - Bioactive properties and chemical composition of six walnut (Juglans regia L.) cultivars.
AB  - The chemical composition, antioxidant potential and antimicrobial activity were studied in six walnuts (Juglans regia L.) cultivars (cv. Franquette, Lara, Marbot, Mayette, Mellanaise and Parisienne) produced in Portugal. Concerning their chemical composition the main constituent of fruits was fat ranging from 78.83% to 82.14%, being the nutritional value around 720kcal per 100g of fruits. Linoleic acid was the major fatty acid reaching the maximum value of 60.30% (cv. Lara) followed by oleic, linolenic and palmitic acids. The aqueous extracts of walnut cultivars were investigated by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. All the walnut extracts exhibited antioxidant capacity in a concentration-dependent manner being the lowest EC(50) values obtained with extracts of cv. Parisienne. Their antimicrobial capacity was also checked against gram positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans), revealing activity against the different tested microorganisms.
TI  - Insecticidal properties and microbial contaminants in a Spodoptera exigua multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (Baculoviridae) formulation stored at different temperatures.
AB  - The Spodoptera exigua (Hubner) multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (SeMNPV) is currently being tested as a biological insecticide for use in greenhouse crops in southern Spain. We performed a study in which semipurified SeMNPV occlusion bodies (OBs) were formulated in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.5, with 5% (vol:vol) glycerol and 0.15% (wt:vol) sorbic acid, and they were stored at -20, 4, or 25 degrees C during 18 mo. Initial aerobic counts (+/-SE) averaged 1.4 (+/-0.17) x 10(7) colony-forming units/ml after 17-h incubation at 37 degrees C. Aerobic counts of microorganisms that contaminated OB formulations stored at 250C decreased markedly over the period of the study, whereas only small decreases were observed in counts from OBs stored at 4 or -20 degrees C. The principal microbial contaminants of OB suspensions were Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, and yeasts. Potential human pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, and Vibrio species) were not detected, and populations of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus were extremely low. Compared with newly formulated OBs, the estimated LD50 values of OBs stored at 25 degrees C increased by >16,666-fold over the 18 mo of storage, whereas LD50 values were not greatly affected by storage at 4 or -20 degrees C. Significant changes over time in OB concentrations were only observed in the 25 degrees C treatment. Complete degradation of viral DNA was observed at 25 degrees C but not in refrigerated or frozen OBs. We conclude that OB formulation with bacteriostatic or antioxidant additives, together with storage and distribution in refrigerated conditions, will likely result in an SeMNPV biopesticide shelf life that exceeds 18 mo.
TI  - Growth inhibitory effects of kimchi (Korean traditional fermented vegetable product) against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Kimchi is a unique Korean traditional vegetable product that is fermented by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and is mainly consumed as a side dish with boiled rice. Its main ingredients are brined Chinese cabbage, red pepper powder, and fermented fish sauce, and these are combined with many spices such as garlic, green onion, ginger, and some seaweed. The relationship between the concentration of LAB or the pH and the growth of three gram-positive foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) was evaluated. Heat treatment (HT; 85 degrees C for 15 min) or neutralization treatment (NT; pH 7.0) was conducted on day 0 (0-D group) and day 3 (3-D group) of incubation. The pH in the control group and the NT group dropped sharply to 4.12 to 4.30 after 2 days of incubation and slightly decreased thereafter, whereas the pH in the control group and HT group stayed at 7.0 during incubation. LAB were not detected in the HT kimchi during incubation. B. cereus in the NT-0-D, NT-3-D, and HT-3-D groups was reduced by 1.5 to 3.1 log CFU/ml but increased slightly in the HT-0-D group. L. monocytogenes in HT-3-D and NT-3-D groups disappeared after 5 days of incubation, and S. aureus in the NT-0-D group disappeared after 4 days. These findings indicate that growth of all the foodborne pathogens was inhibited by NT-0-D, HT-3-D, and NT-3-D, but B. cereus was not inhibited by HT-0-D. Thus, growth of LAB in kimchi is an important factor in the control of foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Crystal structure of the Clostridium limosum C3 exoenzyme.
AB  - C3-like toxins ADP-ribosylate and inactivate Rho GTPases. Seven C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases produced by Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium limosum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus were identified and two representatives--C3bot from C. botulinum and C3stau2 from S. aureus--were crystallized. Here we present the 1.8A structure of C. limosum C3 transferase C3lim and compare it to the structures of other family members. In contrast to the structure of apo-C3bot, the canonical ADP-ribosylating turn turn motif is observed in a primed conformation, ready for NAD binding. This suggests an impact on the binding mode of NAD and on the transferase reaction. The crystal structure explains why auto-ADP-ribosylation of C3lim at Arg41 interferes with the ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the toxin.
TI  - Effects of Rosa rugosa petals on intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The effects of pulverized petal of Rosa rugosa on the growth of 10 species of intestinal and pathogenic bacteria were investigated. Growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli was not affected by the addition of the petal in plate cultivation. However, the growth of Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus was completely inhibited by the addition of 0.1, 0.5, 0.1, and 0.05% (w/v) of the petal respectively. In liquid cultivation, the addition of the petal (0.5%) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium breve and slightly inhibited the growth of Lactobacillus salivarius. But the growth of E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp. was inhibited by nearly 50%. Hydrolyzable tannins isolated from R. rugosa, rugosin D, and tellimagradin II showed antibacterial activities against E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and Salmonella sp., but little or no effect against Bif. breve and L. salivarius. R. rugosa petal showed selective antibacterial activities against intestinal and pathogenic bacteria, and the selectivity resembled that of prebiotics such as oligosaccharides and dietary fiber. Hydrolyzable tannins in R. rugosa, such as rugosin D and tellimagradin II, must be active constituents.
TI  - Chemical composition, and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of three hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cultivars.
AB  - Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) is a very popular dry fruit in the world being consumed in different form and presentations. In the present work, three hazelnut cultivars (cv. Daviana, Fertille de Coutard and M. Bollwiller) produced in Portugal, were characterized in respect to their chemical composition, antioxidant potential and antimicrobial activity. The samples were analysed for proximate constituents (moisture, fat, crude protein, ash), nutritional value and fatty acids profile by GC/FID. Antioxidant potential was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. Their antimicrobial capacity was also checked against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Results showed that the main constituent of fruits was fat ranging from 56% to 61%, being the nutritional value around 650 kcal per 100 g of fruits. Oleic was the major fatty acid varying between 80.67% in cv. F. Coutard and 82.63% in cv. Daviana, followed by linoleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. Aqueous hazelnut extract presented antioxidant activity in a concentration-dependent way, in general with similar behaviour for all cultivars. Hazelnut extracts revealed a high antimicrobial activity against Gram positive bacteria (MIC 0.1 mg/mL) showing a good bioactivity of these fruits.
TI  - Antimicrobial triterpenoids from Vladimiria muliensis.
AB  - A new triterpenoid with a rearranged ursane skeleton, 3beta-acetoxyl-11alpha-methoxybauer-8-en-7alpha-ol ( 1), two new ursane triterpenoids, 1alpha,5alpha-dioxy-11alpha-hydroxyurs-12-en-3-one ( 2) and urs-3beta,13alpha,18beta-triol ( 3), together with three known ursane triterpenoids ( 4- 6) were isolated from the rhizome of Vladimiria muliensis. Their structures were elucidated on the basis of spectroscopic methods (IR, EIMS, HRESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, and X-ray crystallography diffraction). Compounds 2 and 4 exhibited modest antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Molecular identification of dominant microflora associated with 'Hawaijar' - a traditional fermented soybean (Glycine max (L.)) food of Manipur, India.
AB  - The dominant microorganisms in 'Hawaijar', a traditional non-salted fermented soybean (Glycine max (L.)) food of Manipur, India, were isolated and identified by molecular techniques. Bacillus spp. were the predominant microorganisms in 'Hawaijar'. A total of 274 isolates were obtained from forty-one 'Hawaijar' samples collected from household preparations and markets of valley districts of Manipur. Phenotypic grouping followed by Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Digestion Analysis (ARDRA), PCR amplification of 16S-23S rDNA region, RFLP by Hae III and Hind III double digest (by comparing MTCC type strains) and sequencing of 9-1514 region of 16S rDNA resulted in three major phylogenic groups. Bacillus subtilis group comprising B. subtilis and B. licheniformis representing 112 isolates, B. cereus group representing of 128 isolates and Staphylococcus spp. group comprising S. aureus and S. sciuri representing 23 isolates. A few bacterial isolates belongs to Alkaligenes spp. and Providencia rettgeri were also found. Genetic diversity of B. subtilis phylogenic group was investigated by RAPD-PCR. Eighty-two strains of B. subtilis phylogenic group were identified using RAPD-PCR using OPA-18 and OPA-20 primers. These strains will be investigated for potential starter culture selection.
TI  - Two new members of streptothricin class antibiotics from Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov.
AB  - Four streptothricin-group antibiotics (1~4) were isolated from the fermentation broth of Streptomyces qinlingensis sp. nov. Along with the known antibiotics streptothricins F (1) and D (3), two new members of this class (2, 4) were identified as 12-carbamoyl derivatives of 1 and 3, respectively, mainly by analysis of the IR, HR-MS and NMR spectral data. The antibacterial activities of 1~4 against Escherichia coli (MICs 3.1, 25.0, 3.1 and 12.5 microg/ml), Bacillus subtilis (MICs 6.3, 25.0, 3.1 and 50 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (MICs 12.5, >100.0, 6.3, >100.0 microg/ml), Bacillus cereus (MICs 25.0, 50.0, 25.0 and 50.0 microg/ml) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MICs 50.0, >100.0, 50.0, >100.0 microg/ml) were assayed by micro-broth dilution. The results based on MIC data indicated that 2 and 4 exhibited significantly less potent antibacterial activities when compared to that of 1 and 3.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of different parts of Tribulus terrestris L. growing in Iraq.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of organic and aqueous extracts from fruits, leaves and roots of Tribulus terrestris L., an Iraqi medicinal plant used as urinary anti-infective in folk medicine, was examined against 11 species of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans using microdilution method in 96 multiwell microtiter plates. All the extracts from the different parts of the plant showed antimicrobial activity against most tested microorganisms. The most active extract against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria was ethanol extract from the fruits with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 0.15 mg/ml against B. subtilis, B. cereus, P. vulgaris and C. diphtheriae. In addition, the same extract from the same plant part demonstrated the strongest antifungal activity against C. albicans with an MIC value of 0.15 mg/ml.
TI  - Synergistic antibacterial activity between Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum  essential oils and methanol extracts.
AB  - Essential oils (EOs) and methanol extracts obtained from aerial parts of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum seeds were evaluated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against nine Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella typhimurium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The essential oils and methanol extracts revealed promising antibacterial activities against most pathogens using broth microdilution method. Maximum activity of Thymus vulgaris and Pimpinella anisum essential oils and methanol extracts (MIC 15.6 and 62.5mug/ml) were observed against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus vulgaris. Combinations of essential oils and methanol extracts showed an additive action against most tested pathogens especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a PCR-based approach.
AB  - The goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using PCR. In a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, PCR enabled detection of Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. Subsequently, Lactobacillus and Pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. Nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of Pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. PCR also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin A producers and accounted for the LAB succession in the fermenting samples. A total of 328 LAB isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which PCR could identify an overwhelming 186 Lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 Pediococcus and 29 Leuconostoc isolates, respectively. Based on antimicrobial assay against target strain Leuconostoc mesenteroides NRRL B640, 28% of the LAB were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin A and mesentericin producers. The bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of Gram-positive target LAB strains and pathogenic bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Comparative analysis of polyphenolic profiles and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of tunisian pome fruit pulp and peel aqueous acetone extracts.
AB  - Pome trees, apple, pear, and quince, are classified into the subfamily Pomoideae, belonging to the Rosaceae family. Their autumnal fruits are consumed worldwide in different forms, that is, fresh or transformed into jams, jelly, juices, etc. Their well-established beneficial properties to human health were found mainly related to their phenolic content. Pulp and peel aqueous acetone extracts obtained from Tunisian fruits at commercial maturity were comparatively evaluated for their phenolic profiles and antioxidant and antimicrobial potentials. The phenolic compounds present in the extracts were identified and quantified using RP-HPLC-DAD and ESI-MS techniques. Significant differences in the chromatographic profiles among these fruits, as well as between pulp and peel extracts of each fruit, were observed. Quince, followed by 'Red Delicious', peel extracts showed the highest phenolic content (160.33 and 110.90 mg/100 g of fresh weight). The stronger inhibitory effect on DPPH radicals corresponded to those obtained from peel materials. A comparative analysis of the antimicrobial potential against a range of microorganism strains was also carried out. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus were the most sensitive to the active extracts. Among the examined phenolic extracts, 'Red Delicious' and quince peels showed the highest effects for inhibiting bacteria growth. Minimum inhibitory and bactericide concentrations ranged from 10(2) to 10(4) microg of polyphenol/mL. Red skin apple and quince peels could be of great interest as important antioxidant and antimicrobial polyphenol sources.
TI  - [Microbiological monitoring of milk samples and surface samples in a hospital infant formula room].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Analyze the microbiological quality of reconstituted milk formulas and the surface hygiene in a hospital infant formula room, in the context of a worldwide emergence of Enterobacter sakazakii infections. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Over 3.5 years, monthly samples of reconstituted milk formulas as well as quarterly infant formula room surface samples were taken for bacteriological analysis. RESULTS: Of the 156 formulas analyzed, 54 carried microorganisms but no pathogenic bacteria. The presence of Bacillus species was found in 54% of the formulas for premature infants and in 19% of the other formulas (significant difference). Bacteria, probably brought by operators during reconstitution of the powdered formulas, were found in four of 156 samples (two negative-coagulase staphylococcus, one alpha-hemolytic streptococcus, and one Clostridium bifermentans). Surfaces were studied using 117 samples divided into 11 series: 4.3% of the points carried pathogenic bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bulhkholderia cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus). DISCUSSION: The presence of Bacillus species should be analyzed thoroughly so as to differentiate Bacillus cereus from other nonpathogenic species. The microbiological analysis techniques used for reconstituted infant formulas can be simplified. CONCLUSION: The quality of the infant formulas seems satisfactory. Hygiene practices provide good microbiological quality in reconstituted infant milk formulas. Microbiological monitoring of these preparations and the infant formula room surfaces is an important aspect of the quality assurance policy, which makes it possible to take corrective measures when an unsatisfactory result is found.
TI  - Lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  - Twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, C. perfringens). Two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. Isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as L. crispatus or L. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of S. aureus, B. cereus and E. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. Diarrhea-causing E. coli O8K88H9 Ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of L. reuteri 12/26. Mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.
TI  - Cleaning and handling implements as potential reservoirs for bacterial contamination of some ready-to-eat foods in retail delicatessen environments.
AB  - This study assessed the association of bacteria with cleaning tools, such as floor mops (n = 25) and cleaning cloths (n = 39), and handling devices, such as disposable plastic gloves (n = 20), used during filled baguette and assorted salad preparation in four selected retail delicatessens in Johannesburg, South Africa. Samples of each cleaning or handling tool were prepared for aerobic (APC), coliform (CC), Escherichia coli (EC), Bacillus cereus (BCC), and Staphylococcus aureus (SAC) counts, as well as tested for the incidence of Listeria monocytogenes (LM) and Salmonella (SALM) by standard plating methods. Bacterial populations attached to the cleaning and handling tools were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Ten selected gram-positive isolates were further analyzed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis and compared with isolates from filled baguettes and assorted salads. The floor mops consistently yielded the highest APCs, CCs, and ECs (5.7, 4.1, and 3.0 log CFU/g, respectively), while gloves had the lowest corresponding counts (3.6, 2.0, and 1.0 log CFU/g, respectively). Low BCCs and SACs were recorded in this study (ca. 1.2 log CFU/g), while SALM and LM were each detected in five cleaning tool samples. SEM showed rods and cocci attached to handling and cleaning tools. Furthermore, results of 16S rRNA sequence analysis indicated that several gram-positive isolates were identified as S. aureus, Staphylococcus pasteuri, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Enterococcus faecalis. Genetically similar strains (100% similarity) were isolated from cleaning and handling tools and associated ready-to-eat (RTE) foods. Cleaning and handling tools may act as reservoirs of contamination for RTE foods during preparation in retail delicatessens in South Africa. The transfer of potential pathogens, such as S. aureus, to foods from cleaning and handling tools may hold food safety implications.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of CAD-1, a chromosomally encoded new class A penicillinase from Carnobacterium divergens.
AB  - Carnobacterium divergens clinical isolates BM4489 and BM4490 were resistant to penicillins but remained susceptible to combinations of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and piperacillin-tazobactam. Cloning and sequencing of the responsible determinant from BM4489 revealed a coding sequence of 912 bp encoding a class A beta-lactamase named CAD-1. The bla(CAD-1) gene was assigned to a chromosomal location in the two strains that had distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns. CAD-1 shared 53% and 42% identity with beta-lactamases from Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. Alignment of CAD-1 with other class A beta-lactamases indicated the presence of 25 out of the 26 isofunctional amino acids in class A beta-lactamases. Escherichia coli harboring bla(CAD-1) exhibited resistance to penams (benzylpenicillin and amoxicillin) and remained susceptible to amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid. Mature CAD-1 consisted of a 34.4-kDa polypeptide. Kinetic analysis indicated that CAD-1 exhibited a narrow substrate profile, hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, and piperacillin with catalytic efficiencies of 6,600, 3,200, and 2,900 mM(-1) s(-1), respectively. The enzyme did not interact with oxyiminocephalosporins, imipenem, or aztreonam. CAD-1 was inhibited by tazobactam (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 0.27 microM), clavulanic acid (IC(50) = 4.7 microM), and sulbactam (IC(50) = 43.5 microM). The bla(CAD-1) gene is likely to have been acquired by BM4489 and BM4490 as part of a mobile genetic element, since it was not found in the susceptible type strain CIP 101029 and was adjacent to a gene for a resolvase.
TI  - Human chitotriosidase is expressed in the eye and lacrimal gland and has an antimicrobial spectrum different from lysozyme.
AB  - Chitotriosidase is a chitinolytic enzyme expressed by maturing macrophages and preformed in neutrophil granules, suggesting a role in antimicrobial defence. Although available evidence supports a role in anti-fungal immunity, there is a lack of an obvious phenotype in humans homozygous for a mutation which renders chitotriosidase inactive. This may be explained by compensatory effects of enzymes co-expressed with chitotriosidase, such as lysozyme. We have found that chitinase is highly expressed in mouse and human eye, particularly in lacrimal glands. Chitotriosidase is the only member of the chitinase/chilectin gene cluster expressed in the murine eye. As lacrimal glands also produce lysozyme, we have asked whether chitotriosidase, in addition to its documented anti-fungal effects, has synergistic anti-bacterial properties with lysozyme. The effect of recombinant chitotriosidase on the growth of five Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus aureus OatA(+/-)) and two Gram-negative strains (Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), were tested in a luminometric assay. Recombinant chitotriosidase did not inhibit bacterial growth and did not synergize with lysozyme. Though the expression of chitotriosidase in the eye supports a role in innate immunity, the antimicrobial spectrum appears to be complementary to lysozyme and may indeed be limited to fungi.
TI  - Biological activity of phenylpropionic acid isolated from a terrestrial Streptomycetes.
AB  - The strain ANU 6277 was isolated from laterite soil and identified as Streptomyces sp. closely related to Streptomyces albidoflavus cluster by 16S rRNA analysis. The cultural, morphological and physiological characters of the strain were recorded. The strain exhibited resistance to chloramphenicol, penicillin and streptomycin. It had the ability to produce enzymes such as amylase and chitinase. A bioactive compound was isolated from the strain at stationary phase of culture and identified as 3-phenylpropionic acid (3-PPA) by FT-IR, EI-MS, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral studies. It exhibited antimicrobial activity against different bacteria like Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. flourescens, Staphylococcus aureus and some fungi including Aspergillus flavus, A. niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium oxysporum, F. udum and Penicillium citrinum. The antifungal activity of 3-PPA of the strain was evaluated in in vivo and in vitro conditions against Fusarium udum causing wilt disease in pigeon pea. The compound 3-PPA is an effective antifungal agent when compared to tricyclozole (fungicide) to control wilt caused by F. udum, but it exhibited less antifungal activity than carbendazim.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of guava (Psidium guajava L.) and Neem (Azadirachta indica A. Juss.) extracts against foodborne pathogens and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of guava (Psidium guajava) and neem (Azadirachta indica) extracts against 21 strains of foodborne pathogens were determined--Listeria monocytogenes (five strains), Staphylococcus aureus (four strains), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (six strains), Salmonella Enteritidis (four strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and Bacillus cereus, and five food spoilage bacteria: Pseudomonas aeroginosa, P. putida, Alcaligenes faecalis, and Aeromonas hydrophila (two strains). Guava and neem extracts showed higher antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria compared to Gram-negative bacteria except for V. parahaemolyticus, P. aeroginosa, and A. hydrophila. None of the extracts showed antimicrobial activity against E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Enteritidis. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ethanol extracts of guava showed the highest inhibition for L. monocytogenes JCM 7676 (0.1 mg/mL), S. aureus JCM 2151 (0.1 mg/mL), S. aureus JCM 2179 (0.1 mg/mL), and V. parahaemolyticus IFO 12711 (0.1 mg/mL) and the lowest inhibition for Alcaligenes faecalis IFO 12669, Aeromonas hydrophila NFRI 8282 (4.0 mg/mL), and A. hydrophila NFRI 8283 (4.0 mg/mL). The MIC of chloroform extracts of neem showed similar inhibition for L. monocytogenes ATCC 43256 (4.0 mg/mL) and L. monocytogenes ATCC 49594 (5.0 mg/mL). However, ethanol extracts of neem showed higher inhibition for S. aureus JCM 2151 (4.5 mg/mL) and S. aureus IFO 13276 (4.5 mg/mL) and the lower inhibition for other microorganisms (6.5 mg/mL). No significant effects of temperature and pH were found on guava and neem extracts against cocktails of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus. The results of the present study suggest that guava and neem extracts possess compounds containing antibacterial properties that can potentially be useful to control foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms.
TI  - Potential and limitation of UVC irradiation for the inactivation of pathogens in  platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pathogen contamination, causing transfusion-transmitted diseases, is  an ongoing concern in transfusion of cellular blood products. In this explorative study, the pathogen-inactivating capacity of UVC irradiation in platelet (PLT) concentrates was investigated. The dose dependencies of inactivation of several viruses and bacteria were compared with the effect on PLT quality. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The potential of UVC irradiation was studied with a range of lipid-enveloped (LE) and non-lipid-enveloped viruses (NLE) and bacteria. LE viruses were bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). NLE viruses were canine parvovirus (CPV) and simian virus 40 (SV40). Bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Bacillus cereus. After spiking and irradiation, samples were tested for residual infectivity and reduction factors (RFs) were calculated. Furthermore, the effect of UVC irradiation on PLT quality was determined by measuring in vitro quality variables. RESULTS: A UVC dose of 500 J per m(2) resulted in acceptable PLT quality (as measured by pH, lactate production, CD62P expression, and exposure of phosphatidylserine) and high RFs (>4 log) for CPV, TGEV, VSV, S. epidermidis, S. aureus, and E. coli. Intermediate RFs (approx. 3 log) were observed for BVDV, PRV, and B. cereus. Low RFs (approx. 1 log) were found for HIV and SV40. No differences in virus reduction were observed between cell-free and cell-associated virus. CONCLUSION: UVC irradiation is a promising pathogen-reducing technique in PLT concentrates, inactivating bacteria, and a broad range of viruses (with the exception of HIV) under conditions that have limited effects on PLT quality. Further optimization of the UVC procedure, however, is necessary to deal with blood-borne viruses like HIV.
TI  - Production of nisin Z by Lactococcus lactis isolated from dahi.
AB  - Lactococcus lactis CM1, an isolate from homemade "Dahi," a traditional fermented  milk from India, used maltose as carbon source to produce a high level of bacteriocin. The bacterial cell mass and the bacteriocin production correlated with the initial pH of the medium and were highest when the initial pH was 11.0. The level of bacteriocin reached its peak at the late log phase with concomitant reduction of culture pH to 4.2, regardless of the initial pH of the medium. A combination of maltose and an initial medium pH of 11 resulted in the highest bacteriocin production. The antibacterial spectrum of the bacteriocin was closely similar to that of nisin and it inhibited a number of food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. Upon sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the compound migrated close to the position of nisin (3.5 kDa). However, it had higher stability than nisin at a wide range of pH and temperature. PCR amplification using nisin gene-specific primers and sequencing of the amplified DNA revealed the structural gene for the bacteriocin to be identical to that of nisZ.
TI  - Bioactivity and chemical composition of the leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium and Zanthoxylum setulosum from Monteverde, Costa Rica.
AB  - The leaf essential oils of Zanthoxylum rhoifolium and Zanthoxylum setulosum (Rutaceae) from Monteverde, Costa Rica have been obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The principal constituents of Z. rhoifolium leaf oil were germacrene D (14.6%), limonene (12.5%), trans-2-hexenal (11.3%), beta-elemene (9.2%), 2-undecanone (9.2%), myrcene (7.9%), bicyclogermacrene (7.5%), and germacrene A (5.2%). The leaf oil of Z. setulosum was composed largely of beta-phellandrene (37.5%), beta-caryophyllene (13.7%), alpha-pinene (11.9%), germacrene D (10.9%), myrcene (5.9%), and nerolidol (5.4%). The essential oils were screened for in-vitro cytotoxic activity against Hep G2, MCF-7, and PC-3 human tumor cell lines; antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli; and for Artemia salina (brine shrimp) lethality. Neither Z. rhoifolium nor Z. setulosum leaf oils exhibited cytotoxicity or antibacterial activity. Both oils showed activity against A. salina.
TI  - Sphingomyelinase generation of ceramide promotes clustering of nanoscale domains  in supported bilayer membranes.
AB  - The effects of ceramide incorporation in supported bilayers prepared from ternary lipid mixtures which have small nanoscale domains have been examined using atomic force and fluorescence microscopy. Both direct ceramide incorporation in vesicles used to prepare the supported bilayers and enzymatic hydrolysis of SM by sphingomyelinase were compared for membranes prepared from 5:5:1 DOPC/sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixtures. Both methods of ceramide incorporation resulted in enlargement of the initial small ordered domains. However, enzymatic ceramide generation led to a much more pronounced restructuring of the bilayer to give large clusters of domains with adjacent areas of a lower phase. The individual domains were heterogeneous with two distinct heights, the highest of which is assigned to a ceramide-rich phase which is hypothesized to occur via ceramide flip-flop to the lower leaflet with formation of a raised domain due to negative membrane curvature. A combination of AFM and fluorescence showed that the bilayer restructuring starts rapidly after enzyme addition, with formation of large clusters of domains at sites of high enzyme activity. The clustering of domains is accompanied by redistribution of fluid phase to the periphery of the domain clusters and there is a continued slow evolution of the bilayer over a period of an hour or more after the enzyme is removed. The relevance of the observed clustering of small nanoscale domains to the postulated coalescence of raft domains to form large signaling platforms is discussed.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of five Zingiberaceae essential oils.
AB  - Essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation and two different solvent extractions (petroleum ether and ethanol) from five Zingiberaceae species: ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe.), galanga (Alpinia galanga Sw.), turmeric (Curcuma longa L.), kaempferia (Boesenbergia pandurata Holtt.) and bastard cardamom (Amomum xanthioides Wall.) was characterized. Volatile components of all extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The major components of ginger, turmeric, galangal, bastard cardamom and kaempferia were zingiberene, turmerone, methyl chavicol, and gamma-terpinene, respectively. Their antibacterial effects towards Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes were tested by a disc diffusion assay. Essential oil of kaempferia and bastard cardamom obtained by hydrodistillation extraction could inhibit growth of all tested bacteria. Essential oil of ginger extracted by hydrodistillation had the highest efficiency against three positive strains of bacteria (S. aureus, B. cereus and L. monocytogenes), with a minimum concentration to inhibit B. cereus and L. monocytogenes of 6.25 mg/mL.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, methanol, and petroleum ether extracts of the lichen Parmelia sulcata and its salazinic acid constituent have been screened against twenty eight food-borne bacteria and fungi. All of the extracts with the exception of the petroleum ether extract showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Penicillium notatum. Salazinic acid did not show antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes, P. vulgaris, Y. enterocolitica, and S. faecalis but showed activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium as well. The MIC values of the extracts and the acid for the bacteria and fungi have also been determined.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of two antitumour agents and ribonucleotide reductase inhibitors, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and the acetate form of its copper(II) chelate.
AB  - Some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. Yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. Copper(II) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-N-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. Both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. Some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. I report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(II) chelate. They were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus lactis), yeasts (Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (Aspergillus niger). Two clinical isolates of Bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. Both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. The ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except for S. lactis, and its activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. It was highly active against A. niger and moderately active against C. albicans. The chelate was highly active against S. epidermidis and S. cerevisiae. Both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. Since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.
TI  - Effect of heat-generated product from uronic acids on the physiological activities of microbial cells and its application.
AB  - Filtered samples of monogalacturonic (GA) and monoglucuronic acids (GL) that were prepared using millipore filter (pore size=0.2 microm) slightly inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli while the autoclaved (at 121 degrees C for 20 min) samples of GA and GL completely inhibited the growth of E. coli. The most effective substance generated upon autoclave treatment was isolated and characterized as trans-4,5-dihydroxy-2-cyclopenten-1-one (DHCP). The optimal conditions for DHCP generation were also established by autoclaving GA (pH 2.3) at 121 degrees C for 3h. DHCP completely inhibited the growth of E. coli. However, the growth of E. coli was restored when superoxide dismutase and catalase were added to the culture broth that contained DHCP. It was thought that DHCP might have induced the release of active oxygen, which resulted in the inhibition of microbial growth. In the case of gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus) and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida brassicae), DHCP inhibited the cell growth. Based on our results, methods for preparation of food preservatives that contained pectin degraded products (oligo-galacturonic acid and monogalacturonic acid) and DHCP were developed. The preservatives were very effective in inhibiting the growth of E. coli and S. cerevisiae.
TI  - Effectiveness of trisodium phosphate, acidified sodium chlorite, citric acid, and peroxyacids against pathogenic bacteria on poultry during refrigerated storage.
AB  - The effects of dipping treatments (15 min) in potable water or in solutions (wt/vol) of 12% trisodium phosphate (TSP), 1,200 ppm acidified sodium chlorite (ASC), 2% citric acid (CA), and 220 ppm peroxyacids (PA) on inoculated pathogenic bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica) and skin pH were investigated throughout storage of chicken legs (days 0, 1, 3, and 5) at 3 +/- 1 degrees C. All chemical solutions reduced microbial populations (P < 0.001) as compared with the control (untreated) samples. Similar bacterial loads (P > 0.05) were observed on water-dipped and control legs. Type of treatment, microbial group, and sampling day influenced microbial counts (P < 0.001). Average reductions with regard to control samples were 0.28 to 2.41 log CFU/g with TSP, 0.33 to 3.15 log CFU/g with ASC, 0.82 to 1.97 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.07 to 0.96 log CFU/g with PA. Average reductions were lower (P < 0.001) for gram-positive (0.96 log CFU/g) than for gram-negative (1.33 log CFU/g) bacteria. CA and ASC were the most effective antimicrobial compounds against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. TSP was the second most effective compound for both bacterial groups. Average microbial reductions per gram of skin were 0.87 log CFU/g with TSP, 0.86 log CFU/g with ASC, 1.39 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.74 log CFU/g with PA for gram-positive bacteria, and 1.28 log CFU/g with TSP, 2.03 log CFU/g with ASC, 1.23 log CFU/g with CA, and 0.78 log CFU/g with PA for gram-negative bacteria. With only a few exceptions, microbial reductions in TSP- and ASC-treated samples decreased and those in samples treated with CA increased throughout storage. Samples treated with TSP and samples dipped in CA and ASC had the highest and lowest pH values, respectively, after treatment. The pH of the treated legs tended to return to normal (6.3 to 6.6) during storage. However, at the end of storage, the pH of legs treated with TSP remained higher and that of legs treated with CA remained lower than normal.
TI  - Molecular characterization of antimicrobial compound produced by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.). Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced higher antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and could be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-butanol. 12% SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent were located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - Development of flexible antimicrobial films using essential oils as active agents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity in the vapor-phase of laboratory-made flexible films of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene/ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (PE/EVOH) incorporating essential oil of cinnamon ( Cinnamomum zeylanicum), oregano ( Origanum vulgare), clove ( Syzygium aromaticum), or cinnamon fortified with cinnamaldehyde was evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms: the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis; the Gram-positive bacteria Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis; the molds Penicillium islandicum, Penicillium roqueforti, Penicillium nalgiovense, Eurotium repens, and A spergillus flavus and the yeasts Candida albicans, Debaryomyces hansenii, and Zigosaccharomyces rouxii. Films with a nominal concentration of 4% (w/w) of fortified cinnamon or oregano essential oil completely inhibited the growth of the fungi; higher concentrations were required to inhibit the Gram-positive bacteria (8 and 10%, respectively), and higher concentrations still were necessary to inhibit the Gram-negative bacteria. PP films were more effective than PE/EVOH films. The atmospheres generated by the antimicrobial films inside Petri dishes were quantitatively analyzed using headspace-single drop microextraction (HS-SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The analyses showed that the oregano-fortified PP films released higher levels of carvacrol and thymol, and the cinnamon-fortified PP films released higher levels of cinnamaldehyde, during the first 3-6 h of incubation, than the corresponding PE/EVOH films. Shelf-life tests were also performed, demonstrating that the antifungal activities of the films persisted for more than two months after their manufacture. In addition, migration tests (overall and specific) were performed, using both aqueous and fatty simulants, to ensure that the films meet EU regulations regarding food contact materials. Following contact with the tested films, the substances that had migrated into the aqueous simulants were recovered by direct immersion-single drop extraction (DI-SDME) and then analyzed by GC-MS. The fatty stimulant (isooctane) was directly injected into the chromatographic system.
TI  - Phenolic compounds and antimicrobial activity of olive (Olea europaea L. Cv. Cobrancosa) leaves.
AB  - We report the determination of phenolic compounds in olive leaves by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and the evaluation of their in vitro activity against several microorganisms that may be causal agents of human intestinal and respiratory tract infections, namely gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). Seven phenolic compounds were identified and quantified: caffeic acid, verbascoside, oleuropein, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, apigenin 7-O-glucoside and luteolin 4'-O-glucoside. At low concentrations olive leaves extracts showed an unusual combined antibacterial and antifungal action, which suggest their great potential as nutraceuticals, particularly as a source of phenolic compounds.
TI  - Structure and biological activities of beta toxin from Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Beta toxin is a neutral sphingomyelinase secreted by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus. This virulence factor lyses erythrocytes in order to evade the host immune system as well as scavenge nutrients. The structure of beta toxin was determined at 2.4-A resolution using crystals that were merohedrally twinned. This structure is similar to that of the sphingomyelinases of Listeria ivanovii and Bacillus cereus. Beta toxin belongs to the DNase I folding superfamily; in addition to sphingomyelinases, the proteins most structurally related to beta toxin include human endonuclease HAP1, Escherichia coli endonuclease III, bovine pancreatic DNase I, and the endonuclease domain of TRAS1 from Bombyx mori. Our biological assays demonstrated for the first time that beta toxin kills proliferating human lymphocytes. Structure-directed active site mutations show that biological activities, including hemolysis and lymphotoxicity, are due to the sphingomyelinase activity of the enzyme.
TI  - Synthesis, spectroscopic and biological aspects of iron(II) complexes.
AB  - Five novel coordinated complexes of iron(II) with ciprofloxacin and neutral bidentate ligands have been prepared and characterized using elemental analyses, magnetic measurements, IR spectra, UV-VIS spectral, thermogravimetric analyses, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR. The antimicrobial activity of the individual ligands, metal salt and metal complexes with respect to Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marcescens, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus and Lasiodiplodia theobromae were evaluated by the agar-plate technique in comparison to reference standard drugs (ofloxacin, levofloxacin and fluconozole). Binding of the complexes to DNA was studied and is discussed.
TI  - Ethnobotanical survey and antibacterial activity of some plants used in Guinean traditional medicine.
AB  - A total of 418 healers have been interviewed in Guinea, a coastal country of West Africa, ranging between 7 degrees 30 and 12 degrees 30 of northern latitude and 8 degrees and 15 degrees of western longitude. Plant species used by the local inhabitants to treat infectious diseases were identified using ethnobotanical, ethnographic and taxonomic methods. During these investigations, 218 plants were registered, of which the following were the most frequently used: Erythrina senegalensis, Bridelia ferruginea, Crossopteryx febrifuga, Ximenia americana, Annona senegalensis, Cochlospermum tinctorium, Cochlospermum planchonii, Lantana camara, Costus afer, Psidium guajava, Terminalia glaucescens, Uapaca somon and Swartzia madagascariensis. Most plants, and especially the leaves, were essentially used as a decoction. In order to assess antibacterial activity, 190 recipes were prepared and biologically tested, among which six showed activity (minimal inhibitory concentration<125 microg/ml) against Bacillus cereus, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Staphylococcus aureus, or Candida albicans, i.e., Entada africana, Chlorophora regia, Erythrina senegalensis, Harrisonia abyssinica, Uvaria tomentosa, and a mixture of six plants consisting of Swartzia madagascariensis, Isoberlinia doka, Annona senegalensis, Gardenia ternifolia, Terminalia glaucescens and Erythrina senegalensis.
TI  - Maintenance of sterility in 1-mL polypropylene syringes.
AB  - PURPOSE: The sterility of syringes filled with a growth-promoting broth when stored under various temperature conditions was studied. METHODS: Samples of tryptic soy broth (TSB) were injected into 150 1-mL polypropylene syringes and incubated at 33-37 degrees C for 14 days, after which time they were visually inspected for microbial contamination. In addition to visual inspection, the sterility of all syringes was tested by inoculating samples into 10-mL tubes of thioglycollate broth, incubating at 35 degrees C, and observing for growth for 5 days. After the 14-day incubation period, 30 syringes were removed for sterility validation and microbial growth promotion. TSB from 15 syringes was transferred into sterile culture tubes and challenged with Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. The remaining 120 syringes were repackaged and stored at room temperature (22 degrees C), in a refrigerator (5 degrees C), or in a freezer (-20 degrees C). The sterility of the samples was evaluated at 30 days, 45 days, three months, and six months. RESULTS: No microbial growth was detected by visual inspection in any of the 15 syringes examined for turbidity during validation testing. All study syringes (n = 120) remained sterile throughout the respective evaluation periods, regardless of storage condition. CONCLUSION: Growth-promoting broth stored in 1-mL polypropylene syringes remained sterile when stored at room temperature, in a refrigerator, or in a freezer for six months.
TI  - A systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. DATA SOURCES: Studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. Hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. REVIEW METHODS: A systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. Specific organisms under review were Salmonella, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli O157, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus. Data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. Where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. A decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical UK population. Finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of GPs, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. RESULTS: Good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. The estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. Indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. The significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. Economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that PCR for Campylobacter, Salmonella and E. coli O157 is potentially very successful in identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. Less is known about the benefits of testing for B. cereus, C. perfringens and S. aureus. Further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of some new 1,3,4-thiadiazole and 1,2,4-triazole compounds having a D,L-methionine moiety.
AB  - New 1,3,4-thiadiazole, 5a-e, and 1,2,4-triazolecompounds 6a-c, containing a D,L-methionine moiety were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of 1,4-disubstituted thiosemicarbazides 4a-e in acid and alkaline media, respectively. The potential antimicrobial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using the Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus antracis ATCC 8705, Bacillus cereus ATCC 10987, Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 strains. The newly synthesized compounds exhibited promising activities against Bacillus antracis and Bacillus cereus.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Melastoma candidum D. Don acetone extract on foodborne pathogenic bacteria survival in food products.
AB  - Melastoma candidum D. Don, a Taiwanese folk medicinal plant, has high levels of antibacterial and bactericidal activity. Our aim was to determine whether and to what extent an acetone extract of this plant inhibits the growth of foodborne pathogenic bacteria. M. candidum acetone extract had marked inhibitory effect on test bacteria introduced into sliced pork, which was then stored at 4 degrees C. At the end of storage (day 12), the bacterial concentrations dropped by 1.59 to 2.91 log CFU/g compared with the control. In steamed rice stored at 30 degrees C, a 0.2% extract decreased initial (before storage) concentrations of Bacillus cereus from 2.01 log CFU/g to an undetectable level, which remained for at least 24 h. After 72 to 168 h of storage, test bacterial concentrations were reduced by 2.59 to 5.66 log CFU/g. In fresh noodles stored at 30 degrees C, both initial and final bacterial concentrations were decreased. At the end of storage (72 to 168 h), test bacteria concentrations were reduced by 1.85 to 2.88 log CFU/g. Overall, M. candidum acetone extract had an inhibitory effect on foodborne pathogenic bacteria in different food model systems.
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity of the reactive compounds generated in vitro by Manduca sexta phenoloxidase.
AB  - Although quinone production and melanin formation are widely recognized as an integral part of the insect defense system, experimental evidence is lacking that the proteolytic activation of prophenoloxidase participates in the direct killing of invading microbes-active phenoloxidase generates quinones that polymerize to form melanin. Here, we report the antimicrobial effect of reactive intermediates produced in phenoloxidase-catalyzed reactions. After being treated with Manduca sexta phenoloxidase and dopamine, Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis ceased to grow, whereas the growth of Pichia pastoris was slightly affected. Microscopic analysis showed melanin deposition on cell surface, aggregation of bacteria, and loss of cell mobility. Viability tests revealed major decreases in the bacterial colony counts and, since the decrease remained significant after dispersion of the cell clumps, the reactive compounds were surmised to have aggregated and killed E. coli and B. subtilis cells. Under the experimental conditions, 60-94% of the Gram-negative bacteria (E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium) and 52-99% of the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus) were killed. In the presence of phenoloxidase, dopamine or 5,6-dihydroxyindole (DHI) exhibited much higher antibacterial activity than L-dopa, N-acetyldopamine (NADA) or N-beta-alanyldopamine (NBAD) did, suggesting that DHI and its oxidation products were cytotoxic. The antifungal activity of DHI was detected using P. pastoris, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Candida albicans, and Beauveria bassiana. These results established that prophenoloxidase activation is an integral component of the insect defense system involving a multitude of enzymes (e.g. proteinases, oxidases, and dopachrome conversion enzyme (DCE)), which immobilizes and kills invading microorganisms.
TI  - Walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves: phenolic compounds, antibacterial activity and  antioxidant potential of different cultivars.
AB  - Different cultivars of walnut (Juglans regia L.) leaves (Cv. Lara, Franquette, Mayette, Marbot, Mellanaise and Parisienne) grown in Portugal, were investigated in what concerns phenolic compounds and antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. Phenolics analysis was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD and 10 compounds were identified and quantified: 3- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids, 3- and 4-p-coumaroylquinic acids, p-coumaric acid, quercetin 3-galactoside, quercetin 3-pentoside derivative, quercetin 3-arabinoside, quercetin 3-xyloside and quercetin 3-rhamnoside. The antimicrobial capacity was screened against Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). Walnut leaves selectively inhibited the growth of Gram positive bacteria, being B. cereus the most susceptible one (MIC 0.1mg/mL). Gram negative bacteria and fungi were resistant to the extracts at 100mg/mL. Lara walnut leaves were also submitted to antibacterial assays using 18 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus sp. Antioxidant activity was accessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals and beta-carotene linoleate model system. In a general way, all of the studied walnut leaves cultivars presented high antioxidant activity (EC(50) values lower than 1mg/mL), being Cv. Lara the most effective one.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of Indian Berberis species.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of hydroalcoholic extracts of four Berberis species viz. Berberis aristata, Berberis asiatica, Berberis chitria and Berberis lycium were tested against eleven bacterial and eight fungal strains. B. aristata root extract gave low MICs values against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus flavus while stem extract against B. cereus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Antibacterial properties and major bioactive components of cinnamon stick (Cinnamomum burmannii): activity against foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Cinnamomum burmannii Blume (cinnamon stick) from Indonesia is a little-investigated spice. In this study, the antibacterial activity, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of cinnamon stick extract were evaluated against five common foodborne pathogenic bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella anatum). Cinnamon stick extract exhibited significant antibacterial properties. Major compounds in cinnamon stick were tentatively identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography (LC-MS) as a predominant volatile oil component ((E)-cinnamaldehyde) and several polyphenols (mainly proanthocyanidins and (epi)catechins). Both (E)-cinnamaldehyde and proanthocyanidins significantly contributed to the antibacterial properties. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe morphological changes of bacteria treated with the crude extract of cinnamon stick and its major components. This study suggests that cinnamon stick and its bioactive components have potential for application as natural food preservatives.
TI  - The contribution of gC1qR/p33 in infection and inflammation.
AB  - Human gC1qR/p33 is a multi-compartmental and multi-functional cellular protein expressed on a wide range of tissues and cell types including lymphocytes, endothelial cells, dendritic cells, and platelets. Although originally isolated as a receptor for C1q by virtue of its affinity (K(d)=15-50 nM), and specificity for the globular heads of this molecule, a large body of evidence has now been accumulated which shows that in addition to C1q, gC1qR can serve as a receptor for diverse proinflammatory ligands including proteins of the plasma kinin-forming system, most notably high molecular weight kininogen (HK; K(d)=9 nM). In addition, gC1qR has been reported to recognize and bind a number of functional antigens of viral and bacterial origin. It is its ability to interact with microbial antigens and its potential to serve as a cellular protein for bacterial attachment and/or entry that has been the focus of our laboratory in the past few years. On the surface of activated platelets, gC1qR has been shown to serve as a binding site for Staphylococcus aureus and this binding is mediated by protein A. Since the binding of S. aureus to platelets is postulated to play a major role in the pathogenesis of endocarditis, gC1qR may provide a suitable surface for the initial adhesion of the bacterium. Recent data also demonstrate that the exosporium of Bacillus cereus, a member of a genus of aerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming rod-like bacilli, which includes the deadly Bacillus anthracis, contains a binding site for gC1qR. Therefore, by virtue of its ability to recognize plasma proteins such as C1q and HK, as well as bacterial and viral antigens, cell-surface gC1qR not only is able to generate proinflammatory byproducts from the complement and kinin/kallikrein systems, but also can be an efficient vehicle and platform for a plethora of pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity of new aliphatic sulfonamide.
AB  - A series of novel aliphatic sulfonamide derivatives (1-7) were synthesized and characterized by elemental analyses, FT-IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and LC-MS techniques. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro as antimicrobial agents against representative strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Bacillus cereus ATCC 6633 and Listeria monocytogenes ATCC Li6 (isolate), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11230) and antifungal agent against Candida albicans (clinical isolate) by both disc diffusion and minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) methods. All these bacteria and fungus studied were screened against some antibiotics to compare with our chemicals' zone diameters. Our aliphatic sulfonamides have highest powerful antibacterial activity for Gram-negative bacteria than Gram-positive bacteria and antibacterial activity decreases as the length of the carbon chain increases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extract, fractions and four compounds extracted from Piper solmsianum C. DC. VAR. solmsianum (Piperaceae).
AB  - Piper solmsianum C. DC. var. solmsianum (Piperaceae) is a shrub commonly found in areas with wet tropical soils. Other Piper species have been used in folk medicine as antitumoral and antiseptic agents. We studied the crude methanolic extract, some organic fractions and compounds isolated from this plant for possible antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The bioautographic assays disclosed three inhibition zones. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined showing excellent activity, particularly against the Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and Streptococcus agalactiae). It appears that the antimicrobial activity of Piper solmsianum is related mainly to the presence of conocarpan and eupomatenoid-5 (neolignans). However another, as yet unidentified, active compound could also be extracted from the plant.
TI  - New triazole and triazolothiadiazine derivatives as possible antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Triazole and triazoles fused with six-membered ring systems are found to possess  diverse applications in the fields of medicine, agriculture and industry. The new 1,2,4-triazole and 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazine derivatives were synthesized as novel antimicrobial agents. The reaction of 1H-indol-3-acetic acid with thiocarbohydrazide gave the 4-amino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole. The reaction of triazole with arylaldehydes in ethanol gave the 4-arylideneamino-3-mercapto-5-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazoles (I). The 3-[(1H-indol-3-yl)methyl]-6-aryl-7H-1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines (II) were obtained by condensing triazole with phenacyl bromides in absolute ethanol . The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, (1)H NMR and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi University, Faculty of Medicine) were investigated and significant activity was obtained.
TI  - Vapor-phase activities of cinnamon, thyme, and oregano essential oils and key constituents against foodborne microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of the study presented here was to gain knowledge about the vapor-phase antimicrobial activity of selected essential oils and their major putatively active constituents against a range of foodborne bacterial and fungal strains. In a first step, the vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of three commercially available essential oils (EOs)-cinnamon (Cinnamomum zeylanicum), thyme (Thymus vulgaris), and oregano (Origanum vulgare)-were evaluated against a wide range of microorganisms, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella choleraesuis), Gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis), molds (Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus), and a yeast (Candida albicans). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were generally lower for oregano EO than for the thyme and cinnamon EOs, especially against the relatively resistant Gram-negative. The persistence of the EOs' antimicrobial activities over time was assessed, and changes in the composition of the atmosphere they generated over time were determined using single-drop microextraction (SDME) in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and subsequent analysis of the data by principal component analysis (PCA). More relevant chemicals were selected. In addition, the vapor-phase activities of putatively key constituents of the oils were screened against representative Gram-positive (L. monocytogenes) and Gram-negative (S. choleraesuis) bacteria, a mold (A. flavus), and a yeast (C. albicans). Of the tested compounds, cinnamaldehyde, thymol, and carvacrol showed the strongest antimicrobial effectiveness, so their MICs, defined as the minimum vapor concentrations that completely inhibited detectable growth of the microorganisms, were calculated. To check for possible interactions between components present in the EOs, cinnamon EO was fortified with cinnamaldehyde and thyme EO with thymol, and then the antimicrobial activities of the fortified oils were compared to those of the respective unfortified EOs using fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices and by plotting inhibition curves as functions of the vapor-phase concentrations. Synergistic effects were detected for cinnamaldehyde on A. flavus and for thymol on L. monocytogenes, S. choleraesuis, and A. flavus. In all other cases the fortification had additive effects, except for cinnamaldehyde's activity against S. choleraesuis, for which the effect was antagonistic. Finally, various microorganisms were found to cause slight changes over time to the atmospheres generated by all of the EOs (fortified and unfortified) except the fortified cinnamon EO.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of dietary spice and medicinal herb extracts.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of a total of 46 extracts from dietary spices and medicinal herbs were investigated by agar-well diffusion method against five foodborne bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella anatum). Their total phenolic contents were also evaluated. Many herb and spice extracts contained high levels of phenolics and exhibited antibacterial activity against foodborne pathogens. Gram-positive bacteria were generally more sensitive to the tested extracts than Gram-negative ones. S. aureus was the most sensitive, while E. coli was the most resistant. There were highly positive relationships (R(2)=0.73-0.93) between antibacterial activities and phenolic content of the tested extracts against each bacterium. This suggested that the antibacterial activity of the tested extracts was closely associated with their phenolic constituents.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Identification of the sigmaB regulon of Bacillus cereus and conservation of sigmaB-regulated genes in low-GC-content gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The alternative sigma factor sigma(B) has an important role in the acquisition of stress resistance in many gram-positive bacteria, including the food-borne pathogen Bacillus cereus. Here, we describe the identification of the set of sigma(B)-regulated genes in B. cereus by DNA microarray analysis of the transcriptome upon a mild heat shock. Twenty-four genes could be identified as being sigma(B) dependent as witnessed by (i) significantly lower expression levels of these genes in mutants with a deletion of sigB and rsbY (which encode the alternative sigma factor sigma(B) and a crucial positive regulator of sigma(B) activity, respectively) than in the parental strain B. cereus ATCC 14579 and (ii) increased expression of these genes upon a heat shock. Newly identified sigma(B)-dependent genes in B. cereus include a histidine kinase and two genes that have predicted functions in spore germination. This study shows that the sigma(B) regulon of B. cereus is considerably smaller than that of other gram-positive bacteria. This appears to be in line with phylogenetic analyses where sigma(B) of the B. cereus group was placed close to the ancestral form of sigma(B) in gram-positive bacteria. The data described in this study and previous studies in which the complete sigma(B) regulon of the gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined enabled a comparison of the sets of sigma(B)-regulated genes in the different gram-positive bacteria. This showed that only three genes (rsbV, rsbW, and sigB) are conserved in their sigma(B) dependency in all four bacteria, suggesting that the sigma(B) regulon of the different gram-positive bacteria has evolved to perform niche-specific functions.
TI  - A detailed analysis of 16S ribosomal RNA gene segments for the diagnosis of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes contain nine "hypervariable regions" (V1-V9) that demonstrate considerable sequence diversity among different bacteria. Species-specific sequences within a given hypervariable region constitute useful targets for diagnostic assays and other scientific investigations. No single region can differentiate among all bacteria; therefore, systematic studies that compare the relative advantage of each region for specific diagnostic goals are needed. We characterized V1-V8 in 110 different bacterial species including common blood borne pathogens, CDC-defined select agents and environmental microflora. Sequence similarity dendrograms were created for hypervariable regions V1-V8, and for selected combinations of regions or short segments within individual hypervariable regions that might be appropriate for DNA probing and real-time PCR. We determined that V1 best differentiated among Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus sp. V2 and V3 were most suitable for distinguishing all bacterial species to the genus level except for closely related enterobacteriaceae. V2 best distinguished among Mycobacterium species and V3 among Haemophilus species. The 58 nucleotides-long V6 could distinguish among most bacterial species except enterobacteriaceae. V6 was also noteworthy for being able to differentiate among all CDC-defined select agents including Bacillus anthracis, which differed from B. cereus by a single polymorphism. V4, V5, V7 and V8 were less useful targets for genus or species-specific probes. The hypervariable sequence-specific dendrograms and the "MEGALIGN" files provided online will be highly useful tools for designing specific probes and primers for molecular assays to detect pathogenic bacteria, including select agents.
TI  - Inactivation of foodborne pathogens using a one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of a one atmosphere uniform glow discharge plasma (OAUGDP) for inactivation of foodborne pathogens and to evaluate the influence of growth temperature, pH, and culture age on their inactivation. Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Shigella flexneri were evaluated. Three-strain mixtures of each bacterium were inoculated (6-7 log CFU/cm(2)) onto microscope slides containing nonselective agar media adjusted to pH 5 or 7. Samples were exposed to plasma for 0-240 sec immediately, or after incubation for 24 h at 10 degrees C or 35 degrees C. After exposure, the agar was removed from the slides and pummeled in 0.1% peptone water with a stomacher, serially diluted, surface plated onto nonselective media, and incubated at 35 degrees C. Exposure time, pH, incubation temperature, and culture age affected survival of all pathogens exposed to plasma (P < 0.05). The greatest reduction of pathogens generally occurred during the initial exposure time of 30 or 90 sec. Pathogens incubated for 24 h before exposure were more resistant than those exposed immediately after inoculation. Incubation at 35 degrees C before exposure resulted in greater resistance to plasma inactivation than incubation at 10 degrees C. No appreciable differences between gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens were observed, although the spore-forming B. cereus was more resistant to plasma than non-spore-formers. These findings support the potential for plasma treatment of foods or surfaces for pathogen reduction. Increased sensitivity of pathogens to plasma at reduced pH and temperature is encouraging, since these conditions are applicable to many foods during processing, handling, and storage.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and pollen composition of honey samples collected from different provinces in Turkey.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of honey samples from different sources were collected and investigated against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 27736, Morganella morganii, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4375, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, and Candida albicans. Pathogens exhibited different sensitivities towards the honey samples. The results showed that majority of the honey samples (75%) generally inhibitied the bacteria tested. The honey samples which were obtained from Izmir (samples 1 and 2) proved more effective as inhibitors against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus. The honey which was obtained from Mugla (sample 5) exhibited high anticandidal activity on C. albicans. A comparison of the honey samples on the basis of pollen content revealed that they were heterofloral, and samples which had highest antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and S. aureus were dominated by pollen from Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae (sample 1), and Trifolium, Trigonella, Cyperaceae, Zea mays and Anthemis taxa (sample 2). The honey proved more effective on bacteria than antibiotics.
TI  - Chromosomal-gene-mediated inhibition of intestinal and foodborne pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11.
AB  - Approximately 63 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus were isolated from Egyptian home-made cheese and examined for production of antagonism. Only eight strains demonstrated inhibitory activity against spoilage microorganisms (i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and pathogens (i.e. E. coli, Salmonella sp. and Shigella sp.). Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 produced a more antimicrobial activity with a wide range of inhibition. The agent AA11 was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes and retained full activity after 30 min at 100 degrees C. Activity against sensitive cells was bactericidal but not bacteriolytic. The compound was produced during growth phase and can be extracted from the culture supernatant fluids with n-Butanol. 12 % SDS-PAGE analysis of 40% ammonium sulphate precipitated agent showed two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 36 kDa and approximately 29 kDa. No plasmid was identified in Lactobacillus acidophilus AA11 indicating that the genes encoding the inhibitory agent located on the chromosome. These characteristics identify the inhibitory substance as a bacteriocin, designated acidocin AA11 and confer the agent an application potential as a biopreservative.
TI  - The use of clinical profiles in the investigation of foodborne outbreaks in restaurants: United States, 1982-1997.
AB  - Improving the efficiency of outbreak investigation in restaurants is critical to  reducing outbreak-associated illness and improving prevention strategies. Because clinical characteristics of outbreaks are usually available before results of laboratory testing, we examined their use for determining contributing factors in outbreaks caused by restaurants. All confirmed foodborne outbreaks reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1982 to 1997 were reviewed. Clinical profiles were developed based on outbreak characteristics. We compared the percentage of contributing factors by known agent and clinical profile to their occurrence in outbreaks of unclassified aetiology. In total, 2246 foodborne outbreaks were included: 697 (31%) with known aetiology and 1549 (69%) with aetiology undetermined. Salmonella accounted for 65% of outbreaks with a known aetiology. Norovirus-like clinical profiles were noted in 54% of outbreaks with undetermined aetiology. Improper holding times and temperatures were associated with outbreaks caused by Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella, and also with outbreaks of undetermined aetiology that fitted diarrhoea-toxin and vomiting-toxin clinical profiles. Poor personal hygiene was associated with norovirus, Shigella, and Salmonella, and also with outbreaks that fitted norovirus-like and vomiting-toxin clinical profiles. Contributing factors were similar for outbreaks with known aetiology and for those where aetiology was assigned by corresponding clinical profile. Rapidly categorizing outbreaks by clinical profile, before results of laboratory testing are available, can help identification of factors which contributed to the occurrence of the outbreak and will promote timely and efficient outbreak investigations.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of some essential oils administered alone or in combination  with Norfloxacin.
AB  - The objective of the present study was that of verifying a possible synergistic antibacterial effect between Pelargonium graveolens [Lis-Balchin, M., Deans, S.G., Hart, S., 1996. Bioactive Geranium oils from different commercial sources. J. Essential Oil Res. 8, 281-290.] essential oil (and its main components) and Norfloxacin antibiotic. As a first step growth inhibition by some types of essential oils was assessed in five microbial species. The antimicrobial effects of P. graveolens oil, as well as those of its components, were evaluated by means of the agar dilution method (ADM) against Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and S. aureus ATCC 29213. The results obtained highlighted the occurrence of a pronounced synergism between P. graveolens essential oil and Norfloxacin against three of the five bacterial species under study with a FIC index in the 0.37-0.50 range. Such antibacterial effects were also shown to increase, although to a lesser extent, when Norfloxacin was given with the main components of P. graveolens essential oil. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The combination of Norfloxacin with either P. graveolens essential oil, or with some of the main components of this latter, in the treatment of infections caused by some bacterial species is likely to reduce the minimum effective dose of Norfloxacin thus minimizing the side effects of the antibiotic.
TI  - Role of bacterial and host factors in infectious endophthalmitis.
AB  - Endophthalmitis is a frequent blinding complication of globe-penetrating injury and ocular surgery. The outcome of this intraocular infection depends both on the organism involved and management of the ensuing inflammation. The role of various toxins and bacterial factors in the pathogenesis of this infection is beginning to be delineated, but appears to be organism specific. Because of the immune-privileged environment of the eye, principles important in the resolution of infection at extraocular sites cannot be extrapolated to understanding the host-parasite dynamics in eye infection. Moreover, some factors that suppress the intraocular immune environment appear to have unexpected roles in activating phagocytic cells of the innate immune system in response to the presence of bacteria. Therefore, considerable additional information characterizing the precise role of bacterial and host factors in the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis will be required in order to develop new therapies to improve the outcome of this often blinding infection.
TI  - Diagnostic real-time PCR assays for the detection of emetic Bacillus cereus strains in foods and recent food-borne outbreaks.
AB  - Cereulide-producing Bacillus cereus can cause an emetic type of food-borne disease that mimics the symptoms provoked by Staphylococcus aureus. Based on the recently discovered genetic background for cereulide formation, a novel 5' nuclease (TaqMan) real-time PCR assay was developed to provide a rapid and sensitive method for the specific detection of emetic B. cereus in food. The TaqMan assay includes an internal amplification control and primers and a probe designed to target a highly specific part of the cereulide synthetase genes. Additionally, a specific SYBR green I assay was developed and extended to create a duplex SYBR green I assay for the one-step identification and discrimination of the two emesis-causing food pathogens B. cereus and S. aureus. The inclusivity and exclusivity of the assay were assessed using a panel of 100 strains, including 23 emetic B. cereus and 14 S. aureus strains. Different methods for DNA isolation from artificially contaminated foods were evaluated, and established real-time assays were used to analyze two recent emetic food poisonings in southern Germany. One of the food-borne outbreaks included 17 children visiting a day care center who vomited after consuming a reheated rice dish, collapsed, and were hospitalized; the other case concerned a single food-poisoning incident occurring after consumption of cauliflower. Within 2 h, the etiological agent of these food poisonings was identified as emetic B. cereus by using the real-time PCR assay.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic diversity of Lactococcus lactis isolates from Batzos, a  Greek PDO raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - The genotypic and phenotypic variability of 40 Lactococcus lactis isolates obtained from three cheese-making trials of Batzos cheese made one in each, winter, spring and summer was investigated. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Results showed a high degree of heterogeneity among strains. According to PFGE data, all strains except one were clustered together (at a similarity level of approximately 50%) with the L. lactis subsp. lactis reference strain and eleven groups of isolates consisting of 2-8 strains each were distinguished. Plasmid profiling results revealed that there were eight isolates lacking plasmids and nine having unique plasmids. Twenty-three isolates were allocated into six groups. There was an interesting similarity between the plasmid profiling groups and those formed according to PFGE. Clustering of strains according to RAPD-PCR was in agreement with results obtained by both plasmid profiling and PFGE for the majority of the strains. In addition, results obtained by molecular methods indicate a grouping of most of the strains according to the season of cheese production. All strains inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7. Their ability to affect the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecalis was strain dependent. In 42.5% of the isolates high acidifying ability in milk after 24 h was recorded and these were isolates, mainly, from fresh cheese. The 75% of the isolates from winter cheese exhibited higher Lys- than Leu-aminopeptidase activity while the approximately 67% of the isolates from summer cheese showed higher Leu- than Lys-aminopeptidase activity. Their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for 24 h was significant with preference for alpha(s)-casein degradation. The majority (90%) of the strains formed methanethiol from methionine and this ability was strain dependent. These results suggest that among the wild lactococcal population from Batzos cheese there are interesting strains appropriate to be used as starters for the dairy industry.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of garlic (Allium sativum) on growth of some microorganisms.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to compare between the anti-microbial activity of fresh garlic bulbs and that of its water extract against the potent food pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Esherichia coil, Salmonella typhi and Bacillus cereus. Garlic segments with different concentrations (1%, 5%, and 10%) were used. Another 100 gms of garlic segments were weighed and mixed with 100 ml distilled water to prepare water extract of garlic, then 1000, 500 and 100 microg/ml were prepared. These concentrations of garlic were mixed with prepared cultures of E. coli, Staph. aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella typhi. The inhibitory effect of garlic was determined using Spectrophotometer for garlic segments and by comparing with control plates for the water extract of garlic. Results showed that the higher the garlic concentration, the higher was the microbial reduction percent. Water extract of garlic exhibited a higher microbial reduction percentage than fresh garlic.
TI  - Antimicrobial and cytotoxic knotwood extracts and related pure compounds and their effects on food-associated microorganisms.
AB  - Knotwood or bark extracts prepared from 30 species of hard and soft wood trees as well as selected pure compounds (lignans, stilbenes and flavonoids) were assayed for their antimicrobial activity against a battery of both gram positive and negative bacteria, yeasts, and filamentous fungi (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus plantarum, Escherichia coli, Salmonella infantis, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicillium brevicompactum). By far the most consistent antibacterial and antifungal properties were associated with extracts of Pinus species. These extracts showed also cytotoxicity against a mouse hepatoma cell line. Both antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties correlated with the stilbene content of the extracts. Purified stilbenes showed the most consistent antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, while purified lignans had marginal effects, only. The results suggest that stilbenes account both for the antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties of Pinus knotwood extracts.
TI  - Survival and growth of foodborne pathogens during cooking and storage of oriental-style rice cakes.
AB  - Fresh cooked rice cakes for retail sale are typically held at room temperature because refrigeration dramatically reduces their quality. Room temperature, high water activity, and a pH of > 4.6 provided an environment conducive to pathogen growth. To date, no studies have been published regarding survival and growth of foodborne pathogens in fresh cooked rice cakes. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of steam cooking on foodborne pathogens and their subsequent growth in five varieties of rice cakes made from flours of regular rice, sweet rice, white rice, tapioca, and mung bean. Bacillus cereus spores were detected in white rice, tapioca, and mung bean samples. The rice cake flours were inoculated with non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus) or spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus cereus) and steam cooked (100 degrees C) for 30 min. Steam cooking significantly reduced (> 6 log CFU/g) non-spore-forming foodborne pathogens in all samples and inactivated spores of B. cereus by 1 to 2 log CFU/g. Although spores of B. cereus survived steam cooking and germinated during 3 days of storage at room temperature, populations in most rice cakes remained below 106 CFU/g, which is the threshold for producing toxin. Rice cakes made from mung bean flour supported growth and germination of B. cereus spores above that critical level. In mung bean rice cakes, enterotoxin production was detected by the second day, when B cereus cell populations reached about 6.9 log CFU/g. The toxin concentration increased with storage time. However, our results suggest that rapid growth of total mesophilic microorganisms by more than 7 to 8 log CFU/ml during the first day of storage produced off flavors and spoilage before B. cereus was able to grow enough to produce toxins. Therefore, steam-cooked rice cakes made from a variety of flours including mung bean flour are safe for sale for up to 1 day after storage at room temperature and are free of B. cereus toxins.
TI  - Microbial composition in bioaerosols of a high-throughput chicken-slaughtering facility.
AB  - The microbial composition of the air in various areas of a high-throughput chicken-slaughtering facility was investigated. Over a 4-mo period, 6 processing areas were sampled, and the influence of environmental factors was monitored. The highest counts of microorganisms were recorded in the initial stages of processing, comprising the receiving-killing and defeathering areas, whereas counts decreased toward the evisceration, air-chilling, packaging, and dispatch areas. Maximum microbial counts were as follows: coliforms, 4.9 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); Escherichia coli 3.4 x 10(3) cfu/m(3); Bacillus cereus, 5.0 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Staphylococcus aureus, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 7.0 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); presumptive Salmonella spp., 1.5 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); Listeria monocytogenes, 1.6 x 10(4) cfu/m(3); and fungi, 1.4 x 10(4) cfu/m(3). Higher counts of airborne microorganisms found in the receiving-killing and defeathering areas indicate the importance of controlling microbial levels before processing to prevent the spread of organisms downstream. This should limit the risk of carrying over contaminants from areas known to generate high counts to areas where the final food product is exposed to air and surface contamination.
TI  - Computer aided boar semen motility analysis for cereulide detection in different  food matrices.
AB  - Computer Aided Semen Analysis (CASA) study of the boar semen motility has been demonstrated to be an appropriate assay for detection of cereulide (Bacillus cereus emetic toxin). Application of the boar semen bio-assay to detect cereulide directly in foods requires investigation of potential interference of food components, preservatives and other microbial and chemical food contaminants with the bio-assay. Current study provides evidence that none of included Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins A, B, C and D nor B. cereus Hemolysin BL (HBL) and non-hemolytic enterotoxin (NHE) and three mycotoxins (Sterigmatocystin, Fumonisin B1 and Patulin) exhibited a toxic impact on semen progressive motility. Aflatoxin M1, M3 and zearalenone impaired semen motility only at concentrations (0.004 mg ml(-1), 0.1 mg ml(-1) and 10 mg ml(-1), respectively) much higher than those found in foods and those permitted by legislation, in comparison to cereulide which induces motility cease at concentrations lower than 20 ng ml(-1). Ten commonly used preservatives, namely potassium sorbate, sodium benzoate, (DL) malic acid, citric acid, (L+) tartaric acid, acetic acid, (DL) lactic acid, (L+) ascorbic acid, sodium chloride and sucrose induced no cease in spermatozoa motility even at preservative concentrations higher than permitted by legislation. Dioxins, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and acrylamide had no acute effect on spermatozoa motility at concentrations of 500 and 10,000 mg ml(-1), respectively. Robustness of computer aided boar semen motility analysis, tested with 14 different foods inoculated with cereulide producing B. cereus, showed distinct cereulide production in seven samples (although B. cereus growth to counts higher than 8 log CFU g(-1) was noted in 11 samples), in amounts close to those reported in foodborne outbreaks. Test evaluation in 33 samples suspected to hold cereulide showed actual cereulide presence in ten samples and no interference of food matrix with the assay.
TI  - Microflora of minimally processed frozen vegetables sold in Gaborone, Botswana.
AB  - Two hundred samples of minimally processed, frozen, and prepacked potato chips, peas, corn, and a variety of combined vegetables from supermarkets in Gaborone, Botswana, were examined microbiologically. Determination of aerobic mesophilic plate count, aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, yeasts and molds, coliforms, Listeria spp., and Staphylococcus aureus were done. Chips had the lowest mean log values for all of the microorganisms enumerated except yeasts and molds. The mean log values for single vegetables ranged from 3.6 to 9.1, 3.4 to 8.9, 2.9 to 5.6, and 2.1 to 6.5 log CFU/ g aerobic mesophilic plate count, aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, and yeasts and molds, respectively. The microbial profiles of peas and corn were almost similar (P < 0.001). The mean values for combined vegetables were clustered within 4.6 and 5.4 and 4.2 and 5.2 log CFU/g aerobic mesophilic plate count and aerobic psychrotrophic plate count, respectively. All of the vegetables had a coliform population distribution ranging from 0 to < 10(4) most probable number per g. The predominant gram-negative bacteria isolated included members of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonaceae (86.2%). Escherichia coli was not detected in all of the samples. The organisms isolated included those responsible for spoilage in frozen vegetables, namely Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Corynebacterium, lactic acid bacteria, and Flavobacterium. The predominant lactic acid bacteria were Lactobacillus spp. (55.9%). Other spoilage organisms were yeasts, and Cryptococcus spp. (55.4%) was predominant. Pathogens, namely Listeria monocytogenes, were also isolated at a rate of 2 to 10%, of which 4% was from corn, 2% each from peas and country crop, and 10% from stir-fry. Bacillus cereus was also isolated and accounted for 7.7% of the microorganisms from corn. S. aureus was isolated from all of the vegetables. Enterotoxigenic strains were from corn, peas, mixed vegetables, and stir-fry, and all of them produced enterotoxin A. In addition, the isolates from stir-fry vegetables also produced enterotoxins B and C. The study reveals the presence of pathogens and emerging opportunistic pathogens in the ready-to-use or ready-to-eat vegetables. If E. coli is the only indicator for safety and acceptability, consumers may be exposed to foodborne diseases. Inclusion of other groups as indicator organisms is suggested. Retailers are urged to invest in standby generators to maintain the cold chain.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of 1-(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline derivatives.
AB  - Several 1-(4-aryl-2-thiazolyl)-3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-2-pyrazoline derivatives were synthesized by reacting substituted 3-(2-thienyl)-5-aryl-1-thiocarbamoyl-2-pyrazolines with phenacyl bromides in ethanol. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, and EIMS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Staphylococcus aureus (NRLL B-767), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Streptococcus faecalis (NRRL B-14617), Aeromonas hydrophila (Ankara Uni. Fac. of Veterinary), Candida albicans and Candida glabrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac. of Medicine) were investigated. A significant level of activity was observed.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of antibiotic resistance determinants in Bacillus anthracis and closely related Bacillus cereus.
AB  - We developed a multiplex PCR for amplification of ten genes involved in resistance to ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, rifampin, and vancomycin in Bacillus anthracis and closely related Bacillus cereus. Enzymatic labelling of PCR products followed by hybridization to oligonucleotide probes on a DNA microarray enabled simultaneous detection of resistance genes tetK, tetL, tetM, tetO, vanA, and vanB and resistance-mediating point mutations in genes gyrA, gyrB, parC, and rpoB. The presented assay allows detection of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance determinants within 4h and can be used as a time-saving tool supporting conventional culture-based diagnostics.
TI  - The effect of lemon, orange and bergamot essential oils and their components on the survival of Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus in vitro and in food systems.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effectiveness of oils and vapours of lemon (Citrus limon), sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and bergamot (Citrus bergamia) and their components against a number of common foodborne pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: The disc diffusion method was used to screen the oils and vapours against Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157 and Campylobacter jejuni. The survival of each species, demonstrated to be susceptible in the in vitro studies, was tested on cabbage leaf for 60 s by direct contact and on chicken skin for 10 min by direct contact and 24 h by vapour. The results indicate that bergamot was the most inhibitory essential oil (EO) and citral and linalool mimicked its effect (P > 0.001). Citral and linalool vapours produced 6 log reductions in L. monocytogenes, Staph. aureus and B. cereus populations on cabbage leaf after 8-10 h exposure but bergamot vapour exposure, while producing a similar reduction in L. monocytogenes and B. cereus populations, had no effect on Staph. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Bergamot was the most effective of the oils tested and linalool the most effective anti-bacterial component. Gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than Gram-negative bacteria in vitro, although Camp. jejuni and E. coli O157 were inhibited by bergamot and linalool oils and by linalool vapour. All bacteria tested were less susceptible in food systems than in vitro. Of the Gram-positive bacteria tested Staph. aureus was the least susceptible to both the oils and the components tested. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results suggest the possibility that citrus EOs, particularly bergamot, could be used as a way of combating the growth of common causes of food poisoning.
TI  - Antimicrobial emulsion (coating) based on biopolymer containing neem (Melia azardichta) and turmeric (Curcuma longa) extract for wound covering.
AB  - Polymeric bio-adhesives emulsion which is biodegradable and non-toxic containing  antimicrobial agents can play an important role in preventing infection in wound covering and coating for surgical implants. Therefore a bioadhesive polymer was synthesized by semi-Interpenetrating Network process using blend of shellac, casein and polyvinyl alcohol and Maleic anhydride (MA) as reactive compatibilizer. The synthesized polymer was mixed with neem and turmeric extract and homogenized using an emulsifier. Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to measure the molecular miscibility of biopolymer components and emulsion constituents. Stability of emulsion (coating) was measured by keeping property and accelerated stability test. Antimicrobial properties were evaluated for human pathogenic organisms namely E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Salmonella typhimurium using well diffusion assay. The results indicate that stability, miscibility and antimicrobial properties of bioadhesive was satisfactory, however further in vivo studies are required to ascertain suitability of emulsion (coating) for biomedical use.
TI  - Table olives from Portugal: phenolic compounds, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The phenolic compounds composition, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial activity of different table olives from Portugal, namely, natural black olives "Galega", black ripe olive "Negrinha de Freixo", Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) "Azeitona de Conserva Negrinha de Freixo" olives, and "Azeitona de Conserva de Elvas e Campo Maior" Designation of Origin (DO) olives, were investigated. The analysis of phenolic compounds was performed by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and seven compounds were identified and quantified: hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol, 5-O-caffeoilquinic acid, verbascoside, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, rutin, and luteolin. The antioxidant activity was assessed by the reducing power assay, the scavenging effect on DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) radicals, and the beta-carotene linoleate model system. The antioxidant activity was correlated with the amount of phenolics found in each sample. The antimicrobial activity was screened using Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans). PDO and DO table olives revealed a wide range of antimicrobial activity. C. albicans was resistant to all the analyzed extracts.
TI  - Metalloantibiotics: synthesis, characterization and in-vitro antibacterial studies on cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes with cloxacillin.
AB  - The synthesis and characterization of cloxacillin (clox) complexes with divalent  metal ions [Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II)] is described. The nature of bonding of the chelated cloxacillin and the structures of the metal complexes have been elucidated on the basis of their physical and spectroscopic data. In all the complexes, the cloxacillin acts as a uninegatively charged bidentate ligand with coordination involving the carboxylate-O and endocyclic-N of the beta-lactam ring. The new compounds have been screened for in-vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli (a), Klebsiella pneumonae (b), Proteus mirabilis (c), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (d), Salmonella typhi (e), Shigella dysentriae (f), Bacillus cereus (g), Corynebacterium diphtheriae (h), Staphylococcus aureus (j) and Streptococcus pyogenes (k) bacterial strains. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in-vitro cytotoxic properties. All compounds, respectively, showed a promising activity (90%) against five bacterial species at 10 microg/ml concentration and a significant activity (52%) against the same test bacteria at 25 microg/ml concentration.
TI  - Rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time PCR.
AB  - Buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as PCR, and to prevent false-positive results due to DNA originating from dead cells. Applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus O3K6, Vibrio vulnificus, Providencia alcalifaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. This method can be used prior to real-time quantitative PCR (RTi-qPCR) and viable-cell counting. Using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations as low as 10(1) to 10(3) CFU/g using the RTi-qPCR assay, and amounts as small as 10(0) to 10(1) CFU/g could be isolated using plate counting. The combined separation and concentration methods and RTi-qPCR confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) CFU/g of Salmonella and C. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of S. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. These results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of chemical races of the lichen Pseudevernia furfuracea and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the ethanol, chloroform, diethyl ether, and acetone extracts of the chemical races of Pseudevernia furfuracea (var. furfuracea and var. ceratea) and their physodic acid, chloroatranorin, atranorin, and olivetoric acid constituents have been investigated against some microorganisms. Nearly all extracts of both chemical races showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, Alternaria alternata, Ascochyta rabiei, Aspergillus niger, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium moniliforme, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, and Penicillium notatum. There was no antimicrobial activity of the extracts against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas syringae, Salmonella typhimurium, Alternaria citri, Alternaria tenuissima, and Gaeumannomyces graminis. Chloroatranorin and olivetoric acid were active against the same microorganisms with few exceptions. Physodic acid was active against about the same bacteria and yeasts and inactive against all of the filamentous fungi tested. Also no activity of atranorin against the filamentous fungi was observed.
TI  - Evaluation of the hygienic quality and associated public health hazards of raw milk marketed by smallholder dairy producers in the Dar es Salaam region, Tanzania.
AB  - A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3%), Bacillus cereus (6.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6%) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7%). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0% were positive to the CMT and 7.0% were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p < 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p < or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.
TI  - Phenolics and antimicrobial activity of traditional stoned table olives 'alcaparra'.
AB  - In the present work, we report the determination of phenolic compounds in 'alcaparra' table olives by reversed-phase HPLC/DAD, and the evaluation of their extract in vitro activity against several microorganisms that may be causal agents of human intestinal and respiratory tract infections, namely Gram positive (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus), Gram negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) and fungi (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). Three flavonoidic compounds were identified and quantified: luteolin 7-O-glucoside, apigenin 7-O-glucoside, and luteolin. At low concentrations (0.05mg/mL) 'alcaparra' extract revealed significant inhibition of both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria growth, with exception of P. aeruginosa. Nevertheless, no antifungal activity was observed at the tested concentrations.
TI  - A comparison of three rapid bacterial detection methods under simulated real-life conditions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial screening of all produced platelet concentrates (PCs) is implemented in many countries to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted sepsis. This study compares three rapid bacterial detection methods by imitating real-life conditions. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The sensitivity of a solid-phase scanning cytometer (optimized Scansystem, Hemosystem), fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and 16S RNA in-house nucleic acid testing (NAT) was evaluated by spiking PCs with four transfusion relevant bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli ). Two different inocula (10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL and 10 CFUs/bag) were used to simulate real-life conditions. Samples were taken at 12, 16, 20, and 24 hours after spiking. RESULTS: With the high inoculum, NAT had a 100 percent rate of positive testing for all four types of bacteria (10/10 replicates) at each time point. With the exception of E. coli, the sensitivity of FACS and optimized Scansystem was comparable for the high inoculum. With the low inoculum, 60 percent of E. coli, 80 percent of B. cereus, 90 percent of K. pneumoniae, and 100 percent of S. aureus were NAT-positive 12 hours after spiking. In contrast, only 20 percent of E. coli, 10 percent of B. cereus, and 70 percent of K. pneumoniae were FACS-positive with the low inoculum 12 hours after spiking. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, the preliminary data revealed a higher sensitivity for NAT in comparison to FACS and optimized Scansystem under the defined study conditions. To imitate real-life conditions, further spiking studies with a low inoculum (10 CFUs/bag) and slower growing organisms should be conducted to examine the sensitivity of available detection systems.
TI  - Bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  - Between April 2000 and May 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. Two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by Gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to Gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. Of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were Bacillus licheniformis, three were Bacillus cereus and two were Bacillus pumilus. Seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. B. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. This outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. B. cereus and B. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but B. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except for quinolones and vancomycin. Two deaths were observed. In conclusion, Bacillus spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. Both B. cereus and B. licheniformis may be among the 'new' Gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Xanthoparmelia pokornyi and its  gyrophoric and stenosporic acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the diethyl ether, acetone, chloroform, petroleum ether, and ethanol extracts of the lichen Xanthoparmelia pokornyi and its gyrophoric acid and stenosporic acid constituents has been screened against some foodborne bacteria and fungi. Both the extracts and the acids showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. The extracts were inactive against the tested filamentous fungi. The MIC values of the extracts and the acids for the bacteria have also been determined.
TI  - Isolation of bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus plantarum strains from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso.
AB  - A collection of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ben saalga, a traditional fermented gruel from Burkina Faso, was screened for bacteriocin production. Seven isolates were selected for their broad antimicrobial spectra, which overall included strains of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cluster analysis of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed that six of the isolates represent different strains. The six selected strains were identified as Lactobacillus plantarum by 16S rDNA sequencing, species-specific PCR and multiplex PCR of the recA gene. PCR amplification revealed the presence of genes of the plantaricin cluster described in L. plantarum C11. Among them, strain 5.2.2 carried the largest number of genes from this cluster.
TI  - Microbiological transformation of two labdane diterpenes, the main constituents of Madia species, by two fungi.
AB  - Microbial transformation of 13R,14R,15-trihydroxylabd-7-ene (5) and 13R,14R,15-trihydroxylabd-8(17)-ene (6) by the fungus Debaryomyces hansenii gave 1 (13R,14R,15-trihydroxy-6-oxolabd-8-ene) and 3 (7alpha,13R,14R,15-tetrahydroxy-labd-8(17)-ene), respectively. While, microbial transformation of 5 by Aspergillus niger afforded 2 (3beta,13R,14R,15-tetrahydroxy-labd-7-ene), and 13R,14R,15-trihydroxylabd-8,17-ene (6) gave 3 and 4 (3R,14R,15-3-oxotetrahydroxy-labd-7-ene). The structures of the new compounds, 1 and 2, were assigned by 1D and 2D high-field NMR spectroscopic methods. Antimicrobial activity of these compounds were tested and their MIC were determined.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of silver-doped phosphate-based glasses.
AB  - In this study a range of phosphate-based glasses (PBG) doped with silver have been investigated for their antimicrobial activities. In disk diffusion assays, these compositions demonstrated microbistatic effects against a range of organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. The data obtained from the above studies allowed for an additional range of PBG containing lower amounts of silver to be studied for their effects on the growth and viability of S. aureus, E. coli, and C. albicans. PBG containing 3 and 5 mol % Ag were bactericidal for S. aureus and E. coli and significantly decreased the growth rate of C. albicans. A decrease in the dissolution rates of the glasses was seen with increasing Ag content over the range of concentrations investigated. Overall, 3 mol % Ag incorporated into the PBG investigated was sufficient to mount a potent antibacterial effect against the test organisms, and these compositions also gave excellent long-term release of Ag ions into the medium.
TI  - Cytotoxic, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Varthemia iphionoides Boiss. extracts.
AB  - The hexane, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol and water extracts of aerial parts of Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides, were investigated for cytotoxic activity against human myelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells; DPPH radical-scavenging activity; antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system; reducing power; antibacterial activity; the contents of phenolic compounds. A pronounced cytotoxic effect on human leukemia (HL-60) cells was shown in the hexane, chloroform and ethanol extracts, with inhibition of 89.0, 68.4 and 62.3%, respectively, at a concentration of 200 microg extract/ml. High DPPH radical-scavenging activity, antioxidative activity in the linoleic acid system and reducing power were found in the water and ethanol extracts, and were correlated to the contents of phenolic compounds. Antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides was shown in the ethyl acetate and chloroform extracts. A compound responsible for the antibacterial activity was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract, and identified as 3-oxocostusic acid.
TI  - Berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 Nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. The most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were Helicobacter pylori and Bacillus cereus. Campylobacter jejuni and Candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. Cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. However, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent Salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas Staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. Phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined Salmonella strains as indicated by 1-N-phenylnaphthylamine (NPN) uptake increase and analysis of liberation of [14C]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. Gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested Salmonella strains, and significant increase in the NPN uptake was recorded. The stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using Escherichia coli and nonvirulent Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium. The amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. Cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.
TI  - Bioassay-guided purification and identification of antimicrobial components in Chinese green tea extract.
AB  - The Chinese green tea extract was found to strongly inhibit the growth of major food-borne pathogens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium DT104, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and a diarrhoea food-poisoning pathogen Bacillus cereus, by 44-100% with the highest activity found against S. aureus and lowest against E. coli O157:H7. A bioassay-guided fractionation technique was used for identifying the principal active component. A simple and efficient reversed-phase high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) method was developed for the separation and purification of four bioactive polyphenol compounds, epicatechin gallate (ECG), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin (EC), and caffeine (CN). The structures of these polyphenols were confirmed with mass spectrometry. Among the four compounds, ECG and EGCG were the most active, particularly EGCG against S. aureus. EGCG had the lowest MIC90 values against S. aureus (MSSA) (58 mg/L) and its methicilin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (37 mg/L). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) studies showed that these two compounds altered bacterial cell morphology, which might have resulted from disturbed cell division. This study demonstrated a direct link between the antimicrobial activity of tea and its specific polyphenolic compositions. The activity of tea polyphenols, particularly EGCG on antibiotics-resistant strains of S. aureus, suggests that these compounds are potential natural alternatives for the control of bovine mastitis and food poisoning caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro antimicrobial studies of medicinally important novel N-alkyl and N-sulfonyl derivatives of 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]piperazine.
AB  - A series of novel substituted 1-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)-methyl]piperazine derivatives (4a-g) and (5h-m) have been synthesized. The synthesized compounds were characterized by IR and 1H NMR. All the synthesized compounds were evaluated in vitro for their efficacy as antimicrobial agents against representative strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25953, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, Bacillus cereus 11778, and Bacillus subtilis 6051) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 2853, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 2853, and Salmonella typhi ATCC 9484) by paper disc diffusion and microdilution methods. Among the newly synthesized compounds 4e, 5l, and 5m showed potent antimicrobial activities, when compared to the standard drug.
TI  - Biochemical characteristics of chitosanase from the Indonesian Bacillus licheniformis MB-2.
AB  - Bacillus licheniformis MB-2, isolated from a hot spring water in Manado, Indonesia, secreted a unique chitosanase. Media consisted of 0.24% chitosan, 0.25% casiton, 1% MgSO4, 1.4% K2HPO4, 0.02% CaCl2 x 2H2O, 0.002% FeSO4 x 7H2O (w/v) was used for enzyme production. Purification of the enzyme through the hydrophobic interaction chromatography system (butyl Sepharose 4 FF) resulted in two major active fractions; the F2 fraction was shown as a single band at both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and zymogram analysis with apparent molecular mass of 75 kDa. The enzyme worked best at 70 degrees C and pH between 6.0 and 7.0. When incubated at 70, 80, and 90 degrees , the t(1/2) values were 26.56, 18.44, and 16.74 min, respectively with the k constant being at 0.026, 0.037, and 0.04/min. When heated at 90 degrees C, the enzyme retained its activity up to 8 h in the presence of 1 mM MnCl2. The enzyme's activity was unaffected by the presence of 1 M NaCl and 6 M urea but was decreased by 2 M of guanidine hydrochloride. Albeit the enzyme did not degrade colloidal and glycol chitin, it hydrolyzed glycol chitosan up to 0.8% and colloidal chitosan up to 11%. The 85% deacetylated (DDA) soluble chitosan was the most susceptible to this enzyme, followed by 90% and 100% DDA chitosan. The K(m app) values of the 85, 90, and 100% DDA soluble chitosans were found as 0.23, 0.24, and 0.58 mg/mL, whereas the Vmax values were 843, 668, and 261 U/mg, respectively. The hydrolysis products of F2 chitosanase at 24 h incubation (70 degrees C) were pentasaccharide (GlcN)5 and hexasaccharide (GlcN)6. The preliminary test showed inhibitory effect of chitooligosaccharides resulted from enzymatic degradation toward Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Elimination and multiplication of bacteria during preparation and storage of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of bacterial contamination of random-donor platelet concentrates (PCs) is considerably lower than that of blood donations. Which key steps of the preparation procedure contribute to the elimination of bacteria was investigated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Ten bacteria species were used. Blood donations were spiked with bacteria and stored at 22 degrees C for 8 hours. The buffy coats were kept for 6 hours. PCs were prepared from pools of 4 buffy coats. At each preparation step and during PC storage, bacteria contents were measured. In additional experiments, the titers of spiked blood and buffy coats were determined after storage at 20, 22, or 24 degrees C for 8 and up to 24 hours, respectively. RESULTS: Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica were completely inactivated during storage in blood or buffy coats. Titer reduction was between 3.32 and 4.62 log. Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis did not multiply. Compared with their values in spiked blood the titers in the PCs were reduced by 1.7 to 2.8 log. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the only species that grew in blood. With the exception of P. acnes, those species that were not removed by the preparation process multiplied in the PCs. Remarkable donor-to-donor variations of the bactericidal activities of buffy coats were detected when the storage time was prolonged to 24 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Bacteria are significantly eliminated by the preparation procedure for random donor PCs. Also, blood and buffy coats are bactericidal for most species. When buffy-coat storage is prolonged, it cannot, however, be predicted whether specific strains vanish or multiply.
TI  - Evolution of surveillance methods for detection of bacterial contamination of platelets in a university hospital, 1991 through 2004.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet (PLT) bacterial contamination (PBC) is the most common transfusion-associated infection. It is important to understand the impact of interventions addressing this problem. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PBC was studied by prospective (active) and transfusion-reaction triggered (passive) surveillance from July 1991 to December 2004. Active surveillance, utilized for 10 years, included bacterial culture of all or 4- and 5-day-old PLTs at issue and intermittent use of Gram stain, pH measurements, and early (24-hr) culture of single-donor plateletpheresis (SDP) units. RESULTS: Active surveillance detected 38 instances of PBC, 7 in SDP units (1:2213) and 31 in random-donor PLT units (1:2090 units, p = 0.89; or 1:418 pools of 5 units, p < 0.001). Contaminants were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS; n = 27), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Bacillus cereus (1), Serratia marcescens (2), streptococci (2 S. bovis, 1 S. uberis), and CONS with viridans group streptococcus (1). Only one instance of contamination, caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was detected by passive surveillance, with fatal outcome. Colony counts of contaminants ranged from 0.5 x 10(2) to 4 x 10(11) colony-forming units per mL at time of issue. PBC was interdicted before transfusion in 6 cases through Gram stain screening. Transfusion reactions occurred in 13 of 32 recipients (41%), with 9 severe reactions (28%) and 3 deaths (9%). pH testing failed to detect 5 contaminated units and resulted in discard of nearly 2 percent of units, whereas culture of SDP units at 24 hours failed to identify a contaminated unit. CONCLUSION: Improved active surveillance methods for detecting PBC are needed to improve the safety of PLT transfusions.
TI  - Search for antibacterial and antifungal agents from selected Indian medicinal plants.
AB  - A series of 61 Indian medicinal plants belonging to 33 different families used in various infectious disorders, were screened for their antimicrobial properties. Screening was carried out at 1000 and 500 microg/ml concentrations by agar dilution method against Bacillus cereus var mycoides, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Twenty-eight plant extracts showed activity against at least one of the test organisms used in the screening. On the basis of the results obtained, we conclude that the crude extracts of Dorema ammoniacum, Sphaeranthus indicus, Dracaena cinnabari, Mallotus philippinensis, Jatropha gossypifolia, Aristolochia indica, Lantana camara, Nardostachys jatamansi, Randia dumetorum and Cassia fistula exhibited significant antimicrobial activity and properties that support folkloric use in the treatment of some diseases as broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. This probably explains the use of these plants by the indigenous people against a number of infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of saponins from Medicago sp.: structure-activity relationship.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of saponins from Medicago sativa, M. arborea and M. arabica against a selection of medically important yeasts, Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was investigated. Structure-activity growth inhibitory effects of related prosapogenins and sapogenins are also described. Increasing antibiotic activity was observed going from the saponin extracts to the sapogenin samples, suggesting that the sugar moiety is not important for the antimicrobial efficacy. Activity was especially high against Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis) with M. arabica being the species showing a broader spectrum of action. Discrete antifungal activity was also observed, mainly against Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The observed antimicrobial properties of M. sativa and M. arborea were related to the content of medicagenic acid, while hederagenin seems to contribute to the bioactivity of M. arabica total sapogenins.
TI  - Bioactive principles in the bark of Pilidiostigma tropicum.
AB  - The crude dichloromethane bark extract of Pilidiostigma tropicum (Myrtaceae) from north Queensland, Australia, shows antibacterial and cytotoxic activity. Bioactivity-directed separation led to the isolation of rhodomyrtoxin B and ursolic acid-3-p-coumarate as the biologically active materials. The structures of these compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectral analysis. The intercalation interaction of rhodomyrtoxin B with DNA was investigated using molecular mechanics and ab initio molecular-orbital techniques. A favorable pi-pi interaction between rhodomyrtoxin B and the cytosine-guanine base pair is predicted, but the orientation of the interaction cannot be predicted based on frontier molecular orbitals.
TI  - Antimicrobial, wound healing and antioxidant activity of Plagiochasma appendiculatum Lehm. et Lind.
AB  - Plagiochasma appendiculatum (Aytoniaceae) of the order Marchantiales is widely used in the form of paste ethnomedicinally by Gaddi tribe in Kangra valley for treating skin diseases. In this context, antimicrobical potential of Plagiochasma appendiculatum against a wide range of microorganisms was studied. To validate the ethnotherapeutic claims of the plant in skin diseases, wound healing activity was studied, besides antioxidant activity to understand the mechanism of wound healing activity. The plant (alchoholic and aqueous extract) showed significant antibacterial and antifungal activity against almost all the organisms: Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium, and eight fungi Candida albicans and Cryptococcus albidus-dimorphic fungi, Trichophyton rubrum-dermatophyte fungi, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus spinulosus, Aspergillus terreus and Aspergillus nidulans-systemic fungi, with especially good activity against the dermatophyte (Trichophyton rubrum) and some infectious bacteria (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Salmonella typhimurium) with an MIC of 2.5 microg/disc. The results show that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract has potent wound healing capacity as evident from the wound contraction and increased tensile strength. The results also indicated that Plagiochasma appendiculatum extract possesses potent antioxidant activity by inhibiting lipid peroxidation and increase in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase activity.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial, antifungal & cytotoxic activity of some isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases and their cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II) complexes.
AB  - Isonicotinoylhydrazide Schiff's bases formed by the reaction of substituted and unsubstituted furyl-2-carboxaldehyde and thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde with isoniazid and, their Co (II), Cu (II), Ni (II) and Zn (II) complexes have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani and Candida glabrata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal against one or more bacterial/fungal strains as compared to the uncomplexed compounds. The brine shrimp bioassay indicated Schiff's bases, L3 and L6 and, their Cu (II) and Ni (II) metal complexes to be cytotoxic against Artemia salina, while all other compounds were inactive (LD50 > 1000).
TI  - A newly developed assay to study the minimum inhibitory concentration of Satureja spinosa essential oil.
AB  - AIMS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Satureja spinosa essential oil against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Salmonella serovar Enteritidis PT4 and Bacillus cereus was comparatively assessed with an established optical density method as well as a novel impedimetric method. METHODS AND RESULTS: The impedimetric analysis takes into account information of microbial growth, such as detection time, maximum conductance, and slope of the conductance curve. For each pathogen two levels of inoculation were studied, a high (10(5) CFU ml(-1)) and a low level (10(2) CFU ml(-1)). Non-linear regression analysis was used to fit the data using a modification of a previously published model, from which a more exact value can be obtained for the MIC. Both methods gave similar MICs as shown by t-test statistical analysis. Salm. Enteritidis seems to be the least sensitive to the action of S. spinosa essential oil followed by L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B.cereus and Staph. aureus. The MICs of low inoculum were lower than that of high inoculum. CONCLUSIONS: The new impedimetric assay of MIC of essential oils can be considered a reliable rapid method for screening antimicrobial effectiveness of natural additives. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration of an essential oil with the simple conductance technique and further study of the mode of action of its components is a good combination for obtaining additional knowledge for industrial application of such natural additives.
TI  - [Laboratory-based evaluation of a selective X-SA agar medium supplemented with chromogenic substrate for Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - The newly developed culture medium, X-SA agar medium (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Tokyo) selective for Staphylococcus aureus was evaluated for its ability to detect clinical isolates of S. aureus. Besides S. aureus, X-SA agar media allowed the growth of coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus cereus and some isolates of corynebacteria. However, those species were easily distinguishable from the blue and convex colonies of S. aureus. When compared to the traditional egg yolk mannitol salt agar, selectivity for the species other than S. aureus was more specific, and growth support for S. aureus was more comparable to sheep blood agar. Also, when various phenotypic variants of S. aureus were inoculated, visible colonies of mucoid colony variants and attenuated growth variants on Mueller-Hinton agar appeared on X-SA agar plates after 24 hour-incubation, but it required 48 hour-incubation for small colony variants. The fully automated microbiology system, RAISUS (Nissui Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd.) gave comparable species-identification and antimicrobial susceptibility test results when cell suspension directly prepared from X-SA agar media was tested. However, species-identification for phenotypic variants of S. aureus was more complicated for RAISUS testing and detection of coagulase. With these results, it could be concluded that the X-SA agar medium supplemented with chromogenic substrate is superior to the traditional selective media for the detection of S. aureus, and is widely applicable for clinical microbiology as well as food microbiology.
TI  - Sterility testing of platelet concentrates prepared from deliberately infected blood donations.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In general the bacterial count in freshly donated blood is low and even lower in the corresponding platelet concentrates (PCs). By use of flow cytometry (FACS) for sterility testing, the reliability of early versus later sampling times was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Blood donations were spiked with various numbers of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The corresponding PCs were prepared by the buffy-coat method and stored at 22 degrees C. A 20-mL sample was collected from each PC directly after preparation and after 8 hours. Samples were stored at 35 degrees C. Sterility testing of both PCs and samples was by FACS analysis at different time points. RESULTS: All stored PCs were found positive by FACS analysis, with detection times ranging between 8 and 24 hours (K. pneumoniae, B. cereus), 8 and 91 hours (S. aureus), and 144 hours (S. epidermidis). In the samples incubated at 35 degrees C, bacteria were detected after 8 to 19 hours (K. pneumoniae, B. cereus), 8 to 67 hours (S. aureus), and 19 to 43 hours (S. epidermidis). Some of the samples did not contain bacteria. CONCLUSION: Detection times for slow-growing bacteria are significantly shortened when PC samples are incubated at 35 degrees C: the numbers of bacteria in freshly prepared PCs may, however, be so low that the samples drawn for sterility testing do not contain a single bacterium. Our results do not support a shortening of the 24-hour or greater sampling time recommended by the manufacturers of established test systems, because also for consistent detection by FACS, bacteria need to grow in the PCs to sufficient numbers.
TI  - Genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity in Enterococcus isolates from Batzos, a raw goat milk cheese.
AB  - This study investigated the genotypic and phenotypic diversity in 34 isolates of  enterococci obtained during ripening of Batzos cheese from raw goat milk and characterized phenotypically as Enterococcus durans. RAPD-PCR, plasmid profiling and PFGE were used to study the genetic variability and distinguish closely related isolates. Species recognition by means of RAPD-PCR was in agreement with the phenotypic identification for 29 strains. One strain was characterized as Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis by RAPD-PCR and four strains were grouped with the Enterococcus faecium reference strain. All strains were vancomycin sensitive, while 10 strains showed beta-haemolytic reaction on human blood and the majority of them (88.9%) showed decarboxylase activity on tyramine. All strains exhibited antagonistic activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Listeria monocytogenes and the majority inhibited Enterococcus faecalis. Isolates displayed weak acidifying ability and low proteolytic activities when grown in milk for 24h. However, their caseinolytic activity after growth in milk for seven days was significant with preference for alphas-casein degradation.
TI  - Evaluation of a GMP training of milkers in dairy goat farms in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
AB  - A good manufacturing practices (GMP) training course was applied for goat milkers and evaluated using microbiological analysis in milk before and after training. Milkers from three dairy goat farms located in Sao Paulo, Brazil, were submitted to a one-hour course on GMP and recommended guidelines for milking. Samples of raw milk were collected before and one to two months after training, and analysed for aerobic mesophilic, psychrotrophic, coliform, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp counts. Only mesophilic counts decreased (p < 0.05) after training in two of three farms studied. Although important to assess the overall quality of milk, microbiological parameters should not be used alone for the evaluation of GMP effectiveness for goat milkers.
TI  - Microbiological quality of randomly selected ready-to-eat foods sampled between 2003 and 2005 in Wales, UK.
AB  - Since 1995, the publicly funded ready-to-eat food sampling and examination activities in Wales have been coordinated and structured, using a novel approach for the identification of samples and premises. The latest set of data from this surveillance system reports the results from 3391 ready-to-eat foods sampled between November 2003 and March 2005. During this seventeen-month period all samples were examined for aerobic colony count, Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., Bacillus cereus, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. The food types with the poorest microbiological quality were cream cakes, custard slices and egg mayonnaise sandwiches. The food type with the best microbiological quality was dried fruit. In conclusion, the results indicate that, in general terms, the ready-to-eat food types sampled and examined in this period posed little bacterial hazard to consumers.
TI  - Bioactive natural and semisynthetic latrunculins.
AB  - Marine-derived macrolides latrunculins A and B, of the Red Sea sponge Negombata magnifica, are the first marine natural products that have been found to reversibly bind to actin monomers and to disrupt its organization. Latrunculins are structurally related to many antimicrobial and antiangiogenic macrolides. Several grams of latrunculin B (1), together with a new latrunculin named latrunculin T (2), were isolated from a recent collection of N. magnifica. Semisynthetic modifications of 1, including acetylation, acetalization, and N-hydroxymethylation, afforded four new (4, 5, 7, 8) and two known (6 and 9) semisynthetic analogues. Specifically, 15-O-methyllatrunculin B (6) showed a promising antiangiogenic activity in a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay and antimigratory activity in Boyden's chamber assay. Moreover, latrunculin B (1) and the new N-acetyllatrunculin B (4) displayed potent antimigratory activity in a wound-healing assay. Natural and semisynthetic latrunculins showed potent antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. Latrunculins are potential leads that can be developed as anticancer and antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Screening for antimicrobial activity of ten medicinal plants used in Colombian folkloric medicine: a possible alternative in the treatment of non-nosocomial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial activity and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the extracts of Bidens pilosa L., Bixa orellana L., Cecropia peltata L., Cinchona officinalis L., Gliricidia sepium H.B. & K, Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don, Justicia secunda Vahl., Piper pulchrum C.DC, P. paniculata L. and Spilanthes americana Hieron were evaluated against five bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus beta hemolitic, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli), and one yeast (Candida albicans). These plants are used in Colombian folk medicine to treat infections of microbial origin. METHODS: Plants were collected by farmers and traditional healers. The ethanol, hexane and water extracts were obtained by standard methods. The antimicrobial activity was found by using a modified agar well diffusion method. All microorganisms were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MIC was determined in the plant extracts that showed some efficacy against the tested microorganisms. Gentamycin sulfate (1.0 microg/ml), clindamycin (0.3 microg/ml) and nystatin (1.0 microg/ml) were used as positive controls. RESULTS: The water extracts of Bidens pilosa L., Jacaranda mimosifolia D.Don, and Piper pulchrum C.DC showed a higher activity against Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli than gentamycin sulfate. Similarly, the ethanol extracts of all species were active against Staphylococcus aureus except for Justicia secunda. Furthermore, Bixa orellana L, Justicia secunda Vahl. and Piper pulchrum C.DC presented the lowest MICs against Escherichia coli (0.8, 0.6 and 0.6 microg/ml, respectively) compared to gentamycin sulfate (0.9 8 g/ml). Likewise, Justicia secunda and Piper pulchrum C.DC showed an analogous MIC against Candida albicans (0.5 and 0.6 microg/ml, respectively) compared to nystatin (0.6 microg/ml). Bixa orellana L, exhibited a better MIC against Bacillus cereus (0.2 microg/ml) than gentamycin sulfate (0.5 microg/ml). CONCLUSION: This in vitro study corroborated the antimicrobial activity of the selected plants used in folkloric medicine. All these plants were effective against three or more of the pathogenic microorganisms. However, they were ineffective against Streptococcus beta hemolytic and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Their medicinal use in infections associated with these two species is not recommended. This study also showed that Bixa orellana L, Justicia secunda Vahl. and Piper pulchrum C.DC could be potential sources of new antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Dioxiranes generated in situ from pyruvates and oxone as environmentally friendly oxidizing agents for disinfection.
AB  - Dioxiranes generated in situ from pyruvates (alpha-keto esters) and Oxone have been found to be environmentally friendly oxidizing agents for disinfection. These oxidizing agents were highly effective for destruction of various strains of bacteria, fungi, and bacterial endospores in a wide temperature range with exceptional stability. Notably, by using an aqueous solution of methyl pyruvate (1a) and Oxone/NaHCO3, complete destruction of bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and fungus Penicillium corylophilum was achieved within 5 min at 20 degrees C at neutral pH. Highly chemical-resistant bacterial endospores of Bacillus cereus could also be destroyed. The high antibacterial activity of 1a could be attributed to its strong electron-withdrawing alpha-ester group.
TI  - Acceleration of epithelial cell syndecan-1 shedding by anthrax hemolytic virulence factors.
AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been recently reported that major pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accelerate a normal process of cell surface syndecan-1 (Synd1) ectodomain shedding as a mechanism of host damage due to the production of shedding-inducing virulence factors. We tested if acceleration of Synd1 shedding takes place in vitro upon treatment of epithelial cells with B. anthracis hemolysins, as well as in vivo during anthrax infection in mice. RESULTS: The isolated anthrax hemolytic proteins AnlB (sphingomyelinase) and AnlO (cholesterol-binding pore-forming factor), as well as ClnA (B. cereus homolog of B. anthracis phosphatidyl choline-preferring phospholipase C) cause accelerated shedding of Synd1 and E-cadherin from epithelial cells and compromise epithelial barrier integrity within a few hours. In comparison with hemolysins in a similar range of concentrations, anthrax lethal toxin (LT) also accelerates shedding albeit at slower rate. Individual components of LT, lethal factor and protective antigen are inactive with regard to shedding. Inhibition experiments favor a hypothesis that activities of tested bacterial shedding inducers converge on the stimulation of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases of the Syk family, ultimately leading to activation of cellular sheddase. Both LT and AnlO modulate ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways, while JNK pathway seems to be irrelevant to accelerated shedding. Accelerated shedding of Synd1 also takes place in DBA/2 mice challenged with Bacillus anthracis (Sterne) spores. Elevated levels of shed ectodomain are readily detectable in circulation after 24 h. CONCLUSION: The concerted acceleration of shedding by several virulence factors could represent a new pathogenic mechanism contributing to disruption of epithelial or endothelial integrity, hemorrhage, edema and abnormal cell signaling during anthrax infection.
TI  - Detection and identification of intestinal pathogenic bacteria by hybridization to oligonucleotide microarrays.
AB  - AIM: To detect the common intestinal pathogenic bacteria quickly and accurately.  METHODS: A rapid (<3 h) experimental procedure was set up based upon the gene chip technology. Target genes were amplified and hybridized by oligonucleotide microarrays. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy strains of bacteria in pure culture belonging to 11 genera were successfully discriminated under comparatively same conditions, and a series of specific hybridization maps corresponding to each kind of bacteria were obtained. When this method was applied to 26 divided cultures, 25 (96.2%) were identified. CONCLUSION: Salmonella sp., Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus sp., Bacillus cereus, Vibrio cholerae, Enterococcus faecalis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni can be detected and identified by our microarrays. The accuracy, range, and discrimination power of this assay can be continually improved by adding further oligonucleotides to the arrays without any significant increase of complexity or cost.
TI  - Exchange of glutamine-217 to glutamate of Clostridium limosum exoenzyme C3 turns  the asparagine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferase into an arginine-modifying enzyme.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferaseses are produced by Clostridium species, Bacillus cereus, and various Staphylococcus aureus strains. The exoenzymes modify the low-molecular-mass GTPases RhoA, B, and C. In structural studies of C3-like exoenzymes, an ARTT-motif (ADP-ribosylating turn-turn motif) was identified that appears to be involved in substrate specificity and recognition (Han, S., Arvai, A. S., Clancy, S. B., Tainer, J. A. (2001) J. Mol. Biol. 305, 95-107). Exchange of Gln217, which is a key residue of the ARTT-motif, to Glu in C3 from Clostridium limosum results in inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase activity toward RhoA. The mutant protein is still capable of NAD-binding and possesses NAD+ glycohydrolase activity. Whereas recombinant wild-type C3 modifies Rho proteins specifically at an asparagine residue (Asn41), Gln217Glu-C3 is capable of ADP-ribosylation of poly-arginine but not poly-asparagine. Soybean trypsin inhibitor, a model substrate for many arginine-specific ADP-ribosyltransferases, is modified by the Gln217Glu-C3 transferase. Also in C3 ADP-ribosyltransferases from Clostridium botulinum and B. cereus, the exchange of the equivalent Gln residue to Glu blocked asparagine modification of RhoA but elicited arginine-specific ADP-ribosylation. Moreover, the Gln217Glu-C3lim transferase was able to ADP-ribosylate recombinant wild-type C3lim at Arg86, resulting in decrease in ADP-ribosyltransferase activity of the wild-type enzyme. The data indicate that the exchange of one amino acid residue in the ARTT-motif turns the asparagine-modifying ADP-ribosyltransferases of the C3 family into arginine-ADP-ribosylating transferases.
TI  - Basics of flow cytometry-based sterility testing of platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Flow cytometry (FACS) is a common technique in blood banking. It is used, for example, for the enumeration of residual white blood cells in plasma and in cellular blood products. It was investigated whether it can also be applied for sterility testing of buffy coat-derived platelet concentrates (PCs). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Plasma-reduced PCs were spiked with bacteria and stored at 20 to 24 or 37 degrees C for various times. The following 10 species were used: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Bacterial DNA was stained with thiazole orange. After the platelets were lysed, bacteria were enumerated by FACS. RESULTS: All bacteria species used were detectable by FACS. The lower detection limit was approximately 100 bacteria per microL, that is, 10(5) per mL. In general, the titers measured were 1.2- to 3-fold higher than those determined by colony forming assay. In one case (K. pneumoniae) in which the dot plot of the bacteria cloud overlapped with that of bacteria debris, they were consistently lower. When PC samples were inoculated with approximately 1 colony-forming unit per mL of bacteria and kept at 37 degrees C, most species were detected within 21 hours or less. Exceptions were E. cloacae and P. acnes, which were detected after 24 to 40 and 64 hours, respectively. At 20 to 24 degrees C, the detection times were strongly prolonged. CONCLUSION: Sterility testing of PCs by FACS is a feasible approach. The present data suggest incubating PC samples for 20 to 24 hours at 37 degrees C before testing. For slow-growing bacteria, the incubation period must be prolonged by 1 to 2 days.
TI  - Antilisterial activity of grape juice and grape extracts derived from Vitis vinifera variety Ribier.
AB  - Grape juice and skin and seed extracts of Vitis vinifera var. Ribier black table  grapes were found to be highly inhibitory towards Listeria monocytogenes. This grape juice was also active against all other Listeria species tested but not against Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Menston, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Yersinia enterocolitica. Fractionation of the extracts showed that the antilisterial activity was strongest in the polymeric phenolic fractions. Two different types of active compounds were identified: the red-pigmented polymeric phenolics from juice and skin showed pH-dependent antilisterial activity, while the unpigmented polymeric phenolics from the seed showed antilisterial activity which was independent of pH.
TI  - Evaluation of antimicrobial activity of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis  (Mimosaceae).
AB  - Ethyl acetate (EA) extract of the stem bark of Cylicodiscus gabunensis (CG) was analysed phytochemically and evaluated for its antimicrobial activity against 17 pathogenic species isolated from patient: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Shigella flexneri, Morganella morganii, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella typhi, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter agglomerans, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus feacalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus T, Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Flavonoids, saponins, tannins, polyphenols, coumarins, triterpenes and/or sterols and reducing sugars were detected in the (EA) extract of CG. The best MIC and MBC values for the microorganisms sensitive to the extract were 0.00078 and 0.00315 mg/ml respectively. The greater and remarkable antimicrobial activity of the (EA) extract of CG was recorded with Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Bacillus cereus T. These results provide a rationalization for the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Purification and cytotoxic properties of Bacillus cereus hemolysin II.
AB  - The hemolysin II from Bacillus cereus, HlyII, is a member of the beta-barrel pore-forming toxin family of secreted microbial proteins that includes the Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin. Compared with other proteins of the family, hemolysin II has 90 extra amino acids at its C-terminus. To examine more closely the cytotoxic and pore-forming properties of the protein, we have cloned and expressed it in Escherichia coli. We developed a purification procedure for the matured HlyII protein from both culture media and cell extracts using a combination of cation exchange and affinity chromatography together with gel-filtration. In both cases, the fully processed HlyII protein was purified as confirmed by N-terminal sequence analysis. The HlyII protein exhibits cytolytic activity of different extent on erythrocytes from various kinds of mammals. The results presented here show for the first time that two types of human cells are sensitive to HlyII action. In view of its broad cytotoxic activity as well as the ability to interact with artificial membranes, we assume that HlyII needs no specific receptor to bind to cell membranes.
TI  - [Symptoms of food-borne diseases and gastroenteritis in Kyushu, Japan].
AB  - In this study we analyzed the symptoms of gastroenteritis or food-borne disease caused by the 10 most prevalent pathogens: Norovirus, Salmonella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium perfringens, Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), Shigella sonnei/flexneri (Shigella), Staphylococcus aureus, and emetic-type Bacillus cereus. The symptoms diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and headache, and the incubation period in 646 cases in 10 districts of Kyushu between January 2000 and December 2004 were recorded. The pathogen with the shortest mean incubation period was B. cereus (0.8 h), and was followed by S. aureus (3.3 h), C. perfringens (10.7 h) and V. parahaemolyticus (16.4 h). All the patients infected with B. cereus and S. aureus developed symptoms within 6 hours, and those infected with V. parahaemolyticus and C. perfringens developed symptoms within 24 hours. Bloody diarrhea was associated with STEC and Shigella, but rare with other pathogens. Vomiting was associated with almost all cases of S. aureus and B. cereus infection, and occurred in 71.5% of the Norovirus cases and 56.1% of the V. parahaemolyticus cases. Vomiting was less common in the C. perfringens (22.0%) and the ETEC and STEC (both about 5%). Bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were statistically significantly more common with STEC 0157 infection than with STEC non-0157 infection. Since the cases analyzed in this study included all degrees of illness, mild to severe, and a wide range of ages, the information obtained will serve as a good reference material for administrative and laboratory work when an outbreak takes place.
TI  - Determination of the antimicrobial properties of oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde.
AB  - Oligo-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldehyde (OHNA) was synthesized by oxidative polycondensation using H2O2 (35%, aqueous solution), air O2 and NaOCl (34%, aqueous solution) by Kaya and Senol and the products were characterized by spectral techniques. Antimicrobial activities of the first and second fractions of OHNA were tested against Corynobacterium xerosis CCM 2824, Proteus vulgaris ATCC 6897, Staphylococcus epidermidis NRRL B-4877, S. aureus ATCC 6538, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Salmonella thyphimurium CCM 5445, Pseudomonas aeroginosa ATCC 27853, Escherichia coli ATCC 11230, E. coli ATCC 23998, Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, B. cereus ATCC 99, B. subtilis ATCC 6633, Yersinia spp., Neisseria canis, Rhodotorula rubra, Kluyveromyces fragilis NRRL 2415, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 9763, S. ovarum, Debaryomyces hensenii, Hansenula anamola, Candida albicans, C. utilis, Aspergillus niger, A. fumigates, A. versicolor, A. flavus, A. parasiticus, Penicillium granulatum, P. chrysogenum, and P. herque. OHNA demonstrated antimicrobial activity against various bacteria and yeast, but did not affect filamentous fungi.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial and cytotoxic activity of cobalt (ii), copper (ii), nickel (ii) and zinc (ii) complexes of the antibiotic drug cephalothin (Keflin).
AB  - Keflin (kefl) interacts with Co(II), Cu(II), Ni(II) and Zn(II) metal ions leading to complexes of the type M(kefl)2Cl2 and M(kefl)Cl2, which have been characterized by physicochemical and spectroscopic methods. Magnetic moment, IR, electronic spectral and elemental analyses data suggest that keflin behaves tridentately forming octahedral or trigonal bipyramidal complexes with the metal ions mentioned above. The new compounds have been screened in-vitro for antibacterial and cytotoxic activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysentriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains. Compounds, 4 and 8 showed promising activity (90%) against seven, compound 6 showed significant activity (52%) against four and, compounds 1 and 5 showed activity (40%) against three test bacterial strains at concentration of 10 microM.
TI  - Efficient growth inhibition of Bacillus anthracis by knocking out the ribonucleotide reductase tyrosyl radical.
AB  - Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, is a worldwide problem because of the need for effective treatment of respiratory infections shortly after exposure. One potential key enzyme of B. anthracis to be targeted by antiproliferative drugs is ribonucleotide reductase. It provides deoxyribonucleotides for DNA synthesis needed for spore germination and growth of the pathogen. We have cloned, purified, and characterized the tyrosyl radical-carrying NrdF component of B. anthracis class Ib ribonucleotide reductase. Its EPR spectrum points to a hitherto unknown three-dimensional geometry of the radical side chain with a 60 degrees rotational angle of C(alpha)-(C(beta)-C(1))-plane of the aromatic ring. The unusual relaxation behavior of the radical signal and its apparent lack of line broadening at room temperature suggest a weak interaction with the nearby diiron site and the presence of a water molecule plausibly bridging the phenolic oxygen of the radical to a ligand of the diiron site. We show that B. anthracis cells are surprisingly resistant to the radical scavenger hydroxyurea in current use as an antiproliferative drug, even though its NrdF radical is efficiently scavenged in vitro. Importantly, the antioxidants hydroxylamine and N-methyl hydroxylamine scavenge the radical several orders of magnitude faster and prevent B. anthracis growth at several hundred-fold lower concentrations compared with hydroxyurea. Phylogenetically, the B. anthracis NrdF protein clusters together with NrdFs from the pathogens Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. We suggest the potential use of N-hydroxylamines in combination therapies against infections by B. anthracis and closely related pathogens.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of coumarins.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of coumarin per se and other 45 coumarin derivatives was tested against strains of Bacillus cereus MIP 96016, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. The inhibitory effects of coumarins were affected by their substitution patterns. Osthenol (44) showed the most effective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria with MIC values ranging between 125 and 62.5 microg/ml. These results suggested that the prenyl chain of 44 at position 8 and the presence of OH at position 7 of the benzenic ring are required for the antibacterial activity against these strains.
TI  - Differential activity of a lectin from Solieria filiformis against human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A lectin isolated from the red alga Solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). The lectin (500 microg/mL) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species Bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species Serratia marcescens, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus sp, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/mL but the lectin (10-1000 microg/mL) had no effect on the growth of the gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. It is possible that the interaction of S. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. Growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium B. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/mL. The stimulation of the growth of B. cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/mL), its hapten. Thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. The present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.
TI  - Use of oligonucleotide array for identification of six foodborne pathogens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on selective media.
AB  - Identification of presumptive foodborne pathogens grown on selective media may take one to several days and requires a different battery of biochemical tests for each microorganism. A molecular identification method was developed in which universal primers were used to amplify the 16S to 23S rDNA intergenic spacer of target microorganisms, and PCR products were hybridized to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides that were immobilized on a nylon membrane. The seven target microorganisms were Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. After testing a large collection of target bacteria (29 to 51 strains) and nontarget bacteria (> 500 strains), the performances (sensitivity and specificity) of the oligonucleotide array were as follows: B. cereus (100 and 77%), E. coli (100 and 100%), L. monocytogenes (100 and 90%), P. aeruginosa (100 and 100%), Salmonella (100 and 100%), S. aureus (100 and 100%), and V. parahaemolyticus (100 and 94.2%). Other species in the B. cereus group cross-hybridized to the probes used for identification of B. cereus, and positive results should be confirmed by additional morphological observation of colonies. Listeria innocua cross-reacted with probes used to identify L. monocytogenes, but a simple hemolysis test was used to differentiate the two species. Some strains of Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio mimicus cross-hybridized with probes used for identification of V. parahaemolyticus and caused false-positive reactions. The advantage of the array is that a common protocol was used to identify the seven target microorganisms and multiple different microorganisms could be simultaneously identified on a single array.
TI  - Stability of enterocin AS-48 in fruit and vegetable juices.
AB  - Enterocin AS-48 is a candidate bacteriocin for food biopreservation. Before addressing application of AS-48 to vegetable-based foods, the interaction between AS-48 and vegetable food components and the stability of AS-48 were studied. Enterocin AS-48 had variable interactions with fruit and vegetable juices, with complete, partial, or negligible loss of activity. For some juices, loss of activity was ameliorated by increasing the bacteriocin concentration, diluting the juice, or applying a heat pretreatment. In juices obtained from cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, green beans, celery, and avocado, AS-48 was very stable for the first 24 to 48 h of storage under refrigeration, and decay of activity was markedly influenced by storage temperature. In fresh-made fruit juices (orange, apple, grapefruit, pear, pineapple, and kiwi) and juice mixtures, AS-48 was very stable for at least 15 days at 4 degrees C, and bacteriocin activity was still detectable after 30 days of storage. Gradual and variable loss of activity occurred in juices stored at 15 and 28 degrees C; inactivation was faster at higher temperatures. In commercial fruit juices (orange, apple, peach, and pineapple) stored at 4 degrees C, the bacteriocin was completely stable for up to 120 days, and over 60% of initial activity was still present in juices stored at 15 degrees C for the same period. Commercial fruit juices stored at 28 degrees C for 120 days retained between 31.5% (apple) and 67.71% (peach) of their initial bacteriocin activity. Solutions of AS-48 in sterile distilled water were stable (120 days at 4 to 28 degrees C). Limited loss of activity was observed after mixing AS-48 with some food-grade dyes and thickening agents. Enterocin AS-48 added to lettuce juice incubated at 15 degrees C reduced viable counts of Listeria monocytogenes CECT 4032 and Bacillus cereus LWL1 to below detection limits and markedly reduced viable counts of Staphylococcus aureus CECT 976.
TI  - The impact of homologous recombination on the generation of diversity in bacteria.
AB  - The imprint of demographic and selective processes on bacterial population structure needs to be evaluated as deviation from the expectations of an appropriate null neutral model. We explore the impact of varying the population mutation and recombination rates theta and rho on ideal populations, using a recently developed model of neutral drift at multiple loci. This model may be fitted to experimental data to provide estimates of these parameters, and we do so for seven bacterial species (Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Helicobacter pylori, Burkholderia pseudomallei and Bacillus cereus), illustrating that bacterial species vary extensively in these fundamental parameters. Historically, the influence of recombination has often been estimated through its influence on the Index of Association I(A). We show that this may be relatively insensitive to changes in either mutation or recombination rates. It is known that biased sampling can lead to artificially high estimates of I(A). We therefore provide a method of precisely separating the effects of such bias and true linkage between alleles. We also demonstrate that by fitting the neutral model to experimental data, more informative and precise estimates of the relative roles of recombination and mutation may be obtained.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial, antifungal and cytotoxic activities of some coumarins and their metal complexes.
AB  - A series of new antibacterial and antifungal coumarin-derived compounds and their transition metal complexes [cobalt (II), copper (II), nickel (II) and zinc (II)] have been synthesized, characterized and screened for their in vitro antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Shigella dysenteriae, Bacillus cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes bacterial strains and for in vitro antifungal activity against Trichophyton longifusus, Candida albicans, Aspergillus flavus, Microsporum canis, Fusarium solani, Candida glaberata. The results of these studies show the metal complexes to be more antibacterial and antifungal as compared to the uncomplexed coumarins. The brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to study their in vitro cytotoxic properties.
TI  - Investigations on anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products.
AB  - AIMS: To investigate the anti-Aspergillus properties of bacterial products. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 12 bacterial strains were screened for antifungal activity against Aspergilli. The culture supernatant and lysates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli (BL21, DH5alpha, HB101, XL Blue), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptomyces thermonitrificans, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella typhi were examined for antifungal activity in protein concentration ranging from 1000.0 to 7.8 microg ml-1 using microbroth dilution assay. The lysate of Salm. typhi and E. coli BL21 exhibited the maximum activity against Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Their in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were found to be 15.6-31.2 microg ml-1 by microbroth dilution and spore germination inhibition assays. In disc diffusion assay, a concentration of 3.1 microg disc-1 of Salm. typhi lysate showed significant activity against Aspergilli. Escherichia coli BL21 exhibited similar activity at 6.2 microg disc-1. The work on identification of molecule endowed with antimycotic properties is in progress. CONCLUSION: The products of Salm. typhi and E. coli demonstrated significant activity against Aspergillus species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first time that E. coli has been reported for anti-Aspergillus activity. It could be an important source of biologically active compounds useful for developing better new antifungal drugs/or probiotics.
TI  - Recombinant expression of indolicidin concatamers in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are part of the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates. They are active against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. Currently, most antimicrobial peptides are extracted from host organisms or produced by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli is a tool for greater production yields at a decreased cost and reduces the use of hazardous materials. We have constructed a concatamer of indolicidin and successfully expressed a fusion product with thioredoxin in E. coli BL21DE3. Codons for methionine residues flanking individual indolicidin genes were incorporated for cyanogen bromide cleavage of the fusion protein and liberation of active monomeric indolicidin. Peptide yields of 150 microg/l monomeric indolicidin were achieved in this first report of recombinant production of indolicidin with demonstrated antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Evaluation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing pooled whole  blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich plasma platelets with a single contaminated unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In certain countries, whole blood-derived platelet (PLT)-rich plasma  PLTs can only be pooled within 4 hours of transfusion. One prerequisite for prestorage pooling is the ability to detect low levels of bacteria from a single unit (approx. 10 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) once pooled (10/6 approx. 2 CFUs/mL). This study evaluated the BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux) for detection of bacteria in 1 unit of a 6-unit pool. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into single PLT units (target, 10 and 100 CFUs/mL; mean recovered, 5 and 92 CFUs/mL) and then pooled with 5 sterile units. Four milliliters was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles, and 0.5 mL was plated (10 sets). RESULTS: All cases were detected when the single unit had at least 6 CFUs per mL. With B. cereus (< or =2 CFUs/mL), all bottles were reactive. With K. pneumoniae and S. viridans (< or =3 CFUs/mL), all samples were detected with a two-bottle set, but not all bottles were reactive. With S. marcescens (< 2 CFUs/mL), only 7 of the 10 sets were reactive. With C. perfringens (0.2 CFUs/mL), only 3 of 10 samples were detected in the anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for detection of bacteria in PLT pools. Overall, the BacT/ALERT detected all contaminated pooled PLTs when the single inoculated unit had a calculated or recovered concentration at least 3 CFUs per mL with 10 different species of bacteria. Low recovered concentrations (< or =2 CFUs/mL) were, in some cases, only detected with a two-bottle set.
TI  - A study on inhibitory effects of Sigla tree (Liquidambar orientalis Mill. var. orientalis) storax against several bacteria.
AB  - In this study, Sigla (Liquidambar orientalis Mill.) storax (styrax) was investigated for antibacterial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, B. brevis, B. cereus, B. megaterium, B. subtilis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Micrococcus luteus, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. fluorescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Yersinia enterocolitica. The storax was dissolved in absolute ethanol and was tested at concentrations of 10.0%, 1.0%, 0.4%, 0.2% and 0.1%. Pure ethanol was used for the control. The antibacterial activity of the Sigla storax was determined by using the agar diffusion method. The growths of A. hydrophila, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. megaterium, E. coli, E. coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes and Y. enterocolitica were not inhibited by any of the concentrations of Sigla storax. The results showed that Sigla storax has antibacterial activity against many bacteria at concentrations of 10.0% and against some bacteria at concentrations of 1.0%, 0.4% and 0.2%.
TI  - Solid- and vapor-phase antimicrobial activities of six essential oils: susceptibility of selected foodborne bacterial and fungal strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon (Cinnamon zeylanicum), clove (Syzygium aromaticum), basil (Ocimum basillicum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), dill (Anethum graveolens), and ginger (Zingiber officinalis) was evaluated over a range of concentrations in two types of contact tests (solid and vapor diffusion). The EOs were tested against an array of four Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Listeria monocytogenes), four Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella choleraesuis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and three fungi (a yeast, Candida albicans, and two molds, Penicillium islandicum and Aspergillus flavus). The rationale for this work was to test the possibility of creating a protective atmosphere by using natural compounds that could extend the shelf life of packaged foodstuffs while minimizing organoleptic alterations. In the solid diffusion tests, cinnamon and clove gave the strongest (and very similar) inhibition, followed by basil and rosemary, with dill and ginger giving the weakest inhibition. The fungi were the most sensitive microorganisms, followed by the Gram-positive bacterial strains. The Gram-negative strain P. aeruginosa was the least inhibited. The composition of the atmosphere generated by the EOs, and their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were determined using a disk volatilization method, in which no inhibition from rosemary or basil was observed. Cinnamon and clove, once again, gave similar results for every microorganism. As a general rule, MIC (fungi) << MIC (bacteria) with no clear differences between Gram-positive or -negative strains except for P. aeruginosa, which was not inhibited by any of the EOs in the vapor phase. The atmosphere generated from the EOs was analyzed by means of solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry. Differences among the volatiles in the EOs, which may be responsible for the differences in their antimicrobial performances, were found.
TI  - Characterization of a 3944 Da bacteriocin, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST15, with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain ST15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as Enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 Da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Acinetobacter baumanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus caprinus. Bacteriocin ST15 is inactivated by proteinase K, pronase, pepsin, protease and Triton X-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 90 min. Activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity is bactericidal. The highest level of activity (51200 AU ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in MRS broth, pH 6.5. Bacteriocin ST15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for Enterococcus spp. by being active against Gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
TI  - The assessment of biological activities associated with the major constituents of the methanol extract of 'wild carrot' (Daucus carota L) seeds.
AB  - Daucus carota L. (Family: Apiaceae alt. Umbelliferae), commonly known as 'wild carrot' or 'Queen Anne's-lace,' is an ecologically invasive erect biennial naturalized to Scotland. The ethnobotanical uses of this species include applications in the treatment of cough, diarrhea, dysentery, cancer, malaria and tumors, and as an antiseptic, abortifacient, aphrodisiac, carminative, stimulant, stomachic and tonic. The major constituents isolated from the methanol extract of D. carota seeds by reversed-phase preparative high performance chromatography were luteolin, luteolin 3'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and luteolin 4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside, three flavones. The constituents were assessed for their antibacterial and free radical scavenging activities, as well as toxicity towards brine shrimp. Among these three flavones, luteolin showed the highest degree of free radical scavenging activity (RC50 = 4.3 x 10(-4) mg/mL) in the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay. Both luteolin and its 4'-O-glucoside demonstrated bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (Minimum Inhibitory Concentration [MIC] = 5.0 x 10(-2) - 1.0 x 10(-1) mg/mL). Luteolin also demonstrated antibactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Citrobacter freundii (MIC = 5.0 x 10(-2) mg/mL). Luteolin 3'-O-glucoside showed bactericidal activity against Bacillus cereus and Lactobacillus plantarum (MIC = 2.5 x 10(-1) mg/mL and 5 x 10(-1) mg/ mL, respectively). In the brine shrimp lethality assay, the LD50 value of luteolin was 5.3 x 10(-2) mg/mL, and that of its 3'-O-glucoside and 4'-O-glucoside were > 1.0 mg/mL.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  - The coordination of food sampling activities across Wales, a part of the United Kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. This surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. The food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. For all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for Escherichia coli, and 0.5% for Listeria spp. Overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. No Campylobacter-positive samples and only one Salmonella-positive sample were found. The analysis of the results show that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current United Kingdom guidelines. The information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.
TI  - Microbial profiles of on-line--procured sprouting seeds and potential hazards associated with enterotoxigenic Bacillus spp. in homegrown sprouts.
AB  - We examined the microbiological quality of sprouting seeds sold through the Internet. Overall, five types of seeds each from six organic and six conventional sources were evaluated. The growth and toxin production of naturally occurring Bacillus spp. in sprouts produced using home-scale sprouting devices also were investigated. For alfalfa, broccoli, lentil, mungbean, and radish seeds, the average microbial counts were 3.3, 4.0, 2.8, 3.5, and 3.6 log CFU/g, presumptive B. cereus counts were 0.7, 1.0, 0.8, 1.0, and 0.9 log CFU/g, and total coliform counts were -0.3, -0.4, -0.5, 0.0, and -0.4 log of the most probable number per gram, respectively. No Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, other fecal coliforms, or Staphylococcus aureus was found on seeds. Compared with conventional seeds, the organic seeds had lower or equivalent counts for total microorganisms, presumptive B. cereus, and total coliforms. When seeds were sprouting using a glass jar, the growth of presumptive B. cereus was significant for radish and broccoli but not for alfalfa, lentil, and mungbean sprouts; the counts exceeded 5.0 log CFU/g in radish sprouts. When sprouts were grown using an automatic sprouting device, presumptive B. cereus showed slight growth (< 3.0 log cycles) in radish, broccoli, and mungbean sprouts but no growth in alfalfa and lentil sprouts. Although the presumptive B. cereus isolates were enterotoxigenic, they did not produce or accumulate detectable levels of diarrheal toxins in freshly produced sprouts.
TI  - Isolation of cupanioside, a novel cytotoxic and antibacterial long-chain fatty alcohol glycoside from the bark of Cupania glabra.
AB  - The crude dichloromethane extract from the stem bark of Cupania glabra (Sapindaceae), showed in vitro cytotoxic activity against Hep G2, MDA-MB-231, Hs 578T, MCF-7, and PC-3 cells, and antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Bioactivity-directed fractionation led to isolation of the new 1-O-[2'',3'',4''-tri-O-acetyl-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->2)-beta- D-glucopyranosyl]-hexadecanol (cupanioside) as the cytotoxic agent. The structure was elucidated by analysis of 2D-NMR spectra.
TI  - Antagonistic activity against Salmonella infection in vitro and in vivo for two Lactobacillus strains from swine and poultry.
AB  - In this study, we isolated two lactobacillus strains, i.e., strain LAP5 and LF33, from swine and poultry, respectively, and showed that both strains were acid as well as bile tolerant and were able to adhere to the cultured human intestinal cell lines, such as Int-407 and Caco-2 cells, and to the intestinal epithelium cells isolated from swine, poultry and mouse (BALB/c). Both of these LAB strains were shown to inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. When these two LAB strains were evaluated for their antagonistic activity against Salmonella (S. typhimurium) invasion to cultured human intestinal cell line Int-407 and to mouse (BALB/c) liver and spleen, these two LAB strains were found to have significant antagonistic effect.
TI  - Effect of the implementation of HACCP on the microbiological quality of meals at  a university restaurant.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the microbiological quality, including total mesophilic counts and markers of bacteriological hygiene, as indicator of food safety of three categories of the most consumed meals in a university restaurant, before and after implementation of the HACCP system and personnel training. Cold gastronomy products, cooked warm-served products, and cooked cold-served products were tested for bacterial contamination. Throughout the experiment, 894 samples were examined for total counts of aerobic bacteria, counts of indicator organisms (coliform organisms and Escherichia coli) and pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes). Implementation of the HACCP system, together with training in personnel hygiene, good manufacturing practices, and cleaning and sanitation procedures, resulted in lower aerobic plate counts and a lower incidence of S. aureus, coliform organisms, E. coli, and B. cereus, whereas Salmonella spp. and L. monocytogenes were not found in all samples studied. The microbial results of this study demonstrate that personnel training together with HACCP application contributed to improve the food safety of meals served in the restaurant studied.
TI  - In-house validation of the BACTEC 9240 blood culture system for detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: At present, only two commercially available automated culture systems are cleared by the FDA for the purpose of quality control (QC) testing for bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates: the BacT/ALERT blood culture system (bioMerieux) and the Pall eBDS (Pall Corporation), both of which allow testing of leukoreduced apheresis as well as whole blood-derived PLTs. After the decision of the AABB to institute universal QC testing of PLT concentrates for evidence of bacterial contamination, in-house validation of the performance of our current blood culture system, the BACTEC 9240, was carried out for this purpose. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial dilutions of nine species of bacteria commonly associated with PLT contamination were prepared in one single-donor apheresis PLT unit per organism. Four mL of dilutions containing less than 1 to greater than 10(3) colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL was inoculated into blood culture bottles (Standard 10 Aerobic/F, Becton-Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) and incubated in a BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system. Positive bottles were removed from the system and subcultured to insure the identity of bacterial growth. RESULTS: With the exception of Streptococcus mitis, the BACTEC system provided a detection sensitivity of less than 10 CFUs per mL for Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The limit of detection for the S. mitis test strain was 61 CFUs per mL. Detection of positive bottles ranged from 6.5 to 17.6 hours depending on the species tested and the cell density of the inoculum. Ongoing use of this system for bacterial detection yielded two true-positive samples from 3879 apheresis PLT products collected at our hospital-based donor center over 9 months. CONCLUSION: This study validates the use of the BACTEC 9240 continuously monitored blood culture system for the detection of low-level bacterial contamination in single donor apheresis PLTs in less than 24 hours.
TI  - Use of a spectrophotometric bioassay for determination of microbial sensitivity to manuka honey.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of manuka honey has been well documented (Molan, 1992a,b,c, 1997) [Molan, P.C., 1992. The antibacterial activity of honey. 1: the nature of the antibacterial activity. Bee World 73 (1) 5-28; Molan, P.C., 1992. The antibacterial activity of honey. 2: variation in the potency of the antibacterial activity. Bee World 73 (2) 59-76; Molan, P.C., 1992. Medicinal uses for honey. Beekeepers Quarterly 26; Molan, P.C., 1997. Finding New Zealand honeys with outstanding antibacterial and antifungal activity. New Zealand Beekeeper 4 (10) 20-26]. The current bioassays for determining this antimicrobial effect employ a well diffusion (Ahn and Stiles, 1990) [Ahn, C., Stiles, M.E., 1990. Antibacterial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from vacuum-packed meats. Journal of Applied Bacteriology 69, 302-310], (Weston et al., 1999) [Weston, R.J., Mitchell, K.R., Allen, K.L., 1999. Antibacterial phenolic components of New Zealand manuka honey. J. Food Chem. 64, 295-301] or disc diffusion (Taormina et al., 2001) [Taormina, Peter J., Niemira, Brendan A., Beuchat, Larry R., 2001. Inhibitory activity of honey against food borne pathogens as influenced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and level of antioxidant power. Int. J. Food Microbiol. 69, 217-225] assay using zones of inhibition as indicators of bacterial susceptibility. The development of a 24-h spectrophotometric assay employing 96-well microtiter plates, that is more sensitive and more amenable to statistical analysis than the assays currently employed, was undertaken. This simple and rapid assay permits extensive kinetic studies even in the presence of low honey concentrations, and is capable of detecting inhibitory levels below those recorded for well or disc diffusion assays. In this paper, we compare the assay to both well and disc diffusion assays. The results we obtained for the spectrophotometric method MIC values show that this method has greater sensitivity than the standard well and disc diffusion assays. In addition, inter- and intra-assay variance for this method was investigated, demonstrating the methods reproducibility and repeatability.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - Rare trisubstituted sesquiterpenes daucanes from the wild Daucus carota.
AB  - Phytochemical and biological investigation of the roots of the wild Daucus carota ssp. carota afforded three new and four known compounds, including four sesquiterpenes daucane esters (1-3 [new], and 4), one polyacetylene (5), one sesquiterpene coumarin (6), and sitosterol glucoside. The structures of the new compounds were determined by comprehensive NMR studies, including DEPT, COSY, NOESY, HMQC and HMBC analyses. Based on an agar diffusion assay, 1, 2 and 4-6 were screened and found to contain a range of low antibacterial activities against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptomyces scabies, Bacillus subtilus, Bacillus cereus) and two gram negative species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) as well as antifungal against Fusarium oxysporum and Aspergillus niger using cup agar diffusion assay.
TI  - Aerosolization as novel sanitizer delivery system to reduce food-borne pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: As a preliminary experiment on new sanitizer delivery tools, the efficacy of aerosolized sanitizer on food-borne pathogens was investigated in larger model chamber system. METHODS: Peroxyacetic acid and hydrogen peroxide were aerosolized in a model system against artificially inoculated target micro-organisms on laboratory media. Cultures of four different food-borne pathogens were inoculated and affixed onto three different heights (bottom, wall and ceiling), and three different orientations (face-down, vertical and face-down) inside a commercial semi-trailer cabinet (14.6 x 2.6 x 2.8 m). Sanitizer was aerosolized into 2 microm droplet size fog and treated for 1 h at ambient temperature. RESULTS: Populations of Bacillus cereus, Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium were reduced by an average of 3.09, 7.69, 6.93 and 8.18 log units per plate respectively. Interestingly, L. innocua, Staph. aureus, and Salm. typhimurium showed statistically not different (P >/= 0.05) reduction patterns relative to height and orientation that were never expected in a spraying system. CONCLUSIONS: Aerosolized sanitizers diffuse like gaseous sanitizers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Aerosolization has great potential for use in commercial applications.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tenerife cheese: initial characterization of plantaricin TF711, a bacteriocin-like substance produced by Lactobacillus plantarum TF711.
AB  - AIMS: The screening and initial characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from raw Tenerife goats' cheese with possible application as biopreservatives or ripening accelerators for Tenerife cheese. METHODS AND RESULTS: One hundred and eighty LAB of the genera Lactobacillus (95), Leuconostoc (64) and Lactococcus (21) isolated from raw Tenerife goats' cheese were screened for the production of antimicrobial substances. Lactobacillus plantarum TF711, which had the broadest spectrum of antimicrobial activity, was selected for further characterization. The antimicrobial compound was determined as a proteinaceous substance, as it was sensitive to proteases. The bacteriocin-like substance, which we called plantaricin TF711, was active against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes and Staphylococcus aureus; and against the Enterobacteriaceae Shigella sonnei and Klebsiella pneumoniae. It was stable to heat and to treatment with surfactants and organic solvents. Highest antimicrobial activity was found between pH 1 and 9. Plantaricin TF711 exhibited primary metabolite kinetics, a bacteriostatic mode of action and a molecular mass of c. 2.5 kDa as determined by tricine SDS-PAGE. CONCLUSIONS: Lact. plantarum TF711 produces a low molecular mass bacteriocin-like compound with a wide spectrum of activity and interesting technological properties (thermostability, good pH stability and stability against surfactants and organic solvents). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Plantaricin TF711 was found to have potential for use as a biopreservative in the food industry.
TI  - Expanding the bactericidal action of the food color additive phloxine B to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Phloxine B (D&C red no. 28) is a color additive for food, drugs, and cosmetics. It has been previously shown to have anti-Staphylococcus aureus activities. In this work, the effect of Phloxine B on various gram-negative bacteria and other gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus mycoides, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus aureus, Salmonella, Escherichia coli and Shigella was studied, along with the mechanism of anti-microbial activity. In the presence of fluorescent light, the viable count for gram-positive bacteria, (Bacillus spp. and S. aureus) decreased in a dose and time dependent manner when incubated with Phloxine B. The viability of gram-positive bacteria was reduced by 99.99% in 40 min, while there was no effect on gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella choleraesuis, E. coli and Shigella flexneri). However, the use of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) expands the spectrum of activity for Phloxine B to include gram-negative bacteria. EDTA increased membrane-permeability by releasing lipopolysaccharide. Overall, in an Agar diffusion test the light-dependent bactericidal activity of 1 microg of Phloxine B had a potency of 0.64 units of chloramphenicol and 0.5 units of tetracycline when tested on B. cereus, and had a potency of 0.7 units of chloramphenicol and 0.2 units of tetracycline when tested on S. aureus. The data suggest that the dye may have some potential anti-microbial applications.
TI  - The role of sigmaB in the stress response of Gram-positive bacteria -- targets for food preservation and safety.
AB  - The alternative sigma factor sigmaB modulates the stress response of several Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis and the food-borne human pathogens Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. In all these bacteria, sigmaB is responsible for the transcription of genes that can confer stress resistance to the vegetative cell. Recent findings indicate that sigmaB also plays an important role in antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis and cellular differentiation processes such as biofilm formation and sporulation. Although there are important differences in the regulation of sigmaB and in the set of genes regulated by sigmaB in B. subtilis, B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and S. aureus, there are also some conserved themes. A mechanistic understanding of the sigmaB activation processes and assessment of its regulon could provide tools for pathogen control and inactivation both in the food industry and clinical settings.
TI  - Molecular recognition of an ADP-ribosylating Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme by RalA GTPase.
AB  - C3 exoenzymes (members of the ADP-ribosyltranferase family) are produced by Clostridium botulinum (C3bot1 and -2), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), Bacillus cereus (C3cer), and Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau1-3). These exoenzymes lack a translocation domain but are known to specifically inactivate Rho GTPases in host target cells. Here, we report the crystal structure of C3bot1 in complex with RalA (a GTPase of the Ras subfamily) and GDP at a resolution of 2.66 A. RalA is not ADP-ribosylated by C3 exoenzymes but inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3bot1, C3lim, and C3cer to different extents. The structure provides an insight into the molecular interactions between C3bot1 and RalA involving the catalytic ADP-ribosylating turn-turn (ARTT) loop from C3bot1 and helix alpha4 and strand beta6 (which are not part of the GDP-binding pocket) from RalA. The structure also suggests a molecular explanation for the different levels of C3-exoenzyme inhibition by RalA and why RhoA does not bind C3bot1 in this manner.
TI  - Finding optimal photosensitisers for the decontamination of foods by the photodynamic effect.
AB  - A new method for sanitation based on the photodynamic effect is introduced. Photosensitisers are compounds that generate cytotoxic oxygen species and free radicals after excitation with appropriate visible light. The cell killing efficacy is due to their chemical structure, to the actual environment and therefore also to their degree of aggregation. As has been shown, photosensitisers bound to the cell wall or incorporated into the cells are very effective cytotoxic agents after illumination. Even singlet oxygen generated in the gas phase surrounding the micro-organisms effectively kills cells. Especially membrane components are the targets of the photodynamic effect. Membrane disintegration is observed soon after illumination. The food contaminants under investigation are Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, forming endospores, Staphylococcus aureus, forming a wide range of agressins, exotoxins and enterotoxins, all gram positive micro-organisms, Escherichia coli, a hygiene indicator, and the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Kloeckera javanica, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, a blue and a pink pigmented isolate from foods. We investigated the capacity of several photosensitisers to induce the phototoxic effect towards those micro-organisms following excitation by visible light.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Hypogymnia tubulosa and its  3-hydroxyphysodic acid constituent.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity and the MIC values of the diethyl ether, acetone, chloroform, petroleum ether, and ethanol extracts of the lichen Hypogymnia tubulosa and its 3-hydroxyphysodic acid constituent have been investigated against some microorganisms. At least one of the extracts or 3-hydroxyphysodic acid showed antimicrobial activity against Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus vulgaris, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Candida albicans. No antifungal activity of the extracts has been observed against ten filamentous fungi.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of an eudesmane sesquiterpene isolated from common Varthemia, Varthemia iphionoides.
AB  - The ethyl acetate extract of the whole aerial parts of Varthemia iphionoides (Compositae) showed a pronounced antibacterial activity. The bioassay-guided fractionation of the ethyl acetate extract and further purification of the most antibacterially active fraction led to the isolation and identification of an antibacterial sesquiterpene, selina-4,11(13)-dien-3-on-12-oic acid. This compound exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against six bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella enteritides). The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of this compound which was determined by the agar dilution method ranged between 250 and 500 microg/ml.
TI  - Synthesis of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a novel series of Schiff bases of 4-(4-aminophenyl)-morpholine were synthesised and characterised by IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral and elemental analysis. The compounds were screened for antibacterial (Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 9144), Staphylococcus epidermidis (ATCC 155), Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778), Micrococcus luteus (ATCC 4678), and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922)) and antifungal (Candida albicans (ATCC 2091) and Aspergillus niger (ATCC 9029)) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. 4-(4-(4-Hydroxy-benzylidene-imino)phenyl)-morpholine (7) was found to be the most potent antimicrobial activity with MIC of 25, 19, 21, 16, 29, 20 and 40 microg/ml against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus, M. luteus, E. coli, C. albicans and A. niger, respectively. All the other compounds exhibited moderate activity against the bacterial and fungal organisms tested.
TI  - Screening for bacillus isolates in the broiler gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Spores from a number of different Bacillus species are currently being used as human and animal probiotics, although their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here we describe the isolation of 237 presumptive gut-associated Bacillus spp. isolates that were obtained by heat and ethanol treatment of fecal material from organically reared broilers followed by aerobic plating. Thirty-one representative isolates were characterized according to their morphological, physiological, and biochemical properties as well as partial 16S rRNA gene sequences and screening for the presence of plasmid DNA. The Bacillus species identified included B. subtilis, B. pumilus, B. licheniformis, B. clausii, B. megaterium, B. firmus, and species of the B. cereus group, whereas a number of our isolates could not be classified. Intrinsic properties of potential importance for survival in the gut that could be advantageous for spore-forming probiotics were further investigated for seven isolates belonging to five different species. All isolates sporulated efficiently in the laboratory, and the resulting spores were tolerant to simulated gastrointestinal tract conditions. They also exhibited antimicrobial activity against a broad spectrum of bacteria, including food spoilage and pathogenic organisms such as Bacillus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, the isolates were susceptible to most of the antibiotics tested, arguing that they would not act as donors for resistance determinants if introduced in the form of probiotic preparations. Together, our results suggest that some of the sporeformers isolated in this study have the potential to persist in or transiently associate with the complex gut ecosystem.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of cereulide, an emetic toxin of Bacillus cereus, by using  rat liver mitochondria.
AB  - An emetic toxin cereulide, produced by Bacillus cereus, causes emetic food poisonings, but a method for quantitative measurement of cereulide has not been well established. A current detection method is a bioassay method using the HEp-2 cell vacuolation test, but it was unable to measure an accurate concentration. We established a quantitative assay for cereulide based on its mitochondrial respiratory uncoupling activity. The oxygen consumption in a reaction medium containing rat liver mitochondria was rapid in the presence of cereulide. Thus uncoupling effect of cereulide on mitochondrial respiration was similar to those of uncouplers 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), and valinomycin. This method gave constant results over a wide range of cereulide concentrations, ranging from 0.05 to 100 microg/ml. The minimum cereulide concentration to detect uncoupled oxygen consumption was 50 ng/ml and increased dose-dependently to the maximum level. Semi-log relationship between the oxygen consumption rate and the cereulide concentration enables this method to quantify cereulide. The results of this method were highly reproducible as compared with the HEp-2 cell vacuolation test and were in good agreement with those of the HEp-2 cell vacuolation test. The enterotoxin of B. cereus or Staphylococcus aureus did not show any effect on the oxygen consumption, indicating this method is specific for the identification of cereulide as a causative agent of emetic food poisonings.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of 4-benzoyl-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and derivatives.
AB  - Some new 1H-pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid and pyridazinone derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their antibacterial activities against Bacillus cereus ATCC 7064, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Escherichia coli ATCC 4230 and Pseudomonas putida using tube dilution method. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) experiments revealed that all chemical compounds showed inhibitor effects on the growth of the test microorganisms. Moreover, the results of this research showed that the compound named as 5c was the best compound in the series, exhibiting antibacterial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Penetration pharmacokinetics of topically administered 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human aqueous and vitreous.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into the aqueous and vitreous after topical administration in humans. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 20 patients scheduled for vitrectomy surgery between September 1 and December 31, 2003. Aqueous and vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed after topical administration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride, every 2 hours (q2h) or every 6 hours (q6h), for 3 days before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD moxifloxacin concentrations in the q2h group for the aqueous (n = 9) and vitreous (n = 10) were 2.28 +/- 1.23 and 0.11 +/- 0.05 microg/mL, respectively. Mean +/- SD moxifloxacin concentrations in the q6h group for the aqueous (n = 10) and vitreous (n = 9) were 0.88 +/- 0.88 and 0.06 +/- 0.06 microg/mL, respectively. The minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of isolates (MIC(90)) was far exceeded in the aqueous for a wide spectrum of key pathogens, whereas it was not exceeded in the vitreous for several organisms. However, the minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the isolates was exceeded in the q2h vitreous group for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Bacillus cereus, and other gram-negative pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: The Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study revealed that 94.2% of isolates from postoperative endophthalmitis are gram-positive pathogens. Moxifloxacin has a spectrum of coverage that appropriately encompasses the most common organisms in endophthalmitis. The pharmacokinetic findings of this investigation show that relatively high aqueous levels can be achieved after topical administration. Further studies will help define the precise role of 0.5% moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in the treatment of or prophylaxis against intraocular infections.
TI  - Characterization and antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin 217 produced by natural isolate Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16.
AB  - The strain Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei BGBUK2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (Bac217; approximately 7 kDa). The onset of Bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees C, respectively, when culture entered the early stationary phase. Biochemical characterization showed that Bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of pH 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees C for 15 min. Bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees C for 6 months or -20 degrees C for up to 12 months. However, Bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. BGBUK2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. Plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for Bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. Bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Interestingly, Bac217 showed activity against Salmonella sp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853. The inhibitory effect of BGBUK2-16 on the growth of S. aureus in mixed culture was observed. S. aureus treatment with Bac217 led to a considerable decrease (CFU/ml) within a short period of time. The mode of Bac217 action on S. aureus was identified as bactericidal. It should be noted that the strain BGBUK2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and specificity of the six human {alpha}-defensins.
AB  - We developed a kinetic, 96-well turbidimetric procedure that is capable of testing the antimicrobial properties of six human alpha-defensins concurrently on a single microplate. The defensins were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis and tested against gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli). Analysis of the growth curves provided virtual lethal doses (vLDs) equivalent to conventional 50% lethal doses (LD(50)s), LD(90)s, LD(99)s, and LD(99.9)s obtained from colony counts. On the basis of their respective vLD(90)s and vLD(99)s, the relative potencies of human myeloid alpha-defensins against S. aureus were HNP2 > HNP1 > HNP3 > HNP4. In contrast, their relative potencies against E. coli and E. aerogenes were HNP4 > HNP2 > HNP1 = HNP3. HD5 was as effective as HNP2 against S. aureus and as effective as HNP4 against the gram-negative bacteria in our panel. HD6 showed little or no activity against any of the bacteria in our panel, including B. cereus, which was highly susceptible to the other five alpha-defensins. The assay described provides a quantitative, precise, and economical way to study the antimicrobial activities of host-defense peptides. Its use has clarified the relative potencies of human alpha-defensins and raised intriguing questions about the in vivo function(s) of HD6.
TI  - Essential oils of Satureja, Origanum, and Thymus species: chemical composition and antibacterial activities against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - The chemical composition of the essential oils obtained from the species restricted to Greece and the eastern Mediterranean region, Satureja spinosa L. and Thymus longicaulis L.; species endemic to central and south Greece, Satureja parnassica ssp. parnassica Heldr. and Sart ex Boiss.; species endemic to the island of Crete, Origanum dictamnus L.; and species widely distributed in the Mediterranean region, Satureja thymbra L. and Origanum vulgare L. subsp. hirtum, were determined by gas chromatography (GC) and GC/mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The in vitro antibacterial activities of the essential oils were evaluated against a panel of five foodborne bacteria (Escherichia coli 0157:H7 NCTC 12900, Salmonella enteritidis PT4, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Listeria monocytogenes ScottA, and Bacillus cereus FSS 134). The analytical data indicated that various monoterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic monoterpenes constitute the major components of the oils, but their concentrations varied greatly among the oils examined. The antibacterial assay results showed that 5 muL doses of the essential oils extracted from the endemic Satureja species in Greece possess remarkable bactericidal properties, which are clearly superior as compared to those of Origanum and Thymus species essential oils. Therefore, they represent an inexpensive source of natural mixtures of antibacterial compounds that exhibit potentials for use in food systems to prevent the growth of foodborne bacteria and extend the shelf life of the processed food.
TI  - Synthesis and study of antibacterial and antifungal activities of novel 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl] acetylamino]thiazoles.
AB  - Several 2-[[(benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-yl)sulfanyl]acetylamino]thiazoles derivatives were synthesized by reacting 4-substituted-2-(chloroacetylamino)thiazoles with benzoxazole/benzimidazole-2-thioles in acetone and in the presence of K2CO3. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by IR, 1H-NMR, and FAB(+)-MS spectral data. Their antimicrobial activities against Micrococcus luteus (NRLL B-4375), Bacillus cereus (NRRL B-3711), Proteus vulgaris (NRRL B-123), Salmonella typhimurium (NRRL B-4420), Staphylococcus aureus (NRRL B-767), Escherichia coli (NRRL B-3704), Candida albicans and Candida globrata (isolates obtained from Osmangazi Uni. Fac.of Medicine) were investigated and in this investigation, a significant level of activity was illustrated.
TI  - [Interaction of neomycin with other antibiotics on selected bacterial strains].
AB  - Antimicrobial combinations are used most frequently to provide broad-spectrum empirical coverage in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, combination of two antibiotics may not influence their activity, may lead to synergy or antagonism in the activity. Neomycin may be combined with one of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, procaine penicillin, gramicidin, bacitracin, polymyxin B, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, and erythromycin in some human and veterinary multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland. The checkerboard method has been one of the traditional assays for the measurement of antibiotic interactions. The aim of this study was to analyse the activity interaction of neomycin with second antibiotic in multiantibiotic drugs distributed in Poland on standards and clinical bacterial strains. Checkerboard results for all strains demonstrated synergism for 2.5% of combinations, only for standards strains. In one case Salmonella Enteritidis, in combination of neomycin with bacitracin, inhibition effect was observed. Additive effects were predominant--49%. In 18% neutral effects were shown, but in 26% of combinations FIC indexes were not possible to calculate, because of the resistance of clinical strains to the highest concentration of at least one antibiotic. In combination of aminoglycoside (neomycin) with beta-lactams antibiotics (ampicillin, procaine penicillin) in vitro, no synergy was observed for all examined strains. The best results were achieved for combinations of neomycin with peptide antibiotics (polymyxin, gramicidin and bacitracin)--5 for all 6 synergy effect observed.
TI  - New vector for efficient allelic replacement in naturally nontransformable, low-GC-content, gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - A shuttle vector designated pMAD was constructed for quickly generating gene inactivation mutants in naturally nontransformable gram-positive bacteria. This vector allows, on X-Gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) plates, a quick colorimetric blue-white discrimination of bacteria which have lost the plasmid, greatly facilitating clone identification during mutagenesis. The plasmid was used in Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Bacillus cereus to efficiently construct mutants with or without an associated antibiotic resistance gene.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of water extract of sumac (Rhus coriaria L.) on the growth of some food borne bacteria including pathogens.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of water extracts of sumac (Rhus coriaria L.) at concentrations of 0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.5% and 5.0% (w/v), non-neutralized and after neutralization to pH 7.2+/-0.1, was studied on the growth of 12 bacterial strains (six Gram positive strains and six Gram negative strains), mostly food borne including pathogens. It was found to be effective against all the test organisms with Gram positive strains being more sensitive than Gram negative strains. Significant differences (P<0.01) were found among the bacteria and between the non-neutralized and neutralized extracts with non-neutralized being more effective against all the bacteria. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract for each bacterial strain was studied by a gradient plate method. Among the Gram positive organisms, Bacillus species (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus thuringiensis) were found to be the most sensitive showing MICs of 0.25-0.32% (after 24 h incubation) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (0.49%), while Listeria monocytogenes was found to be the least sensitive demonstrating a MIC of 0.67%. Of the Gram negative organisms, Salmonella enteritidis was found to be the most resistant with a MIC of 0.67% followed by Escherichia coli Type I, E. coli O157:H7, Proteus vulgaris and Hafnia alvei having MICs of 0.63%, 0.60%, 0.55% and 0.45%, respectively; whereas Citrobacter freundii was found to be the least resistant surviving up to 0.42%. Some loss of antimicrobial activity was, however, observed after incubation for 3 days. Bacteriostatic/bactericidal effects of sumac, as studied by enumerating survival by the viable count technique after 1 h direct contact of each microorganism with various concentrations of sumac extract, revealed a 4-5 log cycle reduction in Bacillus spp. and 2-3 log cycle reduction in other bacteria tested with 1.0% sumac extract.
TI  - Growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens and food spoilage organisms by select raw honeys.
AB  - Twenty-seven honey samples from different floral sources and geographical locations were evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of seven food spoilage organisms (Alcaligenes faecalis, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Geotrichum candidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Penicillium expansum, Pseudomonas fluorescens) and five foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Ser. Typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) using an overlay inhibition assay. They were also tested for specific activity against S. aureus 9144 and B. stearothermophilus using the equivalent percent phenol test--a well diffusion assay corresponding to a dilute phenol standard curve. Honey inhibited bacterial growth due to high sugar concentration (reduced water activity), hydrogen peroxide generation, and proteinaceous compounds present in the honey. Some antibacterial activity was due to other unidentified components. The ability of honey to inhibit the growth of microorganisms varies widely, and could not be attributed to a specific floral source or demographic region produced in this study. Antibacterially active samples in this study included Montana buckwheat, tarweed, manuka, melaleuca, and saw palmetto. Furthermore, the bacteria were not uniformly affected by honey. Varying sensitivities to the antimicrobial properties were observed with four strains of S. aureus thus emphasizing the variability in the antibacterial effect of honey samples. Mold growth was not inhibited by any of the honeys tested. B. stearothermophilus, a heat-resistant spoilage bacteria, was shown to be highly sensitive to honey in both the overlay and well diffusion assays; other sensitive bacteria included A. faecalis and L. acidophilus. Non-peroxide antibacterial activity was observed in both assays; the highest instance was observed in the specific activity assay against B. stearothermophilus. Further research could indicate whether honey has potential as a preservative in minimally processed foods.
TI  - Chemical composition and in vitro antimicrobial activities of the essential oils  from endemic Psiadia species growing in mauritius.
AB  - The composition of the leaf oils, obtained by hydrodistillation, of five endemic  Psiadia species of the Asteraceae family were studied by GC/MS on both polar and non-polar columns. The analysis showed that the volatile components of the oils were made up essentially of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, aliphatics and other shikimic acid derivatives. With respect to the non-volatile components, great variations were observed: P. lithospermifolia contained (E)-isoasarone (51.5%); P. penninervia: eugenol (5.1%); P. terebinthina: eugenyl-acetate (4.0%); P. viscosa: pentyl-4-(1-methylethyl benzoate) (25.8%); P. arguta: isoeugenol (56.5%). In vitro antimicrobial assays using the agar-well diffusion method, revealed that most of the oils were not very active against the tested microorganisms except for that of P. lithospermifolia, which significantly inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aureofaciens, Aspergillus ochraceus, Candida pseudotropicalis, Kluyveromyces lactis and Fusarium moniliforme. This activity has been attributed to the presence of delta-elemene, (E)-farnesene, alpha-curcumene, selina-4,7(11)-diene, (E,Z)-alpha-farnesene, beta-bisabolene some of which have established antimicrobial profiles. Likewise, the fungi toxic action of the oil of P. arguta against Aspergillus ochraceus, Candida pseudotropicalis, and Fusarium moniliforme, may be attributed to the presence of isoeugenol, eugenol being known to be mycotoxic especially against Aspergillus species.
TI  - Phenolic compounds from Baseonema acuminatum leaves: isolation and antimicrobial  activity.
AB  - Three new phenolic compounds, 1-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-->4)-beta-D-galactopyranoside (1), 2-methoxy-5-(1 '2 3'-trihydroxypropyl)-phenyl- 1-0-(6"-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (2),and 2-methoxy-5-hydroxymethyl-phenyl-1-O-(6"-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (3), together with the known compounds benzyl 6'-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4), 1,6-di-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucopyranose (5), myrciaphenone B (6), kaempferol 3-0-(6"-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (7), quercetin 3-0-(6"-galloyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside (8), vomifoliol 9-O-beta-D-apiofuranosyl-(1-->6)-beta-D-glucopyranoside, 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran-2-(4'-hydroxy-3'-methoxyphenyl)-3-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosylox ymethyl-7-methoxy-5-propanol, and benzyl-O-alpha-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1-->6)-Beta-D-glucopyranoside were isolated from the leaves of Baseonema acuminatum P. Choux (Asclepiadaceae). Their structures were determined by 1D- and 2D-NMR spectroscopy and by ESI-MS analysis. The antimicrobial activity of all compounds was evaluated in vitro against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus two strains, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium) and three strains of Candida albicans. The new compounds 2 and 3, together with the known compound 4, showed antifungal activity against two clinically isolated Candida albicans strains and against C. albicans ATCC 2091; MIC values were in the range of 25-100 microg/mL. Compound 5 was active against the two clinically isolated strains of C. albicans with MICs of 12.5 microg/mL and 25 microg/mL. Compounds 1, 6, 7, and 8 inhibited only one strain of C albicans at the maximum concentration used. None of the phenolic compounds tested was active against the bacteria studied.
TI  - Food safety: emerging trends in foodborne illness surveillance and prevention.
AB  - Between 250 and 350 million Americans are estimated to suffer acute gastroenteritis annually, with 25% to 30% thought to be caused by foodborne illnesses. Most vulnerable to foodborne diseases are elderly people, pregnant women, immune-compromised people, and children. While bacterial causes such as Salmonella are widely recognized and monitored as foodborne infections, other important bacterial causes such as Clostridium perfringens , Bacillus cereus , and Staphylococcus aureus are less well known. While the majority of cases of foodborne diseases are of unknown cause, bacteria and viruses are the most likely causative agents. Caliciviridae (Norwalk-like) virus cases are more difficult to identify, but represent the most common cause of known and probably unknown cases. Fresh produce has to be added to the traditional list of foods requiring careful selection and handling to prevent foodborne disease. To assess the disease burden in the United States, morbidity and mortality surveillance activities are done by several networks and systems with collaboration among federal agencies and health departments. Not all important causes are being equally monitored. Critical behaviors by food processors, food retailers, foodservice personnel, and consumers can reduce the risk of foodborne illness episodes. Dietetics professionals can more readily monitor new developments and update knowledge and practice through online resources.
TI  - [Microbiological quality of minimally processed vegetable salads].
AB  - The microbiological condition of minimally processed vegetable salads (7-days durability) purchased in the retail network of Szczecin has been assessed. The study included 14 kinds of salads manufactured by two producers. The total count of mesophilic aerobic bacteria and their spores, aid-forming bacteria (lactobacilli), titre of coliforms, occurrence of pathogenic bacteria and counts of moulds and yeast were determined. No pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Proteus) was detected in all salads. However contamination by saprophytic microorganisms was high in salads of both producers. Total count of mesophilic aerobic bacteria was higher than recommended level (> 10(5) cfu/g) in majority of salads. The high quantities of yeast (> 10(3) jtk/g) and lactobacilli (10(3)-10(5) fu/g) were also stated. The titre of coliforms was reduced (down to 0.01-0.0001 g). The count of moulds did not exceed 100 cfu/g in a most of samples. Moulds occurring in tested samples were represented mainly by Penicillium sp.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - Glycopeptide derived from hen egg ovomucin has the ability to bind enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Ovomucin glycopeptide (OGP) was prepared by size exclusion chromatography after Pronase digestion of hen egg ovomucin, and the binding of OGP to foodborne pathogens (Bacillus cereus,Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, and Staphylococcus aureus) was investigaed. Binding assays with biotinylated bacteria as probes in microtiter plates showed that OGP bound to only E. coli O157:H7 among these foodborne pathogens. Periodate treatment markedly reduced the binding ability, indicating that E. coli O157:H7 bound to carbohydrate moieties of OGP. Lectin blot analysis with Maackia amurensis (MAA) and Sambucus nigra (SNA), which are specific for oligosaccharides containing sialic acid, revealed their binding sites in OGP were similar to the E. coli O157:H7 binding sites that were probed with biotinylated E. coli O157:H7 after Western blotting of OGP. Sialydase treatment of OGP abolished its ability to bind E. coli O157:H7, demonstrating that sialic acid played an important role in the binding. These results suggest that OGP has E. coli O157:H7-specific binding sites that consist of sialic acid. On the basis of these properties, OGP has the potential to be an ingredient with a protective effect against E. coli O157:H7 infection and to be a novel probe for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 in the food hygiene field.
TI  - Detection and characterization of beta-lactam resistance in Bacillus cereus PTCC  1015.
AB  - In the present study, detection, isolation, and characterization of beta-lactamases from Bacillus cereus PTCC 1015 were investigated. B. cereus was inoculated in nutrient broth containing ampicillin (50 mg x ml(-1)) for 24 h (35 degrees C, 200 rpm). Activity measurements were carried out against ampicillin (0.1 mg x ml(-1)) and cephalexin (0.08 mg x ml(-1)) by a spectrophotometric method at different conditions (pH 6-10, temperatures 25-45 degrees C). Maximum penicillinase and cephalosporinase activity was observed at pH 7. The optimized temperatures for penicillinase and cephalosporinase activity were 30 and 40 degrees C, respectively. At the above conditions, maximum enzymatic activity was calculated as 0.89 +/- 0.014 and 0.037 +/- 0.001 units against ampicillin and cephalexin.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of naturally occurring compounds against antibiotic-resistant Bacillus cereus vegetative cells and spores, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - After demonstrating the lack of effectiveness of standard antibiotics against the acquired antibiotic resistance of Bacillus cereus (NCTC 10989), Escherichia coli (NCTC 1186), and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 12715), we showed that the following natural substances were antibacterial against these resistant pathogens: cinnamon oil, oregano oil, thyme oil, carvacrol, (S)-perillaldehyde, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (beta-resorcylic acid), and 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine (dopamine). Exposure of the three pathogens to a dilution series of the test compounds showed that oregano oil was the most active substance. The oils and pure compounds exhibited exceptional activity against B. cereus vegetative cells, with oregano oil being active at nanogram per milliliter levels. In contrast, activities against B. cereus spores were very low. Activities of the test compounds were in the following approximate order: oregano oil > thyme oil approximately carvacrol > cinnamon oil > perillaldehyde > dopamine > beta-resorcylic acid. The order of susceptibilities of the pathogens to inactivation was as follows: B. cereus (vegetative) >> S. aureus approximately E. coli >> B. cereus (spores). Some of the test substances may be effective against antibiotic-resistant bacteria in foods and feeds.
TI  - Evaluation of antibacterial properties of some medicinal plants used in Iran.
AB  - Forty-five species of 29 plant families used in the traditional medicine by Iranian people, showed antibacterial activities against one or more of the bacterial species: Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Micrococcus luteus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis. No plant showed activity against Serratia marcescens; Bordetella bronchiseptica being the most susceptible species. All extracts showed the same activity 18 months later.
TI  - Validation of pH and glucose determination for bacteria detection screening in platelet concentrates stored in the Terumo Teruflex XT612 platelet container.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity of the essential oil of Curcuma zedoaria.
AB  - The chemical compositions of the essential oil of Curcuma zedoaria (Berg.) Rosc.  were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and showed a high content of epicurzerenone and curdione representing 46.6% and 13.7% of the total oil, respectively. The essential oil was evaluated for potential antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonasa aeruginosa, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella typhimurium and Bacillus cereus. V. parahaemolyticus was sensitive to the presence of the essential oil, while the most resistant strain appeared to be E. coli. Based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and cell morphology, the essential oil of C. zedoaria could inhibit the proliferation of human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. These results suggest that the essential oil has the antimicrobial activity against some of Gram- positive and negative pathogenic microorganisms and the components of the extract lead to the apoptosis of human cancer cell line.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - Validation of BacT/ALERT plastic culture bottles for use in testing of whole-blood-derived leukoreduced platelet-rich-plasma-derived platelets.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial detection of platelet (PLT)-rich-plasma (PRP)-derived PLTs  presents unique challenges for countries that do not allow pooling before storage. This study validated the BacT/ALERT for use in testing pooled PRP-derived PLTs with nine contaminating organisms. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into two PRP-derived PLT pools (target, 10 and 100 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL; actual recovered concentrations, 5 and 90 CFUs/mL). Four milliliters of each postbacterial inoculation sample was inoculated into both plastic aerobic and anaerobic bottles and 0.5 mL was plated onto blood agar. RESULTS: All organisms (excluding P. acnes) were detected in 8.2 to 22.0 and 7.6 to 20.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) and the mean time to detection was 15.0 and 13.1 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respective). P. acnes was detected with the anaerobic bottles in a mean of 74.9 and 64.3 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively). With E. cloacae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. viridans detection with the anaerobic bottles was faster or equivalent to the detection with the aerobic bottles. This was most notable with S. viridans where the anaerobic bottle was reactive on average 21.6 and 10.8 hours (10 and 100 CFUs/mL, respectively) faster than the aerobic bottle. CONCLUSIONS: This study validates the use of the BacT/ALERT system for the detection of bacteria in PRP-derived PLTs in a pooled format. Overall, the use of the BacT/ALERT system allowed the detection of pooled PRP-derived PLTs inoculated with nine bacteria at 10 and 100 CFUs per mL in 7.6 to 22.0 hours (excluding P. acnes).
TI  - [Organic extracts with antimicrobian activity from Penicillium sp. (Moniliales) isolated from the sponge Ircinia felix (Porifera: Demospongiae)].
AB  - This research expresses the potential of the bacterial activity present in the organic extracts obtained from Penicillium sp., isolated from the esponge Irciniafelix. This activity was evaluated through agar diffusion test and Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). The susceptibility trials of organic fractions were carried out against Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Bacillus cereus and B. subtilis. The use of the chromatographic techniques (CLV and TLC), permitted to obtain bioactive organic extracts of different polarities, of which only the EtOAc and MeOH fractions inhibited the growth of the bacteria used. Of the EtOAc fractionation, only fraction number 3 EtOAc/Hex presented greatest activity against the Gram-positive bacteria. Number 1 EtOAc/Hex fraction increased its activity against S. aureus (24 mm) and S. epidermidis (25 mm), which can be explained by the loss of possible antagonistic effect during the fractionation process. The CMI trials were carried out for the EtOAc number I subfraction against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus and B. subtilis, wich was clinical interest, and shows the potential of this organic extract as antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Essential oils: their antibacterial properties and potential applications in foods--a review.
AB  - In vitro studies have demonstrated antibacterial activity of essential oils (EOs) against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Shigella dysenteria, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus at levels between 0.2 and 10 microl ml(-1). Gram-negative organisms are slightly less susceptible than gram-positive bacteria. A number of EO components has been identified as effective antibacterials, e.g. carvacrol, thymol, eugenol, perillaldehyde, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamic acid, having minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.05-5 microl ml(-1) in vitro. A higher concentration is needed to achieve the same effect in foods. Studies with fresh meat, meat products, fish, milk, dairy products, vegetables, fruit and cooked rice have shown that the concentration needed to achieve a significant antibacterial effect is around 0.5-20 microl g(-1) in foods and about 0.1-10 microl ml(-1) in solutions for washing fruit and vegetables. EOs comprise a large number of components and it is likely that their mode of action involves several targets in the bacterial cell. The hydrophobicity of EOs enables them to partition in the lipids of the cell membrane and mitochondria, rendering them permeable and leading to leakage of cell contents. Physical conditions that improve the action of EOs are low pH, low temperature and low oxygen levels. Synergism has been observed between carvacrol and its precursor p-cymene and between cinnamaldehyde and eugenol. Synergy between EO components and mild preservation methods has also been observed. Some EO components are legally registered flavourings in the EU and the USA. Undesirable organoleptic effects can be limited by careful selection of EOs according to the type of food.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Cladonia foliacea and its (-)-usnic acid, atranorin, and fumarprotocetraric acid constituents.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of the chloroform, diethyl ether, acetone, petroleum ether, and ethanol extracts of the lichen Cladonia foliacea and its (-)-usnic acid, atranorin, and fumarprotocetraric acid constituents against 9 bacteria and fungi has been investigated. The extracts and pure compounds alone were found active against the same bacteria and the same yeasts. Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Proteus vulgaris, Listeria monocytogenes, Aeromonas hydrophila, Candida albicans, and Candida glabrata growth were inhibited. In addition, the MICs of the extracts, (-)-usnic acid, atranorin and fumarprotocetraric acid were determined.
TI  - PCR detection of Bacillus and Staphylococcus in various foods.
AB  - A broad-range PCR assay for the detection of bacteria belonging to Bacillus and Staphylococcus genera was developed. Primers targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were newly designed and used in a PCR assay. To determine the specificity of the assay, 81 different bacterial strains (of 50 genera), 2 fungi, 3 animals, and 4 plants were tested. Results were positive for every tested Bacillus, Staphylococcus, or Aerococcus strain. In addition, the result for Listeria grayi was positive with lower PCR product. For all other bacterial strains and eukaryotes tested, results were negative. Bacterial DNA was prepared with the use of achromopeptidase and Chelex 100 resin from culture after growth in brain heart infusion medium. To test the sensitivity of this PCR assay for Bacillus or Staphylococcus genus, either Bacillus cereus or Staphylococcus aureus was inoculated into various foods with undetectable levels of endogenous microbial contamination as an indicator. Inoculation of bacteria at 10 to 30 CFU/g of food was followed by a 5-h enrichment culture step after which the PCR assay allowed the detection of bacterial cells. When the inoculation (B. cereus or S. aureus) of 10 to 90 CFU/g into noodle foods containing endogenous microflora (10(3) to 10(5) CFU/g) was followed by a 6-h enrichment culture step, the PCR assay detected the bacteria. Including the enrichment culture step, the entire PCR detection process can be completed within 8.5 h.
TI  - Influence of the cell wall on ciprofloxacin susceptibility in selected wild-type  Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The susceptibility of several wild-type bacteria to ciprofloxacin and accumulation of the drug in these bacteria were evaluated. Species studied included Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus cereus. Ciprofloxacin susceptibility was measured for each strain using two different methods: the minimal inhibitory concentration and the bactericidal index. Significant differences were observed between the results derived from these two methods. Whereas the minimal inhibitory concentration was low in all strains tested, ciprofloxacin's bactericidal activity, as indicated by the bactericidal index, varied with the species studied. To determine whether this finding was due to variations in cell envelope permeability to ciprofloxacin (i.e. to combined cell uptake and efflux), we studied ciprofloxacin accumulation using spectrofluorometry. In Gram-negative bacteria, differences in permeability can lead to altered susceptibility to antibiotics. In fact, the combination of slow uptake and efficient efflux seems to be crucial to the characteristic poor susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin. However, the low level of activity of ciprofloxacin against S. aureus and two Bacillus species may have resulted from the drug's interaction with its target enzymes (i.e. topoisomerase IV in S. aureus and DNA gyrase in Bacillus spp.) rather than diminished permeability.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts and flavonoids from Eucalyptus maculata.
AB  - AIMS: We investigated the antimicrobial activities of eucalyptus leaf extracts to find effective antibacterial agents. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antimicrobial activities of leaf extracts from 26 species of eucalyptus were measured. Extracts of Eucalyptus globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis significantly inhibited the growth of six Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Propionibacterium acnes), and of a fungus (Trichophyton mentagrophytes), but they did not show strong antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas putida). 2',6'-dihydroxy-3'-methyl-4'-methoxy-dihydrochalcone, eucalyptin and 8-desmethyl-eucalyptin, isolated from E. maculata extracts, exhibited potent antimicrobial activities against seven micro-organisms with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.0 to 31 mg l(-1). CONCLUSIONS: The eucalyptus extracts and three compounds from E. maculata were found to be effective against micro-organisms that cause food poisoning, acne and athlete's foot. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows potential uses of extracts from E. globulus, E. maculata and E. viminalis, and antimicrobial compounds isolated from E. maculata.
TI  - Purification of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Bacteriocins are antibacterial substances of a proteinaceous nature that are produced by different bacterial species. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) produce biologically active peptides or protein complexes that display a bactericidal mode of action almost exclusively toward Gram-positive bacteria and particularly toward closely related species. Generally they are active against food spoilage and foodborne pathogenic microorganisms including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. There is an increased tendency to use natural occurring metabolites to prevent the growth of undesirable flora in foodstuffs. These metabolites could replace the use of chemical additives such as sorbic acid, sulfur dioxide, nitrite, nitrate, and others. For instance, bacteriocins produced by LAB may be promising for use as bio-preservaties. Bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria are typically cationic, hydrophobic peptides and differ widely in many characteristics including molecular weight, presence of particular groups of amino acids, pI, net positive charge, and post-translational modifications of certain amino acids. This heterogeneity within the LAB bacteriocins may explain the different procedures for isolation and purification developed so far. The methods most frequently used for isolation, concentration, and purification involve salt precipitation of bacteriocins from culture supernatants, followed by various combinations of gel filtration, ion-exchange chromatography, and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In this chapter, a protocol is described that combines several methods used in our laboratory for the purification of two cationic bacteriocins, Lactocin 705AL and Enterocin CRL10, produced by Lactobacillus casei CRL705 and Enterococcus mundtii CRL10, respectively.
TI  - Sensitization of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria to jenseniin G by sublethal injury.
AB  - Jenseniin G, a bacteriocin produced by Propionibacterium thoenii P126, is active  against related propionibacteria and some lactic acid bacteria and is sporostatic to botulinal spores. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of sublethal stress on jenseniin G activity. Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Staphylococcus aureus, and Yersinia enterocolitica were subjected to temperature, acid, and osmotic stresses in the presence of jenseniin G. The bacteriocin reduced the viability of sublethally injured cultures, although the extent of reduction varied with strain and treatment. E. faecalis was the most sensitive to temperature stress; no reduction of viable counts occurred in the absence of jenseniin G, and a 1.5-log reduction occurred in the presence of jenseniin G. B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus were more sensitive to jenseniin G when exposed to heat stress than when exposed to cold stress, whereas E. coli, Salmonella Typhimurium, and S. flexneri were more sensitive to jenseniin G when exposed to cold stress than when exposed to heat stress. When comparing an acid stress test alone to a combination of acid stress and jenseniin G, E. faecalis and L. monocytogenes showed the greatest sensitivities with 4.87- and 2.82-log reductions, respectively, after 7 days. All cultures except for S. aureus were adversely affected by the combination of salt stress and jenseniin G. Salmonella Typhimurium showed the greatest sensitivity to salt stress with jenseniin G (a 1.54-log reduction at day 7) when compared to salt stress alone (a 0.55-log reduction at day 7). Jenseniin G, like bacteriocins produced by other gram-positive species, has broader activity against stressed organisms.
TI  - Evaluation of the sanitization effectiveness of a denture-cleaning product on dentures contaminated with known microbial flora. An in vitro study.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To see if dentures contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Candida albicans, and herpes simplex virus 1 could be effectively decontaminated by using Medical Tabs for Dentures. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Ten methylmethacrylate dentures with processed soft liners (soft-liner dentures) and 10 methylmethacrylate dentures without processed soft liners (hard dentures) were aseptically fragmented and individually incubated with a target microorganism. Test denture fragments were immersed in Medical for 5 minutes, vortexed for 5 minutes, and serially diluted onto media. The control denture fragments were similarly treated in sterile water. For virus contamination, denture fragments were contaminated with 1.2 x 10(9) tissue culture infective dose (TCID)50/mL. They were treated with either Medical for 5 minutes (test fragments) or water (controls) for 5 minutes. Serial dilutions were performed and viral (TCID)50/mL titers were calculated using the Reed-Muench method. RESULTS: Medical treatments effectively eliminated C. albicans, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa from soft-liner dentures. Treatment of hard dentures eradicated C. albicans and reduced the numbers of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa to < 10. B. cereus showed a reduction of 10 microorganisms in hard dentures while the soft-liner dentures did not show an appreciable reduction. Viral analyses found that both types of dentures retained large amounts of virus when washed with water, but no virus was recovered from any of the 40 samples treated with Medical. CONCLUSION: A single use of Medical Tabs for Dentures is effective in eliminating certain species of microorganisms, including selected viruses, in vitro.
TI  - The antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito Aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of Gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  - Previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against Gram- Escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against Gram+ Micrococcus sp., is melanization. We examined the immune responses mounted by Aedes aegypti towards Gram- Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium, and Gram+ Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial Gram type and pathogenicity. These data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to the immune response against prokaryotes.
TI  - Use of novel PCR primers specific to the genes of staphylococcal enterotoxin G, H, I for the survey of Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from food-poisoning cases and food samples in Taiwan.
AB  - Data regarding the incidence of the newly found enterotoxigenic Staphylococcus aureus strains in food poisoning cases and in food samples were to date not available in Taiwan. In this study, PCR primers specific for the detection of SEG, H and I genes, i.e., seg, seh and sei, were used for the assay of 55 human isolates of S. aureus negative to the classical enterotoxins (SEA-->SEE) detection. These isolates were from the fecal specimens of the patients suffering from food poisoning outbreaks. Only eight strains were found to have the seg, seh and sei. The presence of other bacterial pathogens, such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Bacillus cereus and Salmonella spp. and perhaps, strains producing other new staphylococcal enterotoxins, in the fecal specimens of these patients, may account for these food poisoning cases. For 139 strains from food samples, such as frozen Chinese foods, Chinese sausages and lunch meals, sea strains accounted for the major portion and it seemed to be the most common SE type to coexist with seg, seh and sei. Only two strains had sec and none of them had seg, seh or sei. For strains without the classical SE genes, only 13 strains had seg, seh and/or sei. The above results imply that seg, seh and sei S. aureus strains play only a minor role in food-borne outbreaks in Taiwan.
TI  - Rugulotrosins A and B: Two new antibacterial metabolites from an Australian isolate of a Penicillium sp.
AB  - Two new antibacterial agents, rugulotrosin A (1) and B (2), were obtained from cultures of a Penicillium sp. isolated from soil samples acquired near Sussex Inlet, New South Wales, Australia. Rugulotrosin A (1) is a chiral symmetric dimer, and its relative stereostructure was determined by spectroscopic and X-ray crystallographic analysis. Rugulotrosin B (2) is a chiral asymmetric dimer isomeric with 1. Its structure was determined by spectroscopic analysis with comparison to the co-metabolite 1 and previously reported fungal metabolites. Both rugulotrosins A and B displayed significant antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis, while rugulotrosin A was also strongly active against Enterococcus faecalis and B. cereus.
TI  - Composition and bioactivity of the leaf essential oil of Heteropyxis dehniae from Zimbabwe.
AB  - The leaf oil of Heteropyxis dehniae Suess. (Heteropyxidaceae) was obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by GC/MS. The most abundant essential oil components are linalool (58.3%), 4-terpineol (9.8%), alpha-terpineol (3.6%), and caryophyllene oxide (3.1%). The antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger, and the in vitro cytotoxicity of the oil on PC-3, MDA-MB-231, Hs 578T, MCF7, SK-MEL-28, and 5637 human tumor cells were also examined. Caryophyllene oxide shows notable cytotoxic activity with LC50 values of 147-351 microM.
TI  - Phenolic metabolites of Dalea versicolor that enhance antibiotic activity against model pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - A new flavonoid (1) was isolated from organic extracts of Dalea versicolor, along with six known phenolic compounds (2-7). The structures of the seven compounds were determined by NMR and HRMS methods. These compounds were evaluated for direct activity against a variety of organisms in vitro, including the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. In addition, the compounds were evaluated for their ability to potentiate the activity of known antimicrobials through inhibition of multidrug-resistance (MDR) pumps. Compounds 1, 2, 4, and 7 exhibited direct or synergistic activity toward the human pathogen S. aureus and the opportunistic pathogen B. cereus. Compounds 4 and 7 were also found to potentiate the activity of berberine and of prescribed antibiotics, with 4 demonstrating a mode of action consistent with inhibition of the NorA MDR efflux pump in S. aureus.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of Carica papaya fruit on common wound organisms.
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate antibacterial activity of ripe and unripe Carica papaya on selected micro-organisms. Cultures of micro-organisms were routinely maintained in nutrient agar slants at 4 degrees C. Extracts of immature, mature and ripe Carica papaya fruit were obtained by separately grinding factions of the epicarp, endocarp and seeds and filtering them through gauze. Sensitivity tests were conducted by adding 0.06 ml of extract to agar wells (6 mm diameter) prepared from 20 ml agar seeded with 10(6) cells/ml suspension of one of the eight organisms per plate. The inoculated plates were allowed to equilibrate at 4 degrees C for 1 hour, incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 hours, and zones of inhibition measured in millimetres. Anti-bacterial activity was expressed in terms of the radius of zone of inhibition. Seed extracts from the fruit showed inhibition in the following order: B cereus > E coli > S faecalis > S aureus > P vulgaris > S flexneri. No significant difference was found in bacterial sensitivity between immature, mature and ripe fruits. No inhibition zone was produced by epicarp and endocarp extracts. Carica papaya seeds contain anti-bacterial activity that inhibits growth of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Observed activity was independent of stage of fruit maturity. Carica papaya has antibacterial effects that could be useful in treating chronic skin ulcers to promote healing.
TI  - Identification of emetic toxin producing Bacillus cereus strains by a novel molecular assay.
AB  - Bacillus cereus causes two types of gastrointestinal diseases: emesis and diarrhea. The emetic type of the disease is attributed to the heat-stable depsipeptide cereulide and symptoms resemble Staphylococcus aureus intoxication, but there is no rapid method available to detect B. cereus strains causing this type of disease. In this study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragment of unknown function was identified, which was shown to be specific for emetic toxin producing strains of B. cereus. The sequence of this amplicon was determined and a PCR assay was developed on this basis. One hundred B. cereus isolates obtained from different food poisoning outbreaks and diverse food sources from various geographical locations and 29 strains from other species belonging to the B. cereus group were tested by this assay. In addition, 49 non-B. cereus group strains, with special emphasis on food pathogens, were used to show that the assay is specific for emetic toxin producing B. cereus strains. The presented PCR assay is the first molecular tool for the rapid detection of emetic toxin producing B. cereus strains.
TI  - Antibacterial screening of plants used in Iranian folkloric medicine.
AB  - Fifty methanolic plant extracts belonging to 44 plant species of 33 families finding use in Iranian folkloric medicine were screened for antibacterial activity. Thirty samples, including 28 species in 20 families, had antibacterial activity against at least on one of the bacteria. Among the active plants, 32.6% were active against G(-), 62% against G(+), and 47.3% against both G(-) and G(+) bacteria. Dianthus coryophyllus was active against all tested G(-) and G(+) bacteria except Micrococcus luteus. Most susceptible G(-) bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bordetella bronchiseptica and least susceptible G(-) bacterium was Escherichia coli. In G(+) bacteria, most and least susceptible were Staphylococcus aureus and M. luteus, respectively. The least MIC, as 0.62 mg/ml, belonged to Myrtus communis seeds against S. aureus, Bacillus cereus and B. bronchiseptica, and to Terminalia chebula ripe seeds against S. aureus.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Artemisia douglasiana leaf essential oil.
AB  - Artemisia douglasiana leaf has been shown to be efficacious complementary herbal  treatment for chronic bladder infection in a paraplegic youth. The leaf oil has been analyzed by GC-MS and the major components found to be camphor (29%), artemisia ketone (26%), artemisia alcohol (13%), alpha-thujone (10%), 1,8-cineole (8%), and hexanal (5%). The leaf oil and the major components have been tested for antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, and Aspergillus niger. The essential oil shows limited antimicrobial activity in vitro, so it is unclear if the oil exerts a direct antimicrobial effect in vivo, or plays some role in stimulation of host defenses.
TI  - Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus PcrA helicases can support DNA unwinding and in vitro rolling-circle replication of plasmid pT181 of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Replication of rolling-circle replicating (RCR) plasmids in gram-positive bacteria requires the unwinding of initiator protein-nicked plasmid DNA by the PcrA helicase. In this report, we demonstrate that heterologous PcrA helicases from Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus cereus are capable of unwinding Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pT181 from the initiator-generated nick and promoting in vitro replication of the plasmid. These helicases also physically interact with the RepC initiator protein of pT181. The ability of PcrA helicases to unwind noncognate RCR plasmids may contribute to the broad-host-range replication and dissemination of RCR plasmids in gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Characterization of a broad range antimicrobial substance from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - AIMS: The aim of this research was to isolate and characterize an antimicrobial substance from the Bacillus cereus type strain ATCC 14579. METHODS AND RESULTS: A substance with antimicrobial activity was isolated from B. cereus ATCC 14579. The substance was produced during late exponential growth and well into the stationary phase with a maximum 9 h after inoculation. The inhibitory substance was purified by reverse-phase HPLC and shown to be highly active against closely related Bacillus spp. Clinically relevant species such as Staphylococcus aureus and Micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. The substance was characterized as a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (BLIS) with a molecular mass of ca 3.4 kDa. The BLIS was very heat stable, and sensitive only to pronase E and proteinase K. Antimicrobial activity was stable and high in the pH range of 2.0-9.0, and relatively unaffected by organic chemicals. CONCLUSIONS: An antimicrobial substance produced by the B. cereus type strain ATCC 14579 was characterized, with a wide spectrum of activity and the potential to be applied as a control agent against pathogenic bacteria. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The present study is the first report of a substance with antimicrobial activity from the B. cereus type strain.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of plastic culture bottles with an automated microbial detection system for nine common contaminating organisms found in PLT components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A microbial detection system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux [formerly Organon Teknika]) has previously been validated with a variety of bacterial contaminants in PLTs. The recovery of nine organisms seeded into PLTs with new plastic culture bottles was studied in comparison to the current glass bottles. The use of plastic instead of glass would be expected to reduce the risk of injury. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes were inoculated into Day 2 (>24 hr <48 hr) apheresis PLT units to 10 and 100 CFUs per mL. Replicate samples (4 mL) were inoculated into both current- and new-generation standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles. RESULTS: All organisms (with the exception of P. acnes) were detected in a mean time of 9.3 to 18.9 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 8.7 to 18.2 hours (100 CFUs/mL). In aggregate (with the exception of P. acnes), the plastic and glass aerobic bottles had a mean difference in detection of 1.2 hours (p < 0.0001), and the plastic and glass anaerobic bottles had a mean difference of 3.3 hours (p < 0.0001). In all cases, the mean detection time was superior or clinically comparable (within 0.1 hr) with the new plastic bottles. P. acnes (an anaerobic organism) was detected with the new and current anaerobic bottles in a mean of 72.8 and 90.4 hours (10 CFUs/mL) or 64.0 and 80.8 hours (100 CFUs/mL), respectively. The narrower bottle neck and smaller inoculation septum present with the new-generation plastic bottles were inoculated with comparable ease to that of the glass bottles. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the new plastic bottles are clinically comparable or superior to the current glass standard aerobic and anaerobic culture bottles.
TI  - Bacterial populations associated with meat from the deboning room of a high throughput red meat abattoir.
AB  - Developing countries are faced with high incidences of food poisoning outbreaks,  with obvious economic consequences. In highly perishable foodstuffs such as fresh red meat the threat of food poisoning is particularly intense. In this study, red meat samples were collected from a deboning room of a high throughput abattoir. The samples were analysed for the presence of Bacillus cereus., Staphylococcus aureus., Pseudomonas spp., Listeria monocytogenes., Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. The aerobic plate counts as well as Enterobacteriaceae were also enumerated. Almost without exception the counts exceeded the microbiological guidelines for raw meat as proposed by the South African Department of Health. The average B. cereus count over the sampling period was 8.32 x 10(3) cfu, g (-1), for S. aureus and Pseudomonas spp. 1.72 x 10(5) and 1.7 x 10(5) cfu g(-1) respectively and for E. coli 3.4 x 10(5) cfu g(-1). Sixty percent of the samples were positive for presumptive Salmonella spp. while 52% of the samples tested positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes. The aerobic plate and Enterobacteriaceae counts were 1.7 x 10(7) and 4.6 x 10(6) cfu g(-1), respectively. The data highlighted the need for a more systematic approach to ensuring safe food through implementing quality control methods to prevent the entry and proliferation of pathogens in meat and meat products, especially during processes with a high degree of handling, such as deboning.
TI  - [Evaluation of a colorimetric method for studying the interaction between microorganisms and intestinal epithelial cells].
AB  - The aim of the present study was to gain further insight on the reliability of the colorimetric determination of the activity of bacterial nitrate reductase to evaluate bacterial concentrations and interaction between microorganisms and enterocyte-like cells. Nitrite produced after incubation of the samples with a nitrate-formate solution was determined with a diazotization reaction with sulphanilic acid and N-naphthyl-ethylene-diamonium dichloride. Cell association assays were performed with differentiated Caco-2 cells. A biphasic relationship was found between nitrite concentration and bacterial densities. This behavior seems to be due to the sigmoideal character of the kinetics of nitrate reduction. Association to Caco-2 cells was strongly strain dependent being Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 the strain showing the highest values of association. For some strains, percentages of association calculated on the basis of the colorimetric assay were significantly higher than those calculated in terms of viable counts. Bacterial association with enterocyte-like cells can be evaluated by measures of the activity of bacterial nitrate reductase provided that the biphasic relationship between bacterial and nitrite concentrations is taken into account for the calculations. Results presented in this paper show the applicability of the colorimetric method to assess the amount of microorganisms associated to human enterocytes in culture.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
AB  - A water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against Escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. This 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (LMWC), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kDa, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. LMWC has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does LMWC. Accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against E. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of LMWC.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the fourth-generation fluoroquinolones gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin against ocular pathogens.
AB  - The ideal ophthalmic anti-infective exhibits broad-spectrum activity against gram-positive, gram-negative, and atypical bacterial species. These pathogens can cause potentially blinding infections such as keratitis and endophthalmitis, both of which are associated with ophthalmic surgery or traumatic injury. These infections often require aggressive antibacterial therapy, preferably with newer generations of antibiotics. In this study, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values for gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined in vitro against bacterial strains that were isolated from suspected cases of bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis. The ocular isolates included 7 gram-positive, 4 gram-negative, and 3 atypical bacterial species. Gatifloxacin and moxifloxacin exhibited similar activity against 6 gram-positive organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis. MIC90 values for the drugs against these isolates ranged from 0.08 mg/mL to 0.57 mg/mL and were comparable to previously published values against isolates from patients with systemic infections. The MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Streptococcus viridans was 0.22 mg/mL compared with 0.73 mg/mL for moxifloxacin (P = .011). Among the gram-negative isolates, the mean MIC90 for gatifloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 1.28 mg/mL compared with 2.60 mg/ mL for moxifloxacin (P = .023). MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter aerogenes were one fourth to one fifth the values for moxifloxacin. For the atypicals, the MIC90 values for gatifloxacin against Nocardia asteroides and Mycobacterium chelonae were one fourth the corresponding values for moxifloxacin. Gatifloxacin demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against several key ocular pathogens tested in this study and was at least as effective as moxifloxacin against these pathogens.
TI  - The role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  - Bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. Bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) Vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, E1 Tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) Escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) Shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) Clostridium perfringens (C. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) Clostridium difficile (toxins A and B); (f) Staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) Bacillus cereus (cytotoxin K and haemolysin BL); and (h) Aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). The mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane receptor. These effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, IP(3), Ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed Ca2+ and K+ permeable channels, which increase Ca2+ flux and augment changes in Ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane potential. Consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent Ca2+ influx, are affected. The toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. Although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.
TI  - [Microbiological quality of muesli samples purchased in retail network].
AB  - The estimation of microbiological quality of muesli samples was the aim of this investigation. The study included 40 samples which represented various consignments of muesli, produced in 2002 year. Total number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, yeasts and moulds, and also occurrence of pathogenic bacteria, coliforms and enterococci were determined. The systematic units of muesli fungal flora have been identified. It was stated that microbiological quality of all tested muesli was good. No pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus) was detected and also coliforms and enterococci titre was correct (> 0.1 g). A majority of samples characterized low contamination levels of mesophilic aerobic bacteria and fungi, and their total number did not exceed, suitably 10(3) and 10(2) cfu/g. The mesophilic aerobic bacteria were mainly represented by vegetative forms. The average share of these bacteria spores in total number of bacteria received 30%. The Aspergillus sp. and Penicillium sp. were regular elements of muesli fungal flora.
TI  - Phytoestrogen genistein as an anti-staphylococcal agent.
AB  - The soybean-derived isoflavone genistein has been shown to exert beneficial effects on many disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The effects of genistein on mammalian cells are mediated by its abilities to inhibit topoisomerase II and protein tyrosine kinase. In order to examine the potential antibacterial activities of genistein, we incubated the bacteria with various concentrations of this compound for different periods of time and assessed the viable counts. Exposure to genistein exhibited an inhibitory effect on all staphylococcal strains tested, including methicillin-resistant strains. Furthermore, the growth of Streptococcus pasteurianus, Bacillus cereus, and Helicobacter pylori was clearly inhibited by genistein, whereas Escherichia coli growth was not suppressed. Daidzein, which is structurally similar to genistein, but deficient in topoisomerase II inhibitory activity, also inhibited the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, albeit with lower potency than genistein. Our results indicate that genistein exerts potent antibacterial properties in vitro, which are possibly mediated by the stabilization of the covalent topoisomerase II-DNA cleavage complex.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of extracts of the lichen Cetraria aculeata and its protolichesterinic acid constituent.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activity of the acetone, diethyl ether and ethanol extracts of the lichen Cetraria aculeata has been investigated. The extracts were tested against twelve bacteria and eight fungi and found active against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Aeromonas hydrophila, Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes. No antimicrobial activity against the fungi was detected. It was determined that only one substance in the extracts has antimicrobial activity and it was characterized as protolichesterinic acid. The MICs of the extracts and protolichesterinic acid were also determined.
TI  - Antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of tick defensin against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Defensins are a major group of antimicrobial peptides and are found widely in vertebrates, invertebrates and plants. Invertebrate defensins have been identified from insects, scorpions, mussels and ticks. In this study, chemically synthesized tick defensin was used to further investigate the activity spectrum and mode of action of natural tick defensin. Synthetic tick defensin showed antibacterial activity against many Gram-positive bacteria but not Gram-negative bacteria and low hemolytic activity, characteristic of invertebrate defensins. Furthermore, bactericidal activity against pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria including Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was observed. However, more than 30 min was necessary for tick defensin to completely kill bacteria. The interaction of tick defensin with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane and its ability to disrupt the membrane potential was analyzed. Tick defensin was able to disrupt the membrane potential over a period of 30-60 min consistent with its relatively slow killing. Transmission electron microscopy of Micrococcus luteus treated with tick defensin showed lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane and leakage of cellular cytoplasmic contents. These findings suggest that the primary mechanism of action of tick defensin is bacterial cytoplasmic membrane lysis. In addition, incomplete cell division with multiple cross-wall formation was occasionally seen in tick defensin-treated bacteria showing pleiotropic secondary effects of tick defensin.
TI  - Synthesis of 6-fluoro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid derivatives as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In the present study, a series of 1-ethyl/benzyl-6-fluoro-7-(substituted piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carboxylic acid were synthesized and characterized by IR, 1H-NMR, mass spectral and elemental analysis. The in vitro antibacterial and antifungal activities of the compounds were evaluated by paper disc diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the compounds were also determined by agar streak dilution method. The in vivo antibacterial activity of the compounds against Escherichia coli was also evaluated by mouse protection test. All the compounds exhibited significant antibacterial and weak antifungal activities. The in vivo antibacterial activity (ED50) against E. coli was 50-160 mg kg(-1) in the order of 7<9<8<10. 1-ethyl-6-fluoro-7-(2,5-dioxo-piperazin-1-yl)1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-quinoline-3-carbox ylic acid (7) was found to exhibit the most potent in vitro antimicrobial activity with MIC of 4.1, 3.1, 3.1, 2.4, 1, 1, 25 and >100 microg mL(-1) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus luteus, Bacillus cereus, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger.
TI  - Effect of gamma irradiation on the survival of pathogens in kwamegi, a traditional Korean semidried seafood.
AB  - Kwamegi (semidried raw Pacific saury) is traditional seafood available in Korea.  It has water activity in the range of 0.90 to 0.95. Spoilage and the growth of most pathogenic bacteria is retarded because of low water activity, low temperature, and packaging. However, it is contaminated with bacteria of public health significance and poses a hazard to the consumer because it is consumed raw without any cooking. The effectiveness of these hurdles in preventing the growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Escherichia coli and the efficacy of irradiation treatment in eliminating these bacteria from kwamegi using inoculated pack studies was examined. Radiation sensitivity of S. aureus, B. cereus, Salmonella Typhimurium, and E. coli in kwamegi was investigated. D10-values of these organisms in kwamegi were 590 +/- 13.6, 640 +/- 14.9, 560 +/- 45.4, and 550 +/- 8.6 Gy, respectively. The growth of all four test organisms inoculated into these foods during 4 weeks of storage at an ambient winter temperature (ranging from -5 degrees C to +5 degrees C) was recorded. All four pathogens (inoculated at 10(6) CFU/g) were eliminated by irradiation at 4 kGy. These studies unequivocally demonstrate that irradiation, with a combination of low water activity and low temperature, results in microbiologically safe kwamegi.
TI  - Identification of foodborne bacteria by infrared spectroscopy using cellular fatty acid methyl esters.
AB  - Identification of bacterial species by profiling fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) has commonly been carried out by using a 20-min capillary gas chromatographic procedure followed by library matching of FAME profiles using commercial MIDI databases and proprietary pattern recognition software. Fast GC (5 min) FAME procedures and mass spectrometric methodologies that require no lipid separation have also been reported. In this study, bacterial identification based on the rapid (2 min) infrared measurement of FAME mixtures was demonstrated. The microorganisms investigated included Gram positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus anthracis, and Bacillus cereus, and Gram negative bacteria from the family Enterobacteriacae: Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, and Escherichia coli (four strains of E. coli), and non-Enterobacteriacae: Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Vibrio parahemolyticus. Foodborne bacterial mixtures of FAMEs were measured by using an attenuated total reflection (ATR)-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic procedure and discriminated by multivariate analysis. Results showed that the Enterobacteriacae could be discriminated from the vibrios. The identification was at the level of species (for the Bacillus and Vibrio genera) or strains (for the E. coli species). A series of bacterial FAME test samples were prepared and analyzed for accuracy of identification, and all were correctly identified. Our results suggest that this infrared strategy could be used to identify foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Duplex real-time SYBR green PCR assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  - A duplex real-time SYBR Green LightCycler PCR (LC-PCR) assay with DNA extraction  using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or less. The protocol used the same LC-PCR with 20 pairs of specific primers. The products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (T(m)) curve analysis. The 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive Escherichia coli, enteropathogenic E. coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli, enterotoxigenic E. coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus, Aeromonas spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Bacillus cereus. No interference with the LC-PCR assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. The detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool. The protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. However, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.
TI  - Composition and antimicrobial activity of Achillea clavennae L. essential oil.
AB  - The volatile constituents of Achillea clavennae L. (Asteraceae), rare plant of Europe, have been analysed using GC/MS. Twenty- five components making up 81.6% of the oil were characterized with camphor (29.5%), myrcene (5.5%), 1,8-cineole (5.3%), beta-caryophyllene (5.1%) and linalool (4.9%) being the major constituents. The essential oil was evaluated for antibacterial and antifungal activities. The screening of the antimicrobial activity of essential oil was conducted by a disc diffusion test against Gram-positive (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis) and fungal organisms (Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans). The activity was more pronounced against Gram-negative and fungal organisms than against Gram-positive bacteria. A. clavennae oil was found to possess antimicrobial activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and all fungal organisms.
TI  - Wessex shopping basket survey - a structured approach to local food sampling.
AB  - The shopping basket approach to food sampling, in which ready-to-eat food items from a shopping list were sampled at premises chosen at random, was adopted by 15 Environmental Health Departments in the Wessex region. A total of 2037 samples were analysed over a 30-month period. The microbiological quality varied considerably between food categories, with gravy and stock samples giving the highest proportion of satisfactory results. Sliced meats, cooked rice and sandwiches gave the poorest overall results. Whilst the majority of unsatisfactory results were due to elevated levels of indicator organisms (Aerobic Colony Count, Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli), unsatisfactory or potentially hazardous levels of pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens or Listeria monocytogenes) were detected in 1% of samples. Salmonella was not detected in any sample. The shopping basket survey was considered to be a useful way of structuring local sampling, and the random selection of premises was found to be a considerable advantage over previous sampling plans. In addition, the survey drew attention to a number of microbiological problems with specific food types, leading to more detailed investigations.
TI  - Consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  - To be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. A four-round Delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. The food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by Staphylococcus aureus. The use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella species, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Toxoplasma gondii, and Yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. Hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. The avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by Listeria monocytogenes, Noroviruses, and Vibrio species. The expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their educational efforts.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of konjac fluid on several food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - In this study, the bactericidal effects of Japanese alkaline foods on food-poisoning bacteria were evaluated. Konjac is an alkaline food soaked in calcinated calcium (the pH of konjac fluid ranges from 11.42 to 12.53). Konjac fluids completely inactivated Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 and E. coil O26:H9, Salmonella Enteritidis, Vibrio parahemolyticus. and Staphylococcus aureus. The initial level of 6 log CFU/ml dramatically decreased after incubation with konjac fluid, and no viable gram-negative bacterium cells could be detected within 1 to 2 days and no viable S. aureus cells could be detected within 3 to 5 days. On the other hand, treatment with konjac fluid was also effective in reducing levels of spore-forming bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium botulinum type E and type A). At least a 4-log reduction of spore-forming bacteria was obtained in konjac fluid within 7 to 14 days. Vegetative cells were more susceptible to konjac fluid than spores were. When the initial cell count was 6 log CFU/ml, a few surviving spores remained for 60 to 90 days, but no spores could be detected after 120 days. When the initial count of spore-forming bacteria was 3 to 4 log CFU/ml, the cells considered vegetative were completely inactivated within I to 3 days. Repeated treatment with konjac fluid caused complete inactivation of spores in less than 1 to 3 days. Our studies indicate that konjac fluid, which has a long history of use in food, will control food-poisoning bacterial contamination during the production or preservation of konjac and other foods and has a preventive effect on bacteria that can cause severe disease at uniquely low levels.
TI  - Antiplasmid effect of promethazine in mixed bacterial cultures.
AB  - Promethazine has been recognised as an effective antiplasmid agent in cultures containing a single bacterial species such as Escherichia coli, Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of heterogenity of the microbial flora on plasmid elimination by promethazine in a laboratory based model system of mixed bacterial infection. F'lac plasmid elimination of E. coli K12 LE140 was studied in the presence of a numerically predominant Gram-positive species (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis) by promethazine (0-120 mg/l) at 23, 37 and 39 degrees C. Growth kinetics of different bacterial species were studied at various temperatures without drug treatment in mixed bacterial cultures and it was found that the small number of added bacteria overgrew the pre-existing flora during the incubation period. We observed that bacterial-bacterial interactions modified the growth rate of individual bacterial species and gave selective advantages to some bacterial species of the microbial community. Some interactions between coexisting bacterial species enhanced the frequency of plasmid curing by promethazine in mixed cultures with S. epidermidis. In our experiments the plasmid curing action of promethazine was more effective at elevated temperature than at lower temperatures.
TI  - Surviving the acid test: responses of gram-positive bacteria to low pH.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria possess a myriad of acid resistance systems that can help  them to overcome the challenge posed by different acidic environments. In this review the most common mechanisms are described: i.e., the use of proton pumps, the protection or repair of macromolecules, cell membrane changes, production of alkali, induction of pathways by transcriptional regulators, alteration of metabolism, and the role of cell density and cell signaling. We also discuss the responses of Listeria monocytogenes, Rhodococcus, Mycobacterium, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, oral streptococci, and lactic acid bacteria to acidic environments and outline ways in which this knowledge has been or may be used to either aid or prevent bacterial survival in low-pH environments.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of Cissus quadrangularis L.
AB  - Extracts of Cissus quadrangularis L. were tested for antioxidant activity by beta-carotene linoleic acid model and also by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl model. The ethyl acetate fraction of both fresh and dry stem extracts at a concentration of 100 ppm showed 64.8% antioxidant activity in the beta-carotene linoleic acid system and 61.6% in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl system. This fraction showed the presence of sterols, vitamin C, and tannins as phytoconstituents. The antioxidant activity of methanol extract and aqueous extract were comparatively less significant than that of ethyl acetate extract, and n-hexane extract showed the least activity. The ethyl acetate extract and methanol extract of both fresh and dry stems further exhibited antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus species. The results of the study have implications in the use of C. quadrangularis as an antibacterial agent and more so as an antioxidant in several applications requiring these properties.
TI  - Rho-specific Bacillus cereus ADP-ribosyltransferase C3cer cloning and characterization.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases represent an expanding family of related exoenzymes, which are produced by Clostridia and various Staphylococcus aureus strains. Here we report on the cloning and biochemical characterization of an ADP-ribosyltransferase from Bacillus cereus strain 2339. The transferase encompasses 219 amino acids; it has a predicted mass of 25.2 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 9.3. To indicate the relationship to the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases, we termed the enzyme C3cer. The amino acid sequence of C3cer is 30 to 40% identical to other C3-like exoenzymes. By site-directed mutagenesis, Arg(59), Arg(97), Tyr(151), Arg(155), Thr(178), Tyr(180), Gln(183), and Glu(185) of recombinant C3cer were identified as pivotal residues of enzyme activity and/or protein substrate recognition. Precipitation experiments with immobilized RhoA revealed that C3cerTyr(180), which is located in the so-called "ADP-ribosylating toxin turn-turn" (ARTT) motif, plays a major role in the recognition of RhoA. Like other C3-like exoenzymes, C3cer ADP-ribosylates preferentially RhoA and RhoB and to a much lesser extent RhoC. Because the cellular accessibility of recombinant C3cer is low, a fusion toxin (C2IN-C3cer), consisting of the N-terminal 225 amino acid residues of the enzyme component of C2 toxin from Clostridium botulinum and C3cer was used to study the cytotoxic effects of the transferase. This fusion toxin caused rounding up of Vero cells comparable to the effects of Rho-inactivating toxins.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial testing of some new S-substituted-thiopyridines, thienopyridines, pyridothienopyrimidines and pyridothienotriazines.
AB  - The reaction of 5-acetyl-4-aryl-3-cyano-6-methylpyridine-2(1H)-thiones (1a, b) with 4-methylphenacyl bromide, chloro-N-arylacetamides or chloroacetonitrile gave the corresponding S-substituted thiopyridines 2a-c, 4a-f and 6a-c, respectively. The latter compounds underwent intramolecular Thorpe-Ziegler cyclization to give 2-substituted 5-acetyl-3-amino-4-aryl-6-methylthieno[2,3-b]pyridines 3a-c, 5a-f and 7a-c. Compounds 5a-f and 7b, c are key intermediates in the synthesis of the target compounds. Some compounds showed remarkable antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of commercial annatto extracts against selected pathogenic, lactic acid, and spoilage microorganisms.
AB  - Annatto preparations are used to impart distinctive flavor and color to foods and are a primary colorant in dairy foods such as cheese and butter. There are several reports indicating that certain fractions of the annatto plant have biological activities against microorganisms of significance in food fermentation, food preservation, and human health. However, little is reported describing the nature of the antimicrobial compound(s) or their potential presence in commercial annatto colorant preparations. This study was conducted to determine whether commonly available annatto extracts are capable of influencing the outgrowth of selected lactic acid, spoilage, and pathogenic microorganisms. Disk diffusion and tube macrodilution techniques were used to determine the MICs and MBCs of double-strength water-soluble annatto extracts. Standard antibiotic disks were used as controls for the disk diffusion assay. The results demonstrate that annatto has an inhibitory effect on Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Staphylococcus aureus, with MICs of 0.08, 0.31, and 0.16% (vol/vol) and diameters of inhibition of 9 to 10, 12 to 13, and 15 to 16 mm, respectively. A concentration of 0.63% (vol/vol) inhibited the growth of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, Lactococcus lactis, and Paenibacillus polymyxa. The MICs for Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus durans were 1.25 and 2.5% (vol/vol), respectively. No activity was detected against Lactobacillus plantarum, Bifidobacterium bifidum, yeasts, or selected gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of essential oils from Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae).
AB  - The chemical composition of essential oils from aerial parts of Thymus spinulosus Ten. (Lamiaceae) is reported. Four oils from plants growing in different environmental conditions were characterized by GC and GC-MS methods; the oils seem to indicate a new chemotype in the genus Thymus. Influences of soil and altitude characteristics on the essential oil composition are discussed. The oils showed antibacterial activity against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimuium Ty2, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria.
TI  - Horizontal transfer of drug-resistant aminoacyl-transfer-RNA synthetases of anthrax and Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The screening of new antibiotics against several bacterial strains often reveals  unexpected occurrences of natural drug resistance. Two examples of this involve specific inhibitors of Staphylococcus aureus isoleucyl-transfer-RNA synthetase 1 (IleRS1) and, more recently, Streptococcus pneumoniae methionyl-tRNA synthetase 1 (MetRS1). In both cases, resistance is due to the presence of a second gene that encodes another synthetase (IleRS2 or MetRS2). Here, we show that both S. pneumoniae MetRS2 and S. aureus IleRS2 have closely related homologues in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax. Furthermore, similar to drug-resistant pathogens, strains of B. anthracis and its closest relative, B. cereus, also have wild-type ileS1 and metS1 genes. Clostridium perfringens, the causative agent of gangrene, also has two metS genes, whereas Oceanobacillus iheyensis isolated from deep-sea sediments has a single ileS2-type gene. This study shows the importance of understanding complex evolutionary networks of ancient horizontal gene transfer for the development of novel antibiotics.
TI  - Vitreous and aqueous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous and aqueous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized study of 24 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy between September 2001 and May 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 24 patients after administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before the operation. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 23), vitreous (n = 23), and aqueous (n = 11) were 5.14 +/- 1.36 micro g/mL, 1.34 +/- 0.34 micro g/mL, and 1.08 +/- 0.54 micro g/mL respectively. Mean +/- SD sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 3.2 +/- 1.0 hours, 4.0 +/- 1.0 hours, and 3.9 +/- 1.1 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 26.17% and 21.02%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC(90 ) levels were achieved against many pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Orally administered gatifloxacin achieves therapeutic levels in the noninflamed human eye, and the activity spectrum appropriately encompass the bacterial species most frequently involved in the various causes of endophthalmitis. Because of its broad-spectrum coverage, low MIC(90) levels for the organisms of concern, and good tolerability, gatifloxacin represents a major advance in the prophylaxis or treatment of postoperative, posttraumatic, and bleb-associated bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Inactivation of bacteria and spores by pulse electric field and high pressure CO2 at low temperature.
AB  - The common methods for inactivation of bacteria involve heating or exposure to toxic chemicals. These methods are not suitable for heat-sensitive materials, food, and pharmaceutical products. Recently, a complete inactivation of many microorganisms was achieved with high-pressure carbon dioxide at ambient temperature and in the absence of organic solvent and irradiation. The inactivation of spores with CO(2) required long residence time and high temperatures, such as 60 degrees C. In this study the synergistic effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) in combination with high-pressure CO(2) for inactivation was investigated. The bacteria Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were suspended in glycerol solution and treated in the first step with PEF (up to 25 KV/cm) and then with high-pressure CO(2) not higher than 40 degrees C and 200 bar. The inactivation efficiency was determined by counting the colony formation units of control and sample. Samples of the cells subjected to PEF treatment alone and in combination with CO(2) treatment were examined by scanning electron microscopy to determine the effect of the processes on the cell wall. Experimental results indicate that the viability decreased with increasing electrical field strength and number of pulses. A further batch treatment with supercritical CO(2) lead to complete inactivation of bacterial species and decreased the count of the spores by at least three orders of magnitude, the inactivation being enhanced by an increase of contact time between CO(2) and the sample. A synergistic effect between the pulsed electric field and the high-pressure CO(2) was evident in all the species treated. The new low temperature process is an alternative for pasteurization of thermally labile compounds such as protein and plasma and minimizes denaturation of important nutrient compounds in the liquid media.
TI  - [Observations of characteristics of the mechanisms of biological oxidation of cell wall-deficient bacteria].
AB  - The L-forms were induced from Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus by beta-lactam antibiotics and then observations on the properties of oxygen requirement, sugar fermentation and sensitive to cyanide of the L-forms were done. The results were shown that the L-forms derived from the obligate aerobe or the facultative anaerobe did not ferment sugars and were highly oxygen-dependent and more sensitive to cyanide than their parent bacteria. The metabolic activities which were same as the parent bacteria of the L-forms would return after the L-forms reverted to the typical bacteria forms. It was possible that the changes of biological oxidation mechanism were due to the deficiency of the cell wall which led to loss of the periplasmic space or the membrane-wall interlayer so that the enzymes for fermentation existed in the space could not be hold.
TI  - Vitreous penetration of orally administered gatifloxacin in humans.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the penetration of gatifloxacin, a novel extended-spectrum fluoroquinolone antibiotic, into the vitreous humor after oral administration. METHODS: A prospective, nonrandomized clinical study of 20 consecutive patients scheduled for pars plana vitrectomy surgery between September 2001 and February 2002 at the Cullen Eye Institute, Houston, Texas. Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and analyzed from 20 patients after oral administration of two 400-mg gatifloxacin tablets taken 12 hours apart before surgery. Assays were performed using high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Mean gatifloxacin concentrations in serum (n = 19), vitreous (n = 19), and aqueous (n = 10) 4.98 +/- 1.14 micrograms/mL, 1.35 +/- 0.36 microgram/mL, and 1.09 +/- 0.57 micrograms/mL, respectively. Mean sampling times after oral administration of the second gatifloxacin tablet for serum, vitreous, and aqueous were 2.99 +/- 0.73 hours, 3.79 +/- 0.81 hours, and 3.71 +/- 0.87 hours, respectively. The percentages of serum gatifloxacin concentration achieved in the vitreous and aqueous were 27.13% and 21.85%, respectively. Mean inhibitory vitreous and aqueous MIC90 levels were achieved against a wide spectrum of pathogens, including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Propionibacterium acnes, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Proteus mirabilis, and other organisms. CONCLUSIONS: Gatifloxacin is a novel fourth-generation fluoroquinolone antibiotic that has MIC90 levels significantly lower than those of other fluoroquinolone agents. Furthermore, it penetrates well into the vitreous cavity in the noninflamed eye. Potential uses for oral gatifloxacin may include prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in open-globe injuries, surgical prophylaxis against postoperative endophthalmitis, and adjunctive therapy for the current management of bacterial endophthalmitis.
TI  - Eggshell matrix proteins as defense mechanism of avian eggs.
AB  - This study focused on the role of eggshell matrix proteins as a function of potential natural antimicrobial defenses of avian eggs. The electrophoretic profile of SDS-PAGE showed that the soluble eggshell matrix proteins had three major bands of 15 000, 36 000, and 66 000 and several minor bands comprising 17 000, 25 000, 30 000, and 75 000, while insoluble matrix proteins were consisting of various bands comprising at least 16 distinct migration bands between 10 000 and 200 000. Three bacteria species, Pseudomonas aureginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus, were found to be inhibited in the presence of soluble eggshell matrix proteins (100 microg/mL). On the other hand, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enteritidis were weakly inhibited at only an early stage of incubation time (up to 4 h). Scanning electron microscopy revealed that eggshell matrix proteins might interact and disrupt the membrane integrity of bacteria. The present study clearly indicated that avian eggshell matrix proteins possess a potential of novel antimicrobial defensin mechanism.
TI  - Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis and Bacillus mycoides differentiation using a PCR-RE technique.
AB  - A method was developed to differentiate between Bacillus cereus, Bacillus mycoides and Bacillus thuringiensis using the polymerase chain reaction combined with a restriction endonuclease (PCR-RE) technique. This fast and simple protocol, applied to pure culture strains, was developed using the gyrB DNA sequence, as previously proposed by other authors. Strains from international collections were used to optimize the method which was then applied to the identification of strains isolated from food samples. Amplifications were specific for the B. cereus group. Only Staphylococcus aureus gave the same size PCR product, but it was easily differentiated from strains in the B. cereus group by using restriction analysis, based on digestion with the RsaI, Sau3AI and EcoRI endonucleases. Specific amplifications and good differentiations were obtained using pure strains, suggesting the possibility of using the method described to identify the B. cereus group directly in food samples.
TI  - Application of a real-time biosensor to detect bacteria in platelet concentrates.
AB  - A spore-based biosensor for detecting low levels of bacteria in real-time has been recently developed. The system (termed LEXSAS, label-free exponential signal-amplification system) exploits spore's ability to produce fluorescence when sensing neighboring bacterial cells. We studied the LEXSAS as a possible approach for identifying bacterially contaminated platelet concentrates prior to transfusion because the system offers rapid analysis, high sensitivity, and low cost. If successful, this approach could reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality from transfusion-related bacteremia and sepsis. In this study, we used the LEXSAS for detecting bacteria in platelet concentrates spiked with Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. Bacteria were separated from platelets using a 2-min procedure based on bacterial resistance to detergents and osmotic shock. The results indicate that the LEXSAS could be used to design a practical biosensor for identifying bacterially contaminated platelets in real-time.
TI  - Isolation of nisin-producing Lactococcus lactis WNC 20 strain from nham, a traditional Thai fermented sausage.
AB  - A total of 14,020 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from nham and screened for bacteriocin production. One Lactococcus lactis strain WNC 20 produced a bacteriocin that not only inhibited closely related LAB, but also some food-borne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Biochemical studies revealed that the bacteriocin was heat-stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10). The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K but not other proteases. The antimicrobial spectrum and some characteristics of this bacteriocin were nearly identical to that of nisin. The gene encoding this bacteriocin was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with nisin gene-specific primer. Sequencing of this gene showed identical sequences to nisin Z as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis WNC 20 may be useful in improving the food safety of the fermented product.
TI  - [Study on the antibacterial activity of ginkgolic acids].
AB  - In this article we studied the anti-bacterial activity of the extract from testa  of Ginkgo biloba and ginkgolic acids. They can inhibit the growth of Staphylocococus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus and MRSA. Ginkgolic acids combined with peniciline can enhance their inhibitory activity to MRSA.
TI  - An investigation into the microflora of heroin.
AB  - In 2000, an unusual increase of morbidity and mortality among illegal injecting drug users in the UK and Ireland was reported and Clostridium novyi was identified as the likely source of the serious infection, although infections due to C. botulinum and Bacillus cereus were also reported. Because heroin was a possibile source of infection, this study investigated the microflora of heroin samples seized in England during 2000 and 2002. Two methods were developed for the examination of the microflora of heroin. The first consisted of suspension of the drug in maximum recovery diluent (MRD) which was inoculated directly into Clostridium Botulinum Isolation Cooked Meat Broth (CBI). The second method rendered the heroin soluble in citric acid, concentrated particulate material (and bacterial cells) by filtration and removed heroin residues by washing with citric acid and phosphate-buffered saline before placing the filter in CBI broth. Duplicate CBI broths from both methods were incubated without heating and after heating at 60 degrees C for 30 min. Subcultures were made after incubation for 7 and 14 days on to eight different solid media. The methods were evaluated with heroin samples spiked with either C. botulinum or C. novyi spore suspensions; recovery of 10 spores in the original sample was demonstrated. Fifty-eight heroin samples were tested by citric acid solubilisation and 34 by the MRD suspension technique. Fifteen different gram-positive species of four genera were recognised. No fungi were isolated. Aerobic endospore-forming bacteria (Bacillus spp. and Paenibacillus macerans) were the predominant microflora isolated and at least one species was isolated from each sample. B. cereus was the most common species and was isolated from 95% of all samples, with B. licheniformis isolated from 40%. Between one and five samples yielded cultures of B. coagulans, B. laterosporus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis and P. macerans. Staphylococcus spp. were isolated from 23 (40%) samples; S. warneri and S. epidermidis were the most common and were cultured from 13 (22%) and 6 (10%) samples respectively. One or two samples yielded cultures of S. aureus, S. capitis and S. haemolyticus. The remainder of the flora detected comprised two samples contaminated with C. perfringens and two samples with either C. sordellii or C. tertium. Multiple bacterial species were isolated from 43 (74%) samples, a single species from the remaining 15. In 13 samples B. cereus alone was isolated, in one B. subtilis alone and in one sample B. pumilus alone. C. botulinum and C. novyi were not isolated from any of the heroin samples. Recommendations for the optimal examination of the microflora of heroin are given.
TI  - Microbiological quality of 18 degrees C ready-to-eat food products sold in Taiwan.
AB  - A total of 164 samples of 18 degrees C ready-to-eat (RTE) food products, purchased in 1999-2000 from convenience stores and supermarkets in central Taiwan, were examined to determine the microbiological quality of these products. The 18 degrees C RTE food products, manufactured by 16 factories, were divided into groups based on the type of food and their major ingredients. Aerobic plate count, coliforms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and psychrotrophic Pseudomonas spp. were evaluated. The incidence of E. coli and coliforms in these 18 degrees C RTE food products was 7.9% and 75.0%, respectively, while 49.8% and 17.9% of the samples were found to contain B. cereus and S. aureus, respectively. Among the samples tested, 1.3% of the food products contained more than 10(5) CFU g(-1) of B. cereus and 0.7% contained more than 10(5) CFU g(-1) of S. aureus. The pH values of the samples were all below 7.0, except for cold noodles, which had pH values ranging from 5.18 to 8.20. Among the five types of 18 degrees C food products tested, the highest incidence of E. coli (16%) and Pseudomonas spp. (64.0%) were detected in hand-rolled sushi in a cone shape. On the other hand, the highest incidence rate of coliforms, B. cereus, and S. aureus were found in sandwiches (88%), cold noodles (66.7%) and rice balls rolled in seaweed (25.0%), respectively. Food products made of ham contained the highest incidence of coliforms (88.0%) and E. coli (16.0%), while food products containing meat and ham as the major ingredients had the highest incidence rates of B. cereus (62.5%) and S. aureus (26.1%), respectively. For coliforms, E. coli, B. cereus and S. aureus, the percentage of 18 degrees C RTE food products exceeding the microbiological standards for RTE food accepted by Republic of China was 75.0%, 7.9%, 49.8% and 17.9%, respectively.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of extracts from some edible plants commonly consumed in Asia.
AB  - Extracts of edible plants (26 species) from China, Japan, Thailand and Yemen were screened for their antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli and Salmonella infantis. Buffered methanol (80% methanol and 20% PBS) and acetone extracted inhibitory substances against tested bacteria from 16 plants, as revealed by the disc assay. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of extracts determined by the agar dilution method ranged from 165 to 2640 mg l(-1). The most sensitive microorganism to extracts from Azadirachta indica, Cinnamomum cassia, Rumex nervosus, Ruta graveolens, Thymus serpyllum and Zingiber officinale was B. cereus, with MIC of 165 to 660 mg l(-1). E. coli and S. infantis were only inhibited by Cinnamomum cassia extracts at the highest MIC (2640 mg l(-1)). L. monocytogenes (Tottori) was more resistant than the ATCC 7644 strain to extracts from Ruta chalepensis, Artemisia absinthium and Cissus spp. EDTA (0.85 mM) reduced the MICs of Cinnamomum cassia and Cissus rotundifolia by at least 50% when tested against E. coli, S. infantis, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of Lantana  xenica.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the chemical composition of Lantana xenica essential oil and its antimicrobial activity. The oil from the aerial parts of Lantana xenica Mold. (Verbenacea) was obtained by steam distillation and analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The major constituent of the oil was (E)-caryophyllene (35.2 %), with minor amounts of gamma-cadinene (13.3 %), alpha-pinene (9.3 %), ocimene (9.2 %) and germacrene D (6.6 %). The antimicrobial assays showed that the essential oil of L. xenica inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus and Proteus mirabilis and both bacteria were inhibited by (E)-caryophyllene, the major component of the oil. Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S. aureus showed a lower inhibition. The bacteria Micrococcus luteus, Klebsiella sp., Escherichia coli and the yeast Candida albicans were insensitive to both the oil and (E)-caryophyllene.
TI  - Screening of some Siberian medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extracts of 16 Siberian medicinal plants was tested against five species of microorganisms: Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. Of the 16 plants tested, 12 showed antimicrobial activity against one or more species of microorganisms. The most active antimicrobial plants were Bergenia crassifolia, Chelidonium majus, Rhaponticum carthamoides, Sanguisorba officinalis, and Tussilago farfara.
TI  - Antimutagenicity of some edible Thai plants, and a bioactive carbazole alkaloid,  mahanine, isolated from Micromelum minutum.
AB  - The antimutagenic activity against Trp-P-1 of methanolic extracts of 118 samples  (108 species) of edible Thai plants was examined by the Ames Test. The activity was evaluated by the amount of plant extracts which suppressed 90% of the mutagenesis (ED90). Five plants, Micromelum minutum, Oroxylum indicum, Cuscuta chinensis, Azadirachta indica, and Litsea petiolata, exhibited significant activity with antimutagenic ED90 values lower than 5 microL/plate (0.1 mg of dry plant material equivalent). The activity-guided fractionation of the extract of M. minutum, which exhibited the highest antimutagenic activity in the screening, resulted in the isolation of an active principle, (+)-mahanine (1) as confirmed by its physicochemical properties. Compound 1 showed a wide variety of biological activity, including antimutagenicity against heterocyclic amines such as Trp-P-1 with an IC50 of 5.2 microM, cytotoxicity against a tumor cell line HL60 with a MIC100 of 4.0 microg/mL, and antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus with MIC100 values of 6.25 and 12.5 microg/mL, respectively.
TI  - Street foods in Accra, Ghana: how safe are they?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the microbial quality of foods sold on streets of Accra and factors predisposing to their contamination. METHODS: Structured questionnaires were used to collect data from 117 street vendors on their vital statistics, personal hygiene, food hygiene and knowledge of foodborne illness. Standard methods were used for the enumeration, isolation, and identification of bacteria. FINDINGS: Most vendors were educated and exhibited good hygiene behaviour. Diarrhoea was defined as the passage of > or =3 stools per day) by 110 vendors (94.0%), but none associated diarrhoea with bloody stools; only 21 (17.9%) associated diarrhoea with germs. The surroundings of the vending sites were clean, but four sites (3.4%) were classified as very dirty. The cooking of food well in advance of consumption, exposure of food to flies, and working with food at ground level and by hand were likely risk factors for contamination. Examinations were made of 511 menu items, classified as breakfast/snack foods, main dishes, soups and sauces, and cold dishes. Mesophilic bacteria were detected in 356 foods (69.7%): 28 contained Bacillus cereus (5.5%), 163 contained Staphylococcus aureus (31.9%) and 172 contained Enterobacteriaceae (33.7%). The microbial quality of most of the foods was within the acceptable limits but samples of salads, macaroni, fufu, omo tuo and red pepper had unacceptable levels of contamination. Shigella sonnei and enteroaggregative Escherichia coli were isolated from macaroni, rice, and tomato stew, and Salmonella arizonae from light soup. CONCLUSION: Street foods can be sources of enteropathogens. Vendors should therefore receive education in food hygiene. Special attention should be given to the causes of diarrhoea, the transmission of diarrhoeal pathogens, the handling of equipment and cooked food, hand-washing practices and environmental hygiene.
TI  - Evaluation of a new generation of culture bottle using an automated bacterial culture system for detecting nine common contaminating organisms found in platelet components.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An automated bacterial culture system (BacT/ALERT 3D, bioMerieux) has been previously validated with a variety of bacteria in platelets. The recovery of bacteria in platelets using a new generation of culture bottles that do not require venting and that use a liquid emulsion sensor was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus viridans, and Propionibacterium acnes isolates were inoculated into Day 2 platelets to concentrations of 10 and 100 CFU per mL. Samples were then studied with current and new aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles. RESULTS: All organisms, except P. acnes, were detected in a mean time of 9.2 to 20.4 (10 CFU/mL) or 8.7 to 18.6 (100 CFU/mL) hours. P. acnes was detected in a mean time of 69.2 (10 CFU/mL) or 66.0 (100 CFU/mL) hours. The 10-fold increase in inoculum was associated with a mean 9.2 percent difference in detection time. The aerobic, anaerobic, and pediatric bottles had a mean difference in detection time (hours) between the current and new bottles of 0.10 (p=0.61), 0.4 (p=0.38), and 1.0 (p < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: No difference in detection time between the current and new aerobic and anaerobic bottles was demonstrated. The new pediatric bottles had a small but significant delay in detection.
TI  - Isolation of S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide and six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates from Allium siculum.
AB  - Isolation and identification of (S(S)R(C))-S-n-butylcysteine sulfoxide (1) from the bulbs of Allium siculum is reported. This compound was found in all parts of the plant (bulbs, stem, leaves, and flowers) along with known compounds (S(S)R(C))-S-methyl- and (R(S)R(C))-(E)-S-(1-propenyl)cysteine sulfoxides (2 and 3, respectively). In addition, six n-butyl-containing thiosulfinates (4-9) have been found in a CH2Cl2 extract of the bulbs. Structures were determined by a combination of spectral methods (primarily NMR and MS) and by comparison with authentic compounds obtained by synthesis. Antimicrobial activities of 4-7 and 9 are reported.
TI  - Prevalence of and resistance to anti-microbial drugs in selected microbial species isolated from bulk milk samples.
AB  - The prevalence of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative (CN) staphylococci, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Bacillus cereus, was investigated in 111 bulk milk samples. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 38 samples, CN staphylococci from 63 samples, E. coli from 49 samples, E. faecalis or E. faecium from 107 samples, and L. monocytogenes from two samples. Bacillus cereus was not found in any of the samples and three samples were free of any of the selected species. Sensitivity to the anti-microbial drugs amikacin, ampicillin, ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin (CLT), cephotaxime, clindamycin, chloramphenicol (CMP), co-trimoxazole, erythromycin (ERY), gentamicin, neomycin, norfloxacin, oxacillin, penicillin, streptomycin (STR), tetracycline (TTC) and vancomycin was tested using the standard dilution technique. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) characteristics (MIC50, MIC90, MIC range) were determined for each microbial species. Resistance against one or more anti-microbial drugs was found in 93% of S. aureus, 40% of CN staphylococci, 73% of E. coli, 88% of E.faecalis, 55% of E.faecium, and one L. monocytogenes strain. Most of the strains, particularly enterococci, were resistant to STR, TTC, and ERY (MIC50 4 microg/ml). A high percentage of staphylococci were resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. High resistance to CLT was found in 11 strains of E. coli (MIC 256 microg/ml) and strains resistant to CMP (MIC90 16 microg/ml) were detected. The highest numbers of resistance phenotypes were found in E. coil (16) and CN staphylococci (12). Eighteen identical resistance phenotypes were demonstrated in indicator bacteria (E. coli, E. faecalis, E. faecium) and pathogens (S. aureus, CN staphylococci) isolated from the same bulk milk sample. The obtained resistance data were matched against the herd owners' information on therapeutic use of the drugs. This confrontation could not explain the findings of strains resistant to ERY or CMP. Our findings are evidence of selection of resistant strains among not only pathogenic agents, but also among indicator bacteria which can become significant carriers of transmissible resistance genes.
TI  - Antimicrobial studies on three species of Hypericum from the Canary Islands.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of several extracts and fractions of the aerial parts  of Hypericum canariense, Hypericum glandulosum and Hypericum grandifolium was investigated using the disc diffusion and broth microdilution methods against twelve reference microorganisms (eight bacterial and four fungal strains). The methanol extract and chloroform fraction of H. canariense, as well as the methanol extracts, butanol and chloroform fractions of both H. glandulosum and H. grandifolium exhibited a good antibacterial activity against four Gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus var. mycoides, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and the Gram-negative bacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica with the diameters of growth inhibition area in the range 10-25 mm and MICs values between 0.03 and 0.29 mg/ml. Neither the infusions and aqueous fractions of the species studied nor the butanol fraction of H. canariense showed any antibacterial activity against the tested microorganisms. Amongst the active extracts, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination showed that the H. canariense chloroform fraction was the most active against M. luteus, S. aureus and S. epidermidis. No antifungal activity was seen with any of the extracts or fractions tested. The results of this study support the use of these species in Canarian traditional medicine to treat skin infections.
TI  - New labdene iterpenes from Eupatorium glutinosum.
AB  - The new diterpene glucoside 3,15-dihydroxy-ent-labd-7-en-17-oic acid 3-O-beta-D-glucoside (1) and its aglycone (2) have been isolated from Eupatorium glutinosum. The structures were determined by IR, one- and two-dimensional NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, chemical transformations, and comparison of spectroscopic data with closely related diterpenes. Crude extracts showed antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities, but compounds 1 and 2 showed only antimicrobial activity. These results support the vernacular medicinal use of the plant as an antimicrobial.
TI  - Essential oil constituents and in vitro antimicrobial activity of Decalepis hamiltonii roots against foodborne pathogens.
AB  - Hydrodistillation of Decalepis hamiltonii roots yielded an essential oil (0.33% v/w) that contained 2-hydroxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (37.45%), 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde (31.01%), 4-O-methylresorcylaldehyde (9.12%), benzyl alcohol (3.16%), and alpha-atlantone (2.06%) as major constituents, with aromatic aldehydes constituting the main fraction of this root's essential oil. The oil was tested for its antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens responsible for food spoilage and human pathologies using standard antimicrobial assays. It exhibited strong antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megaterium, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, and Staphylococcus aureus at a concentration range of 1:0 with inhibitory activities of 27, 23, 16, 19, 22, 19, and 23 mm, respectively, which are comparable to those of the standards. The roots of D. hamiltonii, therefore, may be considered as an inexpensive source of an essential oil rich in antimicrobial compounds against foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat cooked foods from a centralized school kitchen in Argentina.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbiological and sensory quality as well as the safety of ready-to-eat (RTE) cooked foods prepared in and distributed from a centralized kitchen to schools in Argentina. A total of 101 cooked food samples delivered as hot RTE cooked foods (group A) and as RTE cooked foods at room temperature (group B) and 140 surface swab environment samples were collected from February to November 1999. Petrifilm plates were used for aerobic (PAC), coliform (PCC), and Escherichia coli (PEC) counts. Standard methods were used to determine Enterobacteriaceae (EntC) and thermotolerant coliform counts (TCC). Samples were also tested for the presence of Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens. Food temperatures just before samples were put into containers ranged from 80 to 98 degrees C and from 28 to 32 degrees C for group A and group B, respectively. For group A food samples, PAC ranged from 1.04 to 3.50 log CFU/g, and PCC, PEC, TCC, and EntC were not detected. For group B food samples, PAC ranged from 3.63 to 6.48 log CFU/g, PCC ranged from 1.90 to 5.36 log CFU/g, TCC ranged from 1.30 to 3.95 log CFU/g, and EntC ranged from 3.60 to 5.46 log CFU/g. Of the foodborne pathogens, only B. cereus was isolated (63.4% of samples) in both food groups (<4 log CFU/g). The microbiological and sensory quality and the safety of group A foods were satisfactory. Large numbers of PAC and EntC detected in group B foods show that better control is needed to avoid potential foodborne diseases.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of chitosans and chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights.
AB  - Antibacterial activities of six chitosans and six chitosan oligomers with different molecular weights (Mws) were examined against four gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Salmonella typhimurium, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus) and seven gram-positive bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus megaterium, B. cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Lactobacillus plantarum, L. brevis, and L. bulgaricus). Chitosans showed higher antibacterial activities than chitosan oligomers and markedly inhibited growth of most bacteria tested although inhibitory effects differed with Mws of chitosan and the particular bacterium. Chitosan generally showed stronger bactericidal effects with gram-positive bacteria than gram-negative bacteria in the presence of 0.1% chitosan. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of chitosans ranged from 0.05% to >0.1% depending on the bacteria and Mws of chitosan. As a chitosan solvent, 1% acetic acid was effective in inhibiting the growth of most of the bacteria tested except for lactic acid bacteria that were more effectively suppressed with 1% lactic or formic acids. Antibacterial activity of chitosan was inversely affected by pH (pH 4.5-5.9 range tested), with higher activity at lower pH value.
TI  - Antimicrobial synergistic effect of linolenic acid and monoglyceride against Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The antimicrobial effect of linolenic acid with or without monoglyceride (glycerol laurate or glycerol myristate) against six food-borne microorganisms was determined in broth medium. Minimum inhibitory concentration of linolenic acid on Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus was 20 and 50 ppm, respectively. The growth of B. cereus treated with linolenic acid at 10 ppm with 10 ppm monoglyceride was more inhibitory than that of linolenic acid alone, and the viable cell population was reduced 2-4 log cycles compared to that of the control. When linolenic acid was added at that level, the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration of extracellular fluid was drastically increased compared with that of the control, and the combined effect with monoglyceride was higher than that with linolenic acid alone. However, the intracellular ATP concentration decreased compared with that of the control. From these results, we concluded that linolenic acid has a strong antimicrobial activity against B. cereus and S. aureus, and that linolenic acid combined with monoglyceride showed stronger antimicrobial activity than using linolenic acid alone.
TI  - Interaction of the Rho-ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme with RalA.
AB  - RhoA, -B, and -C are ADP-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by Clostridium  botulinum C3 exoenzyme and related C3-like transferases. We report that RalA GTPase, which is not ADP-ribosylated by C3, inhibits ADP-ribosylation of RhoA by C3 from C. botulinum (C3bot), Clostridium limosum (C3lim), and Bacillus cereus (C3cer) but not from Staphylococcus aureus (C3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. Inhibition by RalA occurs with the GDP- and guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of RalA and is overcome by increasing concentrations of C3. A direct interaction of RalA with C3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with GST-RalA-Sepharose. The affinity constant (K(d)) of the binding of RalA to C3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. RalA increased the NAD glycohydrolase activity of C3bot by about 5-fold. Although RalA had no effect on glucosylation of Rho GTPases by Clostridium difficile toxin B, C3bot and C3lim inhibited glucosylation of RalA by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. Furthermore, C3bot decreased activation of phospholipase D by RalA. The data indicate that several C3 exoenzymes directly interact with RalA without ADP-ribosylating the GTPase. The interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of C3 and RalA.
TI  - Bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus sake as starter culture in dry sausages.
AB  - One hundred and fifty-two strains of Lactobacillus spp and Micrococcus spp, isolated from dry sausages, were screened for inhibitory activity. Two of the strains assayed of the genus Lactobacillus showed bactericidal activity. They were able to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria seeligeri, Listeria innocua, Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus bavaricus. The strains of Escherichia coli, Salmonella bradford and Salmonella newlands, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens were resistant. Their antimicrobial activity was due to peptides detectable in the culture broths and inactivated by treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Using bacteriocin-producing Lactobacillus sake as starter cultures in dry sausages could be promising in the food industry.
TI  - Selection of bacteriocin producer strains of lactic acid bacteria from a dairy environment.
AB  - Two strains showing bacteriocin production were selected from a total of 206 lactic acid bacteria isolated from samples of milk, milk serum, whey and homemade cheeses in Southern Cordoba, Argentina. This property was detected by means of well diffusion assays. The strains were identified as Enterococcus hirae and Enterococcus durans. The protein nature of those substances was proved by showing their sensitivity to type IV and XXV proteases, papaine, trypsin, pepsin and K proteinase. The bacteriocins inhibited the growth of Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringes and two strains of Staphylococcus aureus, an A-enterotoxin and a B-enterotoxin producers. All of these bacteria are common pathogens usually associated with food borne diseases (ETA). These lactic acid bacteria or their bacteriocins could be suitable candidates for food preservation and specially useful in the our regional dairy industry.
TI  - Epidemiologic profiling: evaluating foodborne outbreaks for which no pathogen was isolated by routine laboratory testing: United States, 1982-9.
AB  - The objective was to evaluate foodborne outbreaks of undetermined aetiology by comparing them to pathogen-specific epidemiologic profiles of laboratory-confirmed foodborne outbreaks. National foodborne outbreak data reported to CDC during 1982-9 were categorized by clinico-epidemiologic profiles based on incubation, duration, percent vomiting, fever and vomiting to fever ratio. From the pathogen-specific profiles, five syndromes were developed: a vomiting-toxin syndrome resembling Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus; a diarrhoea-toxin syndrome characteristic of Clostridium perfringens, a diarrhaeogenic Escherichia coli syndrome, a Norwalk-like virus syndrome, and a salmonella like syndrome. Of 712 outbreaks, 624 (87.6%) matched one of five syndromes; 340 (47.8%) matched the Norwalk-like syndrome and 83 (11.7%) matched the salmonella-like syndrome. After combining information on known pathogens and epidemiologic profiles, only 88 (12.4%) outbreaks remained unclassified. Norwalk-like virus outbreaks appear as common as salmonella-like outbreaks. We conclude that profiling can help classify outbreaks, guide investigations and direct laboratory testing to help detect new and emerging pathogens.
TI  - Effects of antibacterial dishwashing liquid on foodborne pathogens and competitive microorganisms in kitchen sponges.
AB  - In response to increasing concern about home hygiene, the use of antibacterial products to reduce microorganisms in kitchen sponges and cleaning cloths is strongly promoted by some producers of detergent for domestic use. The effects of an antibacterial dishwashing liquid on Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus were investigated in a modified suspension test and in used sponges with and without food residues under laboratory conditions. A limited study was conducted in households to assess the efficacy of antibacterial dishwashing liquid as used by the consumer. In the suspension tests, S. aureus and B. cereus were shown to be susceptible to low concentrations of antibacterial dishwashing liquid (0.5%), whereas E. coli and Salmonella Enteritidis maintained their initial numbers for at least 24 h at 25 degrees C. At higher concentrations (2 to 4%), all test organisms decreased to below the detection limit after 24 h. Over a 24-h period, the antibacterial dishwashing liquid did not significantly reduce these organisms in used sponges in which food residues were present. The antibacterial product did not reduce the competitive microorganisms either. Similar results were found for sponges involved in daily household use. The results of this study demonstrate that the antibacterial dishwashing liquid was effective in reducing pathogens in the suspension test but not in the used sponges. This finding indicates that to determine the efficacy of antibacterial products, their use in a household setting must be considered.
TI  - C3stau, a new member of the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases.
AB  - C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases, which are produced by Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium limosum, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, are exoenzymes lacking a translocation unit. These enzymes specifically inactivate Rho GTPases in host target cells. Recently, a novel C3-like transferase from S. aureus with new properties was identified, raising questions regarding its function. As Rho GTPases are master regulators of several eukaryotic signal processes and S. aureus can invade eukaryotic cells, C3 might play a role as a virulence factor.
TI  - ANTIMICROBIAL ACTION OF THE LEAF EXTRACT OF Lagerstroemia parviflora Roxb.
AB  - The benzene extract of the leaves of Lagerstroemia paviflora Roxb was tested for  its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against Gram Positive Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative strains E.Coli, Shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae. Further the zones of inhibition Produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic Ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the mycotoxin citrinin obtained from the fungus penicillium citrinum.
AB  - The mycotoxin Citrinin was obtained from the fungus Penicillium citrinum. It was  tested for it's Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) against some gram positive strains viz. Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtillis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative strains E.Coli, Shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis and Vibrio cholerae. Further the zones of inhibition produced by the fungal extract against the bacterial strains were assayed and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Molecular cloning and expression of Mn(2+)-dependent sphingomyelinase/hemolysin of an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4.
AB  - We report here the molecular cloning and expression of a hemolytic sphingomyelinase from an aquatic bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. strain TK4. The sphingomyelinase gene was found to consist of 1,548 nucleotides encoding 516 amino acid residues. The recombinant 57.7-kDa enzyme hydrolyzed sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, or phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating that the enzyme is a sphingomyelin-specific sphingomyelinase C. The hydrolysis of sphingomyelin by the enzyme was found to be most efficient at pH 8.0 and activated by Mn(2+). The enzyme shows quite a broad specificity, i.e., it hydrolyzed 4-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD)-sphingomyelin with short-chain fatty acids and NBD-sphingosylphosphorylcholine, the latter being completely resistant to hydrolysis by any sphingomyelinase reported so far. Significant sequence similarities were found in sphingomyelinases from Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria ivanovii, and Leptospira interrogans, as well as a hypothetical protein encoded in Chromobacterium violaceum, although the first three lacked one-third of the sequence corresponding to that from the C terminus of the TK4 enzyme. Interestingly, the deletion mutant of strain TK4 lacking 186 amino acids at the C-terminal end hydrolyzed sphingomyelin, whereas it lost all hemolytic activity, indicating that the C-terminal region of the TK4 enzyme is indispensable for the hemolytic activity.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of triclosan-impregnated storage boxes against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Shewanella putrefaciens in conditions simulating domestic use.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance has increased over the past decade causing concern for public health. Domestic antimicrobial products containing triclosan (2,4,4'-trichloro-2'-hydroxydiphenylether), a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent, were introduced in 1997 and have become popular among consumers. Cross-resistance to other antibacterial agents has been suggested as a possible consequence of their widespread use. Triclosan-impregnated plastic storage boxes were tested for activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus and Shewanella putrefaciens in various conditions, including some designed to simulate usual storage conditions. Results showed inhibition up to a factor of 106 of bacteria grown in direct contact with triclosan-impregnated plastic at 30 and 22 degrees C, but not at 4 degrees C. Triclosan resistance was not found to increase after repeated exposure in triclosan-impregnated boxes. Further investigation into the effect of triclosan-impregnated products on bacteria will increase understanding of domestic antimicrobial products and implications of their overuse.
TI  - Evaluation of the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for detecting bacteria and measuring their growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the BacT/Alert automated blood culture system for the detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates, and to determine bacterial growth kinetics in leucodepleted and non-leucodepleted units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apheresis (Cobe Leucocyte Reduction System [LRS]) and pooled buffy coat-derived (Optipress) platelet concentrates (PCs) were tested. Six organisms were used for spiking the PCs: Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Group B Streptococcus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Units were inoculated to give a final concentration of approximately equal to 1 and 50 colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. On days 0, 2 and 5, BacT/Alert standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles were inoculated with a 5-ml fill volume and bacteria were enumerated. RESULTS: The BacT/Alert Automated blood culture system gave rapid determination times of spiked units, with all positives detected within 48 h and 98.1% detected within 24 h. In general, as the inoculum concentration increased, the detection time decreased. Rapid growth was obtained with all organisms tested except for B. cereus, which failed to grow on four occasions. Bacterial numbers on day 2 ranged from 10(5) to 10(11) CFU/ml and on day 5 ranged from 10(4) to 10(12) CFU/ml. Growth was not significantly greater in leucodepleted units. CONCLUSIONS: The study confirmed that PCs are an excellent growth medium for bacteria. Rapid and substantial growth was obtained with all organisms under test. Leucodepletion does not appear to enhance bacterial proliferation. The BacT/Alert automated blood culture system could rapidly detect contamination of units. Bacterial screening using an automated blood culture system is therefore a potential option.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of honey against foodborne pathogens as influenced by the presence of hydrogen peroxide and level of antioxidant power.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of honey has been attributed to hydrogen peroxide, which is produced by naturally occurring glucose oxidase, and phenolic compounds, although lethality of and inhibition by these and other components against microorganisms vary greatly, depending on the floral source of nectar. This study was undertaken to compare honeys from six floral sources for their inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella sonnei, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. A disc assay revealed that development of zones of inhibition of growth depends on the type and concentration of honey, as well as the test pathogen. Growth of B. cereus was least affected. The inhibition of growth of S. sonnei, L. monocytogenes, and S. aureus in 25% solutions of honeys was reduced by treating solutions with catalase, indicating that hydrogen peroxide contributes to antimicrobial activity. Darker colored honeys were generally more inhibitory than light colored honeys. Darker honeys also contained higher antioxidant power. Since antimicrobial activity of the darker colored test honeys was not eliminated by catalase treatment, non-peroxide components such as antioxidants may contribute to controlling the growth of some foodborne pathogens. The antibacterial properties of honeys containing hydrogen peroxide and characterized by a range of antioxidant power need to be validated using model food systems.
TI  - Mode of action of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins of the staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin family.
AB  - Staphylococcal alpha-hemolysin is the prototype of a family of bacterial exotoxins with membrane-damaging function, which share sequence and structure homology. These toxins are secreted in a soluble form which finally converts into a transmembrane pore by assembling an oligomeric beta-barrel, with hydrophobic residues facing the lipids and hydrophilic residues facing the lumen of the channel. Besides alpha-hemolysin the family includes other single chain toxins forming homo-oligomers, e.g. beta-toxin of Clostridium perfringens, hemolysin II and cytotoxin K of Bacillus cereus, but also the staphylococcal bi-component toxins, like gamma-hemolysins and leucocidins, which are only active as the combination of two similar proteins which form hetero-oligomers. The molecular basis of membrane insertion has become clearer after the determination of the crystal structure of both the oligomeric pore and the soluble monomer. Studies on this family of beta-barrel pore-forming toxins are important for many aspects: (i) they are involved in serious pathologies of humans and farmed animals, (ii) they are a good model system to investigate protein-membrane interaction and (iii) they are the basic elements for the construction of nanopores with biotechnological applications in various fields.
TI  - Challenge testing of the lactoperoxidase system in pasteurized milk.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the role of lactoperoxidase (LP) in inhibiting the growth of micro-organisms in pasteurised milk. METHODS AND RESULTS: Four micro-organisms of importance in the spoilage of pasteurized milk were challenged in lactoperoxidase (LP)-enriched ultra-heat treated (UHT) milk after subsequent pasteurization. Milk samples were stored at the optimum temperatures for growth of the individual bacteria. Pasteurization was carried out at 72 degrees C/15 s and 80 degrees C/15 s to determine the effect of the LP system on the micro-organisms. An active LP system was found to greatly increase the keeping quality (KQ) of milks inoculated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus thermophilus and pasteurized at 72 degrees C, but had little or no effect in milks heated at 80 degrees C, presumably due to virtual inactivation of LP at 80 degrees C. However, pasteurization temperature had no effect on the KQ of milks challenged with Bacillus cereus spores. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the LP system, rather than heat-shocking of spores, is responsible for the greater KQ of milk pasteurized at 72 degrees C/15 s compared with 80 degrees C/15 s. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study emphasizes the care required in selecting pasteurization temperatures in commercial practice and to avoid the temptation to compensate for inferior quality of raw milk by increasing pasteurization temperature.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of traditional Australian medicinal plants.
AB  - Fifty-six ethanolic extracts of various parts of 39 plants used in traditional Australian Aboriginal medicine were investigated for their antibacterial activities against four Gram-positive (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes) and four Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium) bacterial species. In a plate-hole diffusion assay, 12 extracts inhibited the growth of one or more of the bacteria, with five extracts showing broad spectrum antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. B. cereus was the most susceptible bacterium, with all 12 extracts displaying activity against this organism. Extracts from the leaves of Eremophila species (Myoporaceae) were the most active, with Eremophila duttonii exhibiting the greatest activity (against Gram-positive bacteria). The antibacterial effects of E. duttonii were further investigated by time-course growth assays which showed that significant growth inhibition was observed in cultures incubated in the presence of the extract within 1 h for B. cereus, E. faecalis and S. aureus and 2 h for S. pyogenes.
TI  - [Determination of the antibacterial and antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata (Griseb.) Epling].
AB  - The in vitro antiviral activity of the essential oil from Minthostachys verticillata was investigated against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PrV). The viral inhibition was assayed employing viral plaque reduction assay. The antiviral activity of the essential oil specifically affects PrV and HSV-1 multiplication, since it was found that non toxic effects on cells were observed at the concentrations assayed. The therapeutic index values were 10.0 and 9.5 for HSV-1 and PrV, respectively. The antibacterial activity was studied using a diffusion assay and the broth tube dilution method. Gram-positive bacteria were more sensitive to inhibition by plant essential oil than the gram-negative bacteria. The essential oil of M. verticillata was analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) technique. Of the six components identified in the volatile oil, pulegone (44.56%) and menthone (39.51%) were the major constituents. The antimicrobial activity can be explained to some extent by the presence of pulegone. Results suggest that further investigations concerning the isolation of the substance responsible for the antimicrobial activity and an effort to define the mechanisms of action are warranted.
TI  - Isolation and bioactivities of constitutents of the roots of Garcinia atroviridis.
AB  - Two new prenylated compounds, the benzoquinone atrovirinone (1) and the depsidone atrovirisidone (2), were isolated from the roots of Garcinia atroviridis. Their structures were determined on the basis of the analysis of spectroscopic data. While compound 2 showed some cytotoxicity against HeLa cells, both compounds 1 and 2 were only mildly inhibitory toward Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Class II broad-spectrum mercury resistance transposons in Gram-positive bacteria  from natural environments.
AB  - We have studied the mechanisms of the horizontal dissemination of a broad-spectrum mercury resistance determinant among Bacillus and related species. This mer determinant was first described in Bacillus cereus RC607 from Boston Harbor, USA, and was then found in various Bacillus and related species in Japan, Russia and England. We have shown that the mer determinant can either be located at the chromosome, or on a plasmid in the Bacillus species, and is carried by class II mercury resistance transposons: Tn5084 from B. cereus RC607 and B. cereus VKM684 (ATCC10702) and Tn5085 from Exiguobacterium sp. TC38-2b. Tn5085 is identical in nucleotide sequence to TnMERI1, the only other known mer transposon from Bacillus species, but it does not contain an intron like TnMERI1. Tn5085 is functionally active in Escherichia coli. Tn5083, which we have isolated from B. megaterium MK64-1, contains an RC607-like mer determinant, that has lost some mercury resistance genes and possesses a merA gene which is a novel sequence variant that has not been previously described. Tn5083 and Tn5084 are recombinants, and are comprised of fragments from several transposons including Tn5085, and a relative of a putative transposon from B. firmus (which contains similar genes to the cadmium resistance operon of Staphylococcus aureus), as well as others. The sequence data showed evidence for recombination both between transposition genes and between mer determinants.
TI  - Changes in the disintegration properties of some brands of paracetamol tablets inoculated with four bacterial species.
AB  - Four most common brands of paracetamol (4-aceta-midophenol) tablets were examined for the changes in their disintegration properties after inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella aerogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and incubating for 5 weeks. The disintegration times varied from one brand to the other, reaching maximum values of 72 min., 82 min., 110 min. and 120 min. for S. aureus, B. cereus, P. aeruginosa and Klebsiella aerogenes, respectively. All brands of paracetamol tablets revealed the presence of cotton wool-like fibrils which were seen to be interwoven within the tablets' matrices and these were believed to have caused the higher disintegration times.
TI  - Microbiological status of commercially available medicinal herbal drugs--a screening study.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-eight medicinal herbal drugs obtained from different suppliers were examined for microbial contaminants and for the detectability of pathogenic microorganisms. For this purpose, several microbiological standard parameters (total aerobic mesophilic count, enterobacteria, coliforms, aerobic sporeformers, yeasts and moulds, enterococci, lactobacilli, pseudomonades and aeromades) and selective methods for the detection of indicator microorganisms and pathogens (E. coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC], Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Candida albicans, potentially aflatoxigenic moulds) were applied. The microbial load of the samples varied considerably. While none of the samples contained EHEC, Salmonellae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeriae, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans, four samples were E. coli positive, two samples were presumptively Campylobacter jejuni positive and nine herbal drugs contained a potentially aflatoxigenic mould flora. Further details regarding different viable count classes as well as preparation techniques are discussed.
TI  - Foodborne diseases in Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the occurrence of foodborne disease outbreaks in Kenya and the efforts employed to combat them. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Forty two districts in Kenya between 1970 and 1993. STUDY SUBJECTS: Foodborne disease outbreak episodes due to Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium botulinum, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Listera monocytogenes, chemicals, aflatoxin, plant and animal poisons. OUTCOME MEASURES: Number and aetiological causes of foodborne disease outbreaks reported in the study period. RESULTS: Thirty seven food poisoning outbreaks were reported to the Ministry of Health from various parts of the country in the study period 1970 to 1993, and only 13 of these involving a total of 926 people were confirmed to be due to particular aetiological agents. Foods that were involved included milk and milk products, meat and meat products, maize flour, bread, scones and other wheat products, vegetables and lemon pie pudding. A high number of food poisoning cases were treated as outpatients in various health facilities. CONCLUSION: Under-reporting, inadequate investigation of outbreaks and inadequate diagnostic facilities suggest that foodborne disease outbreaks are more than is recorded by the Ministry of Health.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Bioactivity studies of extracts from Tridax procumbens.
AB  - An updated review on the biological activity of Tridax procumbens is presented. A detailed biological screening comprised of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, yeasts and fungi using crude extracts of this plant was undertaken. The n-hexane extract of the flowers showed activity against Escherichia coli. The same extract of the whole aerial parts was active against Mycobacterium smegmatis, Escherichia coli, Salmonella group C and Salmonella paratyphi. The ethyl-acetate extract of the flowers was active against Bacillus cereus and Klebsiella sp. The aerial parts extract also showed activity only against Mycobacterium smegmatis and Staphylococcus aureus, while the aqueous extract showed no antimicrobial activity. None of the tested extracts was active against the yeasts, Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis and Rhodotorula rubra; or the fungi: Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Mucor sp. and Trichophyton rubrum.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of Thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  - The aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of Thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. Among 3790 isolates (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against Sarcina lutea ATCC 9341, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Streptococcus mutans DTMU 1, Strep. salivarius DTMU 1, Strep. sanguis DTMU 1, Candida albicans ATCC 13803 and C. albicans DTMU 2, as well as the oral pathogens. These antimicrobial isolates included L17 and N14 which showed the antibacterial activity, D14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and D6 and N8 which showed both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. The isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. They could utilize casein but could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. Their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by pH, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. The activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at pH > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees C. However, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. When the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. The final identification revealed that D6, D14 and N14 were Lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, and L17 and N8 were Lact. rhamnosus.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity of new adamantane derivatives II.
AB  - A series of new derivatives of adamantane was synthesised. The new compound 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride obtained from 1-adamantaneethanol and trimellitic anhydride chloride, as well as 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)phthalanhydride, appeared very useful for preparation of a number of N-substituted phthalimides. Antimicrobial activity of newly obtained derivatives such as, for example, 4-(adamant-1-ylethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-phenylalanyl)phthalimide or 4-(adamant-1-ylmethylenoxycarbonyl)-N-(L-leucyl)-phthalimide was tested against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus sp., Micrococcus flavus and Enterococcus faecium. The minimal inhibitory concentrations for these compounds against Bacillus cereus were 15 and 8 microg/ml, respectively.
TI  - Growth of bacteria in inoculated platelets: implications for bacteria detection and the extension of platelet storage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent reports from Europe have advocated the use of bacterial culturing of platelets on Day 2 or 3 of storage to extend the shelf life of platelets to 7 days, thereby reducing the outdating of platelets and preserving a limited medical resource. To assess the optimal timing, the necessary sensitivity, and the possible efficacy of bacterial detection, the bacterial growth characteristics were reviewed in 165 platelet units, each inoculated on the day of collection with one of the following organisms: Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis from four previously published studies. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Quantitative culture data from inoculated platelet concentrates from five sites and four studies were combined into one database and analyzed for bacterial concentration thresholds (> or =10(1), > or =10(2), > or =10(3), > or =10(4), > or =10(5) CFU/mL) by day of storage. RESULTS: All examples of B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and S. aureus had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL by Day 3 after inoculation. By Day 4, all units with these organisms contained > or =10(5) CFU per mL. Units contaminated with S. epidermidis showed slower and more varied growth. By Day 3 after inoculation, 81.3 percent had 10(2) CFU per mL. By Day 4 after inoculation, 46 (95.8%) of 48 units had concentrations > or =10(2) CFU per mL. CONCLUSION: These experiments suggest that an assay capable of detecting 10(2) CFU per mL on Day 3 of storage would detect the vast majority of bacterially contaminated platelet units, prevent many cases of platelet-associated bacterial sepsis, and provide a scientific basis for the extension of the current platelet storage time. It would be expected that a rare, slow-growing organism could escape such a detection scheme.
TI  - Microbiological hazard identification and exposure assessment of street food vending in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-two samples of beef, chicken, salad and gravy were collected from two street vendors over eleven replicate surveys to assess microbiological safety and quality. For each food type samples were collected during preparation and holding. Dish water was also collected and food preparation surfaces swabbed during preparation and display. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts, Enterobacteriaceae counts, coliform counts and spore counts. Six hundred and seventy-five predominant colonies were isolated from aerobic plate counts of all samples and characterised. The incidence of selected foodborne bacterial pathogens and non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was also determined. In most cases mean bacterial counts of the raw materials were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those of corresponding cooked foods. No significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between food samples collected during cooking and those collected during holding. In addition, no significant differences (P > 0.05) in all count types were observed between prepared salads and their raw materials. Mean bacterial counts of water and swab samples collected from vendor 1 were lower than those of water and swab samples collected from vendor 2.The predominant populations isolated from the aerobic plate counts were Bacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae and Alcaligenes spp. Bacillus cereus was detected in 17%, Clostridium perfringens in 1%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3% and Vibrio metchnikovii in 2% of the food samples. Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 were not detected. Non-pathogenic E. coli 1 was detected in 13% of food samples, in 86 and 36% of dish water samples collected from vendors 1 and 2, respectively, and in 36% of surface swab samples from vendor 2.
TI  - A new cytotoxin from Bacillus cereus that may cause necrotic enteritis.
AB  - A cytotoxin (CytK) has been isolated from a Bacillus cereus strain that caused a  severe food poisoning outbreak killing three people. A protein of 34 kDa was highly cytotoxic, and the addition of other secreted proteins gave no synergistic effect. CytK was also necrotic and haemolytic. No known B. cereus enterotoxins were produced by this strain. A DNA sequence from 1.8 kb upstream to 0.2 kb downstream of the toxin gene was sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence of the toxin showed similarity to Staphylococcus aureus leucocidins, gamma-haemolysin and alpha-haemolysin, Clostridium perfringens beta-toxin and B. cereus haemolysin II, all belonging to a family of beta-barrel channel-forming toxins. There was no sequence similarity between CytK and enterotoxins of B. cereus. The upstream sequence contained a partial sequence of a putative histidine kinase gene. A recognition site for PlcR, which regulates the transcription of enterotoxins HBL and Nhe of B. cereus, was found in the promoter region of the toxin. This new cytotoxin may be responsible for a disease that is similar to, although not as severe as, the necrotic enteritis caused by the beta-toxin of C. perfringens type C.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  - A rosemary extract commercially exploited (Oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. For gram-positive bacteria, the MIC of the ethanolic solution was 1% for Leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for Listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for Streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for Bacillus cereus. It slowed the growth of Penicillium roquefortii and Botrytis cinerea. Up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts Rhodotorula glutinis and Cryptococcus laurentii. Antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. The MIC was reduced by low pH, high NaCl contents, and low temperatures. Low pH and high NaCl concentration had a synergistic effect on the MIC of the rosemary extract for S. aureus. Lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. The inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees C). The natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. The antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.
TI  - New developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media.
AB  - This review describes some recent developments in chromogenic and fluorogenic culture media in microbiological diagnostic. The detection of beta-D-glucuronidase (GUD) activity for enumeration of Escherichia coli is well known. E. coli O157:H7 strains are usually GUD-negative and do not ferment sorbitol. These characteristics are used in selective media for these organisms and new chromogenic media are available. Some of the new chromogenic media make the Salmonella diagnostic easier and faster. The use of chromogenic and fluorogenic substrates for detection of beta-D-glucosidase (beta-GLU) activity to differentiate enterococci has received considerable attention and new media are described. Rapid detection of Clostridium perfringens, Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus are other application of enzyme detection methods in food and water microbiology.
TI  - Characterization of reutericyclin produced by Lactobacillus reuteri LTH2584.
AB  - Lactobacillus reuteri LTH2584 exhibits antimicrobial activity that can be attributed neither to bacteriocins nor to the production of reuterin or organic acids. We have purified the active compound, named reutericyclin, to homogeneity and characterized its antimicrobial activity. Reutericyclin exhibited a broad inhibitory spectrum including Lactobacillus spp., Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria innocua. It did not affect the growth of gram-negative bacteria; however, the growth of lipopolysaccharide mutant strains of Escherichia coli was inhibited. Reutericyclin exhibited a bactericidal mode of action against Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Staphylococcus aureus, and B. subtilis and triggered the lysis of cells of L. sanfranciscensis in a dose-dependent manner. Germination of spores of B. subtilis was inhibited, but the spores remained unaffected under conditions that do not permit germination. The fatty acid supply of the growth media had a strong effect on reutericyclin production and its distribution between producer cells and the culture supernatant. Reutericyclin was purified from cell extracts and culture supernatant of L. reuteri LTH2584 cultures grown in mMRS by solvent extraction, gel filtration, RP-C(8) chromatography, and anion-exchange chromatography, followed by rechromatography by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. Reutericyclin was characterized as a negatively charged, highly hydrophobic molecule with a molecular mass of 349 Da. Structural characterization (A. Holtzel, M. G. Ganzle, G. J. Nicholson, W. P. Hammes, and G. Jung, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 39:2766-2768, 2000) revealed that reutericyclin is a novel tetramic acid derivative. The inhibitory activity of culture supernatant of L. reuteri LTH2584 corresponded to that of purified as well as synthetic reutericyclin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of water and acetone extracts of the roots of Euclea natalensis.
AB  - Water and acetone extracts of the roots of Euclea natalensis A.DC. were investigated for their in vitro antibacterial properties. The Gram-positive bacteria tested appeared to be more susceptible to the extracts than the Gram-negative bacteria. The water and acetone extracts inhibited the growth of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus kristinae and Staphylococcus aureus at concentrations ranging between 0.1 and 6.0 mg/ml. The water extract did not exert any inhibitory action on Gram-negative bacteria while the acetone extract showed inhibitory activity at a concentration of 5.0 mg/ml against all the Gram-negative bacteria investigated. The antibacterial activity of acetone extract was also investigated by a direct bioassay on TLC plates against S. aureus.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of new arylamido derivatives of 6 beta-aminopenicillanic, 7 beta-aminocephalosporanic and 7 beta-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acids.
AB  - New semisynthetic penicillins and cephalosporins have been synthesized by acylation of 6 beta-aminopenicillanic, 7 beta-aminocephalosporanic and 7 beta-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acids with ortho-substituted aromatic acids, using the method of mixed anhydrides. The chemical structures of the compounds obtained were confirmed by elemental analysis and by IR- and 1H-NMR spectra. Antibacterial activities of the compounds were determined by the macrodilution susceptibility test in brain-heart infusion broth. Test organisms producing beta-lactamases: Bacillus subtilis L2, Bacillus subtilis HB2, Bacillus cereus 30, Bacillus subtilis 6633 ATCC, Bacillus mycoides 924; Staphylococcus aureus 1/45 "Oxford" as Gram-positive bacteria, and Escherichia coli 111, Escherichia coli K12/F- inverted question marklac-/, Escherichia coli K12/F- inverted question marklambda-/, Escherichia coli K12/F- inverted question marklambda- inverted question marklac+/ as Gram-negative bacteria. In general, the derivatives of 6 beta-aminopenicillanic acid were more active than 7 beta-aminocephalosporanic and 7 beta-aminodesacetoxycephalosporanic acid derivatives. Among all the compounds synthesized 6 beta-[4'-(dimethylamino)-azobenzene-2-amido]penicillanic acid and 6 beta-(N-phenylanthranilamido)penicillanic acid showed the best activity and were with the broadest spectrum of action.
TI  - Hazard analysis and critical control points of weaning foods.
AB  - Hazards and critical control points were identified during the preparation, feeding and storage of weaning foods fed to the children (6-24 months) belonging to low income group (LIG) families using survey methods, spot and indepth observations and microbial analysis. High microbial counts were obtained for the weaning food samples procured from the families that were rated as poor for both personal hygiene and environmental sanitation. Food samples that were held at ambient temperature (25-35 degrees C) showed high counts of coliforms, AMCC, yeast and mold, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Spice mixtures and mop samples also revealed high counts for all these organisms. Coliforms were not isolated from the water samples of all the 10 households. However, a high count of Bacillus cereus (10(3-5)/ml) was observed in water samples of two selected households. The hazards and critical control points identified were high initial contamination of raw foods, poor environmental sanitation and personal hygiene, feeding of overnight moist foods stored at ambient temperature and insufficient steaming of these foods.
TI  - Photochemical inactivation of bacteria and HIV in buffy-coat-derived platelet concentrates under conditions that preserve in vitro platelet function.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: A photochemical process has been tested for the inactivation of viruses and bacteria in buffy-coat derived platelet concentrates (BC PCs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: BC PCs in 35% CPD plasma and 65% platelet-additive solution (PAS III) were exposed to photochemical treatment (PCT) with 150 microM of the psoralen S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment with long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA, 320-400 nm). Platelet function was evaluated following PCT using a panel of in vitro assays. RESULTS: This PCT process was highly effective at inactivating gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis) and gram-negative bacteria (Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens). No viable bacteria were detected following PCT and 7 days of platelet storage while bacterial growth was detected in paired untreated control BC PCs. Complete inactivation of the gram-positive Bacillus cereus was achieved only in one of two replicate experiments with BC PCs. PCT was also highly effective for inactivation of human immunodeficiency virus HIV-1 in BC PCs inoculated with approximately 10(6) tissue culture infectious doses per milliliter (TCID(50)/ml) of cell-associated HIV-1. Rapid inactivation was observed with increasing UVA doses: with 150 microM S-59 and a 1 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA, a reduction of 5.6+/-0.5 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved, and a reduction of >6.4 log TCID(50)/ml was achieved with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) treatment of UVA. No physiologically relevant differences in platelet functions were found between the test and the control BC PCs during 7 days of storage. CONCLUSION: PCT with 150 microM S-59 and a 3 J/cm(2) UVA treatment does not adversely affect in vitro properties of BC PCs stored at 22 degrees C for 7 days. The PCT process inactivated bacteria and HIV-1 inoculated into the BC PCs. These results extend the earlier reported efficacy of PCT apheresis PCs to BC PCs.
TI  - Kombucha fermentation and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Kombucha was prepared in a tea broth (0.5% w/v) supplemented with sucrose (10% w/v) by using a commercially available starter culture. The pH decreased steadily from 5 to 2.5 during the fermentation while the weight of the "tea fungus" and the OD of the tea broth increased through 4 days of the fermentation and remained fairly constant thereafter. The counts of acetic acid-producing bacteria and yeasts in the broth increased up to 4 days of fermentation and decreased afterward. The antimicrobial activity of Kombucha was investigated against a number of pathogenic microorganisms. Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella sonnei, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, Yersinia enterolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Staphylococcus epidermis, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Helicobacterpylori, and Listeria monocytogenes were found to be sensitive to Kombucha. According to the literature on Kombucha, acetic acid is considered to be responsible for the inhibitory effect toward a number of microbes tested, and this is also valid in the present study. However, in this study, Kombucha proved to exert antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Sh. sonnei, Sal. typhimurium, Sal. enteritidis, and Cm. jejuni, even at neutral pH and after thermal denaturation. This finding suggests the presence of antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins in Kombucha.
TI  - Antimicrobial Potency of the Leaf - Stalk Extract of Curcuma longa (LINN).
AB  - The methanolic extract of the leaf-stalk of curcuma longa LINN, was tested for its minimum Inhibitor concentration (MIC) against Gram positive-staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pnemoniae, bacillus cereus, streptococcus pneumoniae, Lactobacillus arabinosus and gram negative E.coli, shigella dysenteriae, shigella sonnei, shigella boydii, salmonella typhimurium, proteus mirabilis, and Vibrio cholerae strains, further, the ones of inhibition produced by the crude extract against four selected bacterial strains were measured and compared with those produced by the standard antibiotic ciprofloxacin against the same bacterial strains.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of some new non-proteinogenic amino acids containing thiazole residues.
AB  - Some new thioamides and thiazoles have been synthesized using canavanine, S-cysteine, homo-S-cysteinesulfonamides and their N-omega aminoethylated derivatives as adducts in order to investigate the structure-antimicrobial activity relationships. The compounds showed substantial antibacterial activity in vitro against various gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus etc.) and gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris etc.) bacteria. These findings indicate that the presence of the thiazole residue is an essential factor for the antibacterial effect.
TI  - [Prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units: prospective study].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Platelet concentrates contaminated with bacteria are a main source of transfusion-associated sepsis. Several studies have reported a very wide incidence (0-10%) of contamination. The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of bacterial contamination of standard platelet units at the regional blood transfusion center in Casablanca. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: During 15.5 months, 3,458 platelet concentrates (PCs) were analysed. The plasma from the bag and the tube was homogenised. One-fifth of the tube contents were inoculated every day for five days in two tubes containing 2.5 mL of Tryptic soy broth. One tube was incubated at room temperature and the other at 37 degrees C for 24 hours. The bacteria were identified by standard procedures. RESULTS: Twenty-five (0.72%) of 3,458 platelet bags were contaminated. Twenty-two bacteria (88%) were found in the platelet bags stored three days or more, of which 14 (56%) were Staphylococci coagulase negative, two Staphylococcus aureus, one alpha-haemolytic Streptococcus, four bacillus cereus, one Enterobacter cloacae, one Escherichia Coli and two Xanthomonas maltophilia. CONCLUSION: The incidence reported in this series is higher than that reported by most authors.
TI  - Biological screening of Brazilian medicinal plants.
AB  - In this study, we screened sixty medicinal plant species from the Brazilian savanna ("cerrado") that could contain useful compounds for the control of tropical diseases. The plant selection was based on existing ethnobotanic information and interviews with local healers. Plant extracts were screened for: (a) molluscicidal activity against Biomphalaria glabrata, (b) toxicity to brine shrimp (Artemia salina L.), (c) antifungal activity in the bioautographic assay with Cladosporium sphaerospermum and (d) antibacterial activity in the agar diffusion assay against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Forty-two species afforded extracts that showed some degree of activity in one or more of these bioassays.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Ethnomedical aspects of the commonly used toothbrush sticks in Ethiopia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the botanical identity, cytotoxicity, and antibacterial property of the commonly used toothbrush sticks in Ethiopia. SETTING: Research laboratories of the departments of Biology and Chemistry, Addis Ababa University between December 1993 and May 1995. METHODS: The study was performed by purchasing the commonly used toothbrush sticks from street markets in various towns of Ethiopia. Voucher specimens were collected and their botanical identity was determined following floral keys. The toothbrush sticks were ground in a mill and soaked in absolute methanol for 24 hours and filtered. The filtrates were dried in a rotary evaporator and the crude extracts were stored at 4 degrees C. The crude methanol extracts were used to test their antibacterial activity by impregnating into filter paper discs and placing on test plates of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cerues. Their lethality to brine shrimp (Artemia salina) was performed following standard procedures. RESULTS: Twenty different species of plant used as toothbrush were collected and their botanical identity determined. Crude methanol extracts of only Agave sisalana, Birbira and Hypericum revolutum test concentrations up to 500 micrograms/ml showed weak toxicity to brine shrimp. All the extracts showed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus by agar diffusion method. CONCLUSION: Toothbrush sticks can be used by the vast majority of people who cannot afford buying the commercial toothbrush and toothpaste. The toothbrush sticks may be important for the oral and dental hygiene of the users and hence may be useful in decreasing dental caries. Further studies should focus on the effect of the toothbrush sticks against other common bacteria that are associated with dental diseases.
TI  - An acylated phloroglucinol with antimicrobial properties from Helichrysum caespititium.
AB  - A new acylated form of a phloroglucinol with significant antimicrobial properties was isolated by bioactivity guided fractionation from Helichrysum caespititium (Asteraceae). The structure elucidation, and conformation of the new phloroglucinol, 2-methyl-4-[2',4',6'-trihydroxy-3'-(2-methylpropanoyl) phenyl]but-2-enyl acetate, was established by high field NMR spectroscopic and MS data. The compound inhibited growth of Bacillus cereus, B. pumilus, B. subtilis and Micrococcus kristinae at the very low concentration of 0.5 microg/ml and Staphylococcus aureus at 5.0 microg/ml. Six fungi tested were similarly inhibited at low MICs, Aspergillus flavus and A. niger (1.0 microg/ml), Cladosporium chladosporioides (5 microg/ml), C. cucumerinum and C. sphaerospermum (0.5 microg/ml) and Phylophthora capsici at 1.0 microg/ml.
TI  - Effect of L-glucose and D-tagatose on bacterial growth in media and a cooked cured ham product.
AB  - Cured meats such as ham can undergo premature spoilage on account of the proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. This spoilage is generally evident from a milkiness in the purge of vacuum-packaged sliced ham. Although cured, most hams are at more risk of spoilage than other types of processed meat products because they contain considerably higher concentrations of carbohydrates, approximately 2 to 7%, usually in the form of dextrose and corn syrup solids. Unfortunately, the meat industry is restricted with respect to the choice of preservatives and bactericidal agents. An alternative approach from these chemical compounds would be to use novel carbohydrate sources that are unrecognizable to spoilage bacteria. L-Glucose and D-tagatose are two such potential sugars, and in a series of tests in vitro, the ability of bacteria to utilize each as an energy source was compared to that of D-glucose. Results showed that both L-glucose and D-tagatose are not easily catabolized by a variety of lactic bacteria and not at all by pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica. In a separate study, D-glucose, L-glucose, and D-tagatose were added to a chopped and formed ham formulation and the rate of bacterial growth was monitored. Analysis of data by a general linear model revealed that the growth rates of total aerobic and lactic acid bacteria were significantly (P < 0.05) slower for the formulation containing D-tagatose than those containing L- or D-glucose. Levels of Enterobacteriaceae were initially low and these bacteria did not significantly (P < 0.20) change in the presence of any of the sugars used in the meat formulations. Compared to the control sample containing D-glucose, the shelf life of the chopped and formed ham containing D-tagatose at 10 degrees C was extended by 7 to 10 days. These results indicate that D-tagatose could deter the growth of microorganisms and inhibit the rate of spoilage in a meat product containing carbohydrates.
TI  - Occurrence of nisin Z production in Lactococcus lactis BFE 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional Nigerian cheese product.
AB  - Screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various African fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing Lactococcus lactis (BFE 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. The bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related LAB, but also strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillis cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. It was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower pH range. The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K, but not by other proteases. Growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 on L. monocytogenes WS 2250 and B. cereus DSM 2301 than with the nisin A producing strain DSM 20729. Polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain BFE 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that Lc. lactis BFE 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin Z, as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The genetic determinants for bacteriocin production in strain BFE 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the African environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.
TI  - Antibacterial hydroxycinnamic esters from Piper caninum from Paluma, north Queensland, Australia. The crystal and molecular structure of (+)-bornyl coumarate.
AB  - The crude chloroform bark extract of Piper caninum (Piperaceae) exhibits antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The antibacterial agents in this extract have been isolated using bioactivity-directed chromatographic techniques and identified by NMR spectroscopy as (+)-bornyl p-coumarate and bornyl caffeate. A single-crystal X-ray structure has been carried out on (+)-bornyl p-coumarate. The compound crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) (#19) with a = 12.659(4), b = 13.281(4), and c = 10.177(3) A. Fullmatrix least-squares refinement converged at R = 0.047, and Rw = 0.058.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Orobanche cernua extract.
AB  - The effect of the parasitic plant Orobanche cernua extract was evaluated on 5 different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Dilution experiments show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC; microgram/ml) of the extract was as follows: Staphylococcus aureus-1526.5; Streptococcus sp.-3125; Streptococcus pyogenes-25,000 and both for Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli-50,000 micrograms/ml. Data indicated that the MIC of 3125 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) and tobromycin (10 micrograms) activity against Streptococcus sp. and S. aureus, respectively; 25,000 and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to cefotaxime (30 micrograms) activity against S. pyogenes and B. cereus, respectively, and 50,000 micrograms/ml is equal to nalidixic acid (30 micrograms) activity against E. coli. It can be concluded that the O. cernua extract displays remarkable activity against some Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus.
TI  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of Turkish medicinal plants.
AB  - A total of 76 extracts from 35 plants available in the Turkish flora were assayed for their in vitro antibacterial activities against five pathogenic bacteria and a yeast. Sixteen crude extracts from eight plant species were found to possess an activity against at least one or more test microorganisms. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the most active crude extracts was also carried out with the most active extracts. Activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens and Candida albicans (yeast) is discussed.
TI  - Antimicrobial Effects of Propolis Extracts on Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus Strains Resistant to Various Antibiotics and Some Microorganisms.
AB  - ABSTRACT Propolis is collected by worker honey bees from the trees. The bees pack propolis on their hind legs, carry it to their colony, and use it as a sterilant in the hive. Propolis has also been used by humans since early times for various purposes and, especially, as a medicine because of its antimicrobial properties. In this study, antimicrobial effects of propolis samples on three Escherichia coli and two Staphylococcus aureus strains that are multiresistant to antibiotics and on Salmonella typhimurium, Bruceila abortus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus cereus, Candida tropicalis, and Aspergillus niger were studied. Propolis extracts were prepared with acetone and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). At concentrations of 10 and 25 ml, propolis extracts affected all of the microorganisms in acetone and DMSO in concentrations of 10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 ppm. The results detected in this in vitro study provided evidence that propolis may be used as an antimicrobial agent against many microorganisms.
TI  - Aqueous and vitreous penetration of levofloxacin after oral administration.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the penetration of levofloxacin, an optical S-(-)isomer of ofloxacin, into the aqueous and vitreous humor after oral administration. DESIGN: Randomized, clinical trial comparing tissue levels of levofloxacin after one or two doses 12 hours apart. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five patients undergoing initial vitrectomy between February 1997 and June 1997 at the UIC Eye Center. METHODS: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum samples were obtained and later analyzed from 45 patients after oral administration of 1 500-mg tablet (group 1, 22 patients) or 2 500-mg tablets (group 2, 23 patients) 12 hours apart before surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Aqueous, vitreous, and serum concentrations of levofloxacin (micrograms/milliliter). RESULTS: Group 1 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 0.59 +/- 0.48 microg/ml, 0.32 +/- 0.34 microg/ml, and 4.34 +/- 3.59 microg/ml, respectively. Group 2 achieved mean aqueous, vitreous, and serum levels of 1.90 +/- 0.97 microg/ml, 2.39 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, and 8.02 +/- 3.14 microg/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Mean inhibitory aqueous and vitreous MIC90 levels were achieved against a majority of ocular pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae (vitreous), Bacillus cereus (vitreous), Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and most gram-negative aerobic organisms except Pseudomonas aeruginosa after two doses given 12 hours apart. Mean MIC90 levels were obtained in the vitreous for a majority of pathogens responsible for traumatic, postoperative, or bleb-related endophthalmitis.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of turmeric oil: a byproduct from curcumin manufacture.
AB  - Curcumin, the yellow color pigment of turmeric, is produced industrially from turmeric oleoresin. The mother liquor after isolation of curcumin from oleoresin contains approximately 40% oil. The oil was extracted from the mother liquor using hexane at 60 degrees C, and the hexane extract was separated into three fractions using silica gel column chromatography. These fractions were tested for antibacterial activity by pour plate method against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fraction II eluted with 5% ethyl acetate in hexane was found to be most active fraction. The turmeric oil, fraction I, and fraction II were analyzed by GC and GC-MS. ar-Turmerone, turmerone, and curlone were found to be the major compounds present in these fractions along with other oxygenated compounds.
TI  - Microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in Johannesburg, South Africa.
AB  - Fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in Johannesburg, South Africa. Food temperatures were recorded at the time of sampling. Standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (APCs), spore counts (SCs), and Enterobacteriaceae counts (ECs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (CCs) for water and swab samples. In addition, Petrifilm Escherichia coli count (PC) plates were used for the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. The presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic E. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. Predominant colonies isolated from APC plates were characterized to the genus level. Holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees C, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees C. Mean APC values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log CFU/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Mean SC values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log CFU/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. A mean EC value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log CFU/g for food samples and mean CC values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log CFU/ml and 1.3 (+/-0.3) log CFU/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. Mean PC values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log CFU/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log CFU/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log CFU/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. Bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, Clostridium perfringens in 16%, Salmonella spp. in 2%, and E. coli (non-O157:H+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. E. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae, and Yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. The 340 isolates obtained from APC plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. It was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.
TI  - Preformed bacterial toxins.
AB  - Food poisoning syndromes caused by four different bacteria are described. For all types, food kept at a permissive temperature allows growth of the vegetative forms of the bacteria and production of a toxin or toxins. The key features of these syndromes, as well as possible new trends of concern, are summarized in Table 1.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of several parts of Pinus brutia, Juniperus oxycedrus, Abies cilicia, Cedrus libani and Pinus nigra.
AB  - In this study, the antimicrobial activities of several parts of various trees grown in the Kahramanmaras region of Turkey were investigated by the disc diffusion method. Chloroform, acetone and methanol extracts of leaves, resins, barks, cones and fruits of Pinus brutia Ten., Juniperus oxycedrus L., Abies cilicia Ant. & Kotschy Carr., Cedrus libani A. Rich. and Pinus nigra Arn. were prepared and tested against Bacillus megaterium DSM 32, Bacillus subtilis IMG 22, Bacillus cereus FMC 19, Escherichia coli DM, Klebsiella pneumoniae FMC 3, Enterobacter aerogenes CCM 2531, Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, Mycobacterium smegmatis RUT, Proteus vulgaris FMC 1, Listeria monocytogenes Scoot A, Pseudomonas aeruginosa DSM 5007, Candida albicans CCM 314, Candida tropicalis MDC 86 and Penicillium italicum K. The results showed that antifungal effects were not observed for the whole extracts, E. coli was not inhibited by any of the plant extracts except by the chloroform and acetone extracts of the leaves of A. cilicia, which showed inhibition zones of 16-18 mm, respectively. All the plant extracts used in this study inhibited the development of the other bacteria studied. When the results of this study were compared with an ampicillin standard, it was found that the microorganisms studied were generally susceptible, intermediate or resistant to the extracts of species when compared with the ampicillin standard. On the other hand, the acetone and methanol extracts of Juniperus fruits were found to be quite resistant.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence and molecular characterization of hemolysin II gene  from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Hemolysin II gene from Bacillus cereus VKM-B771 has been sequenced. The deduced primary translation product consists of 412 amino acid residues which corresponds to the protein with an M(r) of 45.6 kDa. The predicted mature Hly-II protein (residues 32 to 412) is of 42.3 kDa, which is in close agreement with the mini-cell electrophoresis analysis. Hly-II deletion variant lacking 96 C-terminal residues still has hemolytic activity. The protein primary structure analysis revealed no homology with any known Bacillus cytolysins. Significant general homology (31-28% identity) was found between the hemolysin II and Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin, gamma-hemolysin (HlgB), and leukocidins (LukF, LukF-R, LukF-PV). The data suggest that hemolysin II belongs to the group of beta-channel forming cytolysins.
TI  - Bacteriological studies of blood, tissue fluid, lymph and lymph nodes in patients with acute dermatolymphangioadenitis (DLA) in course of 'filarial' lymphedema.
AB  - Filarial lymphedema is complicated by frequent episodes of dermatolymphangioadenitis (DLA). Severe systemic symptoms during attacks of DLA resemble those of septicemia. The question we asked was whether bacterial isolates can be found in the peripheral blood of patients during the episodes of DLA. Out of 100 patients referred to us with 'filarial' lymphedema 14 displayed acute and five subacute symptoms of DLA. All were on admission blood microfilariae negative but had a positive test in the past. Blood bacterial isolates were found in nine cases, four acute (21%) and five subacute (26%). In 10 acute cases blood cultures were found negative. Six blood isolates belonged to Bacilli, four to Cocci and one was Sarcina. To identify the sites of origin of bacterial dissemination, swabs taken from the calf skin biopsy wounds and tissue fluid, lymph and lymph node specimens were cultured. Swabs from the calf skin biopsy wound contained isolates in nine (47%) cases. They were Bacilli in nine, Cocci in three, Acinetobacter and Erwinia in two cases. Tissue fluid was collected from 10 patients and contained Bacilli in four (40%) and Staphylococci in three (30%). Lymph was drained in four patients and contained isolates in all samples (100%). They were Staphylococcus epidermis, xylosus and aureus, Acinetobacter, Bacillus subtilis and Sarcina. Three lymph nodes were biopsied and contained Staphylococcus chromogenes, xylosus, Enterococcus and Bacillus cereus. In six cases the same phenotypically defined species of bacteria were found in blood and limb tissues or fluids. In the 'control' group of patients with lymphedema without acute or subacute changes all blood cultures were negative. Interestingly, swabs from biopsy wound of these patients contained isolates in 80%, tissue fluid in 68%, lymph in 70% and lymph nodes in 58% of cases. In healthy controls, tissue fluid did not contain bacteria, and lymph isolates were found only in 12% of cases. This study demonstrates that patients with acute episodes of DLA reveal bacteremia in a high percentage of cases. Diversity of blood and tissue bacterial isolates in these patients points to a breakdown of the skin immune barrier in lymphedema and subsequently indiscriminate bacterial colonization of deep tissues and spread to an blood circulation.
TI  - Synthesis and antimicrobial activity in vitro of new amino acids and peptides containing thiazole and oxazole moieties.
AB  - 2-(Pyrrolidinyl)thiazole-4-carboxylic acid 5d, 2-(1-aminoalkyl)thiazole-4-carboxamides and hydrazides 8, 10 have been synthesized using alanine, valine, and proline as educts. In addition oxazole amino acids derived from leucine 20a and alanine 20b and some peptides 13, 14, 16 containing the 5-ring heterocyclic backbone modifications have been prepared. The thiazole and oxazole containing amino acids and peptides showed moderate antibacterial activity in vitro against various Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, etc.) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Protens vulgaris, etc.) bacteria, fungi (Candida albicans), and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisae, etc.).

TI  - Decontamination of human sclera: an in vitro study.
AB  - PURPOSE: The human sclera is frequently used in ophthalmic surgeries and must be  preserved in disinfectants that prevent its contamination. In this study the efficiency of glycerin, absolute alcohol (ethanol), and benzalkonium chloride (1:5,000) as human sclera disinfectants were compared. METHODS: Fresh human scleras were trephined, the scleral disks divided into three groups and contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), or Bacillus cereus (ATCC 11778) for 24 h. Thereafter they were transferred to preservation vials each containing glycerin, absolute alcohol, benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000) or Trypticase Soy Broth (control), respectively, and stored at room temperature. From each vial, two scleral disks were removed after 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days of immersion. Both were plated on blood agar, one being macerated, and both incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 h. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, and B. cereus were recovered from the glycerin-immersed scleral disks until the second, fourth, and fourteenth days, respectively. Bacillus cereus was recovered from those immersed in absolute alcohol until the fourteenth day, whereas disks infected with the other microorganisms and immersed in absolute alcohol presented no growth since the very first day of immersion. Bacillus cereus was recovered from scleral disks immersed in benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000) only on the first day. CONCLUSION: Resistant microorganisms can survive in scleral tissue preserved in glycerin and absolute alcohol. We conclude that benzalkonium chloride diluted in 70% alcohol (1:5,000) in vitro is the best disinfectant for human sclera after 24 h.
TI  - Bacterial populations associated with a sorghum-based fermented weaning cereal.
AB  - Microbiological surveys, to determine the quality and safety, were conducted on 45 sorghum samples comprising dry powders (n = 15) and corresponding fermented (n = 15) and cooked fermented porridge (n = 15) samples collected from households in an informal settlement of the Gauteng Province of South Africa. Mean aerobic plate counts, Gram-negative counts and bacterial spore counts of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge samples. However, mean lactic acid bacteria counts increased in fermented porridge samples, but decreased slightly in cooked fermented porridge samples. The mean pH value of sorghum powder samples decreased in fermented and cooked fermented porridge, respectively. Bacillus (B.) cereus was detected in all 15 sorghum powder samples, while Escherichia (E.) coli was detected in 53%, Clostridium perfringens in 27%, Listeria monocytogenes in 13% and Aeromonas spp., Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella spp. and Yersinia spp., each in 7% of sorghum powder samples. Of the fermented porridge samples, 40% contained B. cereus and 7% contained E. coli. None of the pathogens tested for were detected in cooked fermented porridge samples. B. cereus (53%), B. subtilis (21%), B. thuringiensis (13%), B. licheniformis (10%) and B. coagulans (3%) were identified from 120 isolates randomly selected from spore count plates of the highest dilution showing growth.
TI  - Formation and structure of mixed bacterial communities.
AB  - Mixed bacterial communities are formed by unrelated bacteria on solid media. Mixed bacterial communities on solid media are similar to "classical" colonies and are formed after the growth of a large number of unrelated bacteria simultaneously plated onto a limited area of agar. The morphology of the mixed bacterial communities was similar for different combinations of bacteria and did not change when the bacteria were plated on different media. Different bacterial strains form zones of individual and mixed growth in the structure of mixed bacterial communities. The results of electron microscopic examination indicate that mixed bacterial communities are isolated from their external environment by a surface film. The basic part of this film is formed by an elementary membrane. The membrane of the surface film of mixed bacterial communities is a stable structure occupying a large surface area. The results of this investigation seem to indicate the existence of a special type of co-operation between different species of bacteria. This type of co-operation may be very important in the regulation of interactions between different bacteria and between bacteria and the environment.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and stability of tingenone derivatives.
AB  - Quinone-methide triterpenes of the tingenone series were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity. These compounds were effective against Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Microsporum gypseum and a Gram-negative bacterium, Klebsiella pneumoniae. Under acidic conditions, the quinone-methide part of these compounds rearranged into the divinyl-phenolic system, and the antimicrobial activity was thus lost.
TI  - The smcL gene of Listeria ivanovii encodes a sphingomyelinase C that mediates bacterial escape from the phagocytic vacuole.
AB  - The ruminant pathogen Listeria ivanovii differs from Listeria monocytogenes in that it causes strong, bizonal haemolysis and a characteristic shovel-shaped co-operative haemolytic ('CAMP-like') reaction with Rhodococcus equi. We cloned the gene responsible for the differential haemolytic properties of L. ivanovii, smcL. It encodes a sphingomyelinase C (SMase) highly similar (> 50% identity) to the SMases from Staphylococcus aureus (beta-toxin), Bacillus cereus and Leptospira interrogans. smcL was transcribed monocistronically and was expressed independently of PrfA. Low-stringency Southern blots demonstrated that, within the genus Listeria, smcL was present only in L. ivanovii. We constructed an smcL knock-out mutant. Its phenotype on blood agar was identical to that of L. monocytogenes (i.e. weak haemolysis and no shovel-shaped CAMP-like reaction with R. equi ). This mutant was less virulent for mice, and its intracellular proliferation was impaired in the bovine epithelial-like cell line MDBK. The role of SmcL in intracellular survival was investigated using an L. monocytogenes mutant lacking the membrane-damaging determinants hly, plcA and plcB, being thus unable to grow intracellularly. Complementation of this mutant with smcL on a plasmid was sufficient to promote bacterial intracellular proliferation in MDBK cells. Transmission electron microscopy showed that SmcL mediates the disruption of the phagocytic vacuole and the release of bacteria into the cytosol. Therefore, L. ivanovii possesses a third phospholipase with membrane-damaging activity that, together with PlcA and PlcB, may act in concert with the pore-forming toxin Hly to mediate efficient escape from the vacuolar compartment. The 5' end of smcL is contiguous with the internalin locus i-inlFE, which is also specific to L. ivanovii and is required for full virulence in mice. Thus, smcL forms part of a novel virulence gene cluster in Listeria that is species specific.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of ready-to-eat foods and fresh products in retail shops  and food factories.
AB  - Raw vegetables cut for salad, cooked salad, cooked rice, boiled noodles, bean curd, and cooked Japanese foods were purchased in 27 retail shops in Tokyo. Intact vegetables before being processed and ready-to-eat fresh salad products were obtained from two food factories located in the suburbs of Tokyo. Two hundred thirty-eight retail samples, 137 samples of intact vegetables, and 159 samples of fresh products were examined for aerobic plate count (APC), coliforms, Escherichia coli, Listeria spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus cereus. The APC of retail foods were 2.1 to 5.7 log CFU/g, and the range for the coliforms was 0.1 to 2.3 log CFU/g. The APC and coliform values showed that the raw vegetables cut for salad were the most heavily contaminated among the six kinds of ready-to-eat foods examined. Although L. monocytogenes was not detected, two samples of raw vegetables and five kinds of cooked foods yielded Listeria spp. S. aureus was detected in one sample of Japanese cooked food. The APC of the intact vegetables were 2.9 to 7.3 log CFU/g upon arrival and 2.2 to 7.2 log CFU/g after 3 days storage at 10 degrees C. The APC of the fresh products were 3.4 to 7.6 log CFU/g upon arrival and 4.7 to 8.7 log CFU/g after 3 days storage at 10 degrees C. The isolation rates for coliforms were 6.1 to 50% for intact vegetables and 50 to 66.7% for fresh products. E. coli was detected only in the fresh products. B. cereus was isolated from 20.1% (17 of 81) of the intact vegetables and 9.2% (8 of 87) of the fresh products.
TI  - Pathogenesis of gram-positive bacterial endophthalmitis.
AB  - The severity of endophthalmitis has been associated generally with the virulence  of the offending pathogen. However, precisely what constitutes the virulence in intraocular infections remains ill defined. We therefore sought to identify the basis for virulence for three common ocular pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus) in terms of intraocular growth rates, bacterial localization patterns, and the contribution of cell walls and secreted products to the pathogenesis of endophthalmitis. Rabbit eyes were injected intravitreally with (i) viable B. cereus, E. faecalis, or S. aureus, (ii) metabolically inactive B. cereus, E. faecalis, or S. aureus, (iii) sacculus preparations from each strain, or (iv) culture fluid containing products secreted by each strain. Eyes were assessed at various times following injection by slit lamp biomicroscopy, electroretinography (ERG), bacterial and inflammatory cell enumeration, and histology. B. cereus endophthalmitis followed a more rapid and virulent course than E. faecalis or S. aureus endophthalmitis, eliminating retinal responsiveness, as measured by ERG, by 12 h. Analysis of bacterial localization revealed that B. cereus uniquely migrated rapidly from posterior to anterior segment during infection. Although injection of neither metabolically inactive bacteria nor cell wall sacculi greatly affected ERG, significant intraocular inflammation was observed. Injection of B. cereus or S. aureus culture fluids caused both significant reductions in retinal responsiveness and significant intraocular inflammation, paralleling that seen in natural infections. The results demonstrate that toxins, intraocular localization, and, to a lesser extent, the intraocular host response to cell walls all contribute to the pathogenesis of B. cereus, S. aureus, and E. faecalis endophthalmitis in a pathogen-specific manner. The key pathophysiologic differences in these intraocular diseases highlight opportunities for optimizing conventional therapies and deriving new ones.
TI  - An organosulfur compound isolated from oil-macerated garlic extract, and its antimicrobial effect.
AB  - An organosulfur compound was isolated from oil-macerated garlic extract by silica gel column chromatography and preparative TLC. From the results of NMR, IR, and MS analyses, its structure was determined as E-4,5,9-trithiadeca-1,7-diene-9-oxide (iso-E-10-devinylajoene, iso-E-10-DA). This compound was different from E-4,5,9-trithiadeca-1,6-diene-9-oxide (E-10-devinylajoene, E-10-DA) only in the position of a double bond. Iso-E-10-DA had antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, B. subtilis, and Staphylococcus aureus, and yeasts at the concentration lower than 100 micrograms/ml, but Gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited at the same concentration. The antimicrobial activity of iso-E-10-DA was inferior to those of similar oil-macerated garlic extract compounds such as E-ajoene, Z-ajoene, and Z-10-DA. From these results, it was suggested that trans structure and/or the position of double bond of iso-E-10-DA reduce the antimicrobial activity.
TI  - Macromolecular antimicrobial glycoprotein, achacin, expressed in a methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris.
AB  - A cDNA encoding achacin, an antimicrobial glycoprotein from the body surface mucus of giant African snail Achacina fulica Ferussac, was expressed in a methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, and recombinant achacin (rAch) was secreted in yeast minimal medium in a polyglycosylated form with 80 kDa. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the glycosylated moiety of rAch was composed of 50 mol mannose and 2 mol N-acetylglucosamine residues. Antimicrobial activity using Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus showed that the rAch had a behavior similar to its native counterpart. The rAch showed so wide an antimicrobial spectrum that 0.1 mg/ml rAch inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis in addition to E. coli and S. aureus, whereas it did not appreciably affect the growth of Proteus mirabilis, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus luteus. The rAch was also effective in preventing growth of Vibrio anguillarum and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. The results suggested that the rAch had great potential of using as an antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Effect of "siljo" fermentation on growth of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - The fate of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Listeria monocytogenes in control gruel and fermenting "siljo" was assessed. S. aureus reached levels of 10(8) cfu/ml within 48 h in the control gruel. In fermenting "siljo" the count decreased all through the fermentation time. B.cereus was completely inhibited in fermenting "siljo" within 24 h, whereas it survived until 72 h in the control gruel. Complete inhibition of L.monocytogenes was noted at 48 h in fermenting "siljo". L.monocytogenes survived until 96 h in control gruel. Fermentation resulted in fall in pH to < 5.0 within 48-72 h and increase in titratable acidity was also noted. As "siljo" is usually consumed after 72 h of fermentation, "siljo" fermented for more than three days is safe from food intoxication caused by B. cereus or S.aureus or infection from L.monocytogenes.
TI  - The role of the non-conserved residue at position 104 of class A beta-lactamases  in susceptibility to mechanism-based inhibitors.
AB  - The role of the non-conserved amino acid residue at position 104 of the class A beta-lactamases, which comprises a highly conserved sequence of amino acids at the active sites of these enzymes, in both the hydrolysis of beta-lactam substrates and inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors was investigated. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the penPC gene encoding the Bacillus cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I to replace Asp104 with the corresponding Staphylococcus aureus PC1 residue Ala104. Kinetic data obtained with the purified Asp104Ala B. cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I was compared to that obtained from the wild-type B. cereus and S. aureus enzymes. Replacement of amino acid residue 104 had little effect on the Michaelis parameters for the hydrolysis of both S- and A-type penicillins. Relative to wild-type enzyme, the Asp104Ala beta-lactamase I had 2-fold higher Km values for benzylpenicillin and methicillin, but negligible difference in Km for ampicillin and oxacillin. However, kcat values were also slightly increased resulting in little change in catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km. In contrast, the Asp104Ala beta-lactamase I became more like the S. aureus enzyme in its response to the mechanism-based inhibitors clavulanic acid and 6-beta-(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)amido-penicillanic acid sulfone with respect to both response to the inhibitors and subsequent enzymatic properties. Based on the known three-dimensional structures of the Bacillus licheniformis 749/C, Escherichia coli TEM and S. aureus PC1 beta-lactamases, a model for the role of the non-conserved residue at position 104 in the process of inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors is proposed.
TI  - Uptake kinetics of nucleic acid targeting dyes in S. aureus, E. faecalis and B. cereus: a flow cytometric study.
AB  - For flow cytometry-based detection as well as susceptibility testing and counting, staining of the bacterial cells is essential. In an attempt to develop rapid preparatory procedures for nucleic acid staining of wild type Gram positive bacteria, the uptake of fluorescent dyes in viable S. aureus, E. faecalis, and B. cereus cells was studied by flow cytometry under conditions intended to block probe efflux and increase cell wall permeability. The aim of the study was to develop procedures which allow rapid nucleic acid staining independent of fixation, since ethanol fixation is time-consuming and may mask phenomena associated with viability and lead to uncontrolled loss and aggregation of cells. The dye uptake was measured repeatedly after treating cells with metabolic inhibitors in order to block probe efflux, or cold shock (0 degree C) to increase permeability. The probes used were mithramycin (Mi), ethidium bromide (EB), DAPI, Hoechst 33342 and Hoechst 33258. None of the procedures facilitated uptake of the dyes to a level similar to that obtained in fixed control cells in all of the species. After metabolic inhibition of B. cereus cells, DAPI and Hoechst fluorescence increased to a level similar to or above that found in fixed cells, indicating that the uptake of these dyes is limited by energy-dependent efflux. A similar increase of DAPI fluorescence was observed after cold shock suggesting the uptake of this dye to be limited also by permeability in B. cereus. The Mi and EB fluorescence increased to the level of the fixed control cells under all conditions tested, suggesting free probe influx in this species. Generally, probe uptake in S. aureus and E. faecalis was lower than in B. cereus cells, and no permeabilizing effect of cold shock was observed. In some experiments the fluorescence exceeded that of ethanol fixed control cells, indicating that the fixation may cause conformational changes in DNA.
TI  - Isolation and detection of Listeria monocytogenes using fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates for phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.
AB  - The BCM Listeria monocytogenes detection system (LMDS) consists of a selective preenrichment broth (LMPEB), selective enrichment broth (LMSEB), selective/differential plating medium (LMPM), and identification on a confirmatory plating medium (LMCM). The efficacy of the BCM LMDS was determined using pure cultures and naturally and artificially contaminated environmental sponges. The BCM LMPEB allowed the growth of Listeria and resuscitation of heat-injured L. monocytogenes. The BCM LMSEB, which contains the fluorogenic substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-myo-inositol-1-phosphate and detects phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC) activity, provided a presumptive positive test for the presence of pathogenic Listeria (L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii) after 24 h at 35 degrees C. An initial inoculum of 10 to 100 CFU/ml of L. monocytogenes in BCM LMSEB yielded a fluorogenic response after 24 h. On BCM LMPM, L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii were the two Listeria species forming turquoise convex colonies (1.0 to 2.5 mm in diameter) from PI-PLC activity on the chromogenic substrate, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoxyl-myo-inositol-1-phosphate. L. monocytogenes was distinguished from L. ivanovii by either its fluorescence on BCM LMCM or acid production from rhamnose. False-positive organisms (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and yeasts) were eliminated by at least one of the media in the BCM LMDS. Using a pure culture system, the BCM LMDS detected one to two L. monocytogenes cells from a sponge rehydrated in 10 ml of DE neutralizing broth. In an analysis of 162 environmental sponges from facilities inspected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the values for identification of L. monocytogenes by BCM LMDS and the USDA method were 30 and 14 sites, respectively, with sensitivity and specificity values of 85.7 and 100.0% versus 40.0 and 66.1%, respectively. No false-positive organisms were isolated by BCM LMDS, whereas 26.5% of the sponges tested by the USDA method produced false-positive results.
TI  - Evaluation of accuracy and repeatability of identification of food-borne pathogens by automated bacterial identification systems.
AB  - The performances of five automated microbial identification systems, relative to  that of a reference identification system, for their ability to accurately and repeatedly identify six common food-borne pathogens were assessed. The systems assessed were the MicroLog system (Biolog Inc., Hayward, Calif.), the Microbial Identification System (MIS; MIDI Inc., Newark, Del.), the VITEK system (bioMerieux Vitek, Hazelwood, Mo.), the MicroScan WalkAway 40 system (Dade-MicroScan International, West Sacramento, Calif.), and the Replianalyzer system (Oxoid Inc., Nepean, Ontario, Canada). The sensitivities and specificities of these systems for the identification of food-borne isolates of Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., and verotoxigenic Escherichia coli were determined with 40 reference positive isolates and 40 reference negative isolates for each pathogen. The sensitivities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 42.5 to 100%, and the specificities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 32.5 to 100%. Some of the systems had difficulty correctly identifying the reference isolates when the results were compared to those from the reference identification tests. The sensitivity of MIS for the identification of S. aureus, B. cereus, E. coli, and C. jejuni, for example, ranged from 47.5 to 72. 5%. The sensitivity of the Microlog system for the identification of E. coli was 72.5%, and the sensitivity of the VITEK system for the identification of B. cereus was 42.5%. The specificities of four of the five systems for the identification of all of the species tested with the available databases were greater than or equal to 97.5%; the exception was MIS for the identification of C. jejuni, which displayed a specificity of 32.5% when it was tested with reference negative isolates including Campylobacter coli and other Campylobacter species. All systems had >80% sensitivities for the identification of Salmonella species and Listeria species at the genus level. The repeatability of these systems for the identification of test isolates ranged from 30 to 100%. Not all systems included all six pathogens in their databases; thus, some species could not be tested with all systems. The choice of automated microbial identification system for the identification of a food-borne pathogen would depend on the availability of identification libraries within the systems and the performance of the systems for the identification of the pathogen.
TI  - Pulsed-light inactivation of food-related microorganisms.
AB  - The effects of high-intensity pulsed-light emissions of high or low UV content on the survival of predetermined populations of Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus were investigated. Bacterial cultures were seeded separately on the surface of tryptone soya-yeast extract agar and were reduced by up to 2 or 6 log10 orders with 200 light pulses (pulse duration, approximately 100 ns) of low or high UV content, respectively (P < 0.001).
TI  - Identification and semiquantitative estimation of antibiotics added to complete feeds, premixes, and concentrates.
AB  - Classical microbiological methods for determining antimicrobial compounds in feeds are nonspecific. Thus, there is a need to identify biological activity, and bioautography is used for this purpose. A routine method for detecting the following antimicrobial substances in feeds is described: avilamycin, avoparcin, Zn-bacitracin, erythromycin, flavomycin, furazolidone, lasalocid, monensin, narasin, penicillin, salinomycin, spiramycin, tetracyclines, tylosin, and virginiamycin. Carbadox can be detected by UV light examination of the plates prior to bioautography. Semiquantitative estimations of antibiotic content are compared with quantitative determinations of the above mentioned substances in feeds, except erythromycin, penicillin, and tetracyclines. Detection limits range from 0.1 mg/kg (chlortetracycline) to 20 mg/kg (lasalocid). The method involves agar diffusion of buffered samples, a neutral extraction of polyether antibiotics followed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and an acid extraction for other antibiotics followed by TLC. Five test bacteria were used for the main detection by agar diffusion: Micrococcus luteus ATCC 9341, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538P, Corynebacterium xerosis NCTC 9755, Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, and B. subtilis ATCC 6633. Identification after TLC was achieved by bioautography with the most sensitive microorganism(s). This method allows one laboratory technician to analyze up to 30 feed samples within 2.5 working days, provided that feeds of the same category are analyzed in the same run, and that labels of additives are available. Qualitative and semiquantitative information are valuable when performing a quantitative antibiotic determination and it provides proof that the activity determined is due to the tested substance. This last feature is essential from the perspective of quality assurance of results.
TI  - Synergist effect of sucrose fatty acid esters on nisin inhibition of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Nisin in combination with the sucrose fatty acid esters, sucrose palmitate (P-1570 and P-1670) or sucrose stearate (S-1570 and S-1670) was tested against a range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Initial liquid culture investigation showed that the sugar ester P-1670 resulted in a synergist enhancement of the bacteriostatic activity of nisin against Gram-positive bacteria and not Gram-negative bacteria. Some enhancement of the bactericidal activity of nisin against Listeria monocytogenes was also observed. This increased nisin inhibitory effect was confirmed on solid media using plates with gradients of pH and NaCl. Synergism was observed with all four sucrose fatty acid esters, which enhanced the antimicrobial activity of nisin against several strains of L. monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus (both cells and spores), Lactobacillus plantarum and Staphylococcus aureus. The combination of nisin and the sucrose fatty acid esters showed no inhibition of Gram-negative bacteria (Salmonella enteritidis, Salm. typhimurium and Pseudomonas aeruginosa).
TI  - In-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam relative to other antibiotics against blood culture isolates.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antibiotics is an increasing problem in many countries. Accurate locally relevant information is essential for detection and control of emerging resistance and to facilitate choice of empirical antibiotic therapy in the immediate management of seriously ill patients. We have determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of piperacillin/tazobactam for 97 strains of bacteria (55 Enterobacteriaceae, 13 non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, 22 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 Enterococcus faecalis and 1 Bacillus cereus) isolated from blood cultures and compared its activity to that of amoxycillin, co-amoxiclav, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, piperacillin, cefotaxime. The strains were consecutive non-fastidious isolates with the following qualifications: coagulase negative staphylococci and diphtheroids were excluded and the number of Staphylococcus aureus isolates was limited to 12 methicillin-resistant and 10 methicillin-sensitive strains. Multiple isolates of the same species from individual patients were not included. The minimum inhibition concentrations of methicillin, penicillin, teichoplanin and vancomycin were also determined for specific groups of organisms. MICs were determined by the Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on Mueller Hinton agar. The MICs of appropriate American Type Culture Collection control strains were determined. Based on the interpretative criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (USA), 87 per cent of Gram-negative bacilli were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam compared with amoxycillin 26 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, co-amoxiclav 54 per cent, piperacillin 56 per cent, cefotaxime 69 per cent, ceftazidime 84 per cent, gentamicin 85 per cent and ciprofloxacin 91 per cent. Of all isolates 75 per cent were sensitive to piperacillin/tazobactam, compared with amoxycillin 22 per cent, cephalothin 35 per cent, piperacillin 41 per cent, co-amoxiclav 52 per cent, cefotaxime 59 per cent, ceftazidime 60 per cent, gentamicin 74 per cent and ciprofloxacin 77 per cent. Two isolates (1 E. coli and 1 Klebsiella pneumoniae) with antibiograms consistent with the relatively new resistance phenomenon of extended spectrum beta-lactamase production were identified. The spectrum of activity of piperacillin-tazobactam for empirical antibiotic therapy is significantly greater than that of piperacillin alone and is similar to that of ciprofloxacin and gentamicin.
TI  - Amino-acid sequence and three-dimensional structure of the Staphylococcus aureus  metalloproteinase at 1.72 A resolution.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aureolysin is an extracellular zinc-dependent metalloproteinase from  the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. This enzyme exhibits in vitro activity against several molecules of biological significance for the host, indicating that it is involved in the pathology of staphylococcal diseases. RESULTS: Here we report the amino-acid sequence and inhibitor-free X-ray crystal structure of aureolysin, a member of the thermolysin family of zinc-dependent metalloproteinases. This enzyme, which binds one zinc and three calcium ions, comprises a single chain of 301 amino acids that consists of a beta-strand-rich upper domain and an alpha-helix-rich lower domain. CONCLUSIONS: The overall structure of aureolysin is very similar to that of the other three members of this family whose structures are known - thermolysin (TLN) from Bacillus thermoproteolyticus, neutral protease (NP) from Bacillus cereus and elastase (PAE) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. But an important difference has been encountered: in contrast to what has been observed in the other three members of this family (TLN, NP and PAE), inhibitor-free aureolysin displays a 'closed' active site cleft conformation. This new structure therefore raises questions about the universality of the hinge-bending motion model for the neutral metalloproteinases.
TI  - Kits for the detection of some bacterial food poisoning toxins: problems, pitfalls and benefits.
AB  
TI  - A review of analytical methods for the detection of bacterial toxins.
AB  
TI  - Comparative antibacterial effects of novel Pelargonium essential oils and solvent extracts.
AB  - The scented leaves of a number of Pelargonium (Geraniaceae) species and cultivars were extracted using steam distillation, petroleum spirit and methanol. The extracts were assessed for their antibacterial activity in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus and Staph. epidermidis. The results indicated substantial antibacterial activity and suggested that Pelargonium essential oils could be used as novel antibacterial agents. The methanolic and petroleum spirit extracts were more potent antibacterial agents than the steam-distilled volatile samples. The results suggest that Pelargonium essential oils and solvent extracts could be used as novel food or cosmetic antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Prevalence of food-borne pathogens and growth potential of Salmonella in weaning  foods from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
AB  - One hundred samples of ready-to-consume feeding bottle contents from outpatient infants were examined for the presence of Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Nearly all samples had very high gross bacterial contamination. Three Salmonella isolates were encountered from bottle contents made of cow's milk and gruel made from cereal blend. All belonged to group D. Of the 108, isolates 67 were Staph. aureus and 38 were B. cereus. The potential of Salmonella spp to grow in weaning foods was also determined on one common factory-produced infant food and one home-made infant food. In both items, Salmonella increased by approximately 4 log units within eight hours and reached counts as high as log 8 cfu/ml within twelve hours.
TI  - Microbiological quality of hot meals served by airlines.
AB  - The microbiological quality of 1,012 hot meals served on aircraft was studied in  1991 to 1994. The material included dishes prepared in 33 countries all over the world. The geometric means of aerobic colony counts and Escherichia coli were significantly lower in breakfasts (P < 0.05) than in main dishes. Pathogenic bacteria were found in 30 samples (3.0%), Bacillus cereus being the most common pathogen. The frequencies of B. cereus and Staphylococcus aureus did not differ between breakfasts and main dishes. Many of the samples exceeded the minimum acceptable microbiological standards recommended by the Association of European Airlines (AEA) for E. coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella; i.e., 8.2%, 0.6%, 0.7%, 0.7% and 0.3%, respectively. There were considerable differences in aerobic colony counts and E. coli counts between countries where the food was prepared.
TI  - Duplex (thermotroph-psychrotroph) quadrant plates: convenient, error-avoiding tools for monitoring of HACCP-contained food lines and for epidemiological investigations under conditions of military or other constraints.
AB  - A set of two "two-tier" (thermotroph-psychrotroph) single quadrant plates (QPs) was developed previously to allow convenient enumeration of numbers of colony-forming units of most pertinent pathogenic bacteria or marker bacteria in foods. These include Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, thermotrophic and psychrotrophic Enterobacteriaceae, Clostridium spp., and Enterococcus spp. As the QPs had given excellent results in monitoring samples of marketed food products potentially involved in food-transmitted illnesses, the approach was tested for practicability under military deployment and other constraints. Three approaches were envisaged: (i) validating lapse-free adherence to meticulously codified good military catering practices; (ii) acceptance/rejection testing of locally procured foods or meals; and (iii) employing rapid culture in support of evidence obtained by microscopy in attempts to identify foods involved in infectious or toxic disease outbreaks occurring in the field. The method was found to be elegant, avoiding confusion when larger number of specimens were to be screened, as well as easy to teach to staff with little or no training in microbiology, and it provided entirely reliable results. For use outside the laboratory, preparation of food macerates by use of shake flasks containing glass or plastic beads and peptone saline as a substitute for stomaching was found acceptable, though the shake flask technique led to slightly diminished colony counts. Results obtained with incubation times shortened to ca. 12 h could be relied on only when the results were alarmingly positive, but not when the colony counts at the 12-h point did not yet indicate a reason for concern.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of two bacteriocins of Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221.
AB  - Lactobacillus acidophilus LF221 produced bacteriocin-like activity against different bacteria including some pathogenic and food-spoilage species. Besides some lactic acid bacteria, the following species were inhibited: Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sp., Listeria innocua, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus D. L. acidophilus LF221 produced at least two bacteriocins, acidocin LF221 A and acidocin LF221 B, which were purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, ion-exchange chromatography, hydrophobic interaction and reverse-phase FPLC. The antibacterial substances were heat-stable, sensitive to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, pepsin, pronase, proteinase K) and migrated as 3500- to 5000-Da proteins on sodium dodecyl sulphate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The sequences of 46 amino-terminal amino acid residues of peptide A and 35 of peptide B were determined. Among the residues identified, no modified amino acids were found. No significant homology was found between the amino acid sequences of acidocin LF221 A and other bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria and 26% homology was found between acidocin LF221 B and brevicin 27. L. acidophilus LF221 may be of interest as a probiotic strain because of its human origin and inhibition of pathogenic bacteria, especially clostridium difficile.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of the leaf extract of jatropha tanjorensis (e&r).
AB  - The ethalonic extract of the leaves of Jatropha tanjorensis Ellis & Saroja was tested for antimicrobial activities against gram positive - Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, gram negative E. coli and mycobacterium pheli.
TI  - Studying the effect of temperature on microbial growth using multiplicative model.
AB  - The specific growth rates of Brochothrix thermosphacta, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens at various temperatures were taken from the Food MicroModel database, and the data sets of specific growth rate versus temperature were fitted using the multiplicative model (r = a Td, r = specific growth rate; T = temperature; a, d = regression parameters). The exponential d-value derived from microbial growth at suboptimum temperatures reflected the effectiveness of temperature in enhancing growth. A microorganism with a large d-value exhibited a large increment of growth rate as temperature increased. The d-value of a microorganism was related to the temperature range for growth. The temperature range for the growth of psychrotrophs was usually narrow for B. thermosphacta and Y. enterocolitica; hence the d-values of these two psychrotrophs were close to 1 whereas d-values of mesophiles, such as B. cereus, E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella spp., and S. aureus, were 2.31-2.90, and the d-value of C. perfringens, a thermophile, was 3.29. The values of parameter a of the model were affected by extra salt added into cultures. For all the strains mentioned above, the a-values decreased when the cultures contained higher levels of salt. The lowering of the a-value implied that the influence of temperature on the growth rate in the model was reduced. The change of the d-value was dependent on the capability of the microorganism to overcome the obstacle to growth and was affected by the composition of the nutrients and by inhibitory factors in the culture. The influence of environmental factors on the d-value was also found in Chinese sausages. The d-value of a dominant spoilage strain of Enterococcus sp. derived from sausages was 0.833 whereas the d-value derived from MRS cultures was 2.36. In refrigerated foods which usually contained some preservatives and were stored at low temperature, the d-value of psychrotrophic spoilage bacteria was around 1. In this case, the linear model could be a reasonable choice for predicting the proliferation of spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Expression and purification of epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN) from Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - The expression of staphylococcal epidermal cell differentiation inhibitor (EDIN), an ADP-ribosyltransferase targeting the small GTP-binding protein rho p21, was examined using Bacillus subtilis. A recombinant plasmid, containing B. licheniformis alpha-amylase promoter flanking either a beta-glucanase or a B. cereus sphingomyelinase signal sequence, and a DNA fragment corresponding to mature EDIN were constructed and used to transform B. subtilis KN2. Transformants were designated ED7 and ED8, respectively. ED7 extracellularly produced recombinant protein, which was purified to homogeneity through column chromatography using SP-Toyopearl 650 cation-exchange gel and the HA1000 hydroxyapatite HPLC column. ED8 did not grow in broth culture. Biochemical and biological studies of purified protein revealed that ED7 produced a correctly processed recombinant EDIN, indistinguishable from natural EDIN.
TI  - Antibacterial and chemical evaluation of Chromolaena moritziana.
AB  - Chromolaena moritziana (Sch. Bip. ex Hieron.) King & Robin. (Asteraceae) is used  in local ethnomedicine as an anticatarrhal, a depurative and in the treatment of skin diseases. This ethnopharmacological information has a direct correlation with that reported for other Chromolaena species. Dichloromethane and aqueous extracts from the leaves as well as ethyl acetate extracts from the flowers have shown antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and a UV-V light effect was not observed against this bacterium. These results may justify the ethnomedical use in skin infections. The flavonoids kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, rutin and isoquercitrin as well as the triterpene alpha-amyrin were isolated.
TI  - A universal protocol for PCR detection of 13 species of foodborne pathogens in foods.
AB  - A universal protocol for PCR detection of 13 species of foodborne pathogens in foods was developed. The protocol used a universal culture medium and the same PCR conditions with 13 sets of specific primers. The 13 species of foodborne pathogens examined were Escherichia coli, E. coli-ETEC, E. coli-O157:H7, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, Vibrio cholerae, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. No interference was observed using the PCR assay when food sample was artificially inoculated with each individual bacterial species. Twelve different seafood samples and two soft cheese samples without artificial inoculation were examined by this protocol. Vibrio vulnificus, Salmonella spp., E. coli, Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus cereus were detected in some foods. Internal probe hybridization and nested PCR procedures were used to confirm the above findings.
TI  - In-vitro photobactericidal activity of aminoacridines.
AB  - The toxicities of several aminoacridines were measured against pathogenic strains of both Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa) organisms. In several cases, illumination at a light dose of 6.3 J/cm2 resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal drug concentrations required, giving up to 50-fold increases in bactericidal activity. Derivatives of 9-aminoacridine (aminacrine) exhibited phototoxicity against one or more of the test organisms, but the established photosensitizing acridines proflavine and acridine orange were photobactericidal against all strains.
TI  - A xanthanolide with potent antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study was conducted to find constituents of an annual herb, Xanthium sibiricum Patr er Widd, with effective antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). By monitoring antibacterial activity against MRSA strains, it was shown that a sesquiterpene lactone, identified as [3aR-(3a alpha, 7 beta,8a beta)]-3,3a,4,7,8,8a-hexahydro-7- methyl-3-methylene-6-(3-oxo-1-butenyl)-2H-cyclohepta[b]furan-2-one, or xanthatin, isolated from leaves of the herb, had outstandingly potent activity against S. aureus species, including MRSA; its activity against MRSA and MSSA strains was similar. Other bacteria, e.g. Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhi, were also susceptible at the concentrations tested but the compound had no inhibitory effect on some other bacteria, including Escherichia coli. The results show that xanthatin has outstandingly potent activity against strains of S. aureus but that the activity of the compound is highly species-specific.
TI  - Novel selective and non-selective optical detection of microorganisms.
AB  - A new instrument, capable of detecting metabolic changes due to microbiological activity, is described. Optical changes in growth media are monitored in a semi-fluid zone that separates the liquid medium containing the sample. Data demonstrate that common media can be utilized in conjunction with this rapid automated technology. Nutrient broth with the pH dye indicator. bromocresol purple was suitable for total counts. Selective media containing dyes were utilized to assess the presence or absence of specific groups of organisms. Biochemical reactions, such as lysine decarboxylase activity, were identified by the unique generated patterns, and specific enzymatic cleavage reactions with chromogenic substrates, such as 5-bromo-4 chloro-3 indolyl-beta-D-glucuronic acid (X-GLUC), were monitored.
TI  - A study of photobactericidal activity in the phenothiazinium series.
AB  - The photodynamic antibacterial properties of a closely related series of commercially available phenothiazinium dyes were tested against a range of pathogenic strains of Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus) and Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). The photosensitisers were illuminated using a non-laser light source at a fluence of 1.75 mW cm-2 and this resulted in the enhancement of antibacterial activity in liquid culture. In several cases, illumination resulted in considerable decreases in the minimum lethal concentrations required, giving up to 100-fold increases in bactericidal activity.
TI  - Meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  - The authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the United States of America (USA) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. Cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the USA, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. The potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include Salmonella (with special attention to S. Typhimurium DT104), Escherichia coli O157:H7, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from Bacillus cereus and Aeromonas spp. In conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of food-related Penicillium sp. against pathogenic bacteria in laboratory media and a cheese model system.
AB  - Food-related Penicillium species (n = 34) and Geotrichum candidum (n = 11) grown  on Czapek Dox and brie agar were tested for their ability to suppress growth of pathogenic bacteria. Ten out of 13 P. camemberti showed antagonistic activity while the other species did not interact significantly with the bacterial growth. The order of inhibition was: Gram-negative bacteria and Bacillus cereus > Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus sp. > Micrococcus sp. whereas Lactobacillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus and some Micrococcus sp. were unaffected. When Salmonella typhimurium was inoculated together with P. camemberti P25 in brie agar, bacterial growth was inhibited during the first 6 d of incubation whereafter growth started. The inhibition of L. monocytogenes was similar but less pronounced. The antimicrobial activity produced by P. camemberti P25 and L84 was enhanced with increasing amount of sucrose in the medium. The activity was increased at low pH and destroyed at pH above 8. It was detectable at 15 degrees C but not at 37 degrees C indicating that volatile metabolites might be involved. No significant accumulation of organic acids and no secondary metabolites such as mycotoxins were detected. HSGC-MS analysis indicated that acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, 3-methylbutanal and 1-octen-3-ol were produced by P. camemberti during the period when inhibitory activity was observed. Pure acetaldehyde and benzaldehyde were shown to be inhibitory to L. monocytogenes and Salm. typhimurium when grown at 15 degrees C and pH 5.5 and 7.0.
TI  - Rapid purification, partial characterization, and antimicrobial spectrum of the bacteriocin, Pediocin AcM, from Pediococcus acidilactici M.
AB  - The bacteriocin from Pediococcus acidilactici M, designated as Pediocin AcM, was  rapidly purified to homogeneity by the pH mediated cell adsorption-desorption method and semi-preparative reversed-phase HPLC. The purification yield was 40.4% and the specific activity was increased by 2450-fold. It gave a single band and a single peak on SDS-PAGE and HPLC analysis, respectively. When subjected to electrospray LC-MS analysis, the protein was found to be highly pure and the molecular weight was determined as 4,618 Da. High concentration of the bacteriocin (> 50 micrograms/ml) showed good resistance to extremes of pH (1-12) and temperature (121 degrees C). Pediocin AcM was deduced to be a monomer with an intra-peptide disulfide bond from the results of reversed-phase analytical HPLC analyses after reduction, oxidation and trypsin digestion. P. acidilactici M inhibited a large number of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus coagulans, B. cereus, and Aeromonas hydrophila.
TI  - Bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility testing with SYTOX green nucleic acid stain.
AB  - A fluorescent nucleic acid stain that does not penetrate living cells was used to assess the integrity of the plasma membranes of bacteria. SYTOX Green nucleic acid stain is an unsymmetrical cyanine dye with three positive charges that is completely excluded from live eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. Binding of SYTOX Green stain to nucleic acids resulted in a > 500-fold enhancement in fluorescence emission (absorption and emission maxima at 502 and 523 nm, respectively), rendering bacteria with compromised plasma membranes brightly green fluorescent. SYTOX Green stain is readily excited by the 488-nm line of the argon ion laser. The fluorescence signal from membrane-compromised bacteria labeled with SYTOX Green stain was typically > 10-fold brighter than that from intact organisms. Bacterial suspensions labeled with SYTOX Green stain emitted green fluorescence in proportion to the fraction of permeabilized cells in the population, which was quantified by microscopy, fluorometry, or flow cytometry. Flow cytometric and fluorometric approaches were used to quantify the effect of beta-lactam antibiotics on the cell membrane integrity of Escherichia coli. Detection and discrimination of live and permeabilized cells labeled with SYTOX Green stain by flow cytometry were markedly improved over those by propidium iodide-based tests. These studies showed that bacterial labeling with SYTOX Green stain is an effective alternative to conventional methods for measuring bacterial viability and antibiotic susceptibility.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the adhering human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB.
AB  - The spent culture supernatant of the human Lactobacillus acidophilus strain LB produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. It decreased the in vitro viability of Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. In contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. The activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. The antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. Activity against S. typhimurium SL1344 infecting human cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional C3H/He/oujco mouse model with S. typhimurium C5 infection and oral treatment with the LB spent culture supernatant.
TI  - Food-borne disease outbreaks due to bacteria in Taiwan, 1986 to 1995.
AB  - Between 1986 and 1995, 852 outbreaks of food-borne disease involving 26,173 cases and 20 deaths were reported in Taiwan. About 80% of the outbreaks occurred in the warmer months, i.e., between April and October. Of the 852 reported outbreaks, 555 (65%) were caused by bacterial pathogens. The three most common bacteria involved were Vibrio parahaemolyticus (35%, 197 of 555 outbreaks), Staphylococcus aureus (30%, 169 of 555 outbreaks), and Bacillus cereus (18%, 104 of 555 outbreaks).
TI  - Sterilisation of surgical instruments with formaldehyde gas.
AB  - Haemostatic forceps contaminated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and Aspergillus flavus were exposed to formaldehyde gas for up to 48 hours at different temperatures and relative humidities. After 24 hours at 22 to 24 degrees C and a relative humidity of 73 per cent they were sterilised reliably and completely.
TI  - Rapid identification of bacterially contaminated platelets using reagent strips:  glucose and pH analysis as markers of bacterial metabolism.
AB  - BACKGROUND: One in every 1000 units of platelets is bacterially contaminated, which puts patients at risk for transfusion-associated sepsis and death. However, there is currently no screening test in place to detect contaminated units. The use of commercially available multiple-reagent urine dipsticks for this purpose was evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Platelet concentrates were inoculated with either sterile saline or suspensions of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Serratia marcescens to a final concentration of 50 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL. The platelets were analyzed daily by the use of multiple-reagent strips, quantitative culture, and glucometry. RESULTS: B cereus grew rapidly, reaching 10(7) CFU per mL 1 day after inoculation, while S. epidermidis grew slowly, achieving similar concentration 4 to 6 days after inoculation. Two of 10 dipstick reagents, glucose and pH, proved useful in detecting bacteria. Both were lower in bacterially contaminated units than in controls. Glucose data obtained from automated analyzers validated the dipstick data. All organisms were detected at concentrations > or = 10(7) CFU per mL, and S. aureus and K. pneumoniae were detected in the range of 10(3) to 10(5) CFU per mL. CONCLUSION: The multiple-reagent test used had a sensitivity and specificity of 95 percent (> or = 10(7) CFU/mL) and 98 to 100 percent, respectively. These data indicate that urine dipsticks can be used to rapidly and inexpensively detect bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates, which potentially will reduce morbidity and mortality at minimal cost.
TI  - Survival of selected bacteria and fungi in hypertonic (7.2%) saline.
AB  
TI  - Intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  - Bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. Toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. There are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. Heat labile toxins are produced by Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by Escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. Similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by Staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the United States, and Yersenia enterocolitica. Protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. For example the Shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. Intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely Clostridium difficile toxin A and B, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by Escherichia coli, and Shiga toxin and Shiga-like toxins are presented.
TI  - Cloning of the glutamine synthetase gene from group B streptococci.
AB  - The glnA gene from the human pathogen Streptococcus agalactiae was cloned from a  genomic library prepared with the lambda phage vector lambdaDASHII. A 4.6-kb DNA fragment of one of the recombinant phages was subcloned in pUC18. This Escherichia coli clone expressed a 52-kDa protein encoded by a 1,341-bp open reading frame. The nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame and the deduced amino acid sequence shared a significant degree of homology with the sequences of other glutamine synthetases (GS). The highest homology was between our deduced protein and GS of gram-positive bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. Plasmids with the cloned streptococcal glnA were able to complement E. coli glnA mutants grown on minimal media. Rabbit antisera to streptococcal GS recombinant protein recognized not only the recombinant protein but also a similar-sized band in mutanolysin extracts of all group B streptococcal strains tested, regardless of polysaccharide type or surface protein profile. The amino acid sequence of the deduced protein had similarities to other streptococcal cell-surface-bound proteins. The possible functional role of the immunological features of streptococcal GS is discussed.
TI  - Incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  - Rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  More than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. Clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for C. difficile enterotoxin. However, 27 cefmetazole-induced diarrheic cases were not associated with C. difficile. Other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as Campylobacter spp., Bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella spp., Vibrio spp., Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. However, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. This was ascribed to the overgrowth of Clostridium innocuum and Clostridium sporogenes. There were no remarkable differences in changes in other bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.
TI  - Evaluation of swirling, pH, and glucose tests for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infrequent, episodes of transfusion-associated bacterial sepsis may lead to serious outcomes or death and therefore are of concern. This study evaluates the sensitivity of three surrogate tests for the presence of bacteria in platelet concentrates: cessation of swirling, low extracellular pH, and low plasma glucose levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Day 0 platelet concentrates were inoculated with low levels of one of seven bacterial strains and stored with agitation at 20 to 24 degrees C for up to 5 days. In the morning and afternoon of each day of storage, bacterial levels were ascertained by quantitative plate culture, and platelet concentrates were tested for platelet pH, plasma glucose, and swirling. Quantitative and semiquantitative dipstick techniques were used to determine pH and glucose levels. RESULTS: Platelet concentrates had attained stationary phase growth of Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Enterobacter cloacae, Streptococcus mitis, or Staphylococcus epidermidis (> or = 10(7) -10(8) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL) before either the swirling or dipstick methods suggested the presence of bacteria. The sensitivity of swirling and glucose tests for detecting bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates was generally comparable. Although the sensitivity of the pH test was generally similar to that of swirling and glucose tests for most bacteria, platelet concentrates contaminated with E. cloacae had normal pH despite the presence of high levels of bacteria (> or = 10(7)-10(8) CFU/mL). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity in detection of bacteria in platelet concentrates by the swirling technique or by measuring extracellular pH or plasma glucose is less than the sensitivity reported for microscopy with Gram stain (10(5)-10(6) CFU/mL), fluorescence microscopy with acridine orange stain (10(4)-10(5) CFU/mL), chemiluminescence detection of ribosomal RNA (10(3)-10(4) CFU/mL), and automated bacterial culture (1 CFU/sample volume).
TI  - Comparison of the beta-toxins from Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius.
AB  - The beta-toxins produced by Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus intermedius  were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants. Although the toxin from S. aureus has been throughly studied, less is known about its unique counterpart from S. intermedius. This is the first reported purification and analysis of the S. intermedius beta-toxin. Both toxins have similar enzymatic properties, belong to the class of neutral sphingomyelinases C, and have a high specificity for sphingomyelin. They also hydrolyze lysophosphatidylcholine at a much slower rate, but have no activity toward phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, or phosphatidylserine. The kinetic parameters determined for both proteins (apparent Km 1.4 mM, Vmax 100 mmol/min/microg protein) are identical. Despite these similarities, the size and amino acid composition of the two beta-toxins differ. Molecular mass values, determined by electrophoresis and gel filtration, indicate that the both enzymes are single polypeptides. The decrease in sphingomyelinase activity of S. aureus beta-toxin upon pretreatment with dithiothreitol (DTT) indicates the presence of a disulfide bond in the protein. In contrast, DTT has no effect on the enzymatic activity of S. intermedius beta-toxin. This observation is consistent with the absence of detectable cysteine residue in the protein. N-terminal amino acid sequences determined for the first 19 residues of both beta-toxins also differ, only nine of the first 19 residues are identical. Further evidence that the two proteins differ was obtained by immunological analysis which demonstrated crossreactivity but a lack of identity.
TI  - Inhibition of microbial growth by ajoene, a sulfur-containing compound derived from garlic.
AB  - Ajoene, a garlic-derived sulfur-containing compound that prevents platelet aggregation, exhibited broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. Growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Streptomyces griseus, was inhibited at 5 micrograms of ajoene per ml. Staphylococcus aureus and Lactobacillus plantarum also were inhibited below 20 micrograms of ajoene per ml. For gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, MICs were between 100 and 160 micrograms/ml. Ajoene also inhibited yeast growth at concentrations below 20 micrograms/ml. The microbicidal effect of ajoene on growing cells was observed at slightly higher concentrations than the corresponding MICs. B. cereus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were killed at 30 micrograms of ajoene per ml after 24 h of cultivation when cultivation was started at 10(5) cells per ml. However, the minimal microbicidal concentrations for resting cells were at 10 to 100 times higher concentrations than the corresponding MICs. The disulfide bond in ajoene appears to be necessary for the antimicrobial activity of ajoene, since reduction by cysteine, which reacts with disulfide bonds, abolished its antimicrobial activity.
TI  - [A comparative study of ethylene oxide and ionizing radiation for sterilizing bone grafts].
AB  - To find a good way for sterilization and disinfection of bone grafts, we compared the sterilization capacity of gaseous ethylene oxide (EO) and cobalt-60 gamma radiation. The bone chips were contaminated with 10(7) bacteria per milliliter of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus subtilis globigii 8017 and Bacillus cereus 4001, then sterilized with various doses of gaseous EO or cobalt- 60 gamma radiation. The sterilization effect of EO was more stronger and faster than that of 60Co gamma radiation. The application of moderate doses of EO for sterilizing particulate bone grafts was recommended.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ramoplanin (a novel lipoglycopeptide), vancomycin, and teicoplanin against gram-positive clinical isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of ramoplanin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin against Gram-positive organisms isolated from cancer patients were determined. Ramoplanin was the most active agent tested inhibiting all isolates at a concentration of < or = 0.5 mg/L. Although all isolates were also susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin, their activities were surpassed by that of ramoplanin. The activity of teicoplanin was moderately better than that of vancomycin against Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and most streptococcal isolates, and was comparable to vancomycin for the remainder of the isolates tested.
TI  - Selective killing of human monocytes and cytokine release provoked by sphingomyelinase (beta-toxin) of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The best-known activity of Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C, alias beta-toxin, is as a hemolysin that provokes hot-cold lysis of erythrocytes which contain substantial amounts of sphingomyelin in the plasma membrane. Sheep erythrocytes are most susceptible, and we found that one hemolytic unit, representing the toxin concentration that elicits 50% hemolysis of 2.5 X 10(8) erythrocytes per ml, corresponds to 0.05 enzyme units or to approximately 0.25 microg of sphingomyelinase per ml. The cytotoxic action of beta-toxin on nucleated cells has not been described in any detail before, and the present investigation was undertaken to fill this information gap. We now identify beta-toxin as a remarkably potent monocytocidal agent. At a concentration of 0.001 U/ml, corresponding to approximately 5 ng/ml, beta-toxin killed over 50% of human monocytes (10(6) cells per ml) within 60 min. By contrast, 1 to 5 microg of beta-toxin per ml had no cytocidal effects on human granulocytes, fibroblasts, lymphocytes, or erythrocytes. A selective monocytocidal action was also observed with sphingomyelinase C from Bacillus cereus and a Streptomyces sp., whereas phospholipase A2 and phospholipase D at 100 U/ml were without effect. Monocytes succumbing to the action of beta-toxin processed and released interleukin-1beta, soluble interleukin-6 receptor, and soluble CD14 into the supernatant. Thus, monocyte killing by beta-toxin is associated with cytokine-related events that are important for the initiation and progression of infectious disease. These findings uncover a potentially important role for sphingomyelinase as a determinant of microbial pathogenicity.
TI  - Effect of high-power microwave on indicator bacteria for sterilization.
AB  - According to the superiority sterilization, a specially-designed microwave disinfector using high-power microwave energy was made. A series of sterilizing experiments have been made to determine the effect of microwave energy on several typical indicator bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis var. niger, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus pumilus E601, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus. Under the conditions of different sterilization duration and unequal intensity of microwave power irradiation onto the bacteria, a useful result of killing bacteria has been observed, i.e., the Bacillus subtilis can be considered as an optimum indicator bacterium for microwave sterilization.
TI  - The role of the nonconserved residues at position 167 of class A beta-lactamases  in susceptibility to mechanism-based inhibitors.
AB  - Differences in specificities between the class A beta-lactamases for both substrate and inhibitors are known. The role of the nonconserved amino acid residue at position 167 of the class A enzyme, which forms a cis bond with the catalytically essential Glu-166 residue, in both the hydrolysis of beta-lactam substrates and inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors, was investigated. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the penPC gene encoding the Bacillus cereus 569/H beta-lactamase I to replace thr-167 with the corresponding Staphylococcus aureus PC1 residue Ile. Kinetic data obtained from the purified Thr-167-Ile B. cereus 569/H beta-lactamase was compared to that obtained from the wild-type B. cereus and S. aureus enzymes and indicated that the replacement had little effect on the Michaelis parameters for the hydrolysis of S- and A-type penicillins. However, the Thr-167-Ile enzymes became more S. aureus PC1-like in its response to the mechanism-based inhibitors clavulanic acid and 6-beta-(trifluoromethane sulfonyl)amidopenicillanic acid sulfone. A model for the role of this nonconserved residue at position 167 in the mechanism of inactivation by mechanism-based inhibitors is proposed.
TI  - Microbiological quality & incidence of organisms of public health importance in food & water in Ludhiana.
AB  - Bacteriological analysis of 713 samples of various types of foods and related articles and potable water samples from different places in Ludhiana, Punjab was carried out. The highest counts ranging from 2.5 x 10(6)-7.5 x 10(8) organisms/g were observed in raw vegetables and fruits, followed by 3 x 10(6)-9.8 x 10(7)/ml, 8.3 x 10(4)-8.9 x 10(7)/g and 1 x 10(3)-6.7 x 10(7)/g in fruit juice, milk and its products, and salty/non milk snacks respectively. Fresh chapati, dal, rice, cooked vegetables and karhi etc., showed no microbial contamination. However, samples of these articles from road side cafes gave counts up to 1 x 10(7) organism/g. The most probable number of coliforms and Escherichia coli/100 ml of water ranged from < 1 to > 1100. Although 1332 isolates of 16 types of organisms of public health significance were obtained those of proven enteropathogenicity were enterotoxigenic Esch. coli (55), Esch. coli O157 (3), enteropathogenic Esch. coli (1), enterotoxigenic Klebsiella (23), Streptococcus faecalis (152), Bacillus cereus (133), Staphylococcus aureus (125), Aeromonas spp (47), Salmonella spp (10), Shigella spp (4) and Yersinia enterocolitica (2). Poor quality of potable water and widespread occurrence of enteropathogens in food consumed by the common man in Ludhiana was evident.
TI  - Food-borne disease outbreaks in Taiwan, 1994.
AB  - In 1994, 102 outbreaks of food-borne disease involving 4,726 cases were reported  to the Taiwan Department of Health. This is the highest number of outbreaks and cases in recent years in Taiwan. Of these outbreaks, 72.5% (74/102) were caused by bacterial pathogens, with Vibrio parahaemolyticus responsible for 56.7% (42/74), Staphylococcus aureus 20.3% (15/74), Bacillus cereus 14.9% (11/74) and Salmonella spp other than S. typhi and S. paratyphi 8.1% (6/74). V. parahaemolyticus has been a leading cause of problems in Taiwan for many years. Contamination of seafood with this organism has been reported frequently, particularly in the warmer months. In 1994, small outbreaks (fewer than 5 cases) and large outbreaks (more than 50 cases) represented 31.4% (32/102) and 12.7% (13/102), respectively, of the total. The median outbreak size was 10 cases. A high proportion (54%, 7/13) of the large outbreaks was associated with commercial lunch-boxes supplied to elementary and junior high schools. Health education to improve food sanitation and supervision of food sanitation practices need to be strengthened.
TI  - Beta-secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects on beta-lactamase catalysis.
AB  - Beta-Secondary and solvent deuterium kinetic isotope effects have been determined for the steady-state kinetic parameters V/K and V for turnover of a depsipeptide substrate, m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]-oxy]benzoic acid, and of a beta-lactam substrate, penicillanic acid, by three typical class A beta-lactamases and a class C beta-lactamase. The isotope effects on alkaline hydrolysis of these substrates have been used as a frame of reference. The effect of the transition state conformation of the substrates in determining the beta-secondary isotope effects has been explicitly considered. The inverse beta-secondary isotope effects on both V/K and V for the class A enzymes with both substrates indicate transition states where the carbonyl group of the scissile bond has become tetrahedral and therefore reflect typical acyl-transfer transition states. The solvent isotope effects indicate that enzyme deacylation (as reflected in V for the Staphylococcus aureus PC1 beta-lactamase) may be a classical general-base-catalyzed hydrolysis but that there is little proton motion in the enzyme acylation transition state (as revealed by V/K) for the TEM beta-lactamase and Bacillus cereus beta-lactamase I. These results provide kinetic support for the conjecture made on structural grounds that class A beta-lactamases employ an asymmetric double-displacement mechanism. The isotope effects on V/K for the class C beta-lactamase of Enterobacter cloacae P99 suggest an acyl-transfer transition state for the penicillin, although, as for the class A enzymes, without significant proton motion. On the other hand, the V/K transition state for depsipeptide does not seem to involve covalent chemistry. Suggestive of this conclusion are the measured beta-secondary isotope effect of 1,002 +/- 0.012 and the inverse solvent isotope effect. These results provide an example of a significant difference between the kinetics of turnover of a beta-lactam and a depsipeptide by a beta-lactamase. The V transition state for both substrates with the P99 beta-lactamase probably involves acyl-transfer (deacylation) where the conformation of the acyl-enzyme is closely restricted. The conformations of acyl-enzymes of the PC1 and P99 beta-lactamases correlate to the (different) dispositions of general base catalysts at their active sites.
TI  - Two investigational glycylcyclines, DMG-DMDOT and DMG-MINO. Antimicrobial activity studies against gram-positive species.
AB  - DMG-DMDOT (CL-331,002 OR CL-331,928) and DMG-MINO (CL-329,998 or CL-344,677) are  two new semisynthetic tetracyclines called glycylcyclines, with a broad spectrum of activity and includes Enterobacteriaceae, Gram-positive cocci, JK diphtheroids, and Bacillus cereus. Potent activity was demonstrated against all Streptococcus spp. strains [minimum inhibitory concentrations] (MIC90S) 0.06-0.25 micrograms/ml) and staphylococci (oxacillin susceptible ans resistant; MIC90S 0.12-2 micrograms/ml). Both glycylcyclines (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml) were more potent than minocycline (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml) against Enterococcus faecium, many of which were vancomycin resistant (116 strains). Organisms with minocycline MICs at > or = 8 micrograms/ml (Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and pneumococci) had glycylcycline MIC results ranging from 0.06 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (e.g., apparent use against existing tetracycline-resistance phenotypes). Drugs in this class appear promising for therapy of infections caused by Gram-positive species now testing resistant to contemporary antimicrobial agents, and further development of compounds in this class is encouraged.
TI  - Characteristics of Streptomyces strains isolated from soils in two landfill areas in north Jordan.
AB  - A total of 114 Streptomyces strains were isolated and purified from soils collected from Al Akider (53) and from Al Kafeer (61) landfill areas in north Jordan. The Al Akider strains were classified into 5 colour series gray (27), white (18), yellow (3), violet (3) and green (2); while the Al Kafeer strains were classified into 6 colour series white (26), gray (16), yellow (9), red (2), green (7) and blue (1). Melanin pigment was produced by 21 and 25% of the Al Akider and Al Kafeer strains, respectively, while soluble pigment was produced by 15% of the A; Akider and 21% of the Al Kafeer strains; 17% of Al Akider strains and 23% of Al Kafeer strains showed distinctive reverse side pigment. Forty, 32, 19, and 9% of the Al Akider strains had spiral, rectus, flexous and retinaculum apertum spore-chains, respectively, while the distribution of the Al Kafeer strains in the same spore-chain forms was equally 25% each. Arabinose, xylose, inositol, fructose, rhamnose, sucrose, raffinose, and mannitol were utilized by 91, 53, 89, 60, 30, 25 and 79% of the Al Akider strains and by 84, 59, 62, 64, 70, 75, 41 and 26% of the Al Kafeer strains, respectively, while only 2% of the Al Kafeer strains were found to utilize cellulose. Thirty-six percent of the Al Akider strains showed, in vitro activity against Staphylococcus aureus followed by Aspergillus niger (26%), Bacillus cereus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (25% each), Fusarium monilliforme (21%), Candida albicans (15%), Escherichia coli (8%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%), while 51, 49, 46, 34, 25, 15, 7 and 2% of the Al Kafeer strains exhibited activity against A. niger, S. cerevisiae, B. cereus, S. aureus, F. monilliforme, C. albicans, P. aeruginosa and E. coli, respectively.

TI  - Probes and polymerase chain reaction for detection of food-borne bacterial pathogens.
AB  - DNA-hybridization and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are techniques commonly used to detect pathogenic bacteria. In this paper, the use of these techniques for detection of Salmonella, E. coli, V. cholerae, non-O1 Vibrio, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, and C. botulinum is reviewed with emphasis on application in food microbiology. In food control, DNA-techniques have most often been used in a 'culture confirmation' fashion, i.e. bacteria are enriched and sometimes even purified by traditional culture procedures and thereafter identified by the use of DNA-based methods. The most desirable approach is, however, to detect organisms directly in the food, but major problems remain to be solved before this can be routinely performed.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Helichrysum aureonitens (Asteraceae).
AB  - The antibacterial activity of extracts from Helichrysum aureonitens was investigated. The dichloromethane extract was active against all five gram positive bacteria tested and the methanol extract was active only against Bacillus cereus, B. pumilus and Micrococcus kristinae, while the water extract had no activity against any of the organisms. None of the extracts inhibited the growth of the five gram negative bacteria tested.
TI  - Studies on microbial aerobic flora of skin in leprosy patients.
AB  - This study reports the isolation and identification of aerobic organisms from biopsies/slit-skin smears/scrapings from 129 leprosy patients and 50 healthy controls. These include 56 paucibacillary (PB) and 73 multibacillary (MB) cases. Thirty-six isolates from the specimens from 21 patients and 15 healthy controls were grown. The non-mycobacterial isolates from clinically PB leprosy (TT/BT/I) patients were: (1) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus aureus(1), Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Bacillus subtilis(1), Corynebacterium xerosis(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(1), Proteus mirabilis(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa(1). The isolates from clinically MB leprosy (BB/BL/LL) patients were: (a) Gram-positive cocci: Micrococci(1), Staphylococcus aureus(1) and Staphylococcus albus(1); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1); Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1). (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(2), Klebsiella pneumoniae(1) and Proteus mirabilis(2). The specimens from healthy controls yielded similar organisms. These were (a) Gram-positive cocci: Staphylococcus albus(2), Staphylococcus aureus(2) and Micrococci(2); (b) Gram-positive bacilli: Corynebacterium xerosis(1), Bacillus subtilis(2), Corynebacterium hofmanni(1) and Bacillus cereus(1); (c) Gram-negative bacilli: Escherichia coli(3), Proteus vulgaris(1) and Proteus mirabilis(1). While these results show no significant differences in the species types of non-mycobacterial aerobic organisms isolated from healthy skin and PB/MB types of leprosy, these isolates need to be characterized by immunological/molecular methods to find out subtypes if any.
TI  - An antibacterial vitamin E derivative from Tovomitopsis psychotriifolia.
AB  - The crude ethanol extract from the leaves of Tovomitopsis psychotriifolia (Clusiaceae) exhibits antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The biologically active agent in the extract has been isolated by chromatographic techniques and identified by NMR spectroscopy as trans-delta-tocotrienoloic acid.
TI  - Postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  - Studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. Flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. The rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees C, ranged from 0.1 ng/mL/min for Streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/mL/min for Clostridium perfringens. The rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. pH had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. These data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.
TI  - Synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive gene probe for the detection of C.perfringens alpha toxin.
AB  - The synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the Clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. A vector free digoxigenin-dUTP-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting the cloned plc gene of C.perfringens strain ATCC 13124. In a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of C.perfringens were tested for plc. None of the strains failed in hybridization. Presence of plc was even demonstrated in C.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. Specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. None different Clostridia sp. tested, e.g. C.bifermentans, C.tertium, C.novyi, C.chauvoei, C.sporogenes, C.difficile, C.putrifucum, C.sordellii, C.botulinum, C. septicum and C.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. Strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. Comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with DNA hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of C.perfringens plc.
TI  - An unusual outbreak of food poisoning.
AB  - On August 25 1990, over 400 people who attended a Thailand handicappeds' sport day at a provincial physical education college developed gastrointestinal symptoms after having dinner. An epidemiological team want to determine causes(s) and recommend how to prevent and control a food poisoning outbreak. The investigation included interviewing all 1,210 persons who attended the sport's day. In addition, an environmental survey, laboratory analysis of food samples, and rectal, ear, throat and nasal swabs from foodhandlers were also performed. A case was defined as a person who ate any items of dinner food and experienced vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. There were 485 cases out of 1,094 persons, an attack rate of 43%. Interviews were completed for 470 out of 485 cases. The three most common symptoms were nausea (93%), vomiting (88%), and abdominal pain (81.5). The mean incubation period was 3.20 hours. Three out of four items of food had a significant association with illness. Among these 3 items, eclairs had to the highest crude relative risk, 7.0 (95% CI = 4.8, 10.2). For statistical analysis, logistic regression by unconditional method was used, and found that only eclairs which were prepared during the night before the dinner and kept at room temperature for at least 12 hours before serving, remained statistically significant in the model (RR = 11.96; 95% CI = 9-22). Laboratory examination of foods and foodhandlers indicated heavy growth of Staphylococcus aureus producing toxins A and C and Bacillus cereus in eclairs. Culture of nasal swabs from healthy foodhandlers identified B. cereus and S. aureus of different phage types from those in eclairs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibacterial activity of 7-aminocholesterol, a new sterol.
AB  - A new sterol, 7-aminocholesterol, which inhibits growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, also displayed antibiotic activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The 50% growth inhibitory concentration against strains of Listeria innocua, L. monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus hirae and Bacillus cereus was 3 microM.
TI  - Transformation of microorganisms with the plasmid vector with the replicon from pAC1 from Acetobacter pasteurianus.
AB  - A number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria species was screened for the expression of the gram-negative plasmid pACK5 and pACT72 with replicon of pAC1 plasmid from Acetobacter pasteurianus. As was described previously, both plasmids were expressed in Escherichia coli, Acetobacter pasteurianus, Acetobacter aceti, Shigella spp. and Citrobacter spp. Expressions of plasmids were successful in twelve species tested, Comamonas terrigena, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus megatericum, Bacillus subtilis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Micrococcus luteus, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptoccocus feacalis, and the stability of plasmid DNA was tested after cultivation in non-selective conditions.
TI  - Rho-ADP-ribosylating exoenzyme from Bacillus cereus. Purification, characterization, and identification of the NAD-binding site.
AB  - The ADP-ribosyltransferase produced by a pathogenic strain of Bacillus cereus was purified to near homogeneity. The transferase is a 28,000 Da molecular mass enzyme with a pI of 10.3. The specific enzyme activity is 7.0 nmol of ADP-ribose min-1 mg-1 with a Km for NAD of 0.3 microM. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of the exoenzyme reveals no significant homology to Clostridium botulinum C3 nor to Clostridium limosum exoenzyme. The novel exoenzyme selectively modifies the small GTP-binding proteins of the Rho family presumably at the same acceptor amino acid (Asn-41) as determined for C3. Besides cellular Rho, recombinant RhoA and -B are substrates for the exoenzyme. However, recombinant Rac1 and CDC42, although belonging to the Rho family, are not modified. B. cereus exoenzyme was photolabeled with [carbonyl-14C]NAD resulting in inhibition of ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD-glycohydrolase activity. A glutamic acid residue was identified as part of the NAD-binding site which corresponds to Glu-174 of C3. This glutamic acid is located in a domain which shows high homology with the C-terminal part of C3 exoenzyme, C. limosum exoenzyme, and Staphylococcus aureus EDIN and which probably represents the catalytic site of the transferases. The data indicate that B. cereus exoenzyme is a novel member of the family of C3-like ADP-ribosyltransferases which share the same substrate protein Rho and which have an identical highly conserved catalytic domain.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of the leaf extract of moringa oleifera lam.
AB  - The ethnolic extract of the leaves of Moringa oleifera Lam. (Fam. Moringaceae) was tested for antimicrobial activities against Gram Positive - Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis Staphylococcus aureus, Sarcina lutea: Gram negative - Escherichia coli and Acid fast Mycobacterium phlei. Significant antimicrobial activity of the extract was found in this study.
TI  - Microbial counts and characteristics of Streptoverticillium strains isolated from soils in the Jordan valley.
AB  - A microbial survey of total bacterial count, agrobacteria, streptomycetes, and fungi was carried out in six locations in the Jordan Valley. The highest microbial counts for the four populations were in spring, the lowest mostly in autumn. No significant differences at p < 0.05 were observed either in the counts between the six locations, or in the seasonal counts of agrobacteria and streptomycetes between the six locations as well as within each location. The total bacterial counts (at p < 0.01) and fungi (at p < 0.05) differed significantly in the six locations. Microbial counts and the studied environmental conditions showed no significant regression. Of 552 streptomycetes strains isolated from soils collected from these locations, 58 belonged to the genus Streptoverticillium. They were distributed in five colour series grey (41%), red (31%), green (17%), blue (7%) and white (3%). Forty-eight strains had biverticillium spore bearing hyphae while only 10 had monoverticillium. While 28 strains produced distinctive reverse side pigment, only 8 and 6 strains produced soluble pigment and melanin pigment, respectively. Most strains utilized arabinose followed by fructose, mannitol, rhamnose, xylose, sucrose, inositol, and raffinose. Sixty-nine per cent of the strains exhibited activity in vitro test against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 45, 41, 28, and 7% against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Escherichia coli, respectively.

TI  - Isolation, and virulence profiles, of Aeromonas hydrophila implicated in an outbreak of food poisoning in Sweden.
AB  - A case of food poisoning outbreak involving Aeromonas hydrophila is reported in this study. A group of 27 people consumed a typical Swedish food "landgang" which is a type of smorgasbord containing shrimps with mayonnaise, liver pate, ham, sausage, and legume salad which was purchased from a food store. Twenty-two of the 27 persons became ill within 20-34 hr of consumption of the food and reported the symptoms ranging from severe acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache, fever and vomiting. One person also fainted. The symptoms lasted for a couple of days. Of the remaining 5 healthy persons who consumed the left-over food the next day, 2 became ill with similar symptoms. The bacteriological examination of left-over food samples resulted in the isolation of A. hydrophila from shrimps with mayonnaise, smoked sausage, liver pate and boiled ham. The total number of A. hydrophila in these foods were log 10(6) to log > 10(7) organisms per gram of food sample. A. hydrophila was however, not isolated from legume/mayonnaise salad samples. All the food samples tested showed low numbers of other expected food contaminating organisms such as coliforms at 37 C and 44 C, fecal streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, fungi and yeast etc., while Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Salmonella spp. were not detected in the food samples. Investigations of the virulence profiles of the A. hydrophila isolates showed their capacity to produce beta-hemolysin, cytotoxins, cytotonic toxins, enterotoxins, and adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal (Henle 407) cells in culture.

AB  - B. subtilis and B. cereus in concentrations under 10(5) mt, and of E. coli M-17 below 10(7) mt on different plaster materials die within fractures of a second after dynamic plasma processing at atmospheric pressure and at least one passing of the processed surface at a rate of 2.0 to 2.5 m/s at plasma flow power of 60 kw.
TI  - Kinetic and physical studies of beta-lactamase inhibition by a novel penem, BRL 42715.
AB  - The interactions of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus I, TEM, Klebsiella pneumoniae K1 and Enterobacter cloacae P99 beta-lactamases with the novel penem inhibitor BRL 42715 were investigated kinetically and, in some cases, by electrospray mass spectrometry (e.s.m.s.). All the beta-lactamases were rapidly inactivated by BRL 42715, with second-order rate constants ranging from 0.17 to 6.4 microM-1.s-1. The initial stoichiometry of beta-lactamase inhibition was essentially 1:1, with the exception of the K1 enzyme. In this instance about 20 molecules of BRL 42715 were hydrolysed before the enzyme was completely inhibited. Inhibited beta-lactamases did not readily regain activity in the absence of BRL 42715, the half-lives for regeneration of free enzyme ranging from 5 min for the K1 beta-lactamase to over 2 days for the staphylococcal enzyme. Recovery of activity was incomplete for TEM-1, K1 and P99 beta-lactamases, suggesting partitioning of the inhibited enzymes to give a permanently (or at least very stable) inactivated species. Examination of the interactions of the penem with TEM, B. cereus I and P99 beta-lactamases by e.s.m.s. also showed rapid and stoichiometric binding of the inhibitor. In all cases a mass increase of 264 Da over the native enzyme was observed, corresponding to the molecular mass of BRL 42715, showing that no fragmentation of the penem occurred on reaction with the beta-lactamases.
TI  - Inhibition of spoilage and food-borne pathogens by lactic acid bacteria isolated  from fermenting tef (Eragrostis tef) dough.
AB  - A study was carried out at the Department of Biology, Addis Abeba University, in  1991 to determine the inhibitory potential of fermenting tef and the lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermenting tef dough on Salmonella spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. The test bacteria grew in the fermenting tef uptill 30 hr or till the pH dropped to 4.7. Thereafter, growth was inhibited and decreases in population were apparent. The results showed that the spent media from all of the four lactic acid bacterial isolates, namely, Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp. and Streptococcus spp. inhibited the test bacteria. Acidity on its own was not responsible for the inhibition of the test bacteria. The spent medium from Streptococcus spp. showed the best inhibitory activity amongst the lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Anti-bacterial antibodies in Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed oligoclonal B-cell lines established from normal persons and autoimmune disease patients.
AB  - We have established 950 and 430 oligoclonal B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) from two normal persons and eight autoimmune disease patients, respectively by using Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-induced transformation. To re-evaluate the EBV technique for production of human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) related to infectious disease, we screened these oligoclonal LCLs for antibodies against 31 bacterial strains systematically. A total of 74 cultures out of 1380 were reactive to a total of 18 strains out of 31. Among these, eight cultures showed 10(-3) antibody (Ab) titers to Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotypes C, E, F and I, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens and Bacillus cereus. Ten cultures showed 10(-2) Ab titers to Ps. aeruginosa serotypes D, E, F and I, Ps. maltophilia, Staph. epidermidis, Klebsiella ozaenae, Ser. marcescens and B. subtilis. The results reveal the further possibilities for the EBV technique to produce various infectious disease-related human mAbs.
TI  - Platelet bacterial contamination and the use of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial ribosomal RNA gene probe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently, the maximum outdate for platelets is 5 days, because of the increasing chance of bacterial growth over time. Various methods for rapid detection of bacterial contamination of blood components have been described, with mixed results and no general acceptance. A recently described, molecular biologic approach for the detection of bacterial contamination involves a chemiluminescence-linked universal DNA bacterial probe to a highly conserved bacterial region of ribosomal RNA (rRNA). STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A multicenter trial of a chemiluminescence-linked universal bacterial rRNA probe for the detection of bacterial contamination in platelet concentrates is described. At each of five sites, platelet concentrates (no older than 1 day from date of phlebotomy) were inoculated in triplicate with isolates of four bacterial species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus) to a final concentration of 10 to 50 colony-forming units (CFUs) per mL and in triplicate to a final concentration of 1000 CFUs per mL. At one site, an additional 6 platelet concentrates were inoculated with sterile saline to serve as controls. Inoculated units were then subjected periodically to quantitative cultures and probe analyses. A total of 126 platelet concentrates were studied over a period of 7 days (120 inoculated with bacteria and 6 with sterile saline). RESULTS: This assay was, in some cases, able to detect S. aureus bacterial contamination in the range of 100 to 1000 CFUs per mL; the majority of samples (B. cereus, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis) with contamination exceeding 10(4) CFUs per mL; and all samples with contamination of 2.1 x 10(5) CFUs per mL or greater. Increasing the sample size from the recommended 0.4 mL to 1.0 mL resulted in an unacceptable loss of specificity (83.3%). CONCLUSION: The routine use of this assay would be expected to result in a decreased risk of septic platelet transfusion reactions and could lead to a lengthening of the current 5 day storage period for platelets. Further, the pooling of random-donor platelet concentrates before storage instead of immediately before transfusion may be possible if this rRNA probe is employed to detect bacteria in the pool.
TI  - Survival and growth of selected pathogens in fermented kocho (Ensete ventricosum).
AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the antagonistic potential of fermented kocho, aqueous extract of fermented kocho and spent media from lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from it on Salmonella sp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella sp, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. Fermented kocho (pH 4.3) inhibited growth of the test bacteria soon after their introduction into the food. The spent media from all of the four LAB, isolated from fermented kocho, namely Pediococcus sp, Leuconostoc sp, Lactobacillus sp and Streptococcus sp prevented the survival and growth of the test bacteria. The spent medium from Streptococcus sp showed the best antagonistic effect amongst all the LAB isolates. In all cases the inhibitory effects were independent of pH.
TI  - Osteomyelitis due to Bacillus cereus in an adolescent: case report and review.
AB  - Non-anthracis Bacillus species associated with clinical infections are usually dismissed as contaminants or nonpathogens. As opportunists, however, Bacillus organisms can cause significant systemic infections including bacteremia, endophthalmitis, and pneumonia. Osteomyelitis with non-anthracis Bacillus organisms has been described in adults, although to our knowledge it has been described only once in a child. We report a case of chronic osteomyelitis due to Staphylococcus aureus and superinfection with Bacillus cereus in a 13-year-old adolescent. A Bacillus isolate should be considered a true pathogen in children with chronic osteomyelitis who have a poor clinical response to antistaphylococcal therapy.
TI  - Modes of inhibition of foodborne non-Salmonella bacteria by selenite cystine selective broth.
AB  - Various cell densities of six common foodborne non-Salmonella bacteria were exposed to selenite cystine (SC) Salmonella selective medium. The insensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus vulgaris to SC was confirmed. Selenite cystine selective medium was effective against the sensitive bacteria up to certain cell densities, beyond which the bacteria survived. As judged from the minimum cell number required for survival in SC, Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive to SC, followed by Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli and Citrobacter freundii. When sensitive bacteria were grown in SC, they enriched resistant variants which exhibited no or reduced sensitivity to SC. The change in density of sensitive cells after exposure to SC suggested that bacterial sensitivity to SC depended on the efficiency of killing and growth inhibition by SC as well as the fraction of resistant variants in the bacterial population. Since Salmonella samples generally contain unknown numbers and types of sensitive bacteria, it is difficult to predict the effectiveness of their selective inhibition by SC.
TI  - Bacteriological analysis of uncooked pork sausages in relation to public health.
AB  - One hundred and eighteen samples of uncooked pork sausages were analysed bacteriologically. The total aerobic plate count ranged from 1.8 x 10(8) to 9.2 x 10(8) CFU/g in the samples. High mean counts of Staphylococci, Enterococci, Micrococci, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella and Coliforms were observed. Staphylococcus aureus were encountered with count range 2.8 x 10(6) CFU/g to 7.4 x 10(6) CFU/g. The viable count of Escherichia coli ranged from 2.0 x 10(5) to 4.3 x 10(5) CFU/g. Clostridium perfringens were detected in 66.9% of samples with a count ranging from 3.9 x 10(2) to 1.1 x 10(7) Cl. perfringens/g. None of 118 samples contained Yersinia enterocolitica.
TI  - Novel automated microbial screening of platelet concentrates.
AB  - The recovery of bacteria and the speed of detection of microbial growth in platelet concentrates (PC) were studied, comparing a novel automated blood culture system (BacT/Alert) with two traditional methods. Full-scale experiments were performed with a total of 33 units of PC (average content 320 x 10(9) platelets per unit) obtained from pooled buffy coats. Six strains known as possible PC contaminants were tested: S. epidermidis, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, E. aerogenes, and S. sanguis. Using an inoculum of 50-98 bacteria/ml, bacterial contamination was detected in all of 11 PCs on 132 sampling occasions. With a small inoculum (0.3-9 bacteria/ml), the bacterial contamination was detected in all PCs in which abundant growth appeared, but failed to be detected in some instances where the bacterial content was very small. All of 11 uninoculated PC controls were negative. With the automated method the time for detection of a culture-positive PC was 6-16 h, clearly shorter than with the two manual-visual systems. The new system provides a rapid, reliable, and labour-saving method for screening of bacterial contamination in PCs. This would increase safety particularly if the present 5-day shelf life were extended.
TI  - Evaluation of the safety of domestic food preparation in Malaysia.
AB  - Food-handling practices were studied in 119 and 158 households, respectively, in  an urban and a rural community in Peninsular Malaysia. Hazard analyses, including microbiological analysis of foods, were carried out in two households in each community and in a house that prepared food for distribution in the urban area. Kitchen hygiene was generally acceptable, although rated "poor" in some instances in the rural area. Food prepared for lunch was usually sufficient for dinner also, the leftover items being stored at ambient temperature until required. In the house that prepared food for distribution, breakfast was prepared during the evening, stored at ambient temperature overnight, and reheated before sale the next morning. There was a local preference for cooking food at temperatures close to boiling point; this reduced the numbers of vegetative cells but not those of spores. In some stored foods the populations of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus and mesophilic aerobic bacteria increased, the last-mentioned reaching spoilage levels. Reheating reduced the populations of proliferating bacteria in most foods to acceptable levels but would not have destroyed heat-resistant enterotoxins. Because of their importance in combating acute bacterial foodborne disease, the control of the temperature and time factors during the cooking and storage of food should receive special attention in education on health and food safety.
TI  - Cloning, expression, and mutagenesis of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus: a potential staphylococcal virulence factor.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus secretes a phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) which is able to hydrolyze the membrane lipid PI and membrane protein anchors containing glycosyl-PI. The gene for PI-PLC (plc) was cloned from S. aureus into Escherichia coli. Oligonucleotide probes based on partial protein sequence and polyclonal antibodies raised against the purified protein were used to identify positive clones. E. coli transformed with a plasmid containing the plc gene expressed PI-PLC enzyme activity which was abolished by mutagenesis with a tetracycline resistance gene. The plc gene was present in all 15 S. aureus strains examined but not in any of 6 coagulase-negative staphylococcal species. The plc gene contained 984 bp and coded for a mature protein with a calculated molecular mass of 34,107 Da. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that the staphylococcal plc gene was similar (51 to 56%) to the PI-PLCs from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus thuringiensis, and Listeria monocytogenes. The recombinant PI-PLC expressed in E. coli was purified and exhibited biochemical properties identical to those of the native PI-PLC from S. aureus. PI-PLC production was decreased in agr mutant strains of S. aureus. However, PI-PLC production by both agr+ and agr mutant strains exhibited a similar dependence on the type of medium used. These data suggested that PI-PLC production was regulated by both agr-dependent and agr-independent mechanisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of neutralized extracellular culture filtrates of lactic acid bacteria isolated from a cultured Indian milk product ('dahi').
AB  - Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate obtained from isolates of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbruecki ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus salivarius and Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis from 'dahi' showed weak to moderate inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Bacillus brevis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus laterosporus, Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa when tested by the diffusion agar well assay method. The effective minimum quantity of lactic culture filtrates required to obtain complete inhibition of an inoculum of 10(3) cfu/ml of the bacteria tested was between 20 and 26% (vol/vol), as determined by the agar incorporation method. Neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of these lactic cultures added at a level of 10% in sterile, 10% reconstituted non-fat dry milk was able to either suppress or retard growth of selected bacterial cultures when incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h. This study indicated the antimicrobial activity of dahi and the potential of using neutralized extracellular culture filtrate of lactic acid bacteria in the biopreservation of foods.
TI  - A prospective microbiologic surveillance program to detect and prevent the transfusion of bacterially contaminated platelets.
AB  - After two patients received bacterially contaminated platelet transfusions, a prospective surveillance program was instituted to perform Gram staining and microbiologic culturing of platelets at the time of transfusion. In 12 months, 3141 random-donor platelet pools (prepared from 14,481 units) and 2476 single-donor apheresis units were cultured. All single-donor apheresis units were sterile, but 6 (0.19%) of the random-donor pools were found to be bacterially contaminated, with 1 unit of 5 in the pool being the source in each case. Contaminants were Staphylococcus epidermidis (4 cases), Bacillus cereus (1), and Staphylococcus aureus (1) at counts of 0.5 x 10(2) to 10(11) colony-forming units per mL in platelet pools and 10(3) to 10(13) colony-forming units per mL in source units. The contamination rate for units transfused at < or = 4 days (1.8/10,000) was significantly lower than that at 5 days (11.9/10,000; p < 0.05), as was the magnitude of contamination (p < 0.05). Use of the pretransfusion Gram stain on 4- and 5-day-old platelet pools was 100 percent sensitive (4/4 true positives) and 99.93 percent specific (1 false positive) in detecting contaminated pools. These data define the extent and magnitude of platelet bacterial contamination and demonstrate the efficacy of the pretransfusion Gram stain on platelet units stored for 4 and 5 days in preventing the transfusion of heavily contaminated units. It is concluded that the risk of platelet contamination is related to the duration of component storage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  - Forty bacteriocin-producing (Bac+) lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. Of the 40 Bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). By direct plating, Bac+ LAB were detected at levels up to 2.4 x 10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. The Bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, SDS-PAGE protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; SDS-PAGE proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. Differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique Bac+ isolates. Bac+ LAB included Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus curvatus, Lb. delbrueckii, Lb. plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, and Pediococcus acidilactici. Lb. curvatus (four strains) and Lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including Listeria monocytogenes, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. Some Lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine Gram-positive genera. Lb. curvatus FS47 and FS65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees C; however, Lc. lactis FS56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. The high incidence of Bac+ LAB detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of Bac+ LAB that occur as natural contaminants. These data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
TI  - Enterotoxigenic bacteria in the sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  - Faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. Serum samples from the SIDS infants were also analysed for these toxins. A significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of SIDS babies than in samples from the comparative group. These toxins were also found in serum from the SIDS babies. Clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); C. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 SIDS cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); Staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 SIDS cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); C. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 SIDS cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and Bacillus cereus were not detected. Heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (HLML) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 SIDS faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 SIDS serum samples. C. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 SIDS faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%) of 87 SIDS serum samples. C. difficile toxin was detected in four SIDS faecal samples and two serum samples. C. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 SIDS faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. Staphylococcal enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 SIDS faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 SIDS serum samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Dicranin, an antimicrobial and 15-lipoxygenase inhibitor from the moss Dicranum scoparium.
AB  - Extracts of nine mosses, collected in Switzerland, were screened for antimicrobial, antioxidative, and 15-lipoxygenase (15-lpo) inhibitory activities. The CH2Cl2 extract of Dicranum scoparium was found to possess pronounced antimicrobial activity against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. In addition, inhibition of soybean 15-lpo occurred at very low concentration. Phytochemical investigation of this extract afforded Z,Z,Z-octadeca-6-yne-9,12,15-trienoic acid [1] by a combination of chromatographic techniques. This compound, named dicranin [1], was found to be responsible for most of the biological activity. The strongest antimicrobial effect was observed against Streptococcus faecalis (disc diffusion assay). In contrast to the CH2Cl2 extract of D. scoparium, dicranin was inactive against E. coli. Dicranin was identified by ir, ms, and nmr spectroscopy. A 2D INADEQUATE experiment confirmed the structure and yielded the assignment of all 13C-nmr signals.
TI  - The penetration of oral ciprofloxacin into the aqueous humor, vitreous, and subretinal fluid of humans.
AB  - We examined ciprofloxacin levels in the aqueous humor, vitreous, or subretinal fluid in 40 patients undergoing cataract extraction, vitrectomy, or scleral buckling. Ciprofloxacin, 750 mg, was administered orally an average of 17 1/2 and 5 1/2 hours preoperatively. We obtained mean ciprofloxacin levels of 0.53 microgram/ml in aqueous humor, 0.51 microgram/ml in vitreous, and 0.71 microgram/ml in subretinal fluid. These vitreous levels exceed the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)90 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Propionibacterium species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Haemophilus influenzae, as well as the MIC70 of S. aureus and Bacillus cereus. Therefore, ciprofloxacin may have a role in the management and prevention of endophthalmitis.
TI  - Effect of apigeninidin on the growth of selected bacteria.
AB  - Apigeninidin, a 3-deoxyanthocyanidin present in sorghum, was chemically synthesized and effectively purified by extracting impurities from aqueous 2 N HC1 into ethyl acetate. Apigeninidin (50mumol) applied to filter paper disks inhibited the growth on agar plates of selected gram-positive bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, andStreptococcus faecalis) and to a lesser extent gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Serratia marcens, andShigella flexneri). Apigeninidin was not mutagenic based on the Ames assay. The ability of apigeninidin to precipitate proteins from plant extracts could be physiologically important if it can be shown to bind to specific plant proteins.
TI  - Infection due to a contaminated thoracic drainage system.
AB  - Infection and colonization of the pleural space in three patients was traced to contaminated thoracic drain equipment. The organisms implicated were Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and various non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria. A careful examination of cleaning and decontamination procedures revealed delay in replacing the drainage bottle jar to be the main factor responsible for the contamination of the drainage unit and the pleural space. Recent technical adaptation of the drainage apparatus had removed the need for daily changing of this jar. These findings confirm that thoracic drainage systems may be a potential source of contamination for the patient. We emphasize that technical improvements to existing operating apparatus should necessitate the adaptation of recommendations governing their use in accordance with approved hospital hygiene standards.
TI  - Microbial flora of frozen tail meat from captive Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus).
AB  - Frozen tail meat samples from nine Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) were evaluated for microbial numbers and types. Microbial analyses yielded a mean aerobic plate count (APC, 30 degrees C) of 4.86 log cfu/g, a mean coliform count (TC, 37 degrees C) of 3.77 log cfu/g and a mean faecal coliform count (FC, 44 degrees C) of 3.40 log cfu/g. Salmonella was isolated from three samples, and beta-haemolytic streptococci from two samples. Yersinia, Aeromonas, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus were not isolated. Typical bacterial genera recovered included Flavobacterium, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter, Moraxella, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus and Streptococcus.
TI  - Effect of low-dose irradiation on growth of and toxin production by Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus in roast beef and gravy.
AB  - The effect of irradiation (2 kGy) on growth of and toxin production by Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus in roast beef and gravy during storage at abuse temperatures (15 and 22 degrees C) was assessed by inoculation studies. Irradiation resulted in a 3-4 log10 reduction in numbers of both pathogens. Whenever B. cereus and S. aureus numbers reached 10(6) and 10(7) cfu/g, respectively, during storage their toxins were detectable. As the time taken to attain these levels was longer in irradiated than in unirradiated samples, toxin production by both pathogens was delayed by irradiation. When samples initially containing low levels (10(2)/g) of S. aureus were irradiated no toxin was produced during subsequent storage at 15 or 22 degrees C. Diarrhoeal toxin produced by B. cereus was detected after 2 days at 22 degrees C, but not at 15 degrees C, in samples containing 10(2) cells/g prior to irradiation. When higher numbers (10(6)/g) of either pathogen were present prior to irradiation, toxins were produced by both pathogens at 22 degrees C, but not at 15 degrees C. Microbial competition had an effect on the growth of B. cereus and S. aureus after irradiation when a low initial inoculum was applied. However, when a higher inoculum was used the pathogens outnumbered their competitors and competition effects were less important. It was concluded that low-dose irradiation would improve the microbiological safety of roast beef and gravy.
TI  - Effect of three preservatives on the growth of Bacillus cereus, Vero cytotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, on plates with gradients of pH and sodium chloride concentration.
AB  - The effect of temperature, pH, sodium chloride concentration and a preservative (sodium benzoate, sodium nitrite or potassium sorbate) on the growth of three foodborne bacterial pathogens (Bacillus cereus, Vero cytotoxigenic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) was studied using gradient gel plates. Growth, expressed in optical density units, was recorded using image analysis techniques, and was expressed as three-dimensional grids. These gave a visual indication of the effects of any three of the environmental factors on bacterial proliferation. Sorbate was completely effective against E. coli at all temperature/pH/NaCl combinations, and was the most effective preservative tested against B. cereus. Increase in the acidity and/or the NaCl concentration improved the effect of all the preservatives, except nitrite when used against St. aureus. Nitrite was the least effective preservative, particularly against St. aureus. At < 25 degrees C, sorbate was more effective than benzoate against St. aureus when used with higher concentrations of NaCl. At 35 degrees C benzoate was the most effective preservative against St. aureus, especially when used at pH < 6.
TI  - Freeze-dried mixed cultures as reference samples in quantitative and qualitative  microbiological examinations of food.
AB  - Two simulated food samples in the form of mixtures of bacteria, freeze-dried in small glass vials, were tested for their suitability as reference materials in food microbiology. Stability and homogeneity of the samples were assessed during a 1 year period when stored at 2-6 degrees C. Samples were examined for aerobic plate counts, coliform counts, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, enterococci, yeasts and salmonellas. The samples were homogeneous but the number of colony forming units of some organisms declined during the time period studied. The maximum rate of decline (0.8 log units per year) was observed for the coliforms. Precision estimates (reproducibility and repeatability) for the different testing methods used are given. When compared with these data, the rate of decline was considered to be of less importance.
TI  - A study of purified pyocyanine produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa: properties and grouping.
AB  - A study of more than one thousand strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was performed. These were collected from different sources, i.e. humans, animals, environment and food. Cumulative results revealed the existence of three different groups of pyocyanine. The biological importance of grouping this pigment is due to its activity against other bacteria in comparison with other antibiotics such as cyanomycin produced by Streptomyces cyanoflavus. No such grouping or any other classification was found in the literature. Stability test and MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) measurements revealed the priority of group (I); also isolates of animal origin were found preferable. This may be due to the resistance of strains isolated from animals to antibiotics especially to carbenicillin and gentamycine. Observations indicate differences in optical properties of the blue pigment, i.e. absorption centres in the UV region. Some differences in their physical properties were also noted.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence and phylogeny of the tet(L) tetracycline resistance determinant encoded by plasmid pSTE1 from Staphylococcus hyicus.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance (tet) gene and its regulatory region, encoded by the plasmid pSTE1 from Staphylococcus hyicus, was determined. The tet gene was inducible by tetracycline and encoded a hydrophobic protein of 458 amino acids. Comparisons between the predicted amino acid sequences of the pSTE1-encoded Tet from S. hyicus and the previously sequenced Tet K variants from Staphylococcus aureus, Tet L variants from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, and Bacillus subtilis, Tet M variants from Streptococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus as well as Tet O from Streptococcus mutans were performed. An alignment of Tet amino acid sequences revealed the presence of 30 conserved amino acids among these Tet variants. On the basis of the alignment, a phylogenetic tree was constructed. It demonstrated large evolutionary distances between the Tet M and Tet O variants on one hand and the Tet K and Tet L variants on the other hand. The pSTE1-encoded Tet proved to be closely related to the Tet L proteins originally found on small Bacillus plasmids. The observed extensive similarities in the nucleotide sequences of the tet genes and in the deduced Tet amino acid sequences allowed the assignment of the pSTE1-encoded Tet to the Tet proteins of class L.
TI  - Critical micelle concentration and hemolytic activity--a correlation suggested by the marine sterol, halistanol trisulfate.
AB  - The marine natural product, halistanol trisulfate, has a relatively low critical  micelle concentration of 0.001% m/v (14.5 microM) and strong hemolytic potency with an EC50 of 0.00046% m/v (6.67 microM). As expected of a detergent, it inhibits the growth of gram-positive but not gram-negative bacteria. The hemolytic activity of halistanol trisulfate and other detergents has been shown to correlate with critical micelle concentration. This correlation may have important implications in the mechanism of membranolytic bioactivity.
TI  - [Microbial contamination of twenty drugs of plant origin].
AB  - Twenty drugs of plant origin were analysed in order to determine the microbial contamination level. A light homogenizing method was used to avoid an increase in the antimicrobial capacity of certain drugs, which would falsify the analytical results. The total viable aerobic count (TVC) varied from 10(1) to 10(7) CFU/g and in 11 samples out of 21 was equal to or higher than 10(5) CFU/g. The number of fungi varied from one drug to another, but was generally lower than the aerobic TVC to the power of 10. No cases containing Aspergillus flavus were found. The total viable anaerobic count consisted mainly of facultative anaerobic germs. Aerobic spores and facultative anaerobic bacteria were abundant. They often represented more than 50% of the aerobic TVC and among them, Bacillus cereus was found. Concerning specified micro-organisms, Escherichia coli was found 3 times, Staphylococcus aureus 2 times and Pseudomonas (not aeruginosa) a few times. Salmonella was never found. The Enterobacteriaceae, on the other hand, were often found and in some cases their number can be greater than 10(4) CFU/g. The typed bacteria corresponded to Enterobacter spp. Some drug samples in bags were analysed. The level of contamination was identical to that found in the bulk drugs. The analysis in parallel of a black tea sample showed an aerobic TVC of 4.10(3) CFU/g. Specified micro-organisms were not found in the infusions. In comparison with non-boiled drugs, the survivors can represent up to 30% of the aerobic TVC.
TI  - A surface antigen of Giardia lamblia with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor.
AB  - Since Giardia lamblia trophozoites are exposed to high concentrations of fatty acids in their human small intestinal milieu, we determined the pattern of incorporation of [3H]palmitic acid and myristic acid into G. lamblia proteins. The pattern of fatty acylation was unusually simple since greater than 90% of the Giardia protein biosynthetically labeled with either [3H]palmitate or myristate migrated at approximately 49 kDa (GP49) in reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis during both growth and differentiation. GP49, which partitions into the Triton X-114 detergent phase, is localized on the cell surface since it is 125I-surface-labeled. GP49 was also biosynthetically labeled with [14C]ethanolamine and [3H]myoinositol, suggesting that it has a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. Moreover, phospholipase A2 (PLA2) or mild alkaline treatment released free fatty acids, indicating a diacylglycerol moiety with ester linkages. Finally, a 3H- and 14C-labeled species was released by nitrous acid deamination from [14C]palmitate- and [3H]myoinositol-labeled GP49. The GPI anchor of GP49 is unusual, however, because purified GP49 was cleaved by Bacillus cereus phosphatidylinositol (PI)-specific PLC, but not by Staphylococcus aureus PI-PLC, or plasma PLD, and did not react with antibody against the variant surface glycoprotein cross-reactive determinant. Moreover, the double-labeled deaminated GP49 anchor migrated faster than authentic PI in TLC and produced [3H]glycerophosphoinositol after deacylation. In contrast to the variable cysteine-rich G. lamblia surface antigens described previously, GP49 was identified in Western blots of every isolate tested, as well as in subclones of a single isolate which differ in expression of a major cysteine-rich 85/66-kDa surface antigen, which does not appear to be GPI-anchored. These observations suggest that GP49, the first common surface antigen to be described in G. lamblia, may play an important role in the interaction of this parasite with its environment.
TI  - Amperometric monitoring of bacteria-induced milk acidity using a platinum disc microelectrode.
AB  - The acidity induced by the action of bacteria in milk samples was monitored amperometrically by using a platinum microelectrode. The measurements were performed directly on commercial packs of milk, stored at 32 degrees C, and were continued for 9-10 d after inoculation. The data were compared with those obtained by measuring the pH of the samples and the results are discussed on the basis of the metabolism of each bacterial species. The effects of the following bacteria were examined: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis, Aeromonas, and Corynebacterium.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - [Effects of sodium chloride on destruction of microorganisms by microwave heating in potatoes].
AB  - To assess the destructive effect of different sodium chloride concentrations (0,  0.3, 1.5, and 3%) on microorganisms with microwave heating, strains of Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus were used to inoculate a mashed potato preparation. After microwave heating for 1 min at 800 W, resulted in temperatures and rate of destruction of bacteria significantly higher (p less than 0.05) in the core than on the surface of mashed potato when no salt was added. Except for B. cereus, microorganisms inoculated into mashed potato, with no added salt, could be completely destroyed by 2 min of microwave heating. Core temperatures and rate of destruction of microorganisms in the mashed potato decreased significantly (p less than 0.05) with increase in concentration of added salt. The results also indicate that bacterial species differ in their susceptibility to microwave inactivation. In particular, S. aureus, which exhibited a level of survival that was greater than that of any other species tested here, seemed notably resistant to microwave treatment for 2 min while V. parahaemolyticus was highly susceptible.
TI  - Phosphonate monoester inhibitors of class A beta-lactamases.
AB  - Phosphonate monoesters with the general structure: [formula: see text] are inhibitors of representative class A and class C beta-lactamases. This result extends the range of this type of inhibitor to the class A enzymes. Compounds where X is an electron-withdrawing substituent are better inhibitors than the unsubstituted analogue (X = H), and enzyme inhibition is concerted with stoichiometric release of the substituted phenol. Slow turnover of the phosphonates also occurs. These observations support the proposition that the mechanism of action of these inhibitors involves phosphorylation of the beta-lactamase active site. The inhibitory ability of these phosphonates suggests that the beta-lactamase active site is very effective at stabilizing negatively charged transition states. One of the compounds described also inactivated the Streptomyces R61 D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium tyrobutyricum by bacteriocin-like substances produced by lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were selected for their inhibitory activity against Clostridium tyrobutyricum under conditions that eliminate the effects of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Four strains were isolated belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis. The sensitivity of the inhibitory substances to pronase and trypsine indicates that they are proteins or peptides different from nisin. Their resistance to phospholipase D indicates that they are also different from lactostrepcin. The inhibitory substances are produced during the exponential phase of growth. Their activity is bactericidal and directed toward some strains of Clostridium tyrobutyricum, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Streptococcus thermophilus, but strains used as dairy starters, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Propionibacterium shermanii, are not all affected by the inhibition.
TI  - Further observations on enhancement of the infectivity of Fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  - It had already been shown with a single virulent strain (A42) of Fusobacterium necrophorum that suspension of the fusobacteria in sub-lethal doses of broth cultures of other bacteria reduced the minimum infective dose (greater than 10(6) organisms) for mice by subcutaneous inoculation, sometimes to less than 10 organisms. The present study extended the known range of bacteria with strong infectivity-enhancing properties to include Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella oxytoca and Staphylococcus aureus; and those with weaker effect to include Bacillus subtilis, 'Bacteroides melaninogenicus', Clostridium sporogenes, Pasteurella haemolytica, and Proteus mirabilis. The study also showed that five further virulent strains of F. necrophorum closely resembled A42 in respect of striking susceptibility to infectivity enhancement by Escherichia coli. Actinomyces (Corynebacterium) pyogenes and S. aureus. One further strain (A6) of F. necrophorum resembled A42 in respect of strong infectivity enhancement by A. pyogenes, S. aureus, B. cereus and K. oxytoca but differed from it and the other five strains in being only slightly affected by E. coli. This work was a necessary prelude to the development of a method, based on infectivity enhancement, for the detection and isolation of F. necrophorum present in small numbers in heavily contaminated material such as faeces.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of Microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  - Microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Salmonella, and Yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. Gram-positive Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to Microgard. Kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and Penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas Aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% Microgard. Optimum activity of Microgard was at pH 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria present as well as the genus tested. Blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of Microgard against Pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Rapid methods for differentiating gram-positive from gram-negative aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Different tests based on lysis by KOH and on reaction with fluorogenic and chromogenic substrates, L-alanine-4-nitroanilide (LANA); L-alanine-4-methoxy- beta-naphthylamide (MNA); 4-alanine-2-amidoacridone (AAA); L-alanine-7-amido- 4-methylcoumarin (AAMC); 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulphonic acid (ANS) were compared for their suitability to distinguish Gram-positive from Gram-negative bacteria. A concentration of 100 micrograms/ml was chosen for incorporating LANA, AAA, AAMC and ANS into the growth medium, based on sensitivity tests. MNA did not show any detectable reaction over a concentration range from 50 to 200 micrograms/ml, and led to inhibition of all bacteria at 200 micrograms/ml. In the examination of a total of 146 bacterial strains, including Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, and B. subtilis the KOH test was not comparable with the Gram staining. A good correlation with Gram staining was found between LANA, AAA and AAMC added to plate count agar on one hand, and LANA and AAMC impregnated paper strips on the other hand, thereby utilizing the aminopeptidase activity. Agar containing ANS showed detectable fluorescence with all Gram-negative strains, but with Staphylococcus aureus and Staph. epidermidis a weak reaction was also observed. AAMC was selected for a rapid paper strip test. With this substrate a pronounced blue fluorescence was obtained with Gram-negative colonies.
TI  - The role of microorganisms in psoriasis.
AB  - The microflora of 297 psoriasis patients was extensively examined. Throat, urine, and skin surfaces from scalp, ears, chest, face, axillary, submammary, umbilical, upper back, inguinal crease, gluteal-fold, perirectal, vaginal, pubis, penis, scrotal, leg, hands, feet, finger, and toenail areas were cultured for aerobic bacteria, yeast, and dermatophytes. Antibody levels to streptococcal enzymes were performed (streptolysin-O, DNAse-B, hyaluronidase, STREPTOZYME). Giemsa smears and KOH preparations were also used to determine yeast and dermatophyte presence. Associated organisms thought to provoke a psoriatic attack were as follows: streptococcal groups A, B, C, D, F, G, S viridans, S pneumoniae; Klebsiella pneumoniae, oxytoca; Escherichia coli; Enterobacter cloacae, E aerogenes, E agglomerans; Proteus mirabilis, P vulgaris; Citrobacter freundii, C diversus; Morganella morganii; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P maltiphilia, P putida; Serratia marcescens; Acinetobacter calbio aceticus, A luoffi; Flavobacterium specie; CDC groups Ve-1, Ve-2, E-o2; Bacillus subtilis, cereus; Staphylococcus aureus; Candida albicans, C parapsilosis; Torulopsis, glabrata; Rhodotorula and dermatophytes. One or more antistreptococal enzyme tests was positive in 50% of patients. Titers to hepatitis E were elevated in one patient and to HIV in two patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY264826, a new glycopeptide antibiotic, against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with cancer.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY264826, a novel glycopeptide antibiotic produced by Amycolatopsis orientalis, was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and oxacillin against 311 gram-positive clinical isolates from patients with cancer, LY264826 had lower MICs for 90% of isolates (MIC90) than vancomycin for all species tested. It was active against oxacillin-resistant isolates including Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (MIC90, 2.0 micrograms/ml), Enterococcus spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), Bacillus cereus (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml). For S. aureus, including oxacillin-resistant isolates, the MICs of LY264826 were similar to those of teicoplanin. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, however, LY264826 had MICs that were 4- to 32-fold lower than those of teicoplanin. Against most streptococcal species the activities of LY264826 and teicoplanin were similar. Bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus spp. and most Streptococcus pyogenes isolates was less than or equal to 1 dilution of the MIC. One isolate of S. pyogenes and all Enterococcus faecalis strains tested were tolerant of LY264826, with MBCs greater than or equal to 32-fold greater than the MICs. The addition of 50% human serum resulted in a significant increase in activity only against Staphylococcus epidermidis. Variations in pH from 6.4 to 8.4 and in inoculum from 10(3) to 10(7) CFU/ml did not significantly affect the activity of LY264826.
TI  - Sodium hypophosphite inhibition of the growth of selected gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - Sodium hypophosphite (SHP) was evaluated for inhibition of growth of selected Gram-positive foodborne pathogenic bacteria in Trypticase Soy Broth. In addition, the effects of pH and sodium chloride (NaCl) alone and in combination with (SHP) were also examined. All inhibition studies were performed with optimal or nearly optimal growth conditions for each bacterium. Growth was monitored by determining culture optical density at 600 nm, and a time to significant growth determined for each test media. Ratios of time to significant growth for each control over that in test variables were used to evaluate the effect of SHP and other variables on growth. SHP was effective in inhibiting growth of Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium botulinum strains 62A 52A and Lamanna B, but generally ineffective against Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Results from this investigation show that SHP has potential as a food ingredient for the inhibition of certain Gram-positive foodborne pathogens.
TI  - Selection and application of antibodies modifying the function of beta-lactamase.
AB  - Nine monoclonal antibodies directed against class A beta-lactamases were detected and selected by a novel screening procedure based on assaying the modifications in the catalytic and stability properties of beta-lactamase in solution. Unlike conventional screening, e.g., ELISA or immunoprecipitation, the present method does not depend on firm binding and thus favors detection of low affinity antibodies. Individual antibodies were found to affect the enzymatic activity in various ways including stimulation, neutralization, protection and stabilization. Class A beta-lactamases show only 20% among members of this class. In contrast, two of our monoclonal antibodies cross-reacted with different beta-lactamases and thus demonstrate the presence of shared structural epitopes in this class of enzymes. One of the cross-reacting antibodies was elicited by sequential immunization with two different beta-lactamases. Taken together, our findings stress the importance of the screening method in antibody selection and illustrate the use of 'functional' monoclonal antibodies in the study of the structure-function relationship in an enzyme.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of a deuteroporphyrin-hemin mixture on gram-positive bacteria. A microbiological and spectroscopic study.
AB  - The combined antibacterial activity of various porphyrins with hemin on Gram-positive bacteria was studied. Protoporphyrin, hematoporphyrin derivative and deuteroporphyrin show only a marginal inhibitory effect in the dark. However, hemin has a strong cytotoxic effect which is independent of illumination and is equally strong in the dark. The disadvantage of hemin treatment is that it is temporary. In this study, we have demonstrated that a combination of deuteroporphyrin and hemin has a unique cytotoxic activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Bacillus cereus. The effect of the combined compound is stronger than that of the separate constituents, and is as strong in the dark as in the light. Only 0.005% of the initial S. aureus population survive after a 2 h treatment. Absorption and fluorescence spectra of hemin-deuteroporphyrin mixtures in water and liposomes suggest the formation of a species with spectroscopic properties which are different from those of the two constituents.
TI  - Molecular analysis of a sphingomyelinase C gene from Leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo.
AB  - A thermolabile hemolysin from Leptospira interrogans serovar hardjo, strain Sponselee, was shown to specifically degrade sphingomyelin. Nucleotide sequence determination revealed that sphingomyelinase activity was encoded by an open reading frame of 1,668 nucleotides. Although a putative signal sequence could be identified, no evidence for protein export in either L. interrogans or Escherichia coli was obtained. The apparent molecular mass of the expression product in E. coli minicells was 41.2 kilodaltons, whereas open reading frame 1 encoded a protein of 63,268 daltons. The observed difference may be explained by processing at the carboxy-terminal part of the hemolysin in E. coli. A high degree of similarity on the DNA and protein levels with Staphylococcus aureus beta-hemolysin and sphingomyelinase C from three Bacillus cereus strains was observed. The presence of various sphingomyelinase genes within the L. interrogans species is demonstrated.
TI  - [The effect of glutaraldehyde on mycobacteria and on selected types of bacteria].
AB  - The author tested the action of 2% alkalinized glutaraldehyde on Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. kansasii, M. avium, M. xenopi and M. fortuitum, as well as Staphyloccocus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, B. megatherium and B. subtilis. After 5-minute exposure devitalization of M. tuberculosis, M. kansasii and vegetative forms of the tested bacteria occurred. A sporicide effect was recorded already after 30 minutes or after more than 120 minutes. Most resistant were potentially pathogenic M. fortuitum, M. xenopi and M. avium where the disinfectant effect (a drop of CFU by 99.99%) was recorded after 7-63 minutes and their complete devitalization occurred after 3 (M. fortuitum) to 20 hours' (M. avium) action. The author recommends therefore exposure for 24 hours for sterilization of objects contamined with the above species of mycobacteria. This pertains in particular to instruments which cannot be sterilized by heat (endoscopes, bronchoscopes, sigmoidoscopes etc.), used in the diagnosis of mycobacterioses in patients with compromised immunity, e.g. in AIDS.
TI  - Bacterial aetiology of infantile diarrhoea in Papua New Guinea.
AB  - Bacterial examination of stools of children with diarrhoea was carried out at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, where little information is available concerning the causative bacteria of diarrhoea. Shigellae, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, and Aeromonas hydrophila were isolated with the decreasing frequency in that order. Among these, enterotoxigenic E. coli and C. jejuni were isolated for the first time in this country. Although Vibrio parahaemolyticus was recovered from sea water, no cases suffering from this organism were found.
TI  - Microbiological quality of ayib, a traditional Ethiopian cottage cheese.
AB  - One-hundred samples of ayib, a traditional Ethiopian cottage cheese, were purchased from Awassa market and analysed for their aerobic mesophilic counts, psychrotrophic counts, yeasts and molds, coliforms, spore-formers, enterococci, lactic acid bacteria. Listeria monocytogenes, staphylococci and Bacillus cereus. The majority of the samples showed counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, yeasts and enterococci of 10(8), 10(7) and 10(7) cfu/g. About 55% of the samples were positive for coliforms and faecal coliforms. Listeria spp. were not detected in any of the samples. B. cereus and S. aureus were isolated at varying frequencies but at low numbers (10(2)-10(3)). The pH value of the samples varied between 3.3 and 4.6 with about 40% having pH lower than 3.7.
TI  - Survival of pathogenic microorganisms in an egg-nog-like product containing 7% ethanol.
AB  - A liquor consisting of whole egg, saccharose (25% w/v) and ethanol (7.0% w/v) was artificially contaminated with Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus (three different strains), Bacillus cereus and Listeria monocytogenes. After 3 weeks of incubation at 22 degrees C the numbers of Salmonella, S. aureus and L. monocytogenes decreased more than 3 log10 units. Under such conditions, however, the total number of microorganisms increased 3 log10 units. At 4 degrees C the decrease of pathogenic microorganisms was much slower and a decrease of 3 log10 units was observed only after 7 weeks of incubation. Egg-nog, without ethanol, incubated at 22 degrees C allowed growth of Salmonella and S. aureus, while the numbers of B. cereus spores remained unchanged. Vegetative cells of B. cereus as well as L. monocytogenes decreased in numbers. However, after prolonged incubation the numbers of L. monocytogenes increased significantly.
TI  - ACP Broadsheet 124: May 1990. Examination of faeces for bacterial pathogens.
AB  
TI  - Synthesis of 3-aryl-2-substituted-4(3H)-quinazolines as potential antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Three new series of 4(3H)-quinazolinone derivatives were synthesized, namely: [3-Aryl-4(3H)-quinazolinon-2-yl]-methylenehydrazino-(N- substituted)-thiocarbamides, 3-Aryl-2-(3-substituted-4-phenyl-2,3-dihydrothiazol-2-ylidenehy drazonomethyl)-4 (3H)-quinazolinones and 3-Aryl-2-(3-substituted-4-oxothiazolidin-2-ylidenehydrazonometh yl)-4(3H)-quinazolinones. The antimicrobial activities of the synthesized compounds were also studied.
TI  - Beta-lactamases as fully efficient enzymes. Determination of all the rate constants in the acyl-enzyme mechanism.
AB  - The rate constants for both acylation and deacylation of beta-lactamase PC1 from  Staphylococcus aureus and the RTEM beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli were determined by the acid-quench method [Martin & Waley (1988) Biochem. J. 254, 923-925] with several good substrates, and, for a wider range of substrates, of beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus. The values of the acylation and deacylation rate constants for benzylpenicillin were approximately the same (i.e. differing by no more than 2-fold) for each enzyme. The variation of kcat./Km for benzylpenicillin with the viscosity of the medium was used to obtain values for all four rate constants in the acyl-enzyme mechanism for all three enzymes. The reaction is partly diffusion-controlled, and the rate constant for the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex has approximately the same value as the rate constants for acylation and deacylation. Thus all three first-order rate constants have comparable values. Here there is no single rate-determining step for beta-lactamase action. This is taken to be a sign of a fully efficient enzyme.
TI  - Analytical methods for Bacillus cereus and other Bacillus species.
AB  - Bacillus cereus can give rise to two distinct forms of foodborne disease, the emetic and the diarrhoeal syndromes. The emetic syndrome is believed to be associated with an emetic toxin pre-formed in food. Cooked rice is the most common vehicle, and the symptoms are similar to those of Staphylococcus aureus intoxication. The diarrhoeal type is caused by an enterotoxin and the symptoms generally parallel those of the Clostridium perfringens food poisoning. The heat resistance of B. cereus spores and the non-fastidious nature of the organism facilitates its survival and/or growth in a wide variety of foods. This review describes analytical methods available for the isolation, identification, and enumeration of the organism, in addition to details about biological and immunological methods for toxin assay. Data are also presented concerning the incidence and epidemiology of B. cereus food poisoning around the world, and especially in Japan.
TI  - Preincubation time and the use of oxygen indicators in determining the microbiological quality of aseptically packed pea and tomato soup.
AB  - In order to get accurate information about the preincubation time needed for viscous aseptic products, the growth characteristics of three food poisoning organisms Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus in pea soup, and one spoilage organism, Lactobacillus plantarum, in tomato soup, were followed during a preincubation period at 30 degrees C for 14 days. The sterile food packs were sealed into polyamidepolyethylene laminate bags containing different headspace gas concentrations (21% oxygen + 80% nitrogen, 5% oxygen + 95% nitrogen and 100% nitrogen). Bacterial growth was followed every second day by counting the number of colony forming units and following the headspace oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations. The bacterial strains differed in their growth characteristics, especially in their ability to consume oxygen from the headspace, and also in their ability to produce carbon dioxide. The headspace oxygen concentration was also followed by oxygen indicators in order to determine the correlation with the oxygen concentration of the headspace and the growth of bacteria. The bacterial growth followed more closely the concentration of carbon dioxide than the concentration of oxygen. It was concluded that further studies are needed to determine the preincubation period for viscous aseptic products in order to furnish accurate data on the growth characteristics of low numbers of bacteria in aseptic foods at different headspace gas compositions.
TI  - Survival and growth of food poisoning bacteria following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties.
AB  - Following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties with and without sorbic acid, obtained directly from the manufacturer, strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and other E. coli survived but failed to multiply during storage at 7, 10 or 25 degrees C. In the absence of sorbic acid spoilage due to Pseudomonas fluorescens occurred after storage for 5-13 days at 7 or 10 degrees C and 1-2 days at 25 degrees C. Salmonella enteritidis, S. hadar, S. saint-paul, S. typhimurium and S. virchow survived but failed to multiply at 10 degrees C and, in the case of most strains, at 20 or 25 degrees C. S. typhimurium multiplied 100-fold in one batch of cottage cheese with peppers and onion in the absence of sorbic acid during storage at 25 degrees C for 2 days; spoilage of this batch occurred due to yeasts or yeasts and moulds after storage for 4-8 days at 10 degrees C and 0-2 days at 20 or 25 degrees C. Following inoculation into cottage cheese varieties, prepared in the laboratory and which did not contain sorbic acid, as contaminants of the added protein or vegetable ingredients the numbers of Staphylococcus aureus declined during storage at 10 and 20 degrees C, the numbers of Bacillus cereus and S. typhimurium increased at both temperatures, and the numbers of Yersinia enterocolitica increased at 10 degrees C, but declined at 20 degrees C. Spoilage occurred due to the growth of moulds and P. fluorescens after storage for 5-14 days at 10 degrees C, and due to P. fluorescens after storage for up to 2 days at 20 degrees C. In products inoculated in a similar way but which contained sorbic acid (500-530 mg/kg), the numbers of S. aureus and B. cereus declined and in most products the numbers of S. typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica remained constant. In cottage cheese with chicken, however, the numbers of Y. enterocolitica increased 100-fold during storage of the product for 14 days at 10 degrees and the numbers of S. typhimurium increased 100-fold during storage for 2 days at 20 degrees C. Spoilage of this product due to P. fluorescens occurred after storage for 8-14 days at 10 degrees C, but was not evident at 20 degrees C after 2 days.
TI  - Kinetics of bacterial growth in simple intravenous solutions and admixtures.
AB  - The growth of bacteria in intravenous solutions and admixtures has been studied under stationary conditions of incubation. All the solutions were inoculated with 100 organisms/ml, incubated at room temperature (27 degrees C) or (37 degrees C), with samples withdrawn at specified time intervals, and plated in quadruplicates. The simple intravenous (i.v.) solutions did not support significant growth (P greater than 0.05) of any of the micro-organisms. Growth in i.v. solutions containing 1% blood was very significant (P greater than 0.05), as demonstrated by the high apparent growth rate constants (K). The ratio of K for beta-lactamase producing bacteria (beta-lac+) over that for non-beta-lactamase producing bacteria (beta-lac-) was significant (P less than 0.05) at 37 degrees C compared to that at 27 degrees C. The higher K values for B. cereus in benzylpenicillin and cefuroxime solutions, respectively, compared to those in antibiotic-free solutions, may be attributable to hydrolysis of the drugs, while the low K values for B. subtilis in the same solutions may be attributed to the inhibitory effects of the drugs. In conclusion, minute quantities of blood in i.v. solution tend to cause bacteria to multiply rapidly. The presence of beta-lactamase producing species might, in addition, hydrolyse susceptible beta-lactam antibiotics which are common additives to i.v. fluids.
TI  - Detection of bacterial cell wall hydrolases after denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - Cell walls from various Gram-positive bacteria were incorporated at a concentration of 0.2% (w/v) into polyacrylamide gels as a substrate for detection of cell wall hydrolases. Bacterial extracts from crude cell wall preparations were denatured with sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in gels containing bacterial cell walls. After renaturation in the presence of purified and buffered 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, cell wall hydrolases were visualized as clear lytic zones against the opaque cell wall background. One to fifteen bands with lytic activity could be detected, depending on bacterial extracts and on the nature of the cell walls incorporated into gels. Crude cell wall extracts were the best source of cell wall hydrolases from various Gram-positive bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens (15 bands), Micrococcus luteus (1 band), Bacillus megaterium (4 bands), Bacillus sp. (6 bands), B. cereus (3 bands), B. subtilis (7 bands), Staphylococcus aureus (13 bands), Streptococcus faecalis (3 bands), and Strep. pyogenes (5 bands). Molecular masses of cell wall hydrolases ranged from 17 to 114.6 kDa. Lytic activities against cell walls of Corynebacterium sepedonicum (Clavibacter michiganense pv. sepedonicum) could be shown with the cell wall extracts of Strep. pyogenes (45.7 kDa), Strep. faecalis (67 kDa), B. megaterium (67 kDa), and Staph. aureus (67 kDa).
TI  - [Antibacterial spectrum of lisosubtilin G10X].
AB  - Data on the antibacterial spectrum of lysosubtilin G10X, a preparation of lytic enzymes from Bacillus subtilis SK-52 are presented. Lysosubtilin was active against grampositive and gramnegative pathogenic bacteria. When it was used as a substrate of live lyophilized microbial cells the highest lysis levels were observed in B. brevis, B. cereus, B. pumilis, B. subtilis and S. faecalis. Preincubation of the substrate in acid media mainly increased the levels of the lysis by enzyme preparation. Sometimes the increase was very high (B. sphaericus, B. subtilis 720, E. coli K12 and MRE-600). Such a preincubation provided cell lysis in some strains not liable to the effect of lysosubtilin (B. cereus 1312, C. renale, M. luteus, S. aureus KP, 800, 805 and 126001, S. pyogenes 291). An increase in the lysosubtilin concentration in the reaction mixture in the majority of the cases did not provide favourable results. However, some strains resistant to the preparation at a concentration of 1000 units/ml were lysed with its 10 times higher doses. An increase in the lysis level was also achieved with increasing the time of the incubation with the enzyme preparation. Proceeding from the preparation antibacterial spectrum it is possible to recommend it for treatment of diseases in agricultural animals. Its use in veterinary was a success.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the glucose oxidase-glucose system on food-poisoning organisms.
AB  - The antibacterial effect of the glucose oxidase-glucose system was studied on food-poisoning organisms including Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella infantis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica using automated turbidometry. The bacteria were grown in sterile-filtered meat medium which was either raw or heat-denaturated. The results showed a clear growth inhibition with combinations of 0.5-1.0 mg/ml glucose and 0.5-1.0 IU/ml glucose oxidase. The growth inhibition was more effective in the heat-denaturated meat medium. The most resistant pathogens were Campylobacter jejuni and Listeria monocytogenes, however growth inhibition was still evident. The possible application of the glucose oxidase-glucose system in food products inhibiting the growth of pathogens and spoilage organisms is discussed.
TI  - Microbiological quality and public health significance of ice-cream.
AB  - Fifty samples of ice-cream were subjected to microbiological examination. Of these 72% had total viable count over 10(6)/g while 66% had coliform count between 10(2)-10(3)/g. The micro-organisms isolated were Escherichia coli (46%), Enterobacter aerogenes (34%), Staphylococcus aureus (26%), proteus species (16%), Streptococcus faecalis (12%), Citrobacter species (10%) and Bacillus cereus (4%). The results showed that commercially prepared ice-cream sold in the market was not satisfactory for human consumption and preventive measures should be enforced for the supply of satisfactory products.
TI  - A microbiological assay for sterigmatocystin, T-2 toxin and zearalenone.
AB  - A survey was done to find microorganisms useful for assaying sterigmatocystin; T-2 toxin and zearalenone.Staphylococcus aureus was found to be sensitive to T-2 toxin and zearalenone;Bacillus cereus was found to be sensitive to T-2 toxin only; andEscherichia coli was sensitive to sterigmatocystin. The response of the organisms to sterigmatocystin; T-2 toxin and zearalenone was found to be linear between 4 and 100 mug with sterigmatocystin toE. coli; between 2 and 25 mug with T-2 toxin toStaph, aureus andB. cereus; and between 4 and 100 mug with zearalenone toStaph, aureus. The lower limits of sensitivity of the test were 2 mug T-2 toxin and zearalenone, and 4 mug sterigmatocystin. The assay is rapid (15-17 hrs); simple and inexpensive; and can be used to verify the toxicity of samples and to confirm thin layer chromatographic results.
TI  - Screening of isoquinoline alkaloids and their derivatives for antibacterial and antifungal activities.
AB  - A screening test of antimicrobial activities for some of the isoquinoline alkaloids and their first and second Hofmann elimination products was conducted in this study. Results showed that (+)-actinodaphnine (1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), (-)-xylopine (19) and (-)-N-Me-xylopine MeI (20), had the strongest inhibitory activities against three G(+) bacteria (Bacillus cereus, Micrococcus sp. and Staphylococcus aureus) MIC greater than or equal to 50 micrograms/ml). Whereas anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), dicentrine methine (23), roemerine methine (26), dicentrine bismethine (29) and O-Me-armepavine methine (48) also had antibacterial effects against these same three G(+) bacteria (MIC = 50-300 micrograms/ml). However, only (+)-actinodaphnine (1) and roemerine methine (26) showed weak effects against two G(-) bacteria (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumonia) (MIC = 300 micrograms/ml). (+)-Actinodaphnine(1), (+)-N-Me-actinodaphnine (2), (+)-anonaine (17), anhydroushinsunine (34), anhydroushinsunine MeI (35), ushinsunine isomethine (38), O-Me-armepavine methine (48) and O,O-di-Et-N-Me-coclaurine methine (49) had potent antifungal activities against Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans and other Candida species (MIC = 62.5-1000 micrograms/ml).
TI  - Survival of beta-lactamase-producing and -nonproducing bacteria in intravenous solutions.
AB  - The survival of beta-lactamase-producing (beta-lac+) and non-beta-lactamase-producing (beta-lac-) Bacillus and Staphylococcus spp. has been investigated in dextrose 5% injection, NaCl 0.9%, and dextrose 5% in NaCl 0.9% solutions. Tests were performed under static and turbulent conditions of incubation, with and without antibiotics added to the fluids, and with or without 1% citrated blood. All solutions were inoculated with about 1000 organisms/mL, and sampled for viable bacteria at specific time intervals. Under static conditions, there was no significant decrease in viability (p greater than 0.01) of the bacilli, except for the staphylococci (p less than 0.01). However, when cultures were agitated, all species showed significant decline in viability (p less than 0.01). When antibiotics were present, S. aureus (beta-lac+) declined gradually throughout 24 hours (p greater than 0.01). B. cereus (beta-lac+) concentrations were static in all solutions. All organisms multiplied rapidly in solutions containing blood. The results suggest that the growth characteristics of both beta-lac+ and beta-lac- bacteria in intravenous fluids are essentially similar, except in solutions containing beta-lactamase-sensitive antibiotics in which beta-lac+ bacteria tend to survive.
TI  - The migration of bacteria through gels in the presence of IUCD monofilament tails.
AB  - An in vitro model was developed to investigate the migration of a variety of bacteria of different characteristics through a gel system in the presence or absence of a wide range of polymer monofilament threads. The bacteria were unable to migrate through the gel from the point of inoculation in the absence of a solid substrate. Migration occurred along all thread types tested, including those used as IUCD marker tails and the extent of bacterial migration appeared to be determined primarily by the motility of the microorganisms. The implications of these findings in relation to the development of pelvic infections in IUCD wearers is discussed.
TI  - Isolation of a Staphylococcus aureus beta-lactamase-dicloxacillin complex and kinetic studies on the reactivation of the enzyme.
AB  - Exposure of the beta-lactamase from Staphylococcus aureus to the slowly reacting  substrates cloxacillin or dicloxacillin results in time-dependent inactivation of the enzyme. Methods for the rapid separation of a beta-lactamase-dicloxacillin complex from excess inhibitor, using centrifuged columns of Sephadex G-25 or DEAE-Sephadex G-25, are described. The enzyme-dicloxacillin complex releases active enzyme, with specific activity identical to that of untreated enzyme, after storage at pH 7.5 at 15 degrees C. Full reactivation was accompanied by the release of 0.8 eq of hydrolyzed dicloxacillin. The complex is stable for up to 40 h when stored at pH 3 at 4 degrees C. The reactivation process, which occurs with first-order kinetics at 15 degrees C and pH values between 4 and 8, displays a pH dependence with apparent pKa's of 4.6 and 8.5, and a limiting value of the reactivation rate constant of 0.022 min-1. Deviation from first-order kinetics at pH 9 is consistent with a competing irreversible inactivation of the enzyme at that pH. This behavior differs substantially from that of the similarly inactivated beta-lactamase I from Bacillus cereus, whose rate of reactivation is independent of pH, but which undergoes irreversible denaturation at acidic pH [A. L. Fink, K. M. Behner, and A. K. Tan (1987) Biochemistry 26, 4248-4258]. Addition of hydroxylamine to the S. aureus beta-lactamase-dicloxacillin, complex stimulates the rate of reactivation by a maximum of 35%. This effect is hyperbolically dependent on the concentration of hydroxylamine with half-maximal stimulation at 2.8 mM. The Km for ampicillin hydrolysis catalyzed by the partially reactivated enzyme is identical to that measured for catalysis by the untreated enzyme. We discuss our observations in relation to models for the transient inhibition process.
TI  - Experimental observations on the bacteriological controls of antibiotics--II. Inactivation of the antimicrobial activity of membranes employed for the filtration of antibiotics.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of kaurenoic acid derivatives substituted on carbon-15.
AB  - The antibacterial and antifungic activities of two kaurenic acids, ent kaurenoic  acid and cinnamoylgrandifloric acid isolated from a hexane extract of aerial parts of Mikania laevigata, were investigated and compared with the activities of other kaurenic acid derivatives substituted on carbon-15. Only acetylgrandifloric acid (ent-kaur-16-en-15 alpha-acetyloxy-19-oic) and its epimer xylopic acid (ent-kaur-16-en-15 beta-acetyloxy-19-oic) displayed significant antibacterial activity at concentrations greater than or equal to 250 micrograms/ml, the 15 alpha epimer being the most active.
TI  - Critical control points for foods prepared in households whose members had either alleged typhoid fever or diarrhea.
AB  - Hazard analysis of food preparation practices were conducted in four households and eleven others were visited to survey both food preparation practices and environmental conditions. Households selected had members who were suffering from either diarrhea of unknown etiology or alleged typhoid fever. Hazard analyses and sanitary surveys included gathering data on time-temperature exposures of foods, collecting samples of food and drinking water, sampling sewage or drains, and obtaining stool specimens from persons with diarrhea and from family controls. Food samples were tested for aerobic mesophilic colony counts and common foodborne pathogens; specimens were tested for Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter and Yersinia. Campylobacter was isolated from two persons purported to have diarrhea, but neither Salmonella, Shigella nor Yersinia were recovered from alleged cases or controls. Salmonella agona was recovered from a latrine. Most foods were cooked to internal temperatures to or near to boiling. Those not promptly eaten were held at ambient room or outside temperatures until a subsequent meal, until a family member returned home, or until lunch time when taken to the fields. During these intervals, microorganisms multiplied and mesophilic aerobic organisms increased often reaching 10(8)/g or greater before consumption. None of these foods were reheated before eating. Bacillus cereus was isolated from 4 of 10 samples; one sample of 'moro' (beans and rice) exceeded 10(6)/g, two other samples exceeded 10(3)/g. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from 7 of 14 samples, one exceeded 10(5)/g. Fecal coliforms were isolated from 8 of 14 food samples, five exceeded 10(5)/g. Neither Salmonella nor Shigella were isolated from any food, the community water supplies or from vessels of water within houses. Fecal coliform counts of water were less than 3/ml, except one sample from a clay vessel (9/ml). Risks associated with cooked foods which were not promptly eaten appeared to be greater than that associated with water.

TI  - Synthesis of some 5-azo(4'-substituted benzene-sulphamoyl)-8-hydroxyquinolines with antidotal and antibacterial activities.
AB  - 5-Azo(4'-substituted benzenesulphamoyl)-8-hydroxyquinolines(III) have been prepared by coupling of the appropriate p-substituted benzenesulphamoyldiazonium acetates with 8-hydroxyquinoline. The corresponding copper chelates(IV) and iron chelates(V) were also prepared in a 1:2 metal to ligand ratio. Structures of III, IV and V were confirmed by some representative UV, IR, and NMR spectrometry in addition to microanalysis. Antidotal activity of four ligands (IIIa, IIId, IIIf, and IIIi) has been evaluated in mice against the toxicity of lead acetate and copper sulphate. Study revealed that compound IIIf elicited significant antidotal activity against lead and copper poisoning, while IIIi was potent only against lead poisoning. Antibacterial activity of compounds III, IV, and V was also determined in comparison to sulphanilamide against Staph. aureus, Bacill. cereus, and Esch. coli. The test compounds showed variable bacteriostatic activities, and some of them (IIIc, IIId, IIIf, Ve, IIIg, and Vi) are more effective than the reference drug, especially against Bacill. cereus.
TI  - Endovesiculation of human erythrocytes exposed to sphingomyelinase C: a possible  explanation for the enzyme-resistant pool of sphingomyelin.
AB  - When human erythrocytes are treated with Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C at 37 degrees C they become susceptible to cold lysis and appear to endovesiculate. Endovesiculation has been confirmed by showing that in parallel with sphingomyelin breakdown, the cells accumulate [3H]inulin or [14C]sucrose (without losing intracellular K+) and also experience a loss of cell-surface acetylcholinesterase activity into a latent intracellular pool which can be revealed by treatment with detergent. On the basis of these observations it can be calculated that endovesicles account for about 2-4% of cell volume and about 25% of total cell surface. Pretreatment of cells with bee venom phospholipase A2 completely blocked sphingomyelinase-induced endovesiculation but this effect was related to a concomitant decrease in sphingomyelin breakdown which was reduced by about 90%. These results indicate that the pool of sphingomyelin which is not susceptible to attack by sphingomyelinase C (about 15% of total sphingomyelin) may be resistant because of membrane internalisation and not because it originally resides in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.
TI  - Microbial spoilage of pre-cooked potato-topped pies.
AB  - The ecological succession of bacteria which developed in pre-cooked potato-topped pies stored at two different temperatures was examined. Bacillus, Streptococcus and Staphylococcus-Micrococcus spp. were the predominant organisms isolated from freshly prepared pies and those stored at 4 degrees and 37 degrees C. None of these groups of bacteria caused significant biodeterioration of pies held at 4 degrees C, but all groups grew well in pies stored at 37 degrees C and achieved counts of ca 10(8)/g of sample. Bacillus spp. were the first group to grow, followed by Streptococcus and Staphylococcus-Micrococcus spp. Growth which occurred at 37 degrees C did so at the expense of glucose, lactate accumulated and the pH of pie components decreased. Amylase activity detected in all pie components during storage was associated with the growth of Bacillus spp. and probably supplemented glucose already present in pies, by hydrolytic cleavage of potato, flour or binder starches. Spoilage caused by growth and activity of the bacteria isolated was not associated with visual signs of biodeterioration, nor production of 'off' odour usually associated with spoilage of meats. These results suggest that pre-cooked potato-topped pies held at inappropriate temperatures represent a potential public health risk.
TI  - Release of proteins from the surface of bovine central nervous system myelin by salts and phospholipases.
AB  - Incubation of bovine CNS myelin with phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus under conditions that lead to extensive phospholipid degradation caused 10% of the myelin protein to be released from the membrane. The myelin basic protein (MBP) was a major component of the dissolved protein. Comparable incubations with phospholipase C from Clostridium perfringens, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus, or cabbage phospholipase D removed little MBP. However, concentrations of sodium chloride near 1 M and concentrations of divalent metal ions between 50 and 600 mM released typically 9-12% of the total myelin protein, with MBP again as the predominant component. Repetitive washing with calcium chloride solutions resulted in dissolution of over 90% of the MBP. When myelin was incubated in 1.0 M sodium chloride or 25 mM calcium chloride, the MBP was cleaved largely into two major peptides with apparent molecular weights near 14,000 and 12,000, but with 200 mM or higher concentrations of calcium chloride most of this protein remained intact. With appropriate manipulation of the ionic milieu, it is thus possible to remove most of this extrinsic protein from the myelin surface under relatively mild conditions. The conditions that release the protein suggest that it is held at the membrane surface by ionic interactions.
TI  - Egg yolk paste for determining some food poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Egg yolk, aseptically prepared from fresh eggs, was partially dehydrated with a 40% high fructose corn syrup solution, and 10% salt was added. This salted yolk paste was added to mannitol salt agar for the detection of Staphylococcus aureus, to NaCl-glycine Kim and Goepfert medium for detection of Bacillus cereus, to Clostridium welchii agar for detection of C. perfringens, and to Gifu anaerobic medium for detection of C. botulinum. These food poisoning bacteria showed the same lecithovitellin (LV) reaction on these media as on the same media prepared with fresh egg yolk. The yolk paste could be stored at -20 C without freezing and did not show any bacterial growth after holding at 25 C for 30 days. The increased salt content resulted from the addition of salted yolk paste to the media did not inhibit the growth of the food poisoning bacteria used in these experiments. For the identification of the food poisoning bacteria used in this work, and which give a LV reaction, salted yolk paste is more convenient to use than yolk separated from fresh shell eggs.
TI  - In vitro activity of fleroxacin (Ro23-6240), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone against isolates from cancer patients.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Fleroxacin (Ro23-6240; AM 833), a new fluorinated 4-quinolone, was compared to that of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin and A-56620, against 747 isolates from cancer patients. Fleroxacin inhibited more than 90% of Enterobacteriacea isolates at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. It was also extremely active against Aeromonas hydrophila and Haemophilus influenzae isolates with MIC90 values of 0.12 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for Acinetobacter spp. was 1.0 micrograms/ml, for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas fluorescens 4.0 micrograms/ml, and for other Pseudomonas spp., 8.0 micrograms/ml. Staphylococcus aureus isolates including methicillin-resistant strains were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. The MIC90 for three different species of coagulase-negative Staphylococci was 1.0 microgram/ml. Streptococcal species required 8-16 micrograms/ml for inhibition. Fleroxacin was also active against group JK-diphtheroids and Bacillus cereus. The overall activity of fleroxacin was similar to that of enoxacin and less than that of A-56620 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Bacillus subtilis (natto) plasmid pLS20 mediates interspecies plasmid transfer.
AB  - The 55-kilobase plasmid, pLS20, of Bacillus subtilis (natto) 3335 promotes transfer of the tetracycline resistance plasmid pBC16 from B. subtilis (natto) to the Bacillus species B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. licheniformis, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. subtilis, and B. thuringiensis. Frequency of pBC16 transfer ranged from 2.3 x 10(-6) to 2.8 x 10(-3). Evidence for a plasmid-encoded conjugationlike mechanism of genetic exchange includes (i) pLS20+ strains, but not pLS20- strains, functioned as donors of pBC16; (ii) plasmid transfer was insensitive to the presence of DNase; and (iii) cell-free filtrates of donor cultures did not convert recipient cells to Tcr. Cotransfer of pLS20 and pBC16 in intraspecies matings and in matings with a restriction-deficient B. subtilis strain indicated that pLS20 was self-transmissible. In addition to mobilizing pBC16, pLS20 mediated transfer of the B. subtilis (natto) plasmid pLS19 and the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB110. The fertility plasmid did not carry a selectable marker. To facilitate direct selection for pLS20 transfer, plasmid derivatives which carried the erythromycin resistance transposon Tn917 were generated. Development of this method of genetic exchange will facilitate the introduction of plasmid DNA into nontransformable species by use of transformable fertile B. subtilis or B. subtilis (natto) strains as intermediates.
TI  - Production of staphylococcal enterotoxin in mixed cultures.
AB  - Two Staphylococcus aureus strains were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth  and a meat medium with Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both S. aureus strains grew well and produced enterotoxin in the presence of S. faecalis in BHI broth; however, enterotoxin production was observable in the meat medium only when the S. aureus inoculum was greater than the S. faecalis inoculum. S. aureus FRI-100 grown with B. cereus produced enterotoxin in both media only when the S. aureus inoculum was much higher than the B. cereus inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), whereas S. aureus FRI-196E produced enterotoxin in both media at all inoculum combinations except in the meat medium, when the inocula of the two organisms were the same. S. aureus grown with E. coli in BHI broth produced enterotoxin at all inoculum combinations except when the E. coli inoculum was greater than the S. aureus inoculum; however, in the meat medium, enterotoxin was produced only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the E. coli inoculum (10 versus 10(4) CFU), S. aureus FRI-100 grown with P. aeruginosa in either medium produced enterotoxin only when the S. aureus inoculum was much greater than the P. aeruginosa inoculum (10 versus 10(3) or 10(4) CFU). It can be concluded from these results that enterotoxin production is unlikely in mixed cultures unless the staphylococci outnumber the other contaminating organisms.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  - Egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including Listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. We also found that the food spoilage thermophile Clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme and confirmed that the spoilage organisms Bacillus stearothermophilus and Clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. Several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella typhimurium, and Yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. The results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by C. botulinum and L. monocytogenes.
TI  - Kinetics and mechanism of the serine beta-lactamase catalyzed hydrolysis of depsipeptides.
AB  - Steady-state kinetic parameters have been determined for the hydrolysis of a series of acyclic depsipeptides (ester analogues of acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine peptides) catalyzed by representative class C (Enterobacter cloacae P99) and class A (Bacillus cereus I, TEM-2, and Staphylococcus aureus PC1) beta-lactamases. The best of these substrates, and the one most used in this work, was m-[[(phenylacetyl)-glycyl]oxy]benzoic acid, whose rates of cleavage could be followed spectrophotometrically. The P99 enzyme also catalyzed the methanolysis of these substrates in aqueous methanol solutions. Quantitative evaluation of the effects of methanol on the kinetics of the competing hydrolysis and methanolysis reactions, and on the product distribution, supports a reaction mechanism involving an acyl-enzyme intermediate whose formation is rate-determining under conditions of substrate saturation. Consideration of the variation of these kinetic parameters with the structure of the depsipeptides and comparison with the analogous parameters for bicyclic beta-lactam substrates suggest that a variety of substrate binding modes exist on this enzyme. The class A enzymes, B. cereus beta-lactamase I and the TEM-2 beta-lactamase, catalyze depsipeptide and benzylpenicillin hydrolyses but not methanolysis. The acyl-enzyme derived from both types of substrate is thus shielded from external nucleophiles; the shielding is therefore not an effect, direct or indirect, of the thiazolidinyl group in the penicilloyl-enzyme. The class A beta-lactamase of the PC1 plasmid of S. aureus is distinctly different from the above two representatives of that class, in that it does catalyze methanolysis of depsipeptides (but not of benzylpenicillin). The methanolysis kinetics suggest that deacylation is rate-determining at saturation, a conclusion supported by the demonstration of an intermediate during the hydrolysis of m-[[(phenylacetyl)glycyl]oxy]benzoate, subsequent to leaving-group departure. The beta-lactamases have thus been shown to catalyze the hydrolysis of specific depsipeptides with comparable facility to that demonstrated by D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase/transpeptidases. The former enzymes, however, differ in being unable to cleave the analogous peptides.
TI  - Renal dipeptidase is one of the membrane proteins released by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.
AB  - Renal dipeptidase (dehydropeptidase-I, EC 3.4.13.11) was released from pig kidney membrane preparations by treatment with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus thuringiensis and a phospholipase C preparation from Bacillus cereus to a similar extent as alkaline phosphatase. Endopeptidase-24.11 and aminopeptidase N were not released by this treatment. After treatment of the membrane fraction with the S. aureus phospholipase C the dipeptidase was converted from an amphipathic to a hydrophilic form, as deduced from phase-separation experiments in Triton X-114. It is concluded that renal dipeptidase is anchored to the microvillar membrane by covalently attached phosphatidylinositol.
TI  - [Experimental basis of principles for creating microbiologic standards for food products for children during the 1st year of life].
AB  - Standard media were designed simulating the gastro-intestinal contents of infants during the first year of life. These media were used in the in vitro tests to study the viability of a number of potentially-pathogenic microorganisms. It was shown that S. aureus, E. coli O-III, S. liquefaciens not only survived but also multiplied in the media with pH values similar to those of gastric juice in infants of the first year of life, in the presence of the mixture for child nutrition "Malysh". The results obtained necessitate strict requirements for the absence of potentially-pathogenic microorganisms in definite volumes of dry milk mixtures and their components intended for child nutrition.
TI  - [Effect of components of curing mixtures on the antagonistic properties of enterococci and other bacteria isolated from cured meat].
AB  - Effect of sodium chloride, glucose, sodium glutamate, potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium nitraite, ascorbic acid, sodium citrate, polyphosphates (Hamine) on antagonistic activity of enterococci and various bacteria isolated from cured meat against Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella typhi-murium, Salmonella cholerae-suis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium botulinum type A, Clostridium botulinum type B, Clostridium botulinum type E, Clostridium bifermentans, Clostridium perfringens type A, Clostridium sporogenes. It was found that some of the chemical compounds examined increased the antagonistic effect and other compounds partly or totally inhibited it. Sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, potassium nitrate, glucose, and ascorbic acid in majority of cases increased antagonism and sodium citrate and polyphosphates restrained this phenomenon.
TI  - Release of the 120 kDa component of the mouse neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM from cell surfaces by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.
AB  - To study the membrane anchoring of the 120 kDa component of the neural cell adhesion molecule N-CAM, the smallest form lacking a transmembrane domain, cultured mouse neural cells were treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus. When live cultures of astrocytes and neurons are treated with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, N-CAM120 is released into the supernatant. Under these conditions N-CAM140 and N-CAM180 are not released. Phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus or Clostridium perfringens does not release N-CAM120. The embryonic form of N-CAM on astrocytes migrating as a broad band between 120 and 180 kDa is also partially released by phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C as a band migrating between 120 and 160 kDa. These observations suggest novel mechanisms in regulation of N-CAM120 expression on the cell surface and in modulation of N-CAM-mediated cell adhesion.
TI  - Bactericidal action of carbon dioxide laser radiation in experimental dental root canals.
AB  - The ability of a carbon dioxide laser to sterilize the root canal of human teeth  has been investigated. Three oral bacteria, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, and Actinomyces viscosus, and three other bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used as experimental organisms. Exposure of cells on glass slides to laser radiation showed there was little difference in the exposure required to kill these six organisms. Complete recovery of bacteria from the root canal was initially a problem and was only achieved when bacterial manipulations and removal were carried out in rapid succession, within 5 min of inoculation. However, the geometry of the instrumented canal and the laser alignment were major factors in achieving consistent cell death of oral bacteria in the root canals. Using sets of 10 teeth, four repeated exposures of 10 W for 1 s was found to sterilize 4 or more of the teeth.
TI  - Lethal effect of butylated hydroxyanisole as related to bacterial fatty acid composition.
AB  - Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas fragi, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella "anatum" were challenged with butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA). Susceptibility was measured as the concentration of BHA required to cause a 90% reduction in bacterial survivors. Staphylococcus aureus LP and P. fragi were two of the most resistant species examined; C. perfringens and P. fluorescens were the most susceptible. Gram stain reaction was found not to be a strict indicator of bacterial susceptibility to BHA. There was no obvious relationship between individual fatty acids and susceptibility. The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in the total lipid fraction of only the gram-positive species was related to susceptibility. The ratios of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids of other fractions were not related to susceptibility.
TI  - Single-stranded plasmid DNA in Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Plasmid pC194 was found to exist in a double-stranded and a single-stranded DNA form in Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus. This single-stranded DNA was found as a circular molecule of the same size as the parental monomer and corresponded to only one of the two DNA strands. It represented one-third of plasmid copies. Single- and double-stranded DNA copies in similar proportions to the above were detected for five other S. aureus plasmids (pC221, pC223, pE194, pT127, and pT181) and one B. subtilis plasmid (pHV416). S. aureus plasmid pUB110 and Bacillus cereus plasmid pBC16 were, in contrast, predominantly double-stranded.
TI  - [Antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment].
AB  - This study was carried out to understand the antibacterial properties of some spice plants before and after heat treatment in boiling water. The samples included the core and the outer layers of onion, the white and the green parts of green onion, garlic bulb, ginger, ginger root, sweet pepper, chili pepper, brown pepper, and mustard. The test microorganisms included Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus aureus, Mycobacterium phlei, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Micrococcus luteus. Raw garlic bulb could inhibit all of the test strains. The antibacterial activities of green onion are slightly weak than that of onion. However, green onion could inhibit P. aeruginosa and M. luteus, but onion could inhibit E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. faecalis, and B. cereus. Ginger and ginger root could only inhibit M. luteus. Chili pepper could inhibit V. parahaemolyticus and P. vulgaris. Brown pepper could also inhibit P. vulgaris. Sweet pepper and mustard showed no antibacterial activity to all of the test strains. In general, antibacterial components in the spice plants were heat labile. All the spices tested lost their antibacterial activities within 20 min at 100 degrees C.
TI  - Murine monoclonal anti-DNA autoantibodies bind to endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Several bacterial species (including Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli) were tested for their ability to react with monoclonal anti-DNA antibodies that were derived from MRL-lpr/lpr mice. S. faecalis reacted with 8/15 of such antibodies. The binding was unaffected by DNase, but it was competitively inhibited by DNA. F(ab')2 fragments of the monoclonal antibodies reacted with the bacteria, but Fc fragments did not. Phospholipids extracted from the bacterial cells were able to bind to three representative anti-DNA antibodies that also bound to whole bacteria. The results suggest that bacterial phospholipids might provide an immunogenic stimulus for the production of antibodies that cross-react with DNA. We propose that some anti-DNA auto-antibodies and anti-bacterial antibodies evolve from a restricted group of antibodies with high avidity for the phosphodiester groups that occur in DNA and bacterial cells walls.
TI  - [Occurrence of enteritis-causing agents in private households--a pilot study].
AB  - The increasing occurrence of infectious enteritis caused us to perform a prospective, epidemiological pilotstudy in households, in order to receive informations about the practicability of such a project and the bacteriology of food prepared at home as well. 10 families were asked to gather samples of all foodstuffs consumed during the day in separate containers and to keep them frozen at - 20 degrees C until collected by us once a week. Thus we received 4.683 samples within a 6-months-period. In the laboratory those samples were mixed following Table 2 and examined concerning the occurrence of enteropathogenic bacteria. Additionally we carried out an investigation of kitchensurfaces and -utensils by means of "Rodac"-plates. The evaluation of the food-samples showed no growth of salmonella, shigella, yersinia or campylobacter; however, in 267 samples were found staphylococci, in 191 enterococci, in 388 enterobacteria, in 28 aerobic sporeformers and in 144 fungi. Mainly sausage- and meatproducts appeared to be contaminated by staphylococci, also enterococci and enterobacteria (Fig. 1); other groceries were colonized by these microorganisms only to a minor degree. Fungi and aerobic sporeformers were isolated primarily in salads, bakery- and milkproducts (Fig. 2). Though some of the foodstuffs contained up to 10(5) pathogenes/g (Fig. 5), no cases of gastroenteritis were observed within our families. In case of mishandling (e.g. storage of food in refrigerators with temperatures above 4 degrees C) the development of foodborne enteritis has to be taken into account. The kitchens' examination showed a relatively high degree of contamination with pathogenic resp. potentially pathogenic organisms, represented in Fig. 7 by data obtained from different objects of investigation (surfaces, sinks and cloths).
TI  - Microbiological aspects of goat's milk. A Public Health Laboratory Service survey.
AB  - In a 12-month survey (June 1982-May 1983) 41 laboratories examined 2493 samples of goat's milk for colony counts and the presence of pathogens. The statutory tests for cow's milk were also applied. Surface counts of less than 10(5) organisms per ml of raw milk were given by 79% of samples at 37 degrees C and by 76% at 22 degrees C. There were less than 100 coliforms per ml in 71% of samples, less than 10 Escherichia coli per ml in 91%. Staphylococcus aureus was not detected in countable numbers in 96% of samples. Only one isolation of campylobacter was made and two of Yersinia enterocolitica. Salmonella was not detected in 2462 samples. The methylene blue test was carried out on 2368 samples and 86.7% were deemed satisfactory. No sample was Brucella ring-test-positive. Experiments on the survival and growth of six food poisoning organisms in stored goat's milk showed that Bacillus cereus, Staph. aureus, Salmonella typhimurium and Y. enterocolitica survived quite well and multiplied at the higher storage temperature of 30 degrees C. Clostridium perfringens only increased 10- to 100-fold while Campylobacter jejuni did not grow. The results of the survey indicate that any problems with goat's milk relate to poor hygiene during production rather than transmission of organisms from the goat herself.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bupivacaine and morphine against 10 microbial strains was studied with an agar dilution method. The strains tested were Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and one of each of the clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis (a multiresistant strain), Staphylococcus epidermidis (a sensitive strain), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes (A), Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, and Candida albicans. The antimicrobial effect of bupivacaine was tested at concentrations of 0.5, 1.25, 2.5, and 5 mg/ml (0.05% 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.5%). Bupivacaine at a concentration of 2.5 mg/ml inhibited the growth of the sensitive S. epidermidis strain, S. pyogenes, and S. pneumoniae, and all of the others except P. aeruginosa at a concentration of 5 mg/ml. Morphine 0.2 and 2 mg/ml (0.02 and 0.2%) did not inhibit any of the strains.

TI  - Unusually severe food poisoning from vanilla slices.
AB  - Thirty six people suffered from severe vomiting and diarrhoea 15 min to 3 h after eating vanilla slices from the same bakery. Five patients were admitted to hospital, and one developed unusual skin lesions after admission. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in large numbers from vanilla slices of the same batch as those giving rise to symptoms, and from five faecal specimens obtained from affected persons. Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis were also isolated from the slices. Unbaked custard provides an ideal environment for bacterial multiplication, especially when (as on this occasion) the ambient temperature is persistently high.
TI  - A model for the secondary structure of beta-lactamases.
AB  - A 3-dimensional model, common for the secondary structures of four beta-lactamases obtained from Escherichia coli, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus, is proposed. The predictions of the structures were made by the hydrophobicity profiles method complemented by the modified Chou and Fasman's method. The model proposed presents 56% constancy and can be described as a 2-domain structure, in agreement with low resolution X-ray data reported for the E. coli enzyme. The model would explain how a common function can be performed by enzymes of very different sizes, composition and sequence.
TI  - [Incidence of Bacillus cereus and various pathogenic microorganisms in food for infants and small children].
AB  - 206 samples of commercially available infant food and their ingredients were examined for the content of B. cereus and coagulase-positive staphylococci as well as for the presence of salmonellae. B. cereus could be isolated from 64 samples with numbers between 3 and 460/g (only 2 samples greater than 100/g). Two samples contained coagulase-positive staphylococci (4/g each), and no sample salmonellae. Growth of B. cereus in reconstituted samples with counts of less than or equal to 100/g incubated at 20 and 25 degrees C, reached counts of 10(3)-10(4)/g after 6-9 h and 3-6 h, respectively. With regard to productivity and selectivity no differences between the media used (mannitol-egg yolk-phenolred-polymyxin-agar according to Mossel, Koopman and Jongerius, and polymyxin-pyruvate-egg yolk-mannitol-bromthymol blue-agar according to Holbrook and Anderson) could be observed.
TI  - Comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  - It is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. Although the effect of most of these toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. The resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. The biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase, leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of cAMP. Stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. The duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. Subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. The heat-labile toxins of V. cholerae, E. coli, Salmonella spp., A. hydrophila and Y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. Similarly the heat-stable toxins of E. coli and Y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. Classified along with the enterotoxin of C. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by Sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of E. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. In another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by Staph. aureus until more is known. Surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological and structural differences. Evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. The structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. It is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like V. cholerae.
TI  - [Medical aspects of elaboration of microbiological criteria for evaluating the quality and principles of microbiological standards of dried milk and other mixtures for children in the first year of life].
AB  - The author demonstrates the ability of St. aureus, E. coli O III, B. cereus and other opportunistic microorganisms to multiply in model media similar to those in the alimentary tract of children of the first year of life. Describes the principal differences between microbiological criteria of evaluating the quality and safety of infant food mixtures and other products intended for children of the first year of life and these criteria for consumer goods. Emphasizes that food mixtures for infant nutrition should not contain potentially pathogenic and pathogenic microorganisms. At the present stage of manufacturing food for children of the first year of life the microbiological criteria are based on an assay of mesophilic aerobic microorganisms in 1 g (ml) and on the determination of the mass of the ready-made mixture or other product which should not contain E. coli that ferment glucose, coliform bacteria, lactose, E. coli, St. aureus, salmonella, yeast and mold.
TI  - beta-Lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of acyclic depsipeptides and acyl transfer to specific amino acid acceptors.
AB  - beta-Lactamases from all three classes, A, B, and C, catalyze the hydrolysis of specific acyclic depsipeptide (PhCH2CONHCR1R2CO2CHR3CO2H) analogs of acyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine peptides. The depsipeptides investigated, which are chemically as reactive toward nucleophiles as penicillins, are in general poor substrates, although differences between the classes of beta-lactamases have been observed: the order of effectiveness seems to be C greater than B greater than A. Certain class A and C beta-lactamases also catalyze phenylacetylglycyl transfer between phenylacetylglycyl depsipeptides and specific amino acid acceptors, a type of reaction hitherto identified more closely with D-alanyl-D-alanine transpeptidases than with beta-lactamases. Preliminary indications of an acyl-enzyme intermediate in these reactions have been obtained. These results support the suggestion [Tipper, D.J. and Strominger, J.L. (1965) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 54, 1133-1141] that beta-lactamases are evolutionary descendants of bacterial cell wall D-alanyl-D-alanine transpeptidases.
TI  - The microbiology of selected retail food products with an evaluation of viable counting methods.
AB  - In an inter-laboratory survey, the pour plate, surface spread, agar droplet and spiral plate methods were used in parallel with the surface drop method for enumeration of micro-organisms in foods. Good agreement was obtained between all surface methods of enumeration, but there was poor agreement between molten agar methods and the surface drop method. A total of 1143 samples of food that were ready for consumption at the point of retail sale were examined. Eight types of food products were chosen: meat pasties, sausage rolls, real-cream slices, synthetic-cream slices, mayonnaise-based coleslaws, faggots, pates and continental sausages. The results of this survey suggest that the upper limit for an acceptable viable count should vary according to the food product. Salmonellae were not isolated on any occasion. Potentially harmful organisms were not isolated at levels expected to constitute a public health hazard. Information concerning the nature of the product, the total viable count, the presence or absence of pathogenic, toxigenic or indicator organisms, the spectrum of the bacterial flora and the relative predominance of each organism must all be considered when assessing the microbiological acceptability of retail 'ready to eat' products.
TI  - [Microbiological study of spices. I. Oregano].
AB  - A total of 150 oregano samples from 6 different trade marks were studied. These samples were obtained at retail shops in Buenos Aires city and they were analyzed in order to determine the presence of the following microorganisms: 1) mesophilic aerobic plate count; 2) molds; 3) coliforms and fecal coliforms; 4) enterococci; 5) aerobes sporeforming: a) mesophilic aerobes; a1) total aerobes; a2) mesophilic anaerobes; b) thermophilic; b1) sulfide spoilage sporeformers; b2) total aerobes; b3) thermo-philic Flat sour; 6) pathogens; 6a) Clostridium perfringens 6b) Bacillus cereus and 6c) Staphylococcus aureus. We can conclude from these results that there is no apparent risk for public health. Nevertheless the microbiologic evaluation of the spices becomes important when they are added to packed foodstuff which has not received a minimum thermic treatment.
TI  - Antibacterially active substituted anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids.
AB  - Anilides of carboxylic and sulfonic acids were prepared and tested for antimicrobial activity. While these anilides were ineffective against Gram-negative organisms, there was a good correlation between chemical structure and biological activity against Gram-positive species. Both the nature and position of the benzene ring substituents and the length of the carbon side chain affected the activity and specificity of the compounds. The highest activity was observed when the acyl or sulfuryl moiety had a C7-C9 side chain attached. The CONH and SO2NH bridging groups were equally effective. The attachment of COOH or COOCH3 groups in the omega-position did not effect activity, but the substitution of the acidic proton of the sulfonamide group by an alkyl group rendered the compound inactive. Six compounds, which were substituted anilides of sulfonic acids, fatty acids, or the analagous alpha-methylene-substituted acids, were bacteriostatic at 10 ppm against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus plantarum. One of these compounds, 2-hydroxy-5-nitroanilide of alpha-methylenedecanoic acid, was bactericidal at 1 ppm.
TI  - Freeze-dried mixed cultures as samples for proficiency tests and collaborative studies in food microbiology.
AB  - A method is presented for preparing samples of freeze-dried mixtures of microorganisms for proficiency tests and collaborative studies. The samples may include most microorganisms that are found in routine analysis in food laboratories. Transport of samples during 48 h did not decrease the number of microorganisms, nor was the variability among samples significantly affected by transport. The standard deviation of counts after 5 weeks of storage varied from 0.04 (Staphylococcus aureus) to 0.17 (Clostridium perfringens) log unit. Storage of samples for 10 weeks decreased the number of viable organisms by 0.02-0.43 log unit. Variability among samples increased for Providencia alcalifaciens and Bacillus cereus after 10 weeks of storage. No significant increase was found for the other organisms.
TI  - Isolation of a tetracycline-resistance plasmid excised from a chromosomal DNA sequence in Bacillus subtilis.
AB  - When Bacillus subtilis GSY908 (recE4-) (H. C. Spatz and T. A. Trautner, 1971, Mol. Gen. Genet. 113, 174-190) protoplasts were infected with Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pNS1 specifying tetracycline resistance (Tcr) (N. Noguchi et al., 1983, Gene 21, 105-112), which was modified such that it either could not replicate or did not carry a functional Tcr gene, a plasmid with a molecular weight of 3.1 X 10(6) (4.9 kb) was generated in Tcr phenotypes. This plasmid, named Tcr pNS1981, exhibited completely different restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns to pNS1 and showed only negligible sequence homology in hybridization experiments. Southern hybridization experiments revealed that pNS1981 arises by excision of a B. subtilis chromosomal DNA sequence. No sequence corresponding to pNS1 was detectable on the chromosome of pNS1981-maintaining B. subtilis. The production of pNS1981 was also observed in B. subtilis RM125 (r-Mm-Mrec+) (T. Uozumi et al., 1977, Mol. Gen. Genet. 152, 65-69.) with almost the same frequency as B. subtilis GSY908. Since the recipient B. subtilis Marburg 168 derivatives stated above are sensitive to Tc, the results indicate that information essential for Tcr is under negative regulatory control in the integrated state on the chromosome. Restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that pNS1981 is essentially the same as pBC16, formerly found in B. cereus (K. Bernhard, H. Schrempf, and W. Goebel, 1978, J. Bacteriol. 133, 897-903).

TI  - Properties of neutrophils recruited into inflammatory foci with homologous or heterologous antigen in immunized ewes.
AB  - Studies were undertaken to determine functional properties of neutrophils attracted into involuted mammary glands of Staphylococcus aureus--immunized ewes by soluble antigens prepared from S. aureus (homologous antigen) or from Bacillus cereus (heterologous antigen). The ewes were immunized with an S. aureus vaccine known to stimulate synthesis of cytophilic IgG2 antibody, and the inflammatory responses were elicited 4-8 weeks later by infusing homologous antigen into one gland and heterologous antigen into the other. Inflammatory cells were collected at 2, 4, and 8 h postinfusion. The magnitude of the cellular responses was similar in both glands with high proportions of viable neutrophils. There were no significant differences between neutrophil populations from each gland for proportions of cells bearing cytophilic immunoglobulin, although the proportions of cytophilic immunoglobulin-positive cells from both glands were lower in 2-h exudates than in 4-h or 8-h exudates. In invitro phagocytosis assays using 3H-labeled S. aureus and B. cereus no differences could be detected between the two populations of neutrophils in terms of phagocytic efficacy using a range of bacteria-neutrophil ratios and various opsonizing treatments.
TI  - Effects of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide on bacterial growth.
AB  - The effects of low concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on actively dividing cultures of Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, Micrococcus roseus, Serratia marcescens, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus megaterium, and Bacillus cereus were studied. Fresh cultures of each organism were incubated for 24 h at 25 degrees C on both nutrient agar and mineral salts glucose agar plates under atmospheres containing various low concentrations of NO in air (0 to 1.9 ppm [0 to 2.0 micrograms/g of air]), NO2 in air (0 to 5.5 ppm [0 to 8.8 micrograms/g of air]), or NO and NO2 in air. Bacteria grown under air only were used as controls. After incubation, the colonies that developed on the plates were counted. None of the bacteria tested was affected by NO or NO2 at the indicated concentrations while growing on nutrient agar. Serratia marcescens, B. circulans, B. subtilis, B. megaterium, and B. cereus grown on mineral salts glucose agar were not significantly affected by NO or NO2. Low concentrations (0 to 1.9 ppm) of NO were bacteriostatic to log-phase cultures of M. roseus, M. luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus grown on mineral salts glucose agar. Bacteriostatic activity over a 24-h interval was maximal at an initial NO concentration of 1 ppm. Appreciable amounts of NO2 were produced in 24 h at initial NO concentrations greater than 1 ppm. These results suggest that NO2 may reduce the bacteriostatic activity of NO. Low concentrations (0 to 5.5 ppm) of NO2 in air did not affect any of the bacteria tested. At these low concentrations, NO affected bacterial growth, although NO2, NO2-, and NO3- did not. In addition, it was determined that the bacteriostatic activity observed in this study was not due to an increase in the acidity of the medium.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of dissociated and undissociated sorbic acid at different pH levels.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentration of sorbic acid has been determined for Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans. The inhibition was shown to be due to both undissociated and dissociated acid, and the effect of each has been calculated in accordance with a proposed mathematical model. Although the inhibitory action of undissociated acid was 10-600 times greater than that of dissociated acid, the latter caused more than 50% of the growth inhibition at pH levels above 6 for most of the organisms tested.
TI  - Evaluation of the direct epifluorescent filter technique for assessing the hygienic condition of milking equipment.
AB  - The hygienic condition of 6 milking installations, 3 sanitized by circulation cleaning (CC) with chlorine-based chemicals and 3 by flushing with acidified boiling water (ABW), was tested using rinses of quarter strength Ringer's solution. The bacterial content of the rinses was determined using both colony counts and the direct epifluorescent filter technique (DEFT). A comparison of testing methods gave correlation coefficients between colony count and DEFT of 0.82 for plants using CC and 0.46 for plants using ABW. Five strains of bacteria belonging to different genera and commonly found on milking equipment were exposed to various degrees of heat and to various concentrations of chlorine. The effects of such treatments on the staining characteristics of the organisms were studied. It was observed that Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus lactis, although killed by heat treatment, stained a bright orange when treated with acridine orange dye. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Escherichia coli and vegetative cells of Bacillus cereus did not take up the orange stain after heat treatment, nor did any of the 5 strains stain orange after treatment with NaOCl. It is suggested that the DEFT is a useful and rapid means of counting bacteria in rinses of equipment where sterilization is due primarily to chlorination, but in the absence of a stain which can differentiate more accurately between dead and living organisms its use is limited where sterilization is carried out solely by heat.
TI  - What do beta-lactamases mean for clinical efficacy?
AB  - beta-Lactamases have proved to be extremely important in influencing therapy with penicillins and cephalosporins against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic species. Both plasmid mediated beta-lactamases which are primarily of a constitutive penicillinase type and the inducible chromosomal enzymes which are primarily cephalosporinases are important. The use of penicillins to treat Haemophilus, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Salmonella, Shigella and Pseudomonas infections must be based upon the relative incidence of beta-lactamase producing strains. In the same manner cephalosporins can be used to treat infections due to Enterobacter, Serratia and Bacteroides only if the compounds are beta-lactamase stable and not good inducers of beta-lactamase activity. Although altered permeability is important in the resistance of some Pseudomonas and Enterobacter to beta-lactams, the resistance really is due to a combination of reduced entry of molecules and strategically placed beta-lactamases. It is only in some Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis strains that altered penicillin-binding proteins make a significant contribution to the resistance to beta-lactams. beta-lactamases will continue to be the most important factor in clinically significant resistance of bacteria to both penicillins and cephalosporins.

TI  - Survival of cultured cells after functional and structural disorganization of plasma membrane by bacterial haemolysins and phospholipases.
AB  - Lesions were induced in the plasma membranes of cultured human fibroblasts by membrane damaging toxins of bacterial origin (haemolysins). Structural disorganization of the membrane was measured as leakage of a radiolabelled small cytoplasmic marker and functional membrane damage was measured as decreased uptake of aminoisobutyrate. Cell survival was scored 24 and 48 hr later by measuring uptake of Trypan Blue and by light microscopical evaluation of cell morphology and proliferation. The membrane damage induced by most bacterial toxins was reversible upon removal of the toxin, since toxin-treated cells recovered and excluded Trypan Blue although they had been permeable to the dye immediately after the toxin treatment. Among ten bacterial toxins tested, the only exception of this general behavior was the Aeromonas hydrophila beta-haemolysin, which irreversibly damaged human fibroblasts. Thus, the action of bacterial haemolysins on cultured cells generally seems restricted to a plasma membrane permeabilization, which is reversible regardless of the mechanism of membrane damaging action of the toxin or of the relative size of the structural lesions induced. Furthermore, the use of Trypan Blue uptake as a measure of cell death caused by membrane damaging agents appears to be of limited value.

TI  - Gram-positive bacteria-induced granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis in rabbits.
AB  - Pneumococci have been shown to induce granulocytopenia and pulmonary leukostasis  which might contribute to morbidity and mortality in pneumococcal sepsis. We studied whether other gram-positive species (groups A and B streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Clostridium perfringens) could also induce these phenomena. Rabbits were challenged with nonviable preparations of each species, and all five species induced profound granulocytopenia (mean decrease of 90%) and pulmonary leukostasis. In vitro studies of serum incubated with these species of bacteria showed a mean consumption of total hemolytic complement of 90%, a mean increase of chemotactic activity for granulocytes of 204%, and a mean augmentation of granulocyte adherence of 45% (compared with 18% for the control). Infusion of sonicate-exposed sera induced granulocytopenia in recipient rabbits. Thus, several nonviable gram-positive species can interact with serum to activate the complement system, generate C5a bioactivity, augment granulocyte adherence, and generate a neutropenia-inducing factor. These alterations may contribute to granulocytopenia or pulmonary leukostasis, which may play a role in the morbidity and mortality associated with gram-positive bacterial infections.
TI  - Membrane-bound penicillinases in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The penicillinases of Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus are related in structure and cellular localization to one another more closely than they are to penicillinases from Gram-negative organisms. In the latter, penicillinases are almost exclusively found in the periplasm, while the Gram-positive bacteria retain a substantial proportion as hydrophobic membrane-bound forms. We recently showed (Nielsen, J. B. K., Caulfield, M. P., and Lampen, J. O. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 3511-3515) that B. licheniformis membrane attachment was achieved through a glyceride thioether modification identical to that in several Gram-negative outer membrane proteins. We now report that the membrane penicillinases of S. aureus and B. cereus also possess the modification. We do this by demonstrating isotopic labeling of these forms of [3H]palmitate, by showing that they exhibit the same response to the antibiotic globomycin which appears to inhibit processing steps specifically involving the glyceride thioether in Escherichia coli outer membrane proteins, and lastly by isolating glyceryl cysteine sulfone, the oxidation product of the modified cysteine residue. By comparing the modification-susceptible signal sequences of Gram-positive penicillinases and of Gram-negative outer membrane proteins with those of nonmodified Gram-negative penicillinases, we describe in increased detail the structural features within the signal sequence that allow modification and cleavage resulting in membrane anchorage.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylaniline cephalosporin, a new diagnostic chromogenic reagent, and comparison with nitrocefin, cephacetrile, and other beta-lactam compounds.
AB  - Pyridine-2-azo-p-dimethylanaline cephalosporin (PADAC), a chromogenic reagent which is purple and changes to yellow upon cleavage of its beta-lactam ring, was evaluated in comparison with other chromogenic cephalosporins. PADAC exhibited little antimicrobial activity against gram-negative bacteria, but did have good activity (minimum inhibitory concentration, 0.12 to 0.5 microgram/ml) against Staphylococcus aureus, a quality comparable to nitrocefin. Nitrocefin, however, demonstrated an unexpected and uniquely potent activity against Streptococcus faecalis (minimum inhibitory concentration, less than or equal to 0.06 to 0.12 microgram/ml) The relative hydrolysis rate of PADAC when subjected to six different beta-lactamases was substantially greater than that of cephacetrile, but less than that of nitrocefin. The relative hydrolysis rates of PADAC and nitrocefin were comparable with type IIIa beta lactamase and the derived from Bacillus cereus. The inhibition of beta-lactamase hydrolysis of the chromogenic cephalosporin substrates by six enzyme-stable inhibitors was generally greater with PADAC than with nitrocefin. Unlike nitrocefin, PADAC mixed with 50% human serum or various broth culture media showed no evidence of color change or degradation over several hours. The subsequent enzyme hydrolysis rates of such mixtures were the same as in phosphate buffer. Beta-lactamase-containing bacterial suspensions and clinical specimens containing such bacteria produced positive visual and spectrophotometric color changes when mixed with PADAC or nitrocefin. Although color changes occurred more slowly with PADAC than with nitrocefin, PADAC was not adversely influenced (non-enzyme-related color change) by the protein content of specimens. PADAC appears to be a promising alternative for beta-lactamase diagnostic testing in the clinical and research microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Antibacterial substance from Carica papaya fruit extract.
AB  - Ripe and unripe Carica papaya fruits (epicarp, endocarp, seeds and leaves) were extracted separately and purified. All the extracts except that of leaves produced very significant antibacterial activity on Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Shigella flexneri. The MIC of the substance was small (0.2-0.3 mg/ml) for gram-positive bacteria and large (1.5-4 mg/ml) for gram-negative bacteria. The substance was bactericidal and showed properties of a protein. Other proteins previously found in C. papaya did not show antibacterial activity.
TI  - Structural changes induced by subinhibitory concentrations of fosfomycin on Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus.
AB  - Exposure of Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778 to 1/2 MIC fosfomycin for 3 and 6 h was studied by transmission and scanning electron microscopy. After 3 h, a loss of density and irregularity of shape in the septum was noted, while after 6 h a delayed separation of newly formed cells was observed in both species. In Staphylococcus aureus this resulted in the formation of chains of intact cells and cells in lysis. In Bacillus cereus, it produced filamentous forms with multiple septa. the differences between the effects observed at 3 h and 6 h may be due to time-related variations in cell permeability to fosfomycin, or to the existence of indirect mechanisms enabling fosfomycin to interfere with the enzymatic activity regulating the normal separation of cells, or to a combination of these factors.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity evaluation of cefodizime (HR221), a new semisynthetic cephalosporin.
AB  - Cefodizime (HR221) is a new alpha-methoxyimino cephalosporin developed by Hoechst-Roussel with a reported serum half-life of over 2 h. In vitro susceptibility studies showed that the cefodizime spectrum includes all those Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci, Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp., and Neisseria spp. normally susceptible to cefotaxime (HR756) or ceftizoxime (FK749) or both. Cefodizime was less active (two- to eightfold) than cefotaxime or ceftizoxime against some enteric species, but was the most potent drug against some strains of Morganella spp. and Proteus vulgaris. Enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and most Pseudomonas spp. were resistant to cefodizime (median minimum inhibitory concentrations, greater than or equal to 64 microgram/ml). Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains required cefodizime concentrations of 32 microgram/ml to inhibit 50% of tested strains. Cefodizime was very stable to hydrolysis by Richmond-Sykes type I, II, III, and IV beta-lactamases, as well as the enzyme derived from Bacillus cereus. The reference PADAC and nitrocefin substrate hydrolysis by a type I beta-lactamase was markedly inhibited (greater than 80%) by cefodizime at concentrations 0.4 to 4% of substrate concentration. Cefodizime was active against 43% of bacteria which were resistant to cephalothin and cefamandole and against 58% of those resistant to aminoglycosides.
TI  - Mode of antibiotic action of 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde from Streptomyces viridans.
AB  - The free ligand, deferroviridomycin A, and its iron(II) complex, viridomycin A, were detected in culture supernatant fluids of Streptomyces viridans 1671 and were structurally characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehyde and tris(4-hydroxy-3-nitrosobenzaldehydato-N3,O4)ferrate(II), respectively. We investigated the antibiotic activity of the above compounds and of the chemically synthesized bis copper(II), tris cobalt(III), and tris nickel(II) complexes against Escherichia coli NIHJ, Salmonella typhimurium LT-2Z, Staphylococcus aureus 209P, Streptococcus faecium 10541, and Bacillus cereus, T. The free ligand and its kinetically labile copper(II) and nickel(II) complexes displayed activity against all of the above organisms, whereas the kinetically inert iron(II) and cobalt(III) complexes displayed activity only against S. aureus and B. cereus. The antibiotic activity of the substitutionally labile metal complexes was attributed to dissociation of the free ligand. The mode of antibiotic action of the free ligand against E. coli appears to be interference with the structural and functional integrity of the cell membrane.
TI  - Enzymatic hydrolysis by bacterial phospolipases C and D of immobilized radioactive sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine.
AB  - An assay system for phospholipases C has been described with sphingomyelin immobilized to octyl-Sepharose CL-4B as substrate. The immobilization procedure was further developed and used with [14 C-choline]-sphingomyelin and [14C-choline] phosphatidylcholine (lecithin). These immobilized radioactive phospholipids made the enzymatic assays easier to perform and made it possible to increase the sensitivity. Furthermore, since release of the choline part instead of the phosphate part of the substrate molecule was measured, it was possible to use this assay for phospholipase D as well. The enzyme characteristics of phospholipase D from Corynebacterium ovis were compared in this test system with those of three phospholipases C (from Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus) with respect to hydrolysing capacities and optimal ion concentrations.
TI  - Enzymatic hydrolysis of immobilized sphingomyelin by three bacterial phospholipases C.
AB  - Through hydrophobic interaction, sphingomyelin was adsorbed to agarose beads containing octyl groups by a stepwise dilution procedure. This immobilized lipid was used as a substrate for three bacterial phospholipases C (E.C. 3.1.4.3.). The degradation with time of this substrate showed two different fractions of the substrate according to hydrolysing velocity in the early part of the time-curve when phospholipases C from Bacillus cereus and Clostridium perfringens were used. The early fractions could be predigested by the enzymes, a procedure which resulted in linear time-curves. The corresponding early part of the time-curve for phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus was linear, indicating a comparatively large early fraction of the substrate for this enzyme. The stock gel of the immobilized lipid substrate could be stored for months. It was easily and reproducibly handled as a water suspension. After enzymatic hydrolysis the substrate was rapidly separated from enzyme and product by filtration. The enzyme assay presented thus represents a convenient way to avoid the difficulties connected with the use of temporary sonicated suspensions as substrate for bacterial phospholipases C.
TI  - Ceftazidime, a pseudomonas-active cephalosporin: in-vitro antimicrobial activity  evaluation including recommendations for disc diffusion susceptibility tests.
AB  - The in-vitro qualities of ceftazidime, as compared to other beta-lactams and three other antimicrobials (amikacin, gentamicin and chloramphenicol), were evaluated in a multilaboratory, multiphasic study in the United States. A total of 12,986 recent clinical isolates were tested by reference dilution methods in six medical centres over 45-60 days. Ceftazidime was superior to the comparison cephalosporin (cefamandole) and comparable in spectrum and activity to gentamicin against Enterobacteriaceae. Of 8038 enteric bacilli tested, over 98% had CTAZ MICs < or = 8 mg/l with a mode of < or = 0.12 mg/l. Only Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter aerogenes had ceftazidime MIC(90S) in the resistant range ( > or =32 mg/l). Staphylococcus aureus strains were less susceptible to ceftazidime (mode MIC 8 mg/l) compared to cefamandole or gentamicin. Ceftazidime was more effective than cefamandole or gentamicin against the beta-haemolytic streptococci and the pneumococcus. More than 90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, most other Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. were inhibited by ceftazidime at concentrations of 8 mg/l. In other comparative studies ceftazidime was found remarkably similar in spectrum to cefotaxime, cefoperazone and moxalactam against the Enterobacteriaceae, staphylococci and Streptococcus spp. Enterobacter cloacae was the only enteric species having ceftazidime MIC90 >8 mg/l. Only cefsulodin (mode MIC 2 mg/l) and cefoperazone (mode MIC 4 mg/l) shared the ceftazidime activity against Ps. aeruginosa. Ceftazidime MIC(50S) for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae (including beta-lactamase producers) were 0.03-0.06 and 0.015 mg/l, respectively. Ceftazidime was found to be bactericidal against most strains at or one doubling dilution above the MIC, and was relatively unaffected by increasing inoculum concentration (some strain variations). It perfused readily into bacterial cells and was effective against the majority of strains resistant to currently available cephalosporins and aminoglycosides. beta-lactamases of Types I-V and Bacillus cereus failed to significantly hydrolyse ceftazidime. Ceftazidime inhibited only Type I Ent. cloacae beta-lactamase hydrolysis. Disc diffusion tests favour the use of a 30 microg ceftazidime disc for the methods described by the National Committee Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Quality control data are presented. Tentative 30 microg disc interpretive criteria, based on susceptible MICs of < or =8 mg/l(> 17 mm) and resistant > or =32 mg/l ( < or =13 mm), resulted in < 1% (false resistance or false susceptible) interpretive error rates. Staph. aureus was the species most commonly found to have strains with indeterminate ceftazidime zones or MICs. We found ceftazidime to possess one of the widest clinically usable antimicrobial spectrum by in-vitro testing of any beta-lactam tested and to be most comparable to broad-spectrum aminoglycosides such as amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin.
TI  - Salt extends the upper temperature limit for growth of food-poisoning bacteria.
AB  - Inclusion of NaCl into the growth medium raised the upper temperature limit of growth of the following organisms: Staphylococcus aureus (two strains), Salmonella senftenberg, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium sporogenes, C. perfringens (two strains). The magnitude of the response varied with the culture, the largest being 3.5 degrees with B. cereus cells. The spores of B. cereus were not protected by salt but clostridial spores behaved as the vegetative cells (response of 2.5 degrees). The optimal salt concentration for the protective effect varied with the organism ranging from 0.2 M for the Gram-negative organisms to 1.0 M for S. aureus.
TI  - Properties of Ro 13-99041 as a substrate and inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
AB  - Ro 13-9904 is a novel semisynthetic and highly active parenteral cephalosporin. Its stability against hydrolysis by several beta-lactamases was studied. The enzymes were isolated from various Enterobacteriaceae or Staphylococcus aureus and several commercially available enzyme preparations were also included. Most of the penicillinases, cephalosporinases or the TEM-type beta-lactamase studied were unable to hydrolyze this novel cephalosporin. The cephalosporinases from Bacillus cereus 569/H9 and Proteus vulgaris 1028, however, were found to readily cleave all new cephalosporins like cefuroxime, cefotaxime and Ro 13-9904, but not cefoxitin. Ro 13-9904 was seen to be a potent inhibitor of several cephalosporinases, but had little or no affinity for penicillinases or the TEM lactamase.
TI  - Microbiology of frozen goat meat and toxin production by Bacillus cereus isolated therefrom.
AB  - Microbial analysis of commercial samples of freshly frozen goat meat and those stored at - 12 degrees C for one week revealed high counts of aerobic bacteria, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococci. These counts increased with storage. Psychrophilic bacteria were higher in number than mesophiles. The counts of Salmonella were zero CFU/g in both freshly frozen and stock frozen meat. No yeast or moulds were encountered. Mouse tests of crude culture filtrate of B. cereus and preparations from meat samples confirmed the production of toxin.

TI  - Antimicrobial activity of street heroin.
AB  - Street heroin and injection paraphernalia have been implicated as sources of bacteria causing infections in drug abusers [1]. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Bacillus cereus are common etiologic agents. In a previous study of the microbiology of street heroin and injection paraphernalia, Bacillus species was the predominant isolate [2]. We did not find S. aureus, but one study reported isolates of identical phage type from heroin powder and from an infected patient [3]. To reconcile the results of our recent investigation among drug abusers with panophthalmitis, we theorized that the drug mixture might have an antibacterial effect. Of the samples of street heroin tested, all except one were bactericidal against S. aureus. The single sample with no heroin content was not bactericidal against one isolate of S. aureus and was the only sample that exhibited some degree of inhibitory and bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa. All samples were bactericidal against the two isolates of B. cereus tested. Quinine exhibited bactericidal activity against S. aureus and B. cereus but was ineffective against P. aeruginosa. Our findings indicate that most samples of street heroin have antibacterial effects against S. aureus and B. cereus but no activity against P. aeruginosa. Such activity may be due to the quinine content of the mixture. The apparent lack of recovery of S. aureus from street heroin may be partially explained by this phenomenon.
TI  - [Lipase and phospholipase from Staphylococcus aureus of different origin. II. Purification and characterization (author's transl)].
AB  - Lipase and phospholipase C from Staphylococcus aureus could be isolated by gel filtration on Sephacryl S 200 (Fig. 1a, b) and completely separated by refiltration under the same conditions. Isoelectric focusing gave maximal enzyme-activities for lipase at pH 8.6 and 9.5 and for phospholipase C at pH 7.4 (Fig. 2). Thin-layer chromatography revealed that the reaction products in lecithin agar of the phospholipase C-preparations from S. aureus and Bacillus cereus were identical (Table 1).

TI  - The mode of action of nanaomycin A in Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The mode of action of nanaomycin A on Gram-positive such as Staphylococcus aureaus, Bacillus cereus and Streptococcus faecalis was investigated. Nanaomycin A inhibited the biosyntheses of protein, DNA, RNA and cell-well peptidoglycan to a similar extent. It increased the oxygenous respiration of S. aureus cells at the minimal inhibitory concentration. The cells preincubated with nanaomycin A showed stimulation of proton influx after addition of N,N'-dicyclo-hexylcazrbodiimide, an inhibitor of Ca++, Mg++-ATPase. Nanaomycin A seems to interfere with the cytoplasmic or to inhibit coupling of oxidative phosphorylation, followed by secondary inhibitory effect on protein, nucleic acids and cell-wall peptidoglycan biosyntheses.

AB  - A transformation system was developed for Bacillus megaterium by using antibiotic resistance plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid molecules derived from Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Lysozyme-generated protoplasts of B. megaterium allowed uptake of plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid in the presence of polyethylene glycol. Transformants expressed the antibiotic resistance determinants present on the plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid, and reisolated plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid yielded restriction endonuclease digestion patterns identical to those of the donor deoxyribonucleic acid.

TI  - Commercial milk products and indigenous weaning foods in a rural West African Environment: a bacteriological perspective.
AB  - Two commercially available baby milks, one 'biologically acidified', the other 'non-acidified', and a traditional weaning food, millet gruel, were prepared and stored under village conditions in West Africa. Increases in total colony count and in number of Bacillus cereus, Clostridium welchii, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were determined in these products when stored as commonly practised at ambient temperatures over a period of 8 h. Poor hygiene during preparation was indicated by readily detectable numbers of coliforms and E. coli in freshly prepared samples of each of the milks, though the cooked local gruel seemed less vulnerable in this respect. The rate of increase in the numbers of these organisms was lower in the acidified milk when prepared with unboiled water containing high numbers of coliforms and E. coli. Increases in total colony count and in numbers of Staph. aureus were also less marked in the acidified milk. When food was not eaten soon after preparation the problem of bacterial overgrowth was as great with the local gruel as with the considerably more nutritious reconstituted milks.
TI  - Phenylpropynal, a specific, irreversible, non-beta-lactam inhibitor of beta-lactamases.
AB  - Phenylpropynal is a specific, irreversible, non-beta-lactam inhibitor of typical  beta-lactamases. In the presence of millimolar concentrations of phenylpropynal, the beta-lactamase I of Bacillus cereus and the beta-lactamases of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli become completely inactivated; the beta-lactamase II of B. cereus is not affected. The E. coli beta-lactamase is considerably more sensitive to the reagent than the gram-positive enzymes. A variety of structural analogs of phenylpropynal are much less effective inhibitors. Bovine alpha-chymotrypsin, bovine carboxypeptidase A, and the D,D-carboxypeptidase/transpeptidase of Streptomyces R-61 were not inactivated by phenylpropynal. The inactivation of the E. coli beta-lactamase can be significantly retarded when the good substrate benzylpenicillin is also present. The development of a characteristic chromophore (lambda max 318 nm) during beta-lactamase inactivation suggests that covalent modification of the enxymes is involved; arginine and/or lysine modification is indicated.

AB  - Breakdown of the covalent complex formed between [14C]penicillin G and higher molecular weight, cephalosporin-sensitive penicillin-binding proteins was studied using mixtures of the purified proteins isolated from membranes of Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. These penicillin-binding proteins were found to release the bound 14C label in a first order process characterized by half-lives of 10 to 300 min at 37 degrees C. Denaturation of the penicilloyl.penicillin-binding proctein complex prevented this release, indicating that the process is enzyme-catalyzed. [14C]Phenylacetylglycine was identified as the major labeled fragmentation product, indicating that these cephalosporin-sensitive penicillin-binding proteins, for which no in vitro transpeptidase or carboxypeptidase activity has been found, catalyze the same fragmentation of the bound penicilloyl moiety previously described for several penicillin-sensitive D-alanine carboxypeptidases.
TI  - Predicted secondary structures of four penicillin beta-lactamases and a comparison with two lysozymes.
AB  - We have predicted the secondary structures of four beta-lactamases (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli R-TEM) by the statistical method of Chou & Fasman as well as by the information theory method of Garnier et al. The secondary structures of all four beta-lactamases are of the alpha/beta type (Levitt & Chothia's nomenclature), with helices at N- and C-termini. There are about eight short regions each of alpha-helical (30--50%) and beta-strand (10--20%) structure separated by about 20 reverse turns. The conformation of the Gram-positive and Gram-negative beta-lactamases are generally similar although a few differences are predicted between the S.aureus and E.coli structures. Surprisingly, the two bacilli structures differ significantly in three short regions. In all four enzymes the region near the catalytically-implicated tyrosine has similar secondary structure. The secondary structure of hen egg white lysozyme, a penicillin-binding enzyme, as well as T4 phage lysozyme, has similarities to the N-terminal half of the penicillin-destroying beta-lactamases.
TI  - Septicemia in children with cancer.
AB  - Because of the persistently high mortality from sepsis in cancer patients, a retrospective study was designed to identify the causative organisms and to determine the factors affecting the outcome of sepsis. A total of 84 episodes of septicemia in 61 children with cancer were studied. The more frequently isolated organisms were: Staphylococcus aureus (21.4%); Escherichia coli (18%); Klebsiella (7.1%); Pseudomonas (6%); and Bacteroides fragilis (6%). Other isolates included Proteus, Serratia, Acinetobacter, hemolytic Streptococcus, and Bacillus cereus. In 10.7% of septic episodes, mixed bacterial infections were documented. Twenty-four (28.6%) resulted in death; in 13 (54%) death occurred within 24 hours after admission. The fatality rate was high in cases associated with absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte counts of less than 100/cu mm, in neoplastic relapse, and when infection with gram-negative, anaerobic and mixed bacterial flora occurred.
TI  - [Microfloral study of bull seminal fluid stored at low temperatures].
AB  - Hundred twenty three samples of bull semen fluid frozen at 196 degrees C including 83 plastic ampules, 20 granules and 20 plastic straws obtained from the containers of the insemination stations of 10 farms from the Sofia district were investigated. Two hundred twelve strains were isolated and identified as: Escherichia coli--25 strains, Hafnia--16 strains, Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Proteus mirabilis--9 strains of each. The remaining Gram-negative genera and species were more rarely encountered. Gram positive bacteria: Micrococcus--19 strains, Staphylococcus aureus--17 strains, Staph. epidermidis--15 strains, Bacillus cereus--15 strains, B. subtilis--12 strains. Other representatives of Gram-positive bacteria were also found but in lower percentages. Least bacteria were observed in semen fluid frozen in plastic straws and most--in plastic ampules which were mainly used until recently for cow insemination. It was established that the same bacteria isolated by other authors from fresh sperm were encountered in semen fluid stored at minus temperatures. The conclusion is made that semen fluid stored at low temperature is contaminated with bacteria. It is only natural that these bacteria are introduced in cow genitals by insemination.
TI  - Infant foods as a potential source of diarrhoeal illness in rural West Africa.
AB  - It is common practice in rural areas of The Gambia to prepare infant foods in quantities which are sufficient to meet the needs of the day rather than one meal. These are then stored at ambient temperatures for periods up to 12 hours for feeding to the child on demand. The total viable counts and levels of Bacillus cereus, Clostridium welchii, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were determined in 294 infant foods samples from nought to eight hours after preparation. The presence of Salmonella was determined in 10 g samples of food. In the first hour after preparation the proportion of foods dangerously contaminated was high during the rainsy season, significantly more so than during the dry season. Foods not consumed fresh were very often hazardous and almost always so after 8 hours. This problem may be a causal factor in weanling diarrhoea which also shows marked seasonal variation in prevalence.
TI  - Anti-riboflavin activity of 8-O-alkyl derivatives of riboflavin in some Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Two new 8-O-alkyl derivatives of riboflavin (RF), i.e., 8-methoxy- (MOF), and 8-ethoxy-8-demethyl-D-riboflavin (EOF), their tetraacetate, and the tetraacetate of 8-hydroxy-8-demethyl-D-riboflavin (HOF) were synthesized. The anti-RF activity of MOF, EOF and HOF was estimated from the ratio CR/CI, where CI is the concentration of test flavin added to the culture medium and CR is the minimum concentration of RF needed to restore the growth inhibition. Their activity was also compared with that of roseoflavin (RoF). The decreasing order of anti-RF activity was as follows: MOF greater than RoF greater than EOF in Sarcina lutea: RoF greater than MOF greater than EOF in Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. HOF showed no activity in any of the bacteria tested. The redox potential of these compounds decreases as follows: RF greater than RoF greater than EOF greater than MOF greater than HOF, and the RF activity of MOF and EOF could be explained by the redox potential difference between these compounds and RF.

TI  - Accessibility of phospholipids in the chromaffin granule membrane.
AB  - 1. The accessibility of phospholipids in the membrane of the adrenomedullary storage vesicles (chromaffin granules) has been studied. 2. The reaction of 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid with both intact granules and their ghosts, results in the labelling of 70% of the phosphatidylethanolamine. 3. The action of phospholipase A2 (from bee venom), phospholipase C (from Bacillus cereus) and sphingomyelinase C (from Staphylococcus aureus) on granules and their ghosts was followed as a function of time. No significant difference was observed between the intact granules and their ghosts. 4. In the intact granules the various treatments led to varying amounts of lysis although again no evidence was obtained that such lysis in any way increased the amount of accessible phospholipid. 5. Highly purified granule preparations were also compared with the so-called "large granule" fraction and no significant differences were detected. 6. Approx. 67% of phosphatidylethanolamine + phosphatidic acid, 50% of phosphatidylserine + phosphatidylinositol, 65% of phosphatidylcholine and 20% of sphingomyelin is accessible to enzymatic degradation. In total, approx. 50% of all the phospholipids reacted. 7. It is also shown that, unlike in enzymatic treatment, all the phosphatidylcholine can be exchanged in the presence of a phospholipid exchange protein (prepared from beef liver). 8. It is concluded that transmembrane movement of phosphatidylcholine is slow in isolated membranes of chromaffin granules. The presence of the exchange protein, however, in conjunction with membrane proteins and specific phospholipid arrangements may catalyse this transmembrane movement.
TI  - [Method of determining the antimicrobial activity of alcohol extracts of propolis].
AB  - It is proposed to determine the antimicrobial activity of propolys alcohol extracts by the method of subsequent dilutions in solid nutrient media. Dilution of the extracts immediately in hot agar eliminated the inhibiting effect of the extragent on the microbial growth. Opalesence appearing in the agar did not prevent estimation of the results in contrast to the method of subsequent dilutions in liquid nutrient media.
TI  - Effect of pH on the antimicrobial activity of some triphenylmethane dyes.
AB  - Four common dyes were tested as inhibitors of four types of bacteria over the pH  range 5.0-9.0. Inhibition of the gram-negative types, Salmonella anatum and Enterobacter aerogenes, was markedly affected by the pH of the medium. These organisms tolerated concentrations of crystal violet and ethyl violet about 100-fold higher at pH 5.0 than at pH 9.0. Above pH 7.0 brilliant green (BG) and malachite green (MG) were precipitated as their respective carbinols and lost their inhibitory properties with these two organisms. Two gram-positive types, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus, were more sensitive to dyes and results were less affected by pH. The carbinol forms of MG and BG were nearly as inhibitory to these organisms as the ionized forms.
TI  - Phosphatidylinositol as the endogenous activator of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase in microsomes of rabbit kidney.
AB  - Incubation of rabbit kidney microsomes with pig pancreatic phospholipase A2 produced residual membrane preparations with very low (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity. The activity could be restored by recombination with lipid vesicles of negatively-charged glycerophospholipids. Vesicles of pure phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine were virtually inactive in this respect, but could reactivate in the presence of cholate. Incubation of the microsomes with a combination of phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus) and spingomyelinase C (Staphylococcus aureus) resulted in 90--95% release of the phospholipids. The residual membrane contained only phosphatidylinositol and still showed 50--100% of the (Na+ + K+)-ATPase activity.

TI  - Anti-riboflavin activity of 8N-alkyl analogues of roseoflavin in some Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Three new 8N-alkyl analogues of roseoflavin (MM), i.e., 8-ethylamino- (EH), 8-methylethylamino- (ME), 8-diethylamino-8-demethyl-D-riboflavin (EE), their tetraacetates, and 8-amino-8-demethyl-D-riboflavin (HH) tetraacetate, were synthesized. A relation between the anti-riboflavin activity and the chemical structure of 8N-alkyl analogues (8N-methyl, ethyl) was studied by a restoration by riboflavin (RF) of inhibitory effect of the analogues on a growth of Gram-positive bacteria, i.e., Sarcina lutea, Bacillus cereus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The inhibitory effect of most of the analogues was restored by RF. But in some cases, i.e., 8-methylamino-8-demethyl-D-riboflavin (MH) in Sar. lutea and MM in Staph. aureus, the effect was not completely restored. Apparently, the inhibition in early phase of growth was restored, but the maximum growth was still suppressed. The non-alkylated amino analogue (HH) showed only unrestorable suppression of maximum growth in Sar. lutea. Of restorable effect by RF of N-alkyl analogues, approximate decreasing orders of anti-RF activity were as follows. Dialkylated analogue greater than monoalkylated. HH showed insignificant anti-RF activity. In each group, methylated analogue greater than ethylated. In B. cereus monoalkylated analogues, and in Staph. aureus monoalkylated and EE showed no significant inhibitory effect. Redox potentials of the N-alkyl analogues were measured, and a definite relation between the chemical structure and the potential was found (RF = EE greater than ME greater than MM greater than HH greater than EH greater than MH). But the anti-RF activity of the analogues was not completely explained by the difference of the redox potential from RF.

TI  - An investigation of the bacteriological quality of retail vanilla slices.
AB  - One hundred and thiry-three vanilla slices, purchased from shops in the West Yorkshire Metropolitan County, were examined to determine the numbers and types of bacteria present at the time of purchase. The surface colony count at 37 degrees C was greater than 10(3)/g in 67/133 (50%) of the samples examined, Bacillus cereus being found at that concentration in 21.8%, coliform bacilli including E. coli in 5.3%, Staphylococcus aureus in 3-0% and Streptococcus faecalis in 0-8%. Thirty-four strains of B. cereus were serotyped and 11 (32%) of these were typable with the sera available. Preparation of custard mixed in the laboratory suggests that the milk or milk powder used in the mix may be the major source of B. cereus in the final product. Many of the present methods of manufacture, distribution and storage allow organisms present in the custard at manufacture the opportunity to multiply and possibly reach numbers which present a risk of food poisoning.

AB  - Antibody in sera from pigs carrying an abscess associated with Corynebacterium pyogenes and healthy pigs was examined by the agar gel diffusion test. In the test, the concentrated culture fluid containing the protease of C. pyogenes was used as antigen. As a result, precipitating antibody was demonstrated in sera from 25 of 30 abscessed pigs and a few of the healthy pigs. When the relationship between precipitating antibody and protease was examined by the immunoelectrophoresis and gel filtration of the concentrated culture fluid, the antibody was shown in the same position as the protease. From the result, it was clear that the precipitating antibody was against the protease of C. pyogenes. All the proteases produced by 27 strains of C. pyogenes of porcine and bovine origin were serologically identical with one another. They were, however, serologically different from those of Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and B. subtilis. In the inhibition test, the proteolytic activity of C. pyogenes was inhibited by the serum of the abscessed pig. It was also inhibited by healthy pig serum. From the results, it seems that the determination of precipitating antibody may be useful for the diagnosis of C. pyogenes infection.
TI  - [Microbial resistance to formaldehyde. I. Comparative quantitative studies in some selected species of vegetative bacteria, bacterial spores, fungi, bacteriophages and viruses].
AB  - The resistence of different microorganisms to formaldehyde was determined. As test objects served gram-negative and gram-positive vegetative germs (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi-B, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis), bacterial spores (Bacillus cereus, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophilus, Bacillus subtilis), fungi (Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans), bacteriophages (Escherichia coli phages, T1, T2, T3), and viruses (adenovirus, poliomyelitis virus, vaccinia virus). For the studies, suspensions of germs were exposed at identical temperature (20 degrees C) and pH (7.0). The microbicidal effect of formaldehyde was measured by the decrease of the proportion of germs capable of multiplication in the suspension (lg (N/N0); where: N0 equals initial number of germs capable of multiplication; N equals number of germs capable of multiplication after exposure to formaldehyde). For all germs the dependence of the microbicidal effect on the concentration of formaldehyde was determined. In all experiments, the duration of exposure was two hours. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Salmonella paratyphi-B were found to be more susceptible than Staphylococcus aureus (vf. Fig. 1 A). The strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa used were widely varying as to their susceptibility. To obtain equal microbicidal effects, concentrations of formaldehyde almost three times as high had to be used for the most resistant strain than were necessary for the most susceptible strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. All strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae examined were found to have an identical resistence to formaldehyde. Streptococcus faecalis was even more resistant to formaldehyde than Staphylococcus aureus. In the case of Streptococcus faecalis, a concentration of formaldehyde about three times as high had to be used to obtain microbicidal effects of identical magnitude. For the killing of Candida albicans cells concentrations of formaldehyde not higher than those needed for the killing of vegetative gram-negative bacteria were necessary. The conidia of Aspergillus niger were found to be more resistant than the cells of Candida albicans but did not require any higher concentrations than for the killing of Staphylococcus aureus (see Fig. 1 B). In the case of bacterial spores, a special phenomenon was observed. If the spores had been exposed to a temperature of 80 and 95 degrees C, respectively (depending on the species involved) for one or two hours following exposure to formaldehyde, a considerably higher number of spores was found to be capable of germination and colony formation than without such treatment (heat activation: cf. Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). The spores of Bacillus cereus had only a relatively low resistance to formaldehyde. To reduce the proportion of the spores capable of colony formation to 1/10000, a 2.9% formaldehyde concentration was necessary without heat activation and one of 10.8% with heat activation...
TI  - The effect of phospholipase C on DNA synthesis, morphology and phospholipid content of isolated HeLa cell nuclei.
AB  - Isolated HeLa cell nuclei have been treated with purified phospholipase C (Bacillus cereus) and sphingomyelinase (Staphylococcus aureus). The phospholipids of untreated nuclei consisted of about 67% phosphatidylcholine, 23% phosphatidylethanolamine, 7% sphingomyelin, 2% phosphatidylserine and 1% phosphatidylinositol. Phospholipase C degraded 80-90% of the total phospholipids of the nuclei. Such nuclei seemed ultrastructurally intact, and had an average diameter and a protein loss during incubation which were not significantly different from those of controls. Their rate of DNA synthesis was only slightly reduced after treatment with phospholipase C alone and slightly more reduced when phospholipase C was used in combination with sphingomyelinase. This suggests that the polar head-groups of the nuclear phospholipids are of very limited importance in DNA synthesis. Since it has been reported that phospholipase C treatment releases nascent DNA from a membrane complex, the absence of a concommitant reduction in DNA synthesis may suggest that this complex is not necessary for the replication of DNA. Phospholipase C did not significantly influence the stability of the DNA product and gave only a slight inhibition of cytosol and nuclear DNA polymerases when tested with exogenous template.
TI  - [The effects of weak magnetic fields on bacteria].
AB  - A stationary device was constructed for conducting experiments in a weak magnetic field. A ferromagnetic screen was used to produce in the working volume a magnetic-field of 26 nT. The effect of a weak magnetic field on the following bacteria was studied: E. coli communior, B. prodigiosum, Staphylococcus aureus 209, and Bac. anthracoides. Cultivation of the bacteria in these conditions for a long time resulted in changes of their tinctorial, morphological, cultural, and biochemical properties.
TI  - Rational choice of penicillins and cephalosporins based on parallel in-vitro and  in-vivo tests.
AB  - Because of the unavailability of strictly comparable data, seven representative penicillins and the five cephalosporins currently used in Britain were evaluated in parallel, both in vitro and in vivo. Penicillin sensitive and resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis were the main test organisms. Minimum bacteriocidal concentrations of cloxacillin, flucloxacillin, cephalothin, and cephazolin in serum were much higher than conventional minimum inhibitory concentrations in the absence of serum. Cephalexin and cephradine showed the smallest divergence in these values. Staph, aureus beta-lactamase caused least damage to methicillin and cephradine, whereas enzymes from Escherichia, Klebsiella, and Bacillus cereus had least effect against cephradine followed by cephalexin. In mouse protection experiments, highly protein-bound antibiotics had relatively low efficacy. Cephradine had the highest mean activity followed closely by cephaloridine and cephalexin. From the data, cephradine was the cephalosporin of choice, and firm decisions were also made about the choice of penicillins.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of foodborne diseases.
AB  - Many bacterial species are responsible for sporadic cases and outbreaks of foodborne intoxication and infection. The foodborne diseases are classified on the basis of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved into four categories: performed toxin, enterotoxin formed in the colonized small intestine, mucosal invasion (enterocolitis) and mucosal invasion with bacteremia. Invasive and toxigenic strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli are discussed. In vivo test systems for the identification of enterotoxigenic organisms and tissue culture assays for the heat-labile enterotoxin of E. coli are described. Current laboratory methods for the diagnosis of foodborne diseases of major public health interest are reviewed - botulism, staphylococcal intoxication, Clostridium perfringens enteritis, salmonellosis, enteropathogenic E. coli infection, Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection and Bacillus cereus enteritis. The role of the laboratory in the epidemiologic surveillance and investigation of foodborne diseases is emphasized.

TI  - Quantitative structure-activity relationships. 2. A mixed approach, based on Hansch and Free-Wilson Analysis.
AB  - Based on the theoretical and numerical equivalence of Hansch's linear multiple regression model and the modified Free-Wilson model a mixed approach is developed. The mixed approach is a combination of both models which makes use of the advantages of each model and widens the applicability of Hansch and Free-Wilson analysis. The Free-Wilson approach now is applicable also in the case of parabolic dependence of biological activity on a particular physical property, e.g., log P or pi. A rational explanation is given for the use of dummy variables in Hansch equations and the derivation of Hansch correlations for de novo group contributions obtained from Free-Wilson analysis. Some examples illustrate the mixed approach and demonstrate its usefulness to establish biologically meaningful structure-activity relationships.
TI  - Modified assay medium for the turbidimetric assay of chlortetracycline in feeds.
AB  - In previous experiments, the turbidimetric method for determining chlortetracycline-HCI (CTC-HCI) in feeds showed lower recovery than the AOAC plate method. Although the addition of vitamins to the turbidimetric medium improved results, values by the turbidimetric method remained about 10% lower than by the plate method. A modified (1.7X the weight recommended by the manufacturer) turbidimetric assay medium decreased assay sensitivity but did not significantly change the slope of S. aureus response to CTC-HCI. There was no evidence that vitamin fortification of the modified medium had any significant effect on the growth rate of test organism. Examination of about 100 samples of commercial feeds containing CTC-HCI showed excellent agreement in results between the turbidimetric and plate methods.

AB  - Scanning electron-microscopic studies of phagocytosis of various micro organisms  by murine peritoneal macrophages has been made. Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Brewer's yeast were easily ingested, whereas Cryptococcus neoformans was not. The development of intricate and tenuous filopodia preceded close-surface attachment, after which both thin and thicker lamellipodia invested the micro-organisms. Loss of the normal surface ridges characterised the replete cell. The technique of scanning electron microscopy is easily reproducible and adds a new parameter to the morphological appreciation of a fundamental biological phenomenon.
TI  - [Bacterial flora of the conjunctival sac of the horse].
AB  - The AA. report the results of taxonomic research conducted on the conjunctival sac of 59 horses for identification of the present bacterial flora. In the controlled animals, it was observed, at the level of the considered niche, a community constituted of normal bacterial populations, but not autochtonous in the significance they attributed from DUBOS et al., relative to the characterization of the indigenous microbiota of the intestine. The isolated normal bacterial flora seems to be constituted of: Micrococcus (subgroup 6 of Baird-Parker, M. luteus, Micrococcus spp.) isolated in 49,15% of the samples; Staphylococcus aureus and St. epidermidis (18,64%); Moraxella osloensis, M. phenylpiruvica, M. equi and Moraxella spp. (11,86%); Bacillus cereus (11,86%); Neisseria catarrhalis (8,47%); Streptococcus equi and Str. zooepidemicus (6,77%); Corynebacterium spp. (6,77%) and Acinetobacter lwoffi (5,08%). The AA. have found, besides, a particular group of bacteria of uncertain classification, attributed to the coryneforms and found in 30,50% of the examined horses. So-called transient bacteria taxa have been considered are Streptomyces spp., isolated in the 10,16% of the controlled subjects, Aerococcus viridans and Bacillus spp. found in only one equine.
TI  - Bacillus cereus food poisoning.
AB  
TI  - Phospholipase D activity of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - A phospholipase hydrolyzing cardiolipin to phosphatidic acid and phosphatidyl glycerol was characterized in gram-negative bacteria but was absent in preparations of gram-positive bacteria, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and rat liver mitochondria. In cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus vulgaris, and Pseudomonase aeruginosa, this cardiolipin-hydrolyzing enzyme had similar pH and Mg2+ requirements and displayed a specificity which excluded phosphatidyl glycerol and phosphatidyl ethanolamine as substrates.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity and presence of mercury in 12 species of marine algae].
AB  
TI  - Comparison of methods for extraction of bacterial adenine nucleotides determined  by firefly assay.
AB  - Adenine nucleotides in Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Klebsiella pneumoniae,  Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were extracted using 10 different methods. Extracts were assayed for adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP), adenosine 5'-diphosphate (ADP), and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) by the firefly method using an improved procedure. Analytical interference by bacterial enzymes not inactivated during the extraction was found to be a major problem. However, these enzymes were inactivated to a considerable extent by the inclusion of ethylenediaminetetraacetate in the extraction reagent. The 10 extraction methods were compared with respect to yield of adenine nucleotides, interference with the enzymic assay, reproducibility of the method, and stability of the extracts. Results indicated that extraction with trichloroacetic acid was the method most closely reflecting actual levels of ATP, ADP and AMP in intact bacterial cells. However, for the extraction of ATP in some bacterial strains several other methods may be used and may be advantageous from a practical point of view.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of a lysozyme-like enzyme from staphylococci].
AB  - A lysozyme-like enzyme isolated from the culture broth of Staph. aureus 712 presented in its native state a lipoproteid complex. The lytic and antibacterial spectrum of the enzyme was similar to that of the egg albumin enzyme. However, the lipoproteid complex was somewhat superior to the egg albumin complex in its activity against Micrococcus lysodeikticus, a number of gramnegative bacteria and staphylococci. Out of the organisms studied Microccus lysodeikticus, Sarcina and Bac. subtilis proved to be most sensitive to the both enzymes. Comparison of the amount of the enzyme formed in the culture medium with its minimum inhibitory concentration with respect to most of the microbes tested provided a supposition that the lipoproteid enzyme did not play a significant role in the process of the microbial antagonism.
TI  - Relation between various phospholipase actions on human red cell membranes and the interfacial phospholipid pressure in monolayers.
AB  - The action of purified phospholipases on monomolecular films of various interfacial pressures is compared with the action on erythrocyte membranes. The phospholipases which cannot hyorolyse phospholipids of the intact erythrocyte membrane, phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus, phospholipase A2 from pig pancreas and Crotalus adamanteus and phospholipase D from cabbage, can hydrolyse phospholipid monolayers at pressure below 31 dynes/cm only. The phospholipases which can hydrolyse phospholipids of the intact erythrocyte membrane, phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii phospholipase A2 from Naja naja and bee venom and sphingomyelinase from Staphylococcus aureus, can hydrolyse phospholipid monolayers at pressure above 31 dynes/cm. It is concluded that the lipid packing in the outer monolayer of the erythrocyte membrane is comparable with a lateral surface pressure between 31 and 34.8 dynes/cm.
TI  - Organization of phospholipids in human red cell membranes as detected by the action of various purified phospholipases.
AB  - 1. The action of eight purified phospholipases on intact human erythrocytes has been investigated. Four enzymes, e.g. phospholipases A2 from pancreas and Crotalus adamanteus, phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus, and phospholipase D from cabbage produce neither haemolysis nor hydrolysis of phospholipids in intact cells. On the other hand, both phospholipases A2 from bee venom and Naja naja cause a non-haemolytic breakdown of more than 50% of the lecithin, while sphingomyelinase C from Staphylococcus aureus is able to produce a non-lytic degradation of more than 80% of the sphingomyelin. 2. Phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii appeared to be the only lipolytic enzyme tested, which produces haemolysis of human erythrocytes. Evidence is presented that the unique properties of the enzyme itself, rather than possible contaminations in the purified preparation, are responsible for the observed haemolytic effect. 3. With non-sealed ghosts, all phospholipases produce essentially complete breakdown of those phospholipids which can be considered as proper substrates for the enzymes involved. 4. Due to its absolute requirement for Ca2+, pancreatic phospholipase A2 can be trapped inside resealed ghosts in the presence of EDTA, without producing phospholipid breakdown during the resealing procedure. Subsequent addition of Ca2+ stimulates phospholipase A2 activity at the inside of the resealed cell, eventually leading to lysis. Before lysis occurs, however, 25% of the lecithin, half of the phosphatidylethanolamine and some 65% of the phosphatidylserine can be hydrolysed. This observation is explained in relation to an asymmetric phospholipid distribution in red cell membranes.
TI  - The partial amino acid sequence of the extracellular beta-lactamase I of Bacillus cereus 569/H.
AB  - The chemical structure of the extracellular beta-lactamase I of Bacillus cereus 569/H was investigated. Three electrophoretically homogenous charge variants of this enzyme were isolated and amino acid analysis of each revealed no significant differences. However, a degree of N-terminal heterogeneity was found by direct end-group modification of the protein and also on alignment of peptides from tryptic and chymotryptic digestion. The N-terminal heterogeneity observed was great enough to explain the production of the beta-lactamase I isoenzymes which are probably produced by postsynthesis modification of a single gene product. Over 80% of the amino acid sequence of beta-lactamase I was determined by the detailed analysis of peptides derived from tryptic, chymotryptic and thermolytic digests. Five polypeptide fragments were constructed from these data and aligned by comparison with the known amino acid sequences of the penicillinases produced by Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus aureus (Ambler & Meadway, 1969). About 60% of the proposed sequence was identical with that of B. licheniformis penicillinase, whereas the S. aureus enzyme had only about 40% of its residues in common with beta-lactamase I. These results are discussed with reference to the possible evolutionary relationships existing between known beta-lactamases. Detailed evidence for the amino acid sequence proposed has been deposited as Supplementary Publication SUP 50044 (27 pages) at the British Library (Lending Division), Boston Spa, Wetherby, W. Yorks. LS23 7BQ, U.K., from whom copies can be obtained on the terms indicated in Biochem. J. (1975), 145, 5.
TI  - Effects of cadmium on the growth and uptake of cadmium by microorganisms.
AB  - Six species of microorganisms, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis and Actinomyces niger, were grown under suitable conditions in appropriate media. Cadmium chloride was added to provide 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 mug of Cd per ml. At 40 and 80 mug of Cd per ml, E. coli and B. cereus grew well and the other species were repressed. Cd uptake patterns differed significantly among the species tested. The significance of these data with respect to Cd in food chains is discussed.
TI  - Degradation of phospholipid and release of diglyceride-rich membrane vesicles during protoplast formation in certain gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Membrane phospholipid was found to be hydrolyzed presumably by an intracellular phospholipase C, and diglyceride-rich membrane vesicles were released from the cells during protoplast formation in Bacillus cereus Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus lysodeikticus, and Staphylococcus aureus. The released membranes consisted mainly of small vesicles of 50 to 100 nm in diameter. They have a lower density than that of protoplast membranes in all the bacteria tested in the present study.
TI  - Determination of bacterial cell concentrations by electrical measurements.
AB  - An instrument was developed to measure the concentration of bacterial suspensions by their electrical characteristics. It employed a square-wave signal generator, a tetra-polar electrode probe, and a voltage detector in the form of an oscilloscope. When electrical measurements were made on washed bacteria obtained from cultures or urine specimens, there was a direct relationship between the concentration of the cells and the electrical characteristics of the system as reflected by voltage changes. As little as 10(3) organisms per ml could be detected. The resolution between readings taken on samples containing 10(3) to 10(9) cells per ml was found to be a function of the input frequency. The maximal resolution between concentration readings was obtained at a input frequency of 10 Hz. Thus, with relatively simple instrumentation, bacterial concentrations could be determined within a few minutes. This technique, therefore, eliminates the more lengthy laboratory procedures as plate counts or the accumulation of measurable metabolic changes (such as the utilization of radioactive or other substrates). This method can efficiently monitor clinical urine specimens when a bacteriuria is suspected.
TI  - Screening and isolation of penicillinase inhibitor, KA-107.
AB  - It is known that penicillin resistance of bacteria is mainly caused by the inactivation of penicillin by penicillinase derived from such strains. We have developed a screening procedure for penicillinase inhibitors. Several microorganisms were found to produce such inhibitors, and from the culture filtrate of Streptomyces gedanensis ATCC 4880 a penicillinase inhibitor, named KA-107, was isolated. The characteristics of this inhibitor were revealed by an in vitro test by using penicillinase derived from penicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, FS-1277. When KA-107 was used in combination with penicillin-G, ampicillin, d- or l-phenethicillin, the growth inhibitory activity of these penicillins was maintained.
TI  - The relative susceptibility of four cephalosporins to a beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus.
AB  - The effects of purified beta-lactamase from Bacillus cereus on the activity of four cephalosporins are described. Drug inactivation was measured spectrophotometrically and confirmed by microbiological assay and by microbiological techniques involving determinations of minimum inhibitory concentrations and growth curves of Staphylococcus aureus NCTC 6571 (Oxford) in broth containing drug +/- enzyme. Cephaloridine was the most sensitive of the four cephalosporins, followed by cephalothin and the sodium salt of 7-cyanacetamidocephalosporanic acid, with cephalexin considerably resistant to inactivation. The possible use of this beta-lactamase in the sterility testing of cephaloridine and cephalothin is examined.
TI  - Occurrence of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in cell wall peptidoglycan from bacilli as a factor responsible for resistance to lysozyme.
AB  - Analysis by dinitrophenylation techniques revealed the occurrence of significant  amounts of glucosamine residues with free amino groups in the peptidoglycan component of cell walls isolated from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus megaterium. A close correlation was demonstrated between the content of N-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component and the resistance of the cell walls to lysozyme. These lysozyme-resistant cell walls and peptidoglycan were converted into a lysozyme-sensitive form by means of N-acetylation with acetic anhydride. Thus, the occurrence of the N-unacetylated glucosamine residues in the peptidoglycan component accounts for the resistance of these cell walls to lysozyme. The N-unacetylated glucosamine residues were not found in a significant amount in the cell walls of Micrococcus lysodeikticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, or Lactobacillus arabinosus.
TI  - Multiple penicillin-binding components in Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli.
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of natural phenols and related compounds: obtusastyrene  and dihydro-obtusastyrene.
AB  - Factors influencing the antimicrobial properties of obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were studied. Both of these compounds were soluble in acetone, alcohol, and olive oil. In water, they were soluble at concentrations of 34 and 53 mug/ml, respectively. The minimal inhibitory concentrations against gram-positive bacteria and yeast were below 100 mug/ml. The compounds were not effective against gram-negative bacteria at 200 mug/ml or lower concentrations. With initial populations of cells greater than 10(6)/ml, the concentrations of these compounds required to prevent growth were greater than with lower cell populations. Changing the pH of the growth medium did not decrease the effectiveness of these two compounds in the pH range of 3 through 8. Both obtusastyrene and dihydro-obtusastyrene were rapidly bactericidal to Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus at 25 mug/ml.
TI  - In vivo and in vitro action of new antibiotics interfering with the utilization of N-acetyl-glucosamine-N-acetyl-muramyl-pentapeptide.
AB  - Recent literature on the antibiotics enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 RP suggested an interaction with murein synthesis. Incubation of sensitive strains from Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus in a "wall medium" containing labeled l-alanine showed that all four antibiotics inhibited the incorporation of alanine into murein and gave rise to accumulation of radioactive uridine diphosphate-N-acetyl-muramyl (UDP-MurNAc)-pentapeptide. Peptidoglycan was synthesized when the particulate enzyme of B. stearothermophilus was incubated with the murein precursors UDP-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide. The newly formed polymer was less accessible for lysozyme and more strongly bound to the acceptor than the same product from the Escherichia coli particulate enzyme. After incubation in the presence of penicillin, a greater part of the peptidoglycan was lysozyme sensitive and more loosely bound to the acceptor. The antibiotics enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 RP inhibited peptidoglycan synthesis by the B. stearothermophilus particulate enzyme. The rate of synthesis of GlcNAc-MurNAc(-pentapeptide)-P-P-phospholipid was independent from the addition of these antibiotics, but its utilization was strongly inhibited. With the present results, it is not possible to distinguish the mechanisms of action of enduracidin, moenomycin, prasinomycin, and 11.837 RP from the mechanisms of action of vancomycin and ristocetin.
TI  - Effect of ultraviolet on the survival of bacteria airborne in simulated Martian dust clouds.
AB  - A chamber was constructed to create simulated Martian dust storms and thereby study the survival of airborne micro-organisms while exposed to the rigors of the Martian environment, including ultraviolet irradiation. Representative types of sporeforming and non-sporeforming bacteria present in spacecraft assembly areas and indigenous to humans were studied. It was found that daily ultraviolet irradiation of 2 to 9 X 10(7) erg cm-2 was not sufficient to sterilize the dust clouds. The soil particles protected the organisms from ultraviolet irradiation since the numbers of survivors from irradiated environments were similar to those from unirradiated environments. Pending further data of the Martian environment, the contamination and dissemination of Mars with terrestrial micro-organisms is still a distinct possibility.
TI  - Differential light scattering: a physical method for identifying living bacterial cells.
AB  - Differential light scattering techniques appear to represent an attractive physical method for the rapid identification of various microorganisms. Certain general results of inverse scattering theory suggest strongly that characteristic of each distinct microorganism that scatters light is an essentially unique scattering pattern, i.e., unique differential scattered intensity and polarization. Although a mathematically rigorous inversion procedure seems impractical at this time, the use of detailed differential scattered intensity data as an identification fingerprint shows considerable. promise. Published measurements on nonbiological scatterers confirm this possibility. A variety of calculations are presented that contrast the expected scattering characteristics of certain microorganisms such as Bacillus subtilis, B. anthracis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Escherichia coli, and the spores of B. mcgaterium and B. cereus. Experimental and instrumentation difficulties and possible procedures are discussed. A review and laboration of some applicable features of Rayleigh-Gans scattering are included as an appendix.
TI  - [Study on serum and urine concentrations of erythromycin succinate of pyrrolidine-methyl-tetracycline].
AB  - The serum and urine antibiotic levels in a group of 25 patients were determined after a single administration of a new antibiotic salt: erythromycin succinate of pyrrolidine-methyl-tetracycline. Some subjects were treated orally and other intramuscularly. The results obtained showed that this drug gives, both orally and intramuscularly, efficient serum and urine concentrations of tetracycline and erythromycin.
TI  - Use of the scanning electron microscope for viewing bacteria in soil.
AB  - Scanning electron microscopy was used for viewing Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus in three different soils. Both organisms were detected in the test soils at an approximate concentration of 10(7) cells per gram of soil; theoretically, the minimal number of microorganisms required for detection with the scanning electron microscope technique was between 10(7) and 10(10) cells per gram of soil. Because the concentration of cells was critical, the use of scanning electron microscopy as an extraterrestrial life detection instrument would be limited with soils containing more than 10(7) bacteria per gram of soil.
TI  - Rapid and sensitive detection of bacteria by gas chromatography.
AB  - A gas chromatograph fitted with electron capture and flame ionization detectors was employed for the rapid detection of bacteria by analysis for their metabolic products. The presence of Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis, S. liquefaciens, Escherichia coli B, Bacillus cereus, and B. popilliae was detected in 2 to 4 hr in media inoculated with less than 10(4) cells per ml, whereas a 7- to 12-hr growth period was required for the detection of products formed in cultures of Serratia marcescens, Aerobacter aerogenes, E. coli K-12, Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella typhimurium. Metabolites elaborated by the equivalent of less than a single cell of B. cereus, S. faecalis, P. vulgaris, or E. coli B were sensed by the electron capture detector. The flame ionization detector was generally not as sensitive. Volatile metabolites were identified, and their concentrations were determined.
TI  - Tracer studies to locate the site of platinum ions within filamentous and inhibited cells of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The distribution of platinum ions within Escherichia coli after the induction of  filaments with cis-Pt(NH(3))(2)Cl(4), and after growth inhibition by PtCl(6) (2-), has been determined with radioactive metal compounds ((191)Pt, with a half-life of approximately 3 days) by the simple chemical procedure of Roberts et al. In the filamentous cells, the platinum metal is associated with metabolic intermediates, nucleic acids, and cytoplasmic proteins; whereas, in inhibited cells, the platinum is combined only with the cytoplasmic protein. Similar experiments with gram-positive cells of Bacillus cereus and Staphyloccus aureus, which show no filamentous growth in the presence of cis-Pt(NH(3))(2)Cl(4), reveal that the metal complex does penetrate the cell wall and subsequently becomes bound predominantly by metabolic intermediates.
TI  - [Regularities of the induction of enzyme synthesis by penicillin age-producing cultures of Staph. aureus, Bac. cereus 569, Bac. subtilis].
AB  
TI  - Influence of food microorganisms on staphylococcal growth and enterotoxin production in meat.
AB  - Forty-four microorganisms were studied for their influence on staphylococcal growth and enterotoxin production. Inhibition was found to be more common than stimulation. Two types of inhibition were observed: inhibition of staphylococcal growth, and inhibition of enterotoxin formation with no apparent effect on growth. By use of a plate test, 12 of the 44 food microorganisms were found to inhibit staphylococcal growth at 35 C. Of the 12, 3 also inhibited growth at 25 C. No significant differences in inhibition were observed with the 15 strains of enterotoxigenic staphylococci. In meat slurries, inhibition of staphylococcal growth was found to be greater at 25 C than at 35 C. Results on inhibition obtained from the plate test could not be correlated with the effect of the organisms in slurries. Environmental conditions were found to affect markedly the influence of food microorganisms on staphylococci. Of the 44 food microorganisms studied, only Bacillus cereus was observed to stimulate significantly staphylococcal growth and enterotoxin formation. Stimulation was more pronounced with Staphylococcus aureus 196E than with other strains of enterotoxigenic staphylococci. Bacillus megaterium and Brevibacterium linens were inhibited by staphylococci. These organisms were completely inhibited when inoculated in mixed cultures with staphylococci. In pure cultures, good staphylococcal growth was found to be accompanied by enterotoxin production; however, in the presence of food microorganisms, good staphylococcal growth occurred without the formation of detectable levels of enterotoxin A.
TI  - Heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Chorpenning, Frank W. (The Ohio State University, Columbus), and Matthew C. Dodd. Heterogenetic antigens of gram-positive bacteria. J. Bacteriol. 91:1440-1445. 1966.-Soluble antigens obtained by various methods from gram-positive bacteria were used to modify erythrocytes whose hemagglutinating reactions with immune rabbit sera and normal human sera were then studied. Antigens from all gram-positive organisms studied except corynbacteria altered red cells, causing them to react with specific bacterial antisera and with normal human sera; however, cross-absorption and inhibition tests indicated that at least three different specificites were involved. One of these antigens seemed to be similar to Rantz's streptococcal NSS, which is shared with Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus spp., and is therefore heterogenetic. Another was found in streptococci but was apparently not present in S. aureus and Bacillus spp. A third antigen, also heterogenetic, appeared to be shared by several species of Bacillus and by S. aureus, but not by streptococci or any gram-negative bacteria. The third antigen was heat-stable at pH 8.0, and appeared to be essentially polysaccharide in nature. Normal human sera varied in their content of antibodies which reacted with erythrocytes modified by extracts from gram-positive bacteria. Whereas some sera reacted very broadly with red cells modified by extracts of practically any gram-positive organism, other sera agglutinated only cells which had been modified by streptococcal antigen.
TI  - Food-borne bacterial toxins.
AB  - Food poisoning caused by the ingestion of preformed bacterial toxins is considered in relation to comparative symptoms, procedures for extraction and purification of the causal toxins, their chemistry, serology, assay procedures and pharmacology, in so far as these are known.The bacteria discussed in this context are Clostridium botulinum, C. perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Vibrio parahemolyticus. The possible roles of the enterococci, Proteus, E. coli and of unknown species, in relation to production of non-antigenic toxic substances, are discussed briefly.Requirements for prevention of the various forms of bacterial food poisoning are outlined.
TI  - Degradation of penicillin G and three semisynthetic penicillins by Bacillus cereus and Staphylococcus aureus penicillinase.
AB  
TI  - The purification and properties of a penicillinase whose synthesis is mediated by an R-factor in Escherichia coli.
AB  - 1. The penicillinase (beta-lactamase) from Escherichia coli strain TEM has been purified and its activity against a range of penicillin and cephalosporin derivatives measured. 2. The enzyme shows little resemblance to penicillinases from Bacillus cereus, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus aureus. 3. The molecular weight of the enzyme is 16700+/-5%, which is about half the value obtained for other penicillinases. 4. The enzyme is most similar in properties to a crude preparation of a penicillinase from Klebsiella (Aerobacter) aerogenes, but clearly different from crude enzyme preparations from other strains of E. coli. 5. Since penicillinase synthesis in E. coli strain TEM is mediated by an R-factor known to infect many other species of Enterobacteriaceae, the appearance of similar enzymes in other Gramnegative species is not surprising.
TI  - PRODUCTION AND PARTIAL PURIFICATION OF ANTIBIOTIC MATERIALS FORMED BY PHYSARUM GYROSUM.
AB  - Pure cultures of Physarum gyrosum were grown on agar plates with autoclaved Escherichia coli suspensions as the growth medium. Portions of such agar, after growth of the slime mold, contained diffusible materials that inhibited the growth of Bacillus subtilis, B. cereus, E. coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Paper chromatography of extracts of such cultures revealed at least three different active fractions. Preliminary fractionations increased the specific activity by one order of magnitude, probably in part by removal of inactive material and in part by separating active components. The fractionations also demonstrated the multiplicity of the antibiotic activity. Fractions variously obtained always retarded the growth of the bacterial species listed above.
TI  - FATE OF BACTERIA IN CHICKEN MEAT DURING FREEZE-DEHYDRATION, REHYDRATION, AND STORAGE.
AB  - Total plate counts were determined on boneless cooked, cubed chicken meat obtained from a commercial processor. Survival of the natural flora was determined after the meat was freeze-dehydrated and rehydrated at room temperature for 30 min and 50, 85, and 100 C for 10 min. Total counts of bacteria in the rehydrated samples were determined during storage of the meat at 4, 22, and 37 C until spoilage odor was detectable. Meat samples were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, then dried, rehydrated, and stored at the same temperatures. Numbers of surviving organisms in the inoculated samples were determined with use of both selective and nonselective media. Representative genera surviving the various rehydration treatments were determined. Approximately 32% of the bacteria in the meat survived during dehydration and rehydration at room temperature. Many numbers and types of vegetative bacteria also survived rehydration at 50 C. When meat was rehydrated at 85 or 100 C, the initial count was less than one per gram. The only organisms isolated from samples rehydrated at 85 or 100 C were of the genus Bacillus. S. aureus in inoculated samples survived dehydration and rehydration at 60 C. Storage of all rehydrated samples at 4 C gave a good shelf life (18 or more days). The study indicates that freeze-dehydrated meat should be produced with adequate microbiological control and that such meat should be rehydrated in very hot water.
TI  - Antimicrobial substances from aspen tissue grown in vitro.
AB  - Isolated aspen tissue, when grown in vitro for 3 weeks on agar medium, yielded antimicrobial substances which produced inhibitory zones when the culture plates were inoculated with Fusarium roseum, Saccharomyces cervisiae, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Penicillium, roqueforti, Torula utilis, Sarcina lutea, Flavobacterium aquatile, Pullularia pullulans, and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. II. Causes of inhibition.
AB  - Two food bacteria, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas sp. CS-1, inhibited an enterotoxigenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus, apparently by out-competing it for nutrients. Five others, Bacillus cereus, Proteus vulgaris, Escherichia coli H-52, Aerobacter aerogenes, and Achromobacter sp., inhibited by means of antibiotic substances which were Seitz-filterable, dialyzable, and stable at 90 C for 10 min. Inhibition was not caused by changes in pH, oxidation-reduction potential, or production of peroxide or fatty acids. The concentrated antibiotic material from E. coli H-52 contained amino acids but not peptides and was especially effective against staphylococci and micrococci.
TI  - Repression of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria. I. Effect of environmental  factors on inhibition.
AB  - The effects of environmental factors on the inhibition of an enterotoxin-producing strain of Staphylococcus aureus by food bacteria were investigated. Type of medium and temperature of incubation were important factors in determining the amount of inhibition. The pH range of maximal inhibition was found to be 7.4 to 6.2. Availability of oxygen was not a factor. As the ratios of inhibitor to staphylococcus were increased from 1:1 to 10:1 and 100:1, the amount of inhibition was markedly increased. Inhibition occurred in custard, where it increased with increasing ratios of effector to staphylococcus. The repression of the staphylococcus in all media usually was sufficient to be of practical significance.
TI  - Attempts to freeze some bacteriophages to ultralow temperatures.
AB  - A variety of bacteriophages specific for different hosts, including Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Shigella dysenteriae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Vibrio comma, were frozen at a controlled rate to liquid nitrogen temperatures, and then quick-thawed. Glycerol (10%) was used as a protective additive. Quantitative determinations showed from 10% to virtually 100% recovery in the various cases. Host specificity, plaque morphology, and, in one case, rate of inactivation of phage by homologous antiserum remained unchanged.
TI  - The international standard for aureomycin.
AB  - In 1950, the Department of Biological Standards, National Institute for Medical Research, London, was authorized by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization to proceed with the establishment of an International Standard for Aureomycin. A 100-g batch of aureomycin was obtained and was compared with the Standard Preparation of Aureomycin of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in a collaborative assay in which six laboratories in five countries participated.In all, 30 assays were carried out; 26 of these were done by biological methods, using Sarcina lutea, Bacillus pumilus, Staphylococcus aureus, or Bacillus cereus, and the remaining four by physicochemical methods. The results were subjected to standard methods of analysis, and the overall weighted mean potency (calculated from the biological assays only) was 1.0139, with limits of error of 99.5% to 100.5%.Since the International Standard is 1.39% more potent than the FDA Standard Preparation, it is probable that the latter contains a small amount of inert material; it is also possible that the International Standard itself is not 100% pure. For most practical purposes, however, both preparations may be regarded as substantially pure, and it is considered that to alter the present practice of quoting aureomycin dosage in metric units of weight would be inadvisable. Nevertheless, since the International Standard may not be a pure substance, a unit notation-for use where required in bioassays-is desirable, and the International Unit of Aureomycin has therefore been defined as the activity contained in one microgram of the International Standard.
