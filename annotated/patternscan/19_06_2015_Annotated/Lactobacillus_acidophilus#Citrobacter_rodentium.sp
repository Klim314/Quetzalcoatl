TI  == effect of intestinal colonisation by two lactobacillus strains on the immune response of gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == the effect of intestinal colonisation on the immune system was investigated in germ-free mice monoassociated with lactobacillus strains isolated from calf faeces. single doses of lactobacillus acidophilus l36 or lactobacillus salivarius l38 were administered to germ-free mice by intragastric gavage. ten days later, the mice were euthanised. gene expression levels of interleukin 5 (il-5), il-6, il-10, il-12b, il-17a, gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), transforming growth factor beta 1 (tgf-beta1), and tumour necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) were quantified  in segments of the small and large intestines by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. all the mice were colonised rapidly after lactobacillus administration with intestinal counts ranging from 6.53 to 8.26 log cfu/g. l. acidophilus l36 administration increased the expression of cytokines involved with the th2 (il-5, il-6 and tgf-beta1) and th17 (il-17a, tnf-alpha and  il-6) inflammatory response, whereas l. salivarius l38 appeared to stimulate a pattern of less diversified cytokines in the intestine. intragastric gavage of l. acidophilus l36 and l. salivarius l38 induced similar levels of colonisation in the digestive tracts of germ-free mice but stimulated different immune responses  in the intestinal mucosa. the different immunomodulation patterns might facilitate the potential use of these lactobacilli as probiotics to treat distinct pathological conditions, for example protection against citrobacter rodentium infection by stimulating il-17 production.

TI  == early administration of probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus and/or prebiotic inulin attenuates pathogen-mediated intestinal inflammation and smad 7 cell signaling.
AB  == immaturity of gut-associated immunity may contribute to pediatric mortality associated with enteric infections. a murine model to parallel infantile enteric  disease was used to determine the effects of probiotic, lactobacillus acidophilus (la), prebiotic, inulin, or both (synbiotic, syn) on pathogen-induced inflammatory responses, nf-kappab, and smad 7 signaling. newborn mice were inoculated bi-weekly for 4 weeks with la, inulin, or syn and challenged with citrobacter rodentium (cr) at 5 weeks. mouse intestinal epithelial cells (cmt93)  were exposed to cr to determine temporal alterations in nf-kappa b and smad 7 levels. mice with pretreatment of la, inulin, and syn show reduced intestinal inflammation following cr infection compared with controls, which is associated with significantly reduced bacterial colonization in la, inulin, and syn animals. our results further show that host defense against cr infection correlated with enhanced colonic il-10 and transforming growth factor-beta expression and inhibition of nf-kappab in syn-treated mice, whereas mice pretreated with syn, la, or inulin had attenuation of cr-induced smad 7 expression. there was a temporal smad 7 and nf-kappab intracellular accumulation post-cr infection and post-tumor necrosis factor stimulation in cmt93 cells. these results, therefore,  suggest that probiotic, la, prebiotic inulin, or synbiotic may promote host-protective immunity and attenuate cr-induced intestinal inflammation through mechanisms affecting nf-kappab and smad 7 signaling.

TI  == effect of probiotics lactobacillus acidophilus on citrobacter rodentium colitis:  the role of dendritic cells.
AB  == modulation of the intestinal immune response early in life by administration of probiotic bacteria may be an effective strategy for preventing or attenuating infectious diarrhea. we preinoculated the mice early in life with the probiotic bacteria lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm (la) at age 2 wk. dendritic cells (dcs) were collected and purified from mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and spleens of the  balbc/byj mice. dc isolation and adoptive transfer was used to examine the function of probiotics. we demonstrated that when mice were adoptively transferred with la-primed dcs (t-ladc) instead of oral consumption with la, there was a similar effect on fecal bacteria counts, iga levels, and colonic histopathology, as well as cytokine levels in mln when there was intestinal bacterial infection. the above findings suggest that dcs play a key role in probiotics attenuating citrobacter rodentium (cr) colitis. moreover, the location of la-primed dc hints that there is interaction of dcs and t cells in the digestive system of the host. up-regulated expression of a surface marker on dcs  indicated that inoculation with probiotics will stimulate the function of dcs, thereby further increasing immune response triggered by dc.

TI  == preinoculation with the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus early in life effectively inhibits murine citrobacter rodentium colitis.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) is a common pathogen in infantile diarrhea, causing a characteristic histopathologic attaching and effacing (a/e) lesion in the intestinal mucosa. the mouse pathogen citrobacter rodentium causes  a similar a/e lesion in the murine intestine. like epec, c. rodentium infection results in colonic crypt hyperplasia, goblet cell depletion, epithelial proliferation, and mucosal disruption. using this murine model, we tested the hypothesis that preinoculation of murine gut with lactobacillus acidophilus early in life can enhance host defense against enteric bacterial infection and attenuate bacteria-mediated colitis. two-week old balb/c mice were inoculated with l. acidophilus twice per week for 4 weeks before c. rodentium infection or concomitantly with the exposure to c. rodentium at 6-8 weeks of age. the probiotics were administered twice weekly thereafter. we observed that l. acidophilus inoculation in mice inhibits c. rodentium-induced colitis, which is associated with a decrease in c. rodentium colonization and translocation, an increase in its clearance, and a suppression of colonic myeloperoxidase (mpo) activity. probiotic treatment also stimulates regulatory cytokine expression in the colon [transforming growth factor beta (tgf-beta), interleukin (il)-10]. preinoculation with l. acidophilus is more effective than concomitant use of probiotics in the induction of intestinal iga secretion and in the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokine expression [tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha),  il-6, and il-12]. these observations suggest that inoculation with probiotics can effectively prevent bacteria-induced colitis by limiting enteric bacteria infection and promoting mucosal protective regulatory immune responses. this study may have ramifications for prevention of infectious diarrhea in human infants and children, particularly in developing countries.

TI  == amelioration of the effects of citrobacter rodentium infection in mice by pretreatment with probiotics.
AB  == background: citrobacter rodentium is a naturally occurring murine pathogen that causes colonic epithelial-cell hyperplasia, disrupts the colonic mucosa, and elicits a predominantly t helper 1 cellular immune response; it thereby serves as a model for the study of mechanisms of disease induced by human attaching-effacing pathogens. we sought to determine whether pretreatment of mice with a mixture of lactobacillus rhamnosus and l. acidophilus probiotics would attenuate c. rodentium-induced colonic disease in mice. methods: mice were administered sterile drinking water, probiotics (10(9) cfu/ml) in sterile drinking water, maltodextrin in sterile drinking water, orogastric c. rodentium (10(7) cfu in 0.1 ml), or maltodextrin in sterile drinking water for 1 week before c. rodentium infection, or they were pretreated with probiotics (10(9) cfu/ml) for 1 week before challenge with c. rodentium. results: mice that received viable probiotics remained healthy. c. rodentium infection elicited mucosal inflammation, epithelial-cell hyperplasia, apoptosis in the colon, and interferon (ifn)- gamma production by splenocytes. pretreatment with probiotics decreased levels of all but ifn- gamma production. conclusions: pretreatment with probiotics attenuates the effects of c. rodentium infection in mice. understanding the mechanism of these beneficial effects will aid in determining the efficacy of probiotics in preventing infection with related attaching-effacing enteric pathogens in humans.

TI  == prophylactic feeding of lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm to mice attenuates overt colonic hyperplasia.
AB  == the objective of this project was to determine if the probiotic lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm would protect mice from developing transmissible murine colonic  hyperplasia (tmch) caused by citrobacter rodentium. our hypothesis was that the oral administration of l. acidophilus ncfm to mice would mitigate colonic hyperplasia and modulate the host immune response. a concurrent administration (ca) study was performed by feeding mice phosphate-buffered saline (pbs), c. rodentium only, l. acidophilus ncfm only, or c. rodentium and ncfm concurrently on the same day. the mice in the ca study were not protected by the probiotic, since their mean colon sample weights (0.109 g) were significantly higher than those of the pbs controls (0.0774 g), and the hematoxylin and eosin-stained samples showed histological changes typically associated with tmch. a prophylactic feeding (pf) study was performed by orally feeding mice pbs or ncfm  once daily for 20 consecutive days; in addition, on day 7, mice were challenged with either pbs or c. rodentium. mice in the pf study were protected when they consumed the probiotic prior to the pathogen challenge, since their mean colon sample weights (0.0812 g) were not significantly higher than those of the controls (0.0753 g). the hematoxylin and eosin-stained samples appeared similar to the control samples, and the intestinal interleukin (il)-15 and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) mrna levels were reduced. l. acidophilus ncfm did attenuate overt colonic hyperplasia when fed to mice prior to challenge with c. rodentium. the mouse model used in this study enabled us to investigate the efficacy of the l. acidophilus ncfm in preventing gastrointestinal disease and is a valid model for future probiotic research.
