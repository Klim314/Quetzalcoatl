TI  == the oral mucosal and salivary microbial community of behcet's syndrome and recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == background: behcet's syndrome (bs) is a multisystem immune-related disease of unknown etiology. recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras) is characterized by the presence of idiopathic oral ulceration without extraoral manifestation. the interplay between the oral microbial communities and the immune response could play an important role in the etiology and pathogenesis of both bs and ras. objective: to investigate the salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities in  bs and ras. methods: purified microbial dna isolated from saliva samples (54 bs,  25 healthy controls [hc], and 8 ras) were examined by the human oral microbe identification microarray. cultivable salivary and oral mucosal microbial communities from ulcer and non-ulcer sites were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis. mycobacterium spp. were detected in saliva and in ulcer and non-ulcer oral mucosal brush biopsies following culture on lowenstein-jensen slopes and mycobacterial growth indicator  tubes. results: there was increased colonization with rothia denticariosa of the  non-ulcer sites of bs and ras patients (p<0.05). ulcer sites in bs were highly colonized with streptococcus salivarius compared to those of ras (p<0.05), and with streptococcus sanguinis compared to hc (p<0.0001). oral mucosa of hc were more highly colonized with neisseria and veillonella compared to all studied groups (p<0.0001). conclusions: despite the uncertainty whether the reported differences in the oral mucosal microbial community of bs and ras are of causative or reactive nature, it is envisaged that restoring the balance of the oral microbial community of the ulcer sites may be used in the future as a new treatment modality for oral ulceration.

TI  == evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  versatrek blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  == the verigene gram-positive blood culture (bc-gp) assay (nanosphere, northbrook, il) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. a total of 148 versatrek redox 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating gram-positive bacteria were tested. results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) identifications. we obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (24), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa) (14), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) (17), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis (msse) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus parasanguinis (2), streptococcus sanguinis (1), streptococcus cristatus (1), the streptococcus bovis group (5), streptococcus agalactiae (9), the streptococcus anginosus group (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre fcm) (16), vancomycin-susceptible  enterococcus faecalis (3), aerococcus viridans (2), bacillus (6), corynebacterium (8), lactobacillus (2), micrococcus (2), neisseria mucosa (1), escherichia coli (3), candida tropicalis (1), propionibacterium (1), and rothia (1). overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. a total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. we tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. a chart review of 31 patients with mrsa, mssa, or vre demonstrated that the nanosphere bc-gp assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with mrsa or vre. the bc-gp assay may have a positive impact on patient  care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.

TI  == the oral ecology of patients with severe sjogren's syndrome.
AB  == an investigation of the commensal microflora, salivary flow rate, ph, and the degree of atrophy of the oral mucosa in ten patients with severe sjogren's syndrome and ten control subjects, revealed a number of differences. the numbers  of streptococcus salivarius, neisseria pharyngis, veillonella species and micrococcus mucilagenosus isolated from patients with sjogren's syndrome were significantly reduced, while the numbers of candida spp. and staphylococcus aureus were significantly increased when compared with control subjects. in addition the salivary ph of the sjogren's group was significantly reduced and the degree of mucosal atrophy increased compared with controls.
