TI  == morphological and genetic characterization of group i clostridium botulinum type  b strain 111 and the transcriptional regulator spoiiid gene knockout mutant in sporulation.
AB  == clostridium botulinum is a heat-resistant spore-forming bacterium that causes the serious paralytic illness botulism. heat-resistant spores may cause food sanitation hazards and sporulation plays a central role in the survival of c. botulinum. we observed morphological changes and investigated the role of the transcriptional regulator spoiiid in the sporulation of c. botulinum type b strain 111 in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism in c. botulinum. c. botulinum type b formed heat-resistant spores through successive morphological changes corresponding to those of bacillus subtilis, a spore-forming model organism. an analysis of the spoiiid gene knockout mutant revealed that the transcriptional regulator spoiiid contributed to heat-resistant spore formation by c. botulinum type b and activated the transcription of the sigk gene later during sporulation. transcription of the spoiiid gene, which differed from that in b. subtilis and clostridium difficile, was observed in the sige gene knockout  mutant of c. botulinum type b. an analysis of the sigf gene knockout mutant showed that the sporulation-specific sigma factor sigf was essential for transcription of the spoiiid gene in c. botulinum type b. these results suggest that the regulation of sporulation in c. botulinum is not similar to that in b. subtilis and other clostridia.

TI  == diverse mechanisms regulate sporulation sigma factor activity in the firmicutes.
AB  == sporulation allows bacteria to survive adverse conditions and is essential to the lifecycle of some obligate anaerobes. in bacillus subtilis, the sporulation-specific sigma factors, sigma(f), sigma(e), sigma(g), and sigma(k), activate compartment-specific transcriptional programs that drive sporulation through its morphological stages. the regulation of these sigma factors was predicted to be conserved across the firmicutes, since the regulatory proteins controlling their activation are largely conserved. however, recent studies in (pepto)clostridium difficile, clostridium acetobutylicum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium botulinum have revealed striking differences in the  order, activation, and function of sporulation sigma factors. these studies indicate that gene conservation does not necessarily predict gene function and that new mechanisms for controlling cell fate determination remain to be discovered in the anaerobic clostridia.

TI  == infant botulism: is there an association with thiamine deficiency?
AB  == infant botulism is an acute life-threatening condition and diagnosis is frequently delayed. therefore, the best time window to administer specific antibodies, at present the only etiology-based therapy, is often missed, entailing long periods of hospitalization in the picu. here we present a 3-month-old boy with infant botulism and respiratory failure, who quickly and favorably responded to thiamine supplementation. from the feces we isolated clostridium botulinum serotype a2. in addition to producing botulinum neurotoxin  a, this strain carried the thiaminase i gene and produced thiaminase i. accordingly, the child's feces were positive for thiaminase i activity. because c botulinum group i strains are capable of producing thiaminase i, we speculate that thiamine degradation might further aggravate the paralytic symptoms caused by botulinum neurotoxins in infant botulism. thus, supportive supplementation with thiamine could be beneficial to speed up recovery and to shorten hospitalization in some patients with infant botulism.

TI  == immunological function of familial mediterranean fever disease protein pyrin.
AB  == pyrin, encoded by mefv gene, is conserved in humans and mice. mutations in the mefv gene are associated with the human autoinflammatory disease familial mediterranean fever (fmf). pyrin can interact with the inflammasome adaptor asc and induce inflammatory caspase-1 activation in monocytic cells, but the physiological function of pyrin has been unknown for many years. here we summarize previous studies of pyrin function under the context of fmf and immunity, and discuss a recent study demonstrating that pyrin forms an inflammasome complex for caspase-1 activation in innate immunity. pyrin inflammasome detects inactivating modifications of host rho gtpases by diverse bacterial toxins and infections, including clostridium difficile glucosylating cytotoxin tcdb, fic-domain adenylyltransferase effectors from vibrio parahaemolyticus and histophilus somni, adp-ribosylating clostridium botulinum c3 toxin as well as burkholderia cenocepacia infection. the mode of pyrin action, i.e., sensing pathogen virulence activity rather than directly recognizing a microbial molecule, represents a new paradigm in innate immunity.

TI  == clostridium and bacillus binary enterotoxins: bad for the bowels, and eukaryotic  being.
AB  == some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. these gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include clostridium botulinum (c2 toxin), clostridium difficile (c. difficile toxin or cdt), clostridium perfringens (iota-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or bec), clostridium spiroforme (c. spiroforme toxin or cst), as well as bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or vip). these gut-acting proteins form an ab complex composed of adp-ribosyl transferase (a) and cell-binding (b) components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. once inside the cytosol, the a components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-adp-ribosylation  of globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. important aspects of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of action for each toxin.

TI  == cyclophilin-facilitated membrane translocation as pharmacological target to prevent intoxication of mammalian cells by binary clostridial actin adp-ribosylated toxins.
AB  == clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridium perfringens iota toxin and clostridium difficile cdt belong to the family of binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins and are composed of a binding/translocation component and a separate enzyme component. the enzyme components adp-ribosylate g-actin in the cytosol of  target cells resulting in depolymerization of f-actin, cell rounding and cell death. the binding/translocation components bind to their cell receptors and form complexes with the respective enzyme components. after receptor-mediated endocytosis, the binding/translocation components form pores in membranes of acidified endosomes and the enzyme components translocate through these pores into the cytosol. this step is facilitated by the host cell chaperone heat shock  protein 90 and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerases including cyclophilin a. here, we demonstrate that a large isoform of cyclophilin a, the multi-domain enzyme cyclophilin 40 (cyp40), binds to the enzyme components c2i, ia and cdta in vitro. isothermal titration calorimetry revealed a direct binding to c2i with a calculated affinity of 101 nm and to ia with an affinity of 1.01 mum. closer investigation for the prototypic c2i revealed that binding to cyp40 did not depend on its adp-ribosyltransferase activity but was stronger for unfolded c2i.  the interaction of c2i with cyp40 was also demonstrated in lysates from c2-treated cells by pull-down. treatment of cells with a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine a derivative, which still binds to and inhibits the peptidyl-prolyl  cis/trans isomerase activity of cyclophilins, protected cells from intoxication with c2, iota and cdt toxins, offering an attractive approach for development of  novel therapeutic strategies against binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins.

TI  == tailored cyclodextrin pore blocker protects mammalian cells from clostridium difficile binary toxin cdt.
AB  == some clostridium difficile strains produce, in addition to toxins a and b, the binary toxin clostridium difficile transferase (cdt), which adp-ribosylates actin and may contribute to the hypervirulence of these strains. the separate binding and translocation component cdtb mediates transport of the enzyme component cdta  into mammalian target cells. cdtb binds to its receptor on the cell surface, cdta assembles and cdtb/cdta complexes are internalised. in acidic endosomes, cdtb mediates the delivery of cdta into the cytosol, most likely by forming a translocation pore in endosomal membranes. we demonstrate that a seven-fold symmetrical positively charged beta-cyclodextrin derivative, per-6-s-(3-aminomethyl)benzylthio-beta-cyclodextrin, which was developed earlier  as a potent inhibitor of the translocation pores of related binary toxins of bacillus anthracis, clostridium botulinum and clostridium perfringens, protects cells from intoxication with cdt. the pore blocker did not interfere with the cdta-catalyzed adp-ribosylation of actin or toxin binding to vero cells but inhibited the ph-dependent membrane translocation of cdta into the cytosol. in conclusion, the cationic beta-cyclodextrin could serve as the lead compound in a  development of novel pharmacological strategies against the cdt-producing strains of c. difficile.

TI  == innate immune sensing of bacterial modifications of rho gtpases by the pyrin inflammasome.
AB  == cytosolic inflammasome complexes mediated by a pattern recognition receptor (prr) defend against pathogen infection by activating caspase 1. pyrin, a candidate prr, can bind to the inflammasome adaptor asc to form a caspase 1-activating complex. mutations in the pyrin-encoding gene, mefv, cause a human autoinflammatory disease known as familial mediterranean fever. despite important roles in immunity and disease, the physiological function of pyrin remains unknown. here we show that pyrin mediates caspase 1 inflammasome activation in response to rho-glucosylation activity of cytotoxin tcdb, a major virulence factor of clostridium difficile, which causes most cases of nosocomial diarrhoea. the glucosyltransferase-inactive tcdb mutant loses the inflammasome-stimulating activity. other rho-inactivating toxins, including fic-domain adenylyltransferases (vibrio parahaemolyticus vops and histophilus somni ibpa) and clostridium botulinum adp-ribosylating c3 toxin, can also biochemically activate the pyrin inflammasome in their enzymatic activity-dependent manner. these toxins all target the rho subfamily and modify a switch-i residue. we further demonstrate that burkholderia cenocepacia inactivates rhoa by deamidating asn 41, also in the switch-i region, and thereby triggers pyrin inflammasome activation, both of which require the bacterial type vi secretion system (t6ss).  loss of the pyrin inflammasome causes elevated intra-macrophage growth of b. cenocepacia and diminished lung inflammation in mice. thus, pyrin functions to sense pathogen modification and inactivation of rho gtpases, representing a new paradigm in mammalian innate immunity.

TI  == occurrence of zoonotic clostridia and yersinia in healthy cattle.
AB  == zoonotic pathogens are a frequent cause of disease worldwide. this study was designed to determine the occurrence of clostridium difficile, clostridium botulinum, and yersinia enterocolitica in cattle in southern bavaria, germany. the study population included 49 farms; 34 were dairy farms (30 also fattening beef cattle) and 15 were solely beef cattle farms. fecal and dust samples were collected from summer 2011 to summer 2012 and analyzed using a combination of enrichment procedures and real-time pcr. for the detection of c. difficile, samples were screened for the presence of the tpi gene and toxin genes tcda, tcdb, and cdta. samples also were screened for genes for c. botulinum toxins a through f and for the ail gene of y. enterocolitica. of 506 samples, c. difficile genes were found in 29 samples (5.7%): 25 samples from dairy farms and 4 samples  from beef cattle farms. toxin genes were identified in 17 samples, with toxigenic profiles of a(+)b(+)cdt(-), a(+)b(-)cdt(+), and a(+)b(+)cdt(+). c. botulinum toxin genes were not detected in fecal samples from cattle, but the gene for toxin b was detected in 1 (0.8%) of 125 dust samples. y. enterocolitica genes were found in 6 (1.6%) of 382 fecal samples from three dairy farms and one beef cattle farm. this study revealed that c. difficile and y. enterocolitica are rare on cattle farms in bavaria, germany. in contrast to results of previous studies,  c. botulinum was not detected in fecal samples but was found very rarely in dust  samples from the cattle environment.

TI  == cyclodextrin derivatives as anti-infectives.
AB  == cyclodextrin derivatives can be utilized as anti-infectives with pore-forming proteins as the targets. the highly efficient selection of potent inhibitors was  achieved because per-substituted cyclodextrins have the same symmetry as the target pores. inhibitors of several bacterial toxins produced by bacillus anthracis, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, clostridium botulinum, and clostridium difficile were identified from a library of approximately 200 cd  derivatives. it was demonstrated that multi-targeted inhibitors can be found using this approach and could be utilized for the development of broad-spectrum drugs against various pathogens.

TI  == genetic characteristics of toxigenic clostridia and toxin gene evolution.
AB  == clostridia comprise a heterogenous group of environmental bacteria containing 15  pathogenic species, which produce the most potent toxins. the origin of toxins is still enigmatic. it is hypothesized that toxins exhibiting an enzymatic activity  have derived from hydrolytic enzymes, which are abundantly secreted by these bacteria, and that pore-forming toxins have evolved from an ancestor transmembrane protein. the presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridium species and the variability of some toxin genes support horizontal toxin gene transfer and subsequent independent evolution from strain to strain. clostridium perfringens toxin genes involved in myonecrosis, mainly alpha toxin and perfringolysin genes, are chromosomally located, whereas toxin genes responsible for intestinal and food borne diseases are localized on plasmids except the enterotoxin gene which can be located either on the chromosome or plasmids. the distribution of these plasmids containing one or several toxin genes accounts for the diverse c. perfringens toxinotypes. clostridium difficile  strains show a high genetic variability. but in contrast to c. perfringens, toxin genes are clustered in pathogenicity locus located on chromosome. the presence of related toxin genes in distinct clostridial species like clostridium sordellii, clostridium novyi, and c. perfringens supports interspecies mobilization of this  locus. the multiple c. difficile toxinotypes based on toxin gene variants possibly reflect strain adaptation to the intestinal environment. botulinum toxin genes also show a high level of genetic variation. they have a diverse genetic localization including chromosome, plasmid or phage, and are spread in various clostridium species (clostridium botulinum groups, clostridium argentinense, clostridium butyricum, clostridium baratii). exchange of toxin genes not only include transfers between clostridium species but also between clostridium and other bacterial species as well as eukaryotic cells as supported by the wide distribution of related pore-forming toxins of the aerolysin family in various clostridial and non-clostridial species, animal, mushroom and plant.

TI  == detection of clostridium difficile in small and medium-sized wild mammals in southern ontario, canada.
AB  == we sampled 325 small and medium-sized wild mammals in ontario, canada in 2007 and 2010 to determine the prevalence and characteristics of clostridium difficile in  wild mammals living in proximity to captive wildlife and livestock. clostridium difficile was isolated from five of 109 animals (4.6%) on four of 25 farms (16%), but was not isolated from any of the 216 samples from raccoons (procyon lotor) living on the grounds of the toronto zoo. the positive animals included two raccoons from one beef farm, one raccoon from a different beef farm, one raccoon  from a swine farm, and a shrew (blarina brevicauda) from a dairy farm. none had evidence of gastrointestinal disease. three of the five isolates were toxinotype  variants (ii, iv, and xiii) that are rarely identified in humans and domestic animals. the other two were toxinotype 0, a common toxinotype in humans and animals; however, all five isolates were of different ribotypes. none of the recovered ribotypes were recognized as ribotypes present in the authors' reference library of over 3,000 human and domestic animal c. difficile isolates.  neither the public health nor the animal health relevance of these findings is clear. it is not known whether c. difficile is a pathogen of small and medium-sized wild mammals, although the susceptibility of various laboratory species suggests it could cause disease.

TI  == identification of novel host-targeted compounds that protect from anthrax lethal  toxin-induced cell death.
AB  == studying how pathogens subvert the host to cause disease has contributed to the understanding of fundamental cell biology. bacillus anthracis, the causative agent of anthrax, produces the virulence factor lethal toxin to disarm host immunity and cause pathology. we conducted a phenotypic small molecule screen to  identify inhibitors of lethal toxin-induced macrophage cell death and used an ordered series of secondary assays to characterize the hits and determine their effects on cellular function. we identified a structurally diverse set of small molecules that act at various points along the lethal toxin pathway, including inhibitors of endocytosis, natural product inhibitors of organelle acidification  (e.g., the botulinum neurotoxin inhibitor, toosendanin), and a novel proteasome inhibitor, 4mnb (4-methoxy-2-[2-(5-methoxy-2-nitrosophenyl)ethyl]-1-nitrosobenzene). many of the  compounds, including three drugs approved for use in humans, also protected against the related clostridium difficile toxin tcdb, further demonstrating their value as novel tools for perturbation and study of toxin biology and host cellular processes and highlighting potential new strategies for intervening on toxin-mediated diseases.

TI  == cd44 promotes intoxication by the clostridial iota-family toxins.
AB  == various pathogenic clostridia produce binary protein toxins associated with enteric diseases of humans and animals. separate binding/translocation (b) components bind to a protein receptor on the cell surface, assemble with enzymatic (a) component(s), and mediate endocytosis of the toxin complex. ultimately there is translocation of a component(s) from acidified endosomes into the cytosol, leading to destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. our results revealed that cd44, a multifunctional surface protein of mammalian cells, facilitates intoxication by the iota family of clostridial binary toxins. specific antibody against cd44 inhibited cytotoxicity of the prototypical clostridium perfringens iota toxin. versus cd44(+) melanoma cells, those lacking  cd44 bound less toxin and were dose-dependently resistant to c. perfringens iota, as well as clostridium difficile and clostridium spiroforme iota-like, toxins. purified cd44 specifically interacted in vitro with iota and iota-like, but not related clostridium botulinum c2, toxins. furthermore, cd44 knockout mice were resistant to iota toxin lethality. collective data reveal an important role for cd44 during intoxication by a family of clostridial binary toxins.

TI  == prophage carriage and diversity within clinically relevant strains of clostridium difficile.
AB  == prophages are encoded in most genomes of sequenced clostridium difficile strains. they are key components of the mobile genetic elements and, as such, are likely to influence the biology of their host strains. the majority of these phages are  not amenable to propagation, and therefore the development of a molecular marker  is a useful tool with which to establish the extent and diversity of c. difficile prophage carriage within clinical strains. to design markers, several candidate genes were analyzed including structural and holin genes. the holin gene is the only gene present in all sequenced phage genomes, conserved at both terminals, with a variable mid-section. this allowed us to design two sets of degenerate pcr primers specific to c. difficile myoviruses and siphoviruses. subsequent pcr analysis of 16 clinical c. difficile ribotypes showed that 15 of them are myovirus positive, and 2 of them are also siphovirus positive. antibiotic induction and transmission electron microscope analysis confirmed the molecular prediction of myoviruses and/or siphovirus presence. phylogenetic analysis of the holin sequences identified three groups of c. difficile phages, two within the myoviruses and a divergent siphovirus group. the marker also produced tight groups within temperate phages that infect other taxa, including clostridium perfringens, clostridium botulinum, and bacillus spp., which suggests the potential application of the holin gene to study prophage carriage in other bacteria. this study reveals the high incidence of prophage carriage in clinically relevant strains of c. difficile and correlates the molecular data to  the morphological observation.

TI  == bidirectional attack on the actin cytoskeleton. bacterial protein toxins causing  polymerization or depolymerization of actin.
AB  == the actin cytoskeleton is one of the major targets of bacterial protein toxins. the family of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins, including clostridium difficile transferase cdt, clostridium perfringens iota toxin and clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, modifies arginine-177 of actin. thereby actin polymerization  is blocked. by contrast, actin polymerization is facilitated by the tripartite photorhabdus luminescens toxin complex including tccc3, which modifies actin at threonine-148. the review discusses both toxin families in respect to recent findings.

TI  == cellular cytoskeleton dynamics modulates non-viral gene delivery through rhogtpases.
AB  == although it is well accepted that the constituents of the cellular microenvironment modulate a myriad of cellular processes, including cell morphology, cytoskeletal dynamics and uptake pathways, the underlying mechanism of how these pathways influence non-viral gene transfer have not been studied. transgene expression is increased on fibronectin (fn) coated surfaces as a consequence of increased proliferation, cell spreading and active engagement of clathrin endocytosis pathway. rhogtpases mediate the crosstalk between the cell and fn, and regulate cellular processes involving filamentous actin, in-response  to cellular interaction with fn. here the role of rhogtpases specifically rho, rac and cdc42 in modulation of non-viral gene transfer in mouse mesenchymal stem  (mmscs) plated in a fibronectin microenvironment was studied. more than 90% decrease in transgene expression was observed after inactivation of rhogtpases using difficile toxin b (tcdb) and c3 transferase. expression of dominant negative rhoa (rhoat19n), rac1(rac1t17n) and cdc42 (cdc42t17n) also significantly reduced polyplex uptake and transgene expression. interactions of cells with fn lead to activation of rhogtpases. however, further activation of rhoa, rac1 and cdc42 by expression of constitutively active genes (rhoaq63l, rac1q61l and cdc42q61l) did not further enhance transgene expression in mmscs, when plated on  fn. in contrast, activation of rhoa, rac1 and cdc42 by expression of constitutively active genes for cells plated on collagen i, which by itself did not increase rhogtpase activation, resulted in enhanced transgene expression. our study shows that rhogtpases regulate internalization and effective intracellular  processing of polyplexes that results in efficient gene transfer.

TI  == fk506-binding protein 51 interacts with clostridium botulinum c2 toxin and fk506  inhibits membrane translocation of the toxin in mammalian cells.
AB  == the binary clostridium botulinum c2 toxin consists of the binding/translocation component c2iia and the separate enzyme component c2i. c2iia delivers c2i into the cytosol of eukaryotic target cells where c2i adp-ribosylates actin. after receptor-mediated endocytosis of the c2iia/c2i complex, c2iia forms pores in membranes of acidified early endosomes and unfolded c2i translocates through the  pores into the cytosol. membrane translocation of c2i is facilitated by the activities of host cell chaperone hsp90 and the peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (ppiase) cyclophilin a. here, we demonstrated that hsp90 co-precipitates with c2i from lysates of c2 toxin-treated cells and identified the fk506-binding protein (fkbp) 51 as a novel interaction partner of c2i in vitro and in intact mammalian cells. prompted by this finding, we used the specific pharmacological inhibitor fk506 to investigate whether the ppiase activity of fkbps plays a role during membrane translocation of c2 toxin. treatment of cells with fk506 protected cultured cells from intoxication with c2  toxin. moreover, fk506 inhibited the ph-dependent translocation of c2i across membranes into the cytosol but did not interfere with the enzyme activity of c2i  or binding of c2 toxin to cells. furthermore, fk506 treatment delayed intoxication with the related binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins from clostridium perfringens (iota toxin) and clostridium difficile (cdt) but not with the rho-glucosylating clostridium difficile toxin a (tcda). in conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that clostridial binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins share a specific fkbp-dependent translocation mechanism during their uptake into mammalian cells.

TI  == cells transformed by plc-gamma 1 overexpression are highly sensitive to clostridium difficile toxin a-induced apoptosis and mitotic inhibition.
AB  == phospholipase c-gammal (plc-gammal) expression is associated with cellular transformation. notably, plc-gamma is up-regulated in colorectal cancer tissue and breast carcinoma. because exotoxins released by clostridium botulinum have been shown to induce apoptosis and promote growth arrest in various cancer cell lines, we examined here the potential of clostridium difficile toxin a to selectively induce apoptosis in cells transformed by plc-gammal overexpression. we found that plc-gammal-transformed cells, but not vectortransformed (control) cells, were highly sensitive to c. difficile toxin a-induced apoptosis and mitotic inhibition. moreover, expression of the proapoptotic bcl2 family member,  bim, and activation of caspase-3 were significantly up-regulated by toxin a in plc-gammal-transformed cells. toxin a-induced cell rounding and paxillin dephosphorylation were also significantly higher in plc-gammal-transformed cells  than in control cells. these findings suggest that c. difficile toxin a may have  potential as an anticancer agent against colorectal cancers and breast carcinomas in which plc-gammal is highly up-regulated.

TI  == retargeting clostridium difficile toxin b to neuronal cells as a potential vehicle for cytosolic delivery of therapeutic biomolecules to treat botulism.
AB  == botulinum neurotoxins (bonts) deliver a protease to neurons which can cause a flaccid paralysis called botulism. development of botulism antidotes will require neuronal delivery of agents that inhibit or destroy the bont protease. here, we investigated the potential of engineering clostridium difficile toxin b (tcdb) as a neuronal delivery vehicle by testing two recombinant tcdb chimeras. for agt-tcdb chimera, an alkyltransferase (agt) was appended to the n-terminal glucosyltransferase (gt) of tcdb. recombinant agt-tcdb had alkyltransferase activity, and the chimera was nearly as toxic to vero cells as wild-type tcdb, suggesting efficient cytosolic delivery of the agt/gt fusion. for agt-tcdb-bont/a-hc, the receptor-binding domain (rbd) of tcdb was replaced by the equivalent rbd from bont/a (bont/a-hc). agt-tcdb-bont/a-hc was >25-fold more toxic to neuronal cells and >25-fold less toxic to vero cells than agt-tcdb. thus, tcdb can be engineered for cytosolic delivery of biomolecules and improved  targeting of neuronal cells.

AB  == insulin-like growth factor binding protein 1 (igfbp1), the main secretory product of the decidualized endometrium of a pregnant woman, has previously been shown to interact with the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin of extravillous trophoblast (evt) cell surface to stimulate its migration in an igf-independent manner. this migration stimulation has also been shown to require activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (erk1/2; mitogen-activated protein kinase [mapk] 3/1])  and focal adhesion kinase. the present study examined the roles of rho gtpases rhoa, rhoc, rac1, and cdc42 as well as rho kinases rock1 and rock2 in igfbp1-mediated migration of an immortalized evt cell line htr-8/svneo. a nonselective rho kinase inhibitor, y27632, as well as sirnas selective for rock1  and rock2 decreased the migration of these cells in a transwell migration assay,  and this inhibition could not be restored by igfbp1. clostridium difficile toxin  b, which inhibits all the rho gtpases, rac inhibitor nsc23766, rac1 sirna, and cdc42 sirna, decreased their basal migration, but none of these inhibitions except cdc42 sirna-induced inhibition could be restored by igfbp1. clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme that inhibits rhoa, rhob, and rhoc inhibited basal migration but not igfbp1-induced migration. igfbp1-induced activation of erk1/2 (mapk3/1), which did not require rho proteins, might function as an alternate pathway for rho action. however, selective sirna-mediated downregulation of rhoa  inhibited basal, but not igfbp1-mediated, migration, whereas that of rhoc inhibited both basal and igfbp1-mediated migration of these evt cells. therefore, rho kinase, rhoc, and rac1 are essential, but rhoa and cdc42 are not essential, for igfbp1-induced evt migration.

TI  == clostron-mediated engineering of clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium is a diverse assemblage of gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. clostridium difficile, clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani, and clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the  biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as clostridium  acetobutylicum, clostridium beijerinkii, clostridium thermocellum, and clostridium phytofermentans. the prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. the historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies  for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by clostron technology. the clostron uses a retargeted group ii intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert dna into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo dna delivery. the procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.

TI  == disinfection methods for spores of bacillus atrophaeus, b. anthracis, clostridium tetani, c. botulinum and c. difficile.
AB  == to evaluate disinfection methods for environments contaminated with bioterrorism-associated microorganism (bacillus anthracis), we performed the following experiments. first, the sporicidal effects of sodium hypochlorite on spores of five bacterial species were evaluated. bacillus atrophaeus was the most resistant to hypochlorite, followed in order by b. anthracis, clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani, and clostridium difficile. subsequently, using  b. atrophaeus spores that were the most resistant to hypochlorite, the sporicidal effects of hypochlorite at lower ph by adding vinegar were evaluated. hypochlorite containing vinegar had far more marked sporicidal effects than hypochlorite alone. cleaning with 0.5% (5000 ppm) hypochlorite containing vinegar inactivated b. atrophaeus spores attached to vinyl chloride and plywood plates within 15 s, while that not containing vinegar did not inactivate spores attached to cement or plywood plates even after 1 h. therefore, the surfaces of cement or  plywood plates were covered with gauze soaked in 0.5% hypochlorite containing vinegar, and the sporicidal effects were evaluated. b. atrophaeus spores attached to plywood plates were not inactivated even after 6 h, but those attached to cement plates were inactivated within 5 min. on the other hand, covering the surfaces of plywood plates with gauze soaked in 0.3% peracetic acid and gauze soaked in 2% glutaral inactivated b. atrophaeus spores within 5 min and 6 h, respectively. these results suggest that hypochlorite containing vinegar is effective for disinfecting vinyl chloride, tile, and cement plates contaminated with b. anthracis, and peracetic acid is effective for disinfecting plywood plates contaminated with such microorganism.

TI  == membrane translocation of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins from clostridium difficile and clostridium perfringens is facilitated by cyclophilin a and hsp90.
AB  == some hypervirulent strains of clostridium difficile produce the binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxin c. difficile transferase (cdt) in addition to rho-glucosylating toxins a and b. it has been suggested that the presence of cdt  increases the severity of c. difficile-associated diseases, including pseudomembranous colitis. cdt contains a binding and translocation component, cdtb, that mediates the transport of the separate enzyme component cdta into the  cytosol of target cells, where cdta modifies actin. here we investigated the mechanism of cellular cdt uptake and found that bafilomycin a1 protects cultured  epithelial cells from intoxication with cdt, implying that cdta is translocated from acidified endosomal vesicles into the cytosol. consistently, cdta is translocated across the cytoplasmic membranes into the cytosol when cell-bound cdt is exposed to acidic medium. radicicol and cyclosporine a, inhibitors of the  heat shock protein hsp90 and cyclophilins, respectively, protected cells from intoxication with cdt but not from intoxication with toxins a and b. moreover, both inhibitors blocked the ph-dependent membrane translocation of cdta, strongly suggesting that hsp90 and cyclophilin are crucial for this process. in contrast,  the inhibitors did not interfere with the adp-ribosyltransferase activity, receptor binding, or endocytosis of the toxin. we obtained comparable results with the closely related iota-toxin from clostridium perfringens. moreover, cdta  and ia, the enzyme component of iota-toxin, specifically bound to immobilized hsp90 and cyclophilin a in vitro. in combination with our recently obtained data  on the c2 toxin from c. botulinum, these results imply a common hsp90/cyclophilin a-dependent translocation mechanism for the family of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins.

TI  == quantitative mass spectrometry for bacterial protein toxins--a sensitive, specific, high-throughput tool for detection and diagnosis.
AB  == matrix-assisted laser-desorption time-of-flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry (ms) is a valuable high-throughput tool for peptide analysis. liquid chromatography electrospray ionization (lc-esi) tandem-ms provides sensitive and  specific quantification of small molecules and peptides. the high analytic power  of ms coupled with high-specificity substrates is ideally suited for detection and quantification of bacterial enzymatic activities. as specific examples of the ms applications in disease diagnosis and select agent detection, we describe recent advances in the analyses of two high profile protein toxin groups, the bacillus anthracis toxins and the clostridium botulinum neurotoxins. the two binary toxins produced by b. anthracis consist of protective antigen (pa) which combines with lethal factor (lf) and edema factor (ef), forming lethal toxin and  edema toxin respectively. lf is a zinc-dependent endoprotease which hydrolyzes specific proteins involved in inflammation and immunity. ef is an adenylyl cyclase which converts atp to cyclic-amp. toxin-specific enzyme activity for a strategically designed substrate, amplifies reaction products which are detected  by maldi-tof-ms and lc-esi-ms/ms. pre-concentration/purification with toxin specific monoclonal antibodies provides additional specificity. these combined technologies have achieved high specificity, ultrasensitive detection and quantification of the anthrax toxins. we also describe potential applications to  diseases of high public health impact, including clostridium difficile glucosylating toxins and the bordetella pertussis adenylyl cyclase.

TI  == small rnas in the genus clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. small rnas (srnas) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not  been investigated in clostridia. research on srnas in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify srna candidates, thus delegating clostridial srna research to a hit-and-miss process. thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential srnas in the clostridium genus to open up the field  of srna research in clostridia. using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted srnas in 21 clostridial genomes: clostridium acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum (eight strains), c. cellulolyticum, c. difficile, c. kluyveri (two strains), c. novyi, c. perfringens (three strains), c. phytofermentans, c. tetani, and c. thermocellum. although more than one-third of predicted srnas have shine-dalgarno (sd) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of sd sequences; thus, most of the predicted srnas are noncoding rnas. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (q-rt-pcr) and northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of srnas in c. acetobutylicum and several c. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested  srnas. we identified a conserved, novel srna which, together with the downstream  gene coding for an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. the number of predicted srnas correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic,  and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16s rrna-based phylogeny.

TI  == clostridial binary toxins: iota and c2 family portraits.
AB  == there are many pathogenic clostridium species with diverse virulence factors that include protein toxins. some of these bacteria, such as c. botulinum, c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. spiroforme, cause enteric problems in animals as well as humans. these often fatal diseases can partly be attributed to binary  protein toxins that follow a classic ab paradigm. within a targeted cell, all clostridial binary toxins destroy filamentous actin via mono-adp-ribosylation of  globular actin by the a component. however, much less is known about b component  binding to cell-surface receptors. these toxins share sequence homology amongst themselves and with those produced by another gram-positive, spore-forming bacterium also commonly associated with soil and disease: bacillus anthracis. this review focuses upon the iota and c2 families of clostridial binary toxins and includes: (1) basics of the bacterial source; (2) toxin biochemistry; (3) sophisticated cellular uptake machinery; and (4) host-cell responses following toxin-mediated disruption of the cytoskeleton. in summary, these protein toxins aid diverse enteric species within the genus clostridium.

TI  == from cosubstrate similarity to inhibitor diversity--inhibitors of adp-ribosyltransferases from kinase inhibitor screening.
AB  == adp-ribosyltransferases (adp-rts) use nad(+) to transfer an adp-ribosyl group to  target proteins. although some adp-rts are bacterial toxins only few inhibitors are known. here we present the development of fluorescence-based assays and a focussed library screening using kinase inhibitors as a new approach towards inhibitors of adp-rts. different screening setups were established using surrogate small molecule substrates or the quantitation of the cofactor nad(+). proof-of-principle screening experiments were performed using a kinase inhibitor  library in order to target the nad(+) binding pockets. this led to the discovery  of structurally different lead inhibitors for the mono-adp-ribosyltransferases mosquitocidal toxin (mtx) from bacillus sphaericus ssii-1, c3bot toxin from clostridium botulinum and cdta from clostridium difficile. the interaction of the inhibitors with the toxin proteins was analyzed by means of docking and binding free energy calculations. binding at the nicotinamide subpocket, which shows a significant difference in the three enzymes, is used to explain the selectivity of the identified inhibitors and offers an opportunity for further development of potent and selective inhibitors.

TI  == differential role of rho gtpases in intestinal epithelial barrier regulation in vitro.
AB  == maintenance of intestinal epithelial barrier functions is crucial to prevent systemic contamination by microbes that penetrate from the gut lumen. gtpases of  the rho-family such as rhoa, rac1, and cdc42 are known to be critically involved  in the regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier functions. however, it is still unclear whether inactivation or activation of these gtpases exerts barrier  protection or not. we tested the effects of rho gtpase activities on intestinal epithelial barrier functions by using the bacterial toxins cytotoxic necrotizing  factor 1 (cnf-1), toxin b, c3 transferase (c3 tf), and lethal toxin (lt) in an in vitro model of the intestinal epithelial barrier. incubation of cell monolayers with cnf-1 for 3 h induced exclusive activation of rhoa whereas rac1 and cdc42 activities were unchanged. as revealed by fitc-dextran flux and measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance (ter) intestinal epithelial permeability was significantly increased under these conditions. inhibition of rho kinase via  y27632 blocked barrier destabilization of cnf-1 after 3 h. in contrast, after 24  h of incubation with cnf-1 only rac1 and cdc42 but not rhoa were activated which  resulted in intestinal epithelial barrier stabilization. toxin b to inactivate rhoa, rac1, and cdc42 as well as rac1 inhibitor lt increased intestinal epithelial permeability. similar effects were observed after inhibition of rhoa/rho kinase signaling by c3 tf or y27632. taken together, these data demonstrate that both activation and inactivation of rhoa signaling increased paracellular permeability whereas activation of rac1 and cdc42 correlated with stabilized barrier functions.

TI  == inhibition of rho-rock signaling induces apoptotic and non-apoptotic ps exposure  in cardiomyocytes via inhibition of flippase.
AB  == subsequent to myocardial infarction, cardiomyocytes within the infarcted areas and border zones expose phosphatidylserine (ps) in the outer plasma membrane leaflet (flip-flop). we showed earlier that in addition to apoptosis, this flip-flop can be reversible in cardiomyocytes. we now investigated a possible role for rho and downstream effector rho-associated kinase (rock) in the process  of (reversible) ps exposure and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes. in rat cardiomyoblasts (h9c2 cells) and isolated adult ventricular rat cardiomyocytes clostridium difficile toxin b (tcdb), a rho gtpase family inhibitor, c3 transferase (c3), a rho(a,b,c) inhibitor and the rock inhibitors y27632 and h1152 were used to inhibit rho-rock signaling. ps exposure was assessed via flow cytometry and fluorescent digital imaging microscopy using annexin v. akt expression and phosphorylation were analyzed via western blot, and akt activity was inhibited by wortmannin. the cellular concentration activated caspase 3 was determined as a measure of apoptosis, and flippase activity was assessed via flow cytometry using nbd-labeled ps. tcdb, c3, y27632 and h1152 all significantly increased ps exposure. tcdb, y27632 and h1152 all significantly inhibited phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein akt and akt inhibition by wortmannin lead to increased ps exposure. however, only tcdb and c3, but not rock- or akt inhibition led to caspase 3 activation and thus apoptosis. notably,  pancaspase inhibitor zvad only partially inhibited tcdb-induced ps exposure indicating the existence of apoptotic and non-apoptotic ps exposure. the induced  ps exposure coincided with decreased flippase activity as measured with nbd-labeled ps flip-flop. in this study, we show a regulatory role for a novel signaling route, rho-rock-flippase signaling, in maintaining asymmetrical membrane phospholipid distribution in cardiomyocytes.

TI  == clostron-targeted mutagenesis.
AB  == members of the genus clostridium have long been recognised as important to humankind and its animals, both in terms of the diseases they cause and the useful biological processes they undertake. this has led to increasing efforts directed at deriving greater information on their basic biology, most notably through genome sequence. accordingly, annotated sequences of all of the most important species are now available. however, full exploitation of the data generated has been hindered by the lack of mutational tools that may be used in functional genomic studies. thus, the number of clostridial mutants generated has until recently been disappointingly small. in particular, the construction of directed mutants using classical homologous recombination-based methods has met with only limited success. moreover, most of these few mutants were constructed by the unstable integration of a plasmid into the chromosome via a single crossover event. as an alternative, recombination-independent strategies have been devised that are reliant upon a re-targeted group ii intron. one element in  particular, the clostron, provides the facility for the positive selection of insertional mutants. the generation of mutants using the clostron is extremely rapid (as little as 10 days) and is highly efficient and reproducible. furthermore, the insertions made are extremely stable. its deployment has considerably expanded available options for clostridial functional genomic studies.

AB  == tumor endothelial marker (tem) 5 is an adhesion g-protein-coupled receptor upregulated in endothelial cells during tumor and physiologic angiogenesis. so far, the mechanisms leading to upregulation of tem5 and its function during angiogenesis have not been identified. here, we report that tem5 expression in endothelial cells is induced during capillary-like network formation on matrigel, during capillary morphogenesis in a three-dimensional collagen i matrix, and upon confluence on a two-dimensional matrix. tem5 expression was not induced by a variety of soluble angiogenic factors, including vegf and bfgf, in subconfluent endothelial cells. tem5 upregulation was blocked by toxin b from clostridium difficile, an inhibitor of the small gtpases rho, rac, and cdc42. the rho inhibitor c3 transferase from clostridium botulinum did not affect tem5 expression, whereas the rac inhibitor nsc23766 suppressed tem5 upregulation. an excess of the soluble tem5 extracellular domain or an inhibitory monoclonal tem5  antibody blocked contact inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation resulting in multilayered islands within the endothelial monolayer and increased vessel density during capillary formation. based on our results we conclude that tem5 expression during capillary morphogenesis is induced by the small gtpase rac and  mediates contact inhibition of proliferation in endothelial cells.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxin cdt induces formation of microtubule-based protrusions and increases adherence of bacteria.
AB  == clostridium difficile causes antibiotic-associated diarrhea and pseudomembranous  colitis by production of the rho gtpase-glucosylating toxins a and b. recently emerging hypervirulent clostridium difficile strains additionally produce the binary adp-ribosyltransferase toxin cdt (clostridium difficile transferase), which adp-ribosylates actin and inhibits actin polymerization. thus far, the role of cdt as a virulence factor is not understood. here we report by using time-lapse- and immunofluorescence microscopy that cdt and other binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins, including clostridium botulinum c2 toxin and clostridium perfringens iota toxin, induce redistribution of microtubules and formation of long (up to >150 microm) microtubule-based protrusions at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. the toxins increase the length of decoration of microtubule plus-ends by eb1/3, clip-170 and clip-115 proteins and  cause redistribution of the capture proteins clasp2 and acf7 from microtubules at the cell cortex into the cell interior. the cdt-induced microtubule protrusions form a dense meshwork at the cell surface, which wrap and embed bacterial cells,  thereby largely increasing the adherence of clostridia. the study describes a novel type of microtubule structure caused by less efficient microtubule capture  and offers a new perspective for the pathogenetic role of cdt and other binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins in host-pathogen interactions.

TI  == phosphodiesterase 4b2 gene is an effector of toll-like receptor signaling in astrocytes.
AB  == cyclic amp is part of an endogenous mechanism that downregulates inflammatory response, and its intracellular concentration is regulated chiefly by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases type 4. the goal of the present study was to determine whether phosphodiesterases 4 are involved in the inflammatory response  of astrocytes mediated by toll-like receptors. astrocyte cultures established from newborn rat brain were challenged with lipoteichoic acid, a ligand of toll-like receptor 2, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, a ligand of toll-like receptor 3, or lipopolysaccharide, a ligand of toll-like receptor 4. after 24 h the expression of genes encoding phosphodiesterase 4a, phosphodiesterase 4b and phosphodiesterase 4d was determined by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. the challenge of astrocytes with the ligands profoundly up-regulated expression of the phosphodiesterase 4b mrna, while the phosphodiesterase 4a and 4d mrna was either unaffected or downregulated. moreover, toll-like receptor ligation specifically up-regulated expression of the phosphodiesterase 4b2 transcriptional variant. thus, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid induced approximately 7-, 5- and 4-fold up-regulation of the message, respectively. toll-like receptor ligation also led to an over 2-fold increase in the protein level of phosphodiesterase 4b2 as revealed by immunoblot analysis. the inactivation of rho proteins by pretreatment with toxin b form c. difficile enhanced ligation-induced up-regulation of the phosphodiesterase 4b2 message by 4-9-fold. however, in spite of this increase in the message abundance, there was no increase in the protein level compared to cells challenged with the ligands alone. these results demonstrate that the phosphodiesterase 4b2 gene is an effector of toll-like receptor signaling in astrocytes, and that its up-regulation at the protein level is controlled by complex mechanisms.

AB  == the ability to form botulinum neurotoxin is restricted to six phylogenetically and physiologically distinct bacteria (clostridium botulinum groups i-iv and some strains of c. baratii and c. butyricum). the botulinum neurotoxin is the most potent toxin known, with as little as 30-100 ng potentially fatal, and is responsible for botulism, a severe neuroparalytic disease that affects humans, animals, and birds. in order to minimize the hazards presented by the botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia, it is necessary to extend understanding of the biology of these bacteria. analyses of recently available genome sequences in conjunction with studies of bacterial physiology are beginning to reveal new and  exciting information on the biology of these dangerous bacteria. at the whole organism level, substantial differences between the six botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia have been reported. for example, the genomes of proteolytic c. botulinum (c. botulinum group i) and non-proteolytic c. botulinum  (c. botulinum group ii) are highly diverged and show neither synteny nor homology. it has also emerged that the botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia are not overtly pathogenic (unlike c. difficile), but saprophytic bacteria that use the neurotoxin to kill a host and create a source of nutrients. one important feature that has contributed to the success of botulinum neurotoxin-forming clostridia is their ability to form highly resistant endospores. the spores, however, also present an opportunity to control these bacteria if escape from lag phase (and hence growth) can be prevented. this is dependent on extending understanding of the biology of these processes. differences in the genetics and  physiology of spore germination in proteolytic c. botulinum and non-proteolytic c. botulinum have been identified. the biological variability in lag phase and its stages has been described for individual spores, and it has been shown that various adverse treatments extend different stages of lag phase. for example, heat treatment primarily extended germination, while incubation at a chilled temperature primarily extended outgrowth. the neurotoxin gene is present within a cluster of associated genes, and can be located on the chromosome, a plasmid or a bacteriophage. two basic types of neurotoxin cluster have been identified. evolution of the neurotoxin gene and cluster has occurred independently of the organism, and involved a series of recombination events but is still poorly understood. factors affecting the regulation of neurotoxin formation also remain  poorly understood, and will be the focus of much future research.

TI  == rho-family gtpases modulate ca(2+) -dependent atp release from astrocytes.
AB  == previously, we reported that activation of g protein-coupled receptors (gpcr) in  1321n1 human astrocytoma cells elicits a rapid release of atp that is partially dependent on a g(q)/phophospholipase c (plc)/ca(2+) mobilization signaling cascade. in this study we assessed the role of rho-family gtpase signaling as an  additional pathway for the regulation of atp release in response to activation of protease-activated receptor-1 (par1), lysophosphatidic acid receptor (lpar), and  m3-muscarinic (m3r) gpcrs. thrombin (or other par1 peptide agonists), lpa, and carbachol triggered quantitatively similar ca(2+) mobilization responses, but only thrombin and lpa caused rapid accumulation of active gtp-bound rho. the ability to elicit rho activation correlated with the markedly higher efficacy of  thrombin and lpa, relative to carbachol, as atp secretagogues. clostridium difficile toxin b and clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme, which inhibit rho-gtpases, attenuated the thrombin- and lpa-stimulated atp release but did not  decrease carbachol-stimulated release. thus the ability of certain g(q)-coupled receptors to additionally stimulate rho-gtpases acts to strongly potentiate a ca(2+)-activated atp release pathway. however, pharmacological inhibition of rho  kinase i/ii or myosin light chain kinase did not attenuate atp release. par1-induced atp release was also reduced twofold by brefeldin treatment suggesting the possible mobilization of golgi-derived, atp-containing secretory vesicles. atp release was also markedly repressed by the gap junction channel inhibitor carbenoxolone in the absence of any obvious thrombin-induced change in  membrane permeability indicative of hemichannel gating.

TI  == binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins and their use as molecular trojan horses for drug delivery into eukaryotic cells.
AB  == binary bacterial toxins are unique ab-type toxins, composed of two non-linked proteins that act as a binding/translocation component and an enzyme component. all known actin-adp-ribosylating toxins from clostridia possess this binary structure. this toxin family is comprised of the prototypical clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridium perfringens iota toxin, clostridium difficile cdt, and clostridium spiroforme toxin. once in the cytosol of host cells, these toxins transfer an adp-ribose moiety from nicotinamide-adenosine-dinucleotide onto g-actin that then leads to depolymerization of actin filaments. in recent years much progress has been made towards understanding the cellular uptake mechanism of binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins, and in particular that of c2 toxin. both components act in a precisely concerted manner to intoxicate eukaryotic cells. the binding/translocation (b-) component forms a complex with the enzyme (a-) component and mediates toxin binding to a cell-surface receptor.  following receptor-mediated endocytosis, the enzyme component escapes from acidic endosomes into the cytosol. acidification of endosomes triggers pore formation by the binding/translocation component in endosomal membranes and the enzyme component subsequently translocates through the pore. this step requires a host cell chaperone, hsp90. due to their unique structure, binary toxins are naturally "tailor made" for transporting foreign proteins into the cytosol of host cells. several highly specific and cell-permeable recombinant fusion proteins have been  designed and successfully used in experimental cell research. this review will focus on the recent progress in studying binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins as  highly effective virulence factors and innovative tools for cell physiology as well as pharmacology.

AB  == a family of gtp-binding proteins, rho, plays critical roles in cell migration, morphological change, cytokinesis, and smooth muscle contraction. furthermore, evidence has recently been accumulating for an involvement in regulation of receptor-operated ionic channels. we previously reported that stimulation of d1-like receptor by dopamine (da) induces a slow na+ current response in the identified neurons of aplysia under voltage-clamp. to further study a regulatory  mechanism of the da-induced response, we examined possible involvement of small g-proteins and subsequent enzymes. the na+ current response to da was gradually and irreversibly depressed after the intracellular injection of either clostridium difficile toxin b, an inhibitor for all rho family g-proteins, or clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme, a specific blocker for rhoa-c. intacellular injection of active rhoa had no significant effect on the response. however, injection of gap domain of p50rhogap significantly depressed the da-induced response, while application of gef domain of rhogef dbs increased the response. in addition, either intracellular injection of alpha-synuclein or extracellular application of 1-butanol, inhibitors for phospholipase d (pld), significantly depressed the da-induced response. these results suggest that the da-induced na+  current response may be facilitated by the activation of rho family g-protein rhob or c but not rhoa, and subsequent pld.

TI  == yersinia controls type iii effector delivery into host cells by modulating rho activity.
AB  == yersinia pseudotuberculosis binds to beta1 integrin receptors, and uses the type  iii secretion proteins yopb and yopd to introduce pores and to translocate yop effectors directly into host cells. y. pseudotuberculosis lacking effectors that  inhibit rho gtpases, yope and yopt, have high pore forming activity. here, we present evidence that y. pseudotuberculosis selectively modulates rho activity to induce cellular changes that control pore formation and effector translocation. inhibition of actin polymerization decreased pore formation and yope translocation in hela cells infected with y. pseudotuberculosis. inactivation of  rho, rac, and cdc42 by treatment with clostridium difficile toxin b inhibited pore formation and yope translocation in infected hela cells. expression of a dominant negative form of rac did not reduce the uptake of membrane impermeable dyes in hela cells infected with a pore forming strain yopehjt(-). similarly, the rac inhibitor nsc23766 did not decrease pore formation or translocation, although it efficiently hindered rac-dependent bacterial uptake. in contrast, c. botulinum c3 potently reduced pore formation and translocation, implicating rho a, b, and/or c in the control of the yop delivery. an invasin mutant (y. pseudotuberculosis invd911e) that binds to beta1 integrins, but inefficiently transduces signals through the receptors, was defective for yope translocation. interfering with the beta1 integrin signaling pathway, by inhibiting src kinase activity, negatively affected yope translocation. additionally, y. pseudotuberculosis infection activated rho by a mechanism that was dependent on yopb and on high affinity bacteria interaction with beta1 integrin receptors. we  propose that rho activation, mediated by signals triggered by the yopb/yopd translocon and from engagement of beta1 integrin receptors, stimulates actin polymerization and activates the translocation process, and that once the yops are translocated, the action of yope or yopt terminate delivery of yops and prevents pore formation.

AB  == progress in exploiting clostridial genome information has been severely impeded by a general lack of effective methods for the directed inactivation of specific  genes. those few mutants that have been generated have been almost exclusively derived by single crossover integration of a replication-deficient or defective plasmid by homologous recombination. the mutants created are therefore unstable.  here we have adapted a mutagenesis system based on the mobile group ii intron from the ltrb gene of lactococcus lactis (ll.ltrb) to function in clostridial hosts. integrants are readily selected on the basis of acquisition of resistance  to erythromycin, and are generated from start to finish in as little as 10 to 14  days. unlike single crossover plasmid integrants, the mutants are extremely stable. the system has been used to make 6 mutants of clostridium acetobutylicum  and 5 of clostridium difficile, exceeding the number of published mutants ever generated in these species. genes have also been inactivated for the first time in clostridium botulinum and clostridium sporogenes, suggesting the system will be universally applicable to the genus. the procedure is highly efficient and reproducible, and should revolutionize functional genomic studies in clostridia.

TI  == inactivation of rho gtpases with clostridium difficile toxin b impairs centrosomal activation of aurora-a in g2/m transition of hela cells.
AB  == during g2 phase of cell cycle, centrosomes function as a scaffold for activation  of mitotic kinases. aurora-a is first activated at late g2 phase at the centrosome, facilitates centrosome maturation, and induces activation of cyclin b-cdk1 at the centrosome for mitotic entry. although several molecules including  hef1 and pak are implicated in centrosomal activation of aurora-a, signaling pathways leading to aurora-a activation at the centrosome, and hence mitotic commitment in vertebrate cells remains largely unknown. here, we have used clostridium difficile toxin b and examined the role of rho gtpases in g2/m transition of hela cells. inactivation of rho gtpases by the toxin b treatment delayed by 2 h histone h3 phosphorylation, cdk1/cyclin b activation, and aurora-a activation. furthermore, pak activation at the centrosome that was already present before the toxin addition was significantly attenuated for 2 h by the addition of toxin b, and hef1 accumulation at the centrosome that occurred in late g2 phase was also delayed. these results suggest that rho gtpases function in g2/m transition of mammalian cells by mediating multiple signaling pathways converging to centrosomal activation of aurora-a.

TI  == genome sequence of a proteolytic (group i) clostridium botulinum strain hall a and comparative analysis of the clostridial genomes.
AB  == clostridium botulinum is a heterogeneous gram-positive species that comprises four genetically and physiologically distinct groups of bacteria that share the ability to produce botulinum neurotoxin, the most poisonous toxin known to man, and the causative agent of botulism, a severe disease of humans and animals. we report here the complete genome sequence of a representative of group i (proteolytic) c. botulinum (strain hall a, atcc 3502). the genome consists of a chromosome (3,886,916 bp) and a plasmid (16,344 bp), which carry 3650 and 19 predicted genes, respectively. consistent with the proteolytic phenotype of this  strain, the genome harbors a large number of genes encoding secreted proteases and enzymes involved in uptake and metabolism of amino acids. the genome also reveals a hitherto unknown ability of c. botulinum to degrade chitin. there is a  significant lack of recently acquired dna, indicating a stable genomic content, in strong contrast to the fluid genome of clostridium difficile, which can form longer-term relationships with its host. overall, the genome indicates that c. botulinum is adapted to a saprophytic lifestyle both in soil and aquatic environments. this pathogen relies on its toxin to rapidly kill a wide range of prey species, and to gain access to nutrient sources, it releases a large number  of extracellular enzymes to soften and destroy rotting or decayed tissues.

TI  == rac1, rhoa, and cdc42 participate in hela cell invasion by group b streptococcus.
AB  == the group b streptococcus (gbs) is an important human pathogen with the ability to cause invasive disease. to do so, the bacteria must invade host cells. it has  been well documented that gbs are able to invade a variety of nonphagocytic host  cell types, and this process is thought to involve a number of pathogen-host cell interactions. while some of the molecular aspects of the gbs-host cell invasion process have been characterized, many events still remain unclear. the objective  of this investigation was to evaluate the role of the rho-family gtpases rac, rho, and cdc42 in gbs invasion into epithelial cells. the epithelial cell invasion process was modeled using hela 229 cell culture. treatment of hela cells with 10 microm compactin, a pan-gtpase inhibitor, abolished gbs internalization,  suggesting that gtpases are involved in the gbs invasion process. the addition of toxin b or exoenzyme c3 to hela cells before gbs infection reduced invasion by 50%, further suggesting that the rho-family gtpases are involved in gbs entry. examining invasion of gbs into hela cells with altered genetic backgrounds was used to confirm these findings; gbs invasion into hela cells transiently transfected with dominant negative rac1, cdc42, or rhoa reduced invasion by 75%,  51%, and 42%, respectively. results of this study suggest that the rho-family gtpases are required for efficient invasion of hela cells by gbs.

TI  == upregulation of the immediate early gene product rhob by exoenzyme c3 from clostridium limosum and toxin b from clostridium difficile.
AB  == adp-ribosylation of rho(a,b,c) by the family of exoenzyme c3-like transferases induces reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton based on inactivation of rhoa. no data are available on the role of rhob in c3-treated cells. in murine fibroblasts treated with the cell-permeable exoenzyme c3 from clostridium limosum (c3), an increase in the level of rhob was observed. this upregulation of rhob was based on transcriptional activation, as it was responsive to inhibition by actinomycin d and accompanied by activation of the rhob promoter. upregulation of rhob was not observed in cells treated with either the actin adp-ribosylating c2  toxin from clostridium botulinum or latrunculin b, suggesting that inactivation of rho but not actin reorganization was required for the upregulation of rhob. this notion was confirmed, as the rho/rac/cdc42-glucosylating toxin b from clostridium difficile (tcdb) but not the rac/r-ras-glucosylating variant toxin b  from c. difficile strain 1470 serotype f (tcdbf) induced a strong upregulation of rhob. upregulation of rhob was further observed in response to the rac/(h-,k-,n-,r-)ras-glucosylating lethal toxin from clostridium sordellii. the level of active, gtp-bound rhob was increased in tcdb-treated cells compared to untreated cells (as determined by rhotekin pull-down assay). in contrast, no active rhob was found in c3-treated cells. rhob-gtp was required for the tcdb-induced apoptosis (cytotoxic effect), as this effect was responsive to inhibition by c3. in conclusion, rhob was upregulated by rho-/ras-inactivating toxins, as a consequence of the inactivation of either rho(a,b,c) or (h-,k-,n-)ras. in tcdb-treated cells, rhob escaped its inactivation and was required for the cytotoxic effect.

TI  == tlr2 transmodulates monocyte adhesion and transmigration via rac1- and pi3k-mediated inside-out signaling in response to porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae.
AB  == we present evidence for a novel tlr2 function in transmodulating the adhesive activities of human monocytes in response to the fimbriae of porphyromonas gingivalis, a pathogen implicated in chronic periodontitis and atherosclerosis. monocyte recruitment into the subendothelium is a crucial step in atherosclerosis, and we investigated the role of p. gingivalis fimbriae in stimulating monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells and transendothelial migration. fimbriae induced cd11b/cd18-dependent adhesion of human monocytes or mouse macrophages to endothelial receptor icam-1; these activities were inhibited by tlr2 blockade or deficiency or by pharmacological inhibitors of pi3k. moreover, this inducible adhesive activity was sensitive to the action of clostridium difficile toxin b, but was not affected by clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme, pertussis toxin, or cholera toxin. accordingly, we subsequently showed through the use of dominant negative signaling mutants of small gtpases, that rac1 mediates the ability of fimbria-stimulated monocytes to bind icam-1. a dominant negative mutant of rac1 also inhibited the lipid kinase activity of pi3k suggesting that rac1 acts upstream of pi3k in this proadhesive pathway. furthermore, fimbriae stimulated monocyte adhesion to huvec and transmigration across huvec monolayers; both activities required tlr2 and rac1 signaling and were dependent upon icam-1 and the high-affinity state of cd11b/cd18. p. gingivalis-stimulated monocytes displayed enhanced transendothelial migration compared with monocytes stimulated with nonfimbriated isogenic mutants. thus, p.  gingivalis fimbriae activate a novel proadhesive pathway in human monocytes, involving tlr2, rac1, pi3k, and cd11b/cd18, which may constitute a mechanistic basis linking p. gingivalis to inflammatory atherosclerotic processes.

TI  == organization and regulation of the neurotoxin genes in clostridium botulinum and  clostridium tetani.
AB  == botulinum and tetanus neurotoxins are structurally and functionally related 150 kda proteins that are potent inhibitors of neuroexocytosis. botulinum neurotoxin  associates with non-toxic proteins to form complexes of various sizes. the botulinum neurotoxin and non-toxic protein genes are clustered in a dna segment called the botulinum locus. this locus is probably located on a mobile or degenerate mobile element, which accounts for the various genomic localizations (chromosome, plasmid, phage) in different clostridium botulinum types. the botulinum neurotoxin and non-toxic protein genes are organized in two polycistronic operons (ntnh-bont and ha operons) transcribed in opposite orientations. the gene that separates the two operons of the botulinum locus in c. botulinum a encodes a 21 kda protein botr/a, which is a positive regulator of  the expression of the botulinum locus genes. similarly, in clostridium tetani, the gene located immediately upstream of the tetanus toxin gene, encodes a positive regulatory protein, tetr. botr and tetr are possibly alternative sigma factors related to txer and uvia, which regulate c. difficile toxin and c. perfringens bacteriocin production, respectively. txer and uvia define a new sub-group of the sigma(70) family of rna polymerase initiation factors. in addition, the c. botulinum genome contains predicted two-component system genes,  some of which are possibly involved in regulation of toxinogenesis.

TI  == insights in metabolism and toxin production from the complete genome sequence of  clostridium tetani.
AB  == the decryption of prokaryotic genome sequences progresses rapidly and provides the scientific community with an enormous amount of information. clostridial genome sequencing projects have been finished only recently, starting with the genome of the solvent-producing clostridium acetobutylicum in 2001. a lot of attention has been devoted to the genomes of pathogenic clostridia. in 2002, the  genome sequence of c. perfringens, the causative agent of gas gangrene, has been  released. currently in the finishing stage and prior to publication are the genomes of the foodborne botulism-causing c. botulinum and of c. difficile, the causative agent of a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations such as antibiotic-associated diarrhea. our team sequenced the genome of neuropathogenic  c. tetani, a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium predominantly found in the soil. in deep wound infections it occasionally causes spastic paralysis in humans and vertebrate animals, known as tetanus disease, by the secretion of potent neurotoxin, designated tetanus toxin. the toxin blocks the release of neurotransmitters from presynaptic membranes of interneurons of the spinal cord and the brainstem, thus preventing muscle relaxation. fortunately, this disease is successfully controlled through immunization with tetanus toxoid, a formaldehyde-treated tetanus toxin, but nevertheless, an estimated 400,000 cases  still occur each year, mainly of neonatal tetanus. the world health organization  has stated that neonatal tetanus is the second leading cause of death from vaccine preventable diseases among children worldwide. this minireview focuses on an analysis of the genome sequence of c. tetani e88, a vaccine production strain, which is a toxigenic non-sporulating variant of strain massachusetts. the genome  consists of a 2,799,250 bp chromosome encoding 2618 open reading frames. the tetanus toxin is encoded on a 74,082 kb plasmid, containing 61 genes. additional  virulence-related factors as well as an insight into the metabolic strategy of c. tetani with regard to its pathogenic phenotype will be presented. the information from other clostridial genomes by means of comparative analysis will also be explored.

TI  == regulation of toxin and bacteriocin gene expression in clostridium by interchangeable rna polymerase sigma factors.
AB  == the production of major extracellular toxins by pathogenic strains of clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani and clostridium difficile, and a bacteriocin by clostridium perfringens is dependent on a related group of rna polymerase sigma-factors. these sigma-factors (botr, tetr, tcdr and uvia) were shown to be sufficiently similar that they could substitute for one another in in vitro dna binding and run-off transcription experiments. in cells, however, the sigma-factors fell into two subclasses. botr and tetr were able to direct transcription of their target genes in a fully reciprocal manner. similarly, uvia and tcdr were fully interchangeable. neither botr nor tetr could substitute for uvia or tcdr, however, and neither uvia nor tcdr could direct transcription of the natural targets of botr or tetr. the extent of functional interchangeability  of the sigma-factors was attributed to the strong conservation of their subregion 4.2 sequences and the conserved -35 sequences of their target promoters, while restrictions on interchangeability were attributed to variations in their subregion 2.4 sequences and the target site -10 sequences. the four sigma-factors have been assigned to group 5 of the sigma(70) family and seem to have arisen from a common ancestral protein that may have co-evolved with the genes whose transcription they direct. a fifth clostridiumsigma-factor, sigma(y) of clostridium acetobutylicum, resembles the tcdr family, but was not functionally interchangeable with members of this family.

TI  == centaureidin promotes dendrite retraction of melanocytes by activating rho.
AB  == melanosomes synthesized within melanocytes are transferred to keratinocytes through dendrites, resulting in a constant supply of melanin to the epidermis, and this process determines skin pigmentation. during screening for inhibitors of melanosome transfer, we found a novel reagent, centaureidin, that induces significant morphological changes in normal human epidermal melanocytes and inhibits melanocyte dendrite elongation, resulting in a reduction of melanosome transfer in an in vitro melanocyte-keratinocyte co-culture system. since members  of the rho family of small gtp-binding proteins act as master regulators of dendrite formation, and activated rho promotes dendrite retraction, we studied the effects of centaureidin on the small gtpases. in in vitro binding assay, centaureidin activated rho and furthermore, a rho inhibitor (c. botulinum c3 exoenzyme), a rho kinase inhibitor (y27632) and a small gtpase inhibitor (toxin b) blocked dendrite retraction induced by centaureidin. these results suggest centaureidin could act via the rho signaling pathway, and it may directly or indirectly activate rho. thus, centaureidin appears to inhibit dendrite outgrowth from melanocytes by activating rho, resulting in the inhibition of melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes.

TI  == regulation of toxin and bacteriocin synthesis in clostridium species by a new subgroup of rna polymerase sigma-factors.
AB  == many clostridium species are pathogenic for humans and animals, and most of the resulting diseases, such as tetanus, botulism, gas gangrene and pseudomembranous  colitis, are due to the production of potent extracellular toxins. the biochemical mechanisms of action of clostridium toxins have been extensively studied in the past ten years. however, detailed information about the regulation of toxin gene expression has only recently emerged. tcdr, botr, tetr and uvia are now known to be related alternative rna polymerase sigma factors that drive transcription of toxin a and toxin b genes in c. difficile, the neurotoxin genes  in c. botulinum and c. tetani, and a bacteriocin gene in c. perfringens. although the clostridium sigma factors have some similarity to members of the ecf sigma factor group, they differ sufficiently in structure and function so that they have been assigned to a new group within the sigma(70)-family.

AB  == to investigate the role of the monomeric guanosine triphosphatase (gtpase) rho on migration of hematopoietic progenitor cells (hpc), we employed different clostridial toxins which inhibit the rho family of gtpases. pretreatment with c2i-c3, a cell-accessible c3 transferase fusion protein that targets rho, increased chemokinetic migration of the factor-dependent multipotent cell line factor dependent cell paterson with mixed lineage differentiation potential (fdcp-mix) and of primary lineage marker-depleted hpc in vitro. in contrast, treatment with lethal toxin (lt) from clostridium sordellii, which predominantly  inactivates rac, and with toxin b from c. difficile, which inactivates rho, rac and cdc42, decreased in vitro migration. when hpc pretreated with lt or toxin b were transplanted into mice, homing to the bone marrow was impaired, whereas c2i-c3 treatment did not alter hpc homing. however, in a competitive hematopoietic repopulation experiment in c57bl/6 mice, pretreatment of bone marrow cells with any of the inhibitors, including the rho inhibitor c2i-c3, resulted in suppressed donor-type hematopoiesis. our data indicate that whereas rac supports hpc cell cycling, migration, short-term homing and hematopoietic regeneration, rho coordinates down-regulation of hpc migration and is required for hematopoietic regeneration.

TI  == botr/a and tetr are alternative rna polymerase sigma factors controlling the expression of the neurotoxin and associated protein genes in clostridium botulinum type a and clostridium tetani.
AB  == clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani, respectively, produce potent toxins, botulinum neurotoxin (bont) and tetanus neurotoxin (tetx), which are responsible for severe diseases, botulism and tetanus. neurotoxin synthesis is a  regulated process in clostridium. the genes botr/a in c. botulinum a and tetr in  c. tetani positively regulate expression of bont/a and associated non-toxic proteins (antps), as well as tetx respectively. the botr/a gene lies in close vicinity of the two operons which contain bont/a and antps genes in c. botulinum  a, and tetr immediately precedes the tetx gene in c. tetani. we show that botr/a  and tetr function as specific alternative sigma factors rather than positive regulators based on the following results: (i) botr/a and tetr associated with target dnas only in the presence of the rna polymerase core enzyme (core), (ii) botr/a and tetr directly bound with the core enzyme, (iii) botr/a-core recognized -35 and -10 regions of ntnh-bont/a promoter and (iv) botr/a and tetr triggered in vitro transcription from the target promoters. in c. botulinum a, bont/a and antps genes are transcribed as bi- and tricistronic operons controlled by botr/a. botr/a and tetr are seemingly related to a new subgroup of the sigma70 family that includes tcdr and uvia, which, respectively, regulate production of toxins a and b in c. difficile and bacteriocin in c. perfringens. sequences of -35 region  are highly conserved in the promoter of target toxin genes in c. botulinum, c. tetani, c. difficile and c. perfringens. overall, a common regulation mechanism probably controls toxin gene expression in these four toxigenic clostridial species.

TI  == lysophospholipids increase icam-1 expression in huvec through a gi- and nf-kappab-dependent mechanism.
AB  == lysophosphatidic acid (lpa) and sphingosine 1-phosphate (s-1-p) are both low molecular weight lysophospholipid (lpl) ligands that are recognized by the edg family of g protein-coupled receptors. in endothelial cells, these two ligands activate edg receptors, resulting in cell proliferation and cell migration. the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (icam-1, cd54) is one of many cell adhesion molecules belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily. this study showed that lpa and s-1-p enhance icam-1 expression at both the mrna and protein levels in human  umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (huvecs). this enhanced icam-1 expression in huvecs was first observed at 2 h postligand treatment. maximal expression appeared at 8 h postligand treatment, as detected by flow cytometry and western blotting. furthermore, the effects of s-1-p on icam-1 expression were shown to be concentration dependent. prior treatment of huvecs with pertussis toxin, a specific inhibitor of g(i), ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate and bay 11-7082,  inhibitors of the nuclear factor (nf)-kappab pathway, or clostridium difficile toxin b, an inhibitor of rac, prevented the enhanced effect of lpl-induced icam-1 expression. however, pretreatment of huvecs with exoc3, an inhibitor of rho, had  no effect on s-1-p-enhanced icam-1 expression. in a static cell-cell adhesion assay system, pretreatment of lpl enhanced the adhesion between huvecs and u-937  cells, a human mononucleated cell line. the enhanced adhesion effect could be prevented by preincubation with a functional blocking antibody against human icam-1. these results suggest that lpls released by activated platelets might enhance interactions of leukocytes with the endothelium through a g(i)-, nf-kappab-, and possibly rac-dependent mechanism, thus facilitating wound healing and inflammation processes.

TI  == [sudden death of twins: botulism because of contamination by pap vegetables].
AB  == botulism is caused by the blockage of the neural transmission in the cholinergic  synapses by botulinum neurotoxin (bont) which is produced by clostridium botulinum or other clostridia. the classic form of botulism occurs after the ingestion of food contaminated by bont. the course of the infection can be asymptomatic, mild with subtle paralysis ("failure to thrive") oder severe with generalized paralysis ("floppy infant"). infected infants can also die sudden and unexpectedly. these deaths often are attributed to sudden infant death syndrome (sids), unless a thorough postmortem examination reveals botulism. the rate of fatal botulism falsely attributed to sids is not known, because it is difficult in most cases to show the causal relationship between contamination, disease and  death. we report the sudden and unexpected simultaneous death of twins of 22 months which could be attributed to botulism. contamination of food, colonization of the gut by clostridia and infection with specific pathomorphological changes could be proven. the initial suspicion of infanticide could be excluded. lt could be shown, that botulism is a potential cause of simultaneous unexpected deaths in twins.

AB  == the current study was designed to characterize the role of rho and rho-dependent  kinase (rho-kinase) in isometric contractile responses induced by serotonin (5-ht) and a solution containing 40 mm k(+) (high k(+)) in ring preparations of the middle cerebral artery of bovine. application of w-7, a ca(2+)-calmodulin inhibitor, reversibly and equally attenuated the amplitudes of contractions produced by both 5-ht and high k(+). similar effects were observed with ml-7, an  inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase. surprisingly, the protein kinase c inhibitors, calphostin c and ro-31-8220, had no effect on the 5-ht-induced contraction. incubation of preparations with clostridium difficile toxin a and b  or with clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme for 48 hours attenuated the 5-ht-induced response but not the high k(+)-induced response. application of the  rho-kinase inhibitor, y-27632, resulted in marked inhibition of the 5-ht-induced  response but had negligible effect on the high k(+)-induced response. these results suggest that the activation of rho and rho-kinase may be involved in the  generation of the contraction produced by 5-ht in the bovine middle cerebral artery, while protein kinase c plays, if any, an insignificant role on the contraction.

TI  == the small gtp-binding protein rhoa regulates serotonin-induced na+-current response in the neurons of aplysia.
AB  == application of serotonin (5-ht) induces a slow inward current response in identified neurons of aplysia ganglia under voltage clamp. the 5-ht-induced current response was depressed in na+-free media, but augmented in ca2+-free media, and unaffected by a change in external k+. the 5-ht-induced response was markedly blocked by intracellular injection of guanosine 5'-o-(2-thiodiphosphate) (gdpbetas). after the injection of guanosine 5'-o-(3-thiotriphosphate) (gtpgammas), the responses to 5-ht gradually and significantly increased at the initial period, reached its plateau, and finally decreased. intracellular injection of clostridium difficile toxin b, a blocker of small g-protein rho family members such as rho (rhoa, rhob and rhoc), rac and cdc42, markedly depressed the 5-ht-induced response. intracellular injection of clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme, a specific blocker of rhoa, rhob, rhoc, exhibited a similar depressing effect observed with toxin b. in contrast, intracellular injection of recombinant l63rhoa, a constitutively active form of rhoa, significantly augmented the 5-ht-induced response without affecting the resting membrane. these results suggested that the 5-ht-induced na+-current response might be facilitated by the activation of aplysia rho which is closely homologous to rhoa, rhob or rhoc in mammalian neuron.

TI  == involvement of cdc42 signaling in apoa-i-induced cholesterol efflux.
AB  == cholesterol efflux, an important mechanism by which high density lipoproteins (hdl) protect against atherosclerosis, is initiated by docking of apolipoprotein  a-i (apoa-i), a major hdl protein, to specific binding sites followed by activation of atp-binding cassette transporter a1 (abca1) and translocation of cholesterol from intracellular compartments to the exofacial monolayer of the plasma membrane where it is accessible to hdl. in this report, we investigated potential signal transduction pathways that may link apoa-i binding to cholesterol translocation to the plasma membrane and cholesterol efflux. by using pull-down assays we found that apoa-i substantially increased the amount of activated cdc42, rac1, and rho in human fibroblasts. moreover, apoa-i induced actin polymerization, which is known to be controlled by rho family g proteins. inhibition of cdc42 and rac1 with clostridium difficile toxin b inhibited apoa-i-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas inhibition of rho with clostridium botulinum c3-exoenzyme exerted opposite effects. adenoviral expression of a cdc42(t17n) dominant negative mutant substantially reduced apoa-i-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas dominant negative rac1(t17n) had no effect. we further found that two downstream effectors of cdc42/rac1 signaling, c-jun n-terminal kinase (jnk) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 mapk), are  activated by apoa-i. pharmacological inhibition of jnk but not p38 mapk decreased apoa-i-induced cholesterol efflux, whereas anisomycin and hydrogen peroxide, two  direct jnk activators, could partially substitute for apoa-i in its ability to induce cholesterol efflux. these results for the first time demonstrate activation of rho family g proteins and stress kinases by apoa-i and implicate the involvement of cdc42 and jnk in the apoa-i-induced cholesterol efflux.

TI  == modulation of the expression of connective tissue growth factor by alterations of the cytoskeleton.
AB  == modulation of the cytoskeletal architecture was shown to regulate the expression  of ctgf (connective tissue growth factor, ccn2). the microtubule disrupting agents nocodazole and colchicine strongly up-regulated ctgf expression, which was prevented upon stabilization of the microtubules by paclitaxel. as a consequence  of microtubule disruption, rhoa was activated and the actin stress fibers were stabilized. both effects were related to ctgf induction. overexpression of constitutively active rhoa induced ctgf synthesis. interference with rhoa signaling by simvastatin, toxinb, c3 toxin, and y27632 prevented up-regulation of ctgf. likewise, direct disintegration of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin b  interfered with nocodazole-mediated up-regulation of ctgf expression. disassembly of actin fibers by cytochalasin d, however, unexpectedly increased ctgf expression indicating that the content of f-actin per se was not the major determinant for ctgf gene expression. given the fact that cytochalasin d sequesters g-actin, a decrease in g-actin increased ctgf, while increased levels  of g-actin corresponded to reduced ctgf expression. these data link alterations in the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton to the expression of ctgf and provide a molecular basis for the observation that ctgf is up-regulated in cells exposed to mechanical stress.

TI  == involvement of rho family g protein in the cell signaling for sperm incorporation during fertilization of mouse eggs: inhibition by clostridium difficile toxin b.
AB  == sperm-egg interaction was investigated in mouse eggs freed from the zona pellucida and injected with clostridium difficile toxin b, the inhibitor of rho family small g proteins. toxin b reduced in a dose-dependent manner the percentage of eggs associated with sperm fusion on the surface or sperm nucleus decondensation in the ooplasm, examined by injection of a dna-staining dye into the egg and transfer of the dye to the fused sperm head after recording intracellular ca(2+) responses for 100 min postinsemination. the mean number of decondensed sperm nuclei per egg was remarkably decreased by approximately 1 microg/ml toxin b in the ooplasm. this was because spermatozoa were arrested at the fusion state without developing to sperm incorporation and tended to lose cytoplasmic continuity to the egg. the fusion-arrested spermatozoa caused transient small ca(2+) oscillations in most of eggs, while an injected spermatozoon produced repetitive large ca(2+) spikes unaffected by toxin b. a decrease in the rate of fused spermatozoa and decondensed sperm nuclei was also caused by 20-40 microm cytochalasin d, the inhibitor of actin polymerization. immunostaining of rho proteins showed that rac1 and rhob are present in the cortical ooplasm, but cdc42 is absent. actin filaments in the cortex appeared to  be reduced in toxin b-injected eggs. this study suggests that rho protein(s) regulating actin-based cytoskeletal reorganization is involved in the process leading to sperm incorporation.

TI  == the host cell chaperone hsp90 is essential for translocation of the binary clostridium botulinum c2 toxin into the cytosol.
AB  == clostridium botulinum c2 toxin is the prototype of the binary actin-adp-ribosylating toxins and consists of the binding component c2ii and the  enzyme component c2i. the activated binding component c2iia forms heptamers, which bind to carbohydrates on the cell surface and interact with the enzyme component c2i. this toxin complex is taken up by receptor-mediated endocytosis. in acidic endosomes, heptameric c2iia forms pores and mediates the translocation  of c2i into the cytosol. we report that the heat shock protein (hsp) 90-specific  inhibitors, geldanamycin or radicicol, block intoxication of vero cells, rat astrocytes, and hela cells by c2 toxin. adp-ribosylation of actin in the cytosol  of toxin-treated cells revealed that less active c2i was translocated into the cytosol after treatment with hsp90 inhibitors. under control conditions, c2i was  localized in the cytosol of toxin-treated rat astrocytes, whereas geldanamycin blocked the cytosolic distribution of c2i. at low extracellular ph (ph 4.5), which allows the direct translocation of c2i via c2iia heptamers across the cell  membrane into the cytosol, hsp90 inhibitors retarded intoxication by c2i. geldanamycin did not affect toxin binding, endocytosis, and pore formation by c2iia. the adp-ribosyltransferase activity of c2i was not affected by hsp90 inhibitors in vitro. the cytotoxic actions of the actin-adp-ribosylating clostridium perfringens iota toxin and the rho-adp-ribosylating c2-c3 fusion toxin was similarly blocked by hsp90 inhibitors. in contrast, radicicol and geldanamycin had no effect on anthrax lethal toxin-induced cytotoxicity of j774-a1 macrophage-like cells or on cytotoxic effects of the glucosylating clostridium difficile toxin b in vero cells. the data indicate that hsp90 is essential for the membrane translocation of adp-ribosylating toxins delivered by  c2ii.

TI  == camp-induced aqp2 translocation is associated with rhoa inhibition through rhoa phosphorylation and interaction with rhogdi.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that inhibition of rho gtpase with clostridium difficile toxin b, or with clostridium botulinum c3 toxin, causes actin depolymerization and translocation of aquaporin 2 (aqp2) in renal cd8 cells in the absence of hormonal stimulation. here we demonstrate that rho inhibition is part of the signal transduction cascade activated by vasopressin leading to aqp2  insertion into the apical membrane. quantitation of active rhoa (gtp-bound) by selective pull down experiments demonstrated that the amount of active rhoa decreased upon stimulation of cd8 cells with the camp-elevating agent forskolin.  consistent with this observation, forskolin treatment resulted in a decreased expression of membrane-associated (active) rho, as assessed by cell fractionation followed by western blotting analysis. in addition, the abundance of the endogenous rho gdp dissociation inhibitor (rho-gdi) was found to have decreased in the membrane fraction after forskolin stimulation. co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that, after forskolin stimulation, the amount of rho-gdi complexed with rhoa increased, suggesting that rho gtpase inhibition occurs through association of rhoa with rho-gdi. finally, forskolin stimulation was associated with an increase in rho phosphorylation on a serine residue, a protein modification known to stabilize the inactive form of rhoa and to increase its interaction with rho-gdi. taken together, these data demonstrate that rhoa inhibition through rho phosphorylation and interaction with rho-gdi is a key event for cytoskeletal dynamics controlling camp-induced aqp2 translocation.

TI  == pitavastatin-induced thrombomodulin expression by endothelial cells acts via inhibition of small g proteins of the rho family.
AB  == objective: 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl coenzyme a reductase inhibitors (statins) can function to protect the vasculature in a manner that is independent of their lipid-lowering activity. the main feature of the antithrombotic properties of endothelial cells is an increase in the expression of thrombomodulin (tm) without induction of tissue factor (tf) expression. we investigated the effect of statins on the expression of tm and tf by endothelial cells. methods and results: the incubation of endothelial cells with pitavastatin led to a concentration- and time-dependent increase in cellular tm antigen and mrna levels. in contrast, the  expression of tf mrna was not induced under the same conditions. a nuclear run-on study revealed that pitavastatin accelerates tm transcription rate. the stimulation of tm expression by pitavastatin was prevented by either mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. specific inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase-i and rac/cdc42 by ggti-286 and clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, respectively, enhanced tm expression, whereas inactivation of rho by clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme was ineffective. conclusions: statins regulate tm expression via inhibition of small g proteins of the rho family; rac/cdc42. a statin-mediated increase in tm expression by endothelial cells may contribute to the beneficial effects of statins on endothelial function.

TI  == the uptake machinery of clostridial actin adp-ribosylating toxins--a cell delivery system for fusion proteins and polypeptide drugs.
AB  == several bacterial protein toxins, including clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, clostridum perfringens iota toxin, clostridium difficile adp-ribosyltransferase,  and the bacillus-produced vegetative insecticidal proteins, target the cytoskeleton by adp-ribosylation of actin. all these toxins are binary in structure and consist of an enzyme component, possessing adp-ribosyltransferase activity and a separated binding and translocation component, which is involved in the delivery of the enzyme component into the cell. the toxins are not only important virulence factors but also cell biological tools to study the function  of the actin cytoskeleton. moreover, the binary toxins turned out to be effective transporter systems for the delivery of specific fusion toxins (e.g., rho-adp-ribosylating c3 exoenzyme) into cells. the present review describes the biological functions of the toxins, focuses on recent studies on the uptake and delivery mechanism and discusses the usage as a drug delivery system.

TI  == rho protein inactivation induced apoptosis of cultured human endothelial cells.
AB  == small gtp-binding rho gtpases regulate important signaling pathways in endothelial cells, but little is known about their role in endothelial cell apoptosis. clostridial cytotoxins specifically inactivate gtpases by glucosylation [clostridium difficile toxin b-10463 (tcdb-10463), c. difficile toxin b-1470 (tcdb-1470)] or adp ribosylation (c. botulinum c3 toxin). exposure of human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (huvec) to tcdb-10463, which inhibits rhoa/rac1/cdc42, or to c3 toxin, which inhibits rhoa, -b, -c, resulted in apoptosis, whereas inactivation of rac1/cdc42 with tcdb-1470 was without effect, suggesting that rho inhibition was responsible for endothelial apoptosis. disruption of endothelial microfilaments as well as inhibition of p160rock did not induce endothelial apoptosis. exposure to tcdb-10463 resulted in activation of caspase-9 and -3 but not caspase-8 in huvec. moreover, rho inhibition reduced  expression of antiapoptotic bcl-2 and mcl-1 and increased proapoptotic bid but had no effect on bax or flip protein levels. caspase-3 activity and apoptosis induced by tcdb-10463 were abolished by camp elevation. in summary, inhibition of rho in endothelial cells activates caspase-9- and -3-dependent apoptosis, which can be antagonized by camp elevation.

TI  == reduction of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) related nuclear factor-kappab (nf-kappab) translocation but not inhibitor kappa-b (ikappa-b)-degradation by rho protein inhibition in human endothelial cells.
AB  == degradation of inhibitor kappa-b (ikappa-b) followed by translocation of nuclear  factor-kappab (nf-kappab) into the nucleus and activation of gene expression is essential in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha)-signaling. in order to analyze the role of rho proteins in tnf-alpha-induced nf-kappab-activation in human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (huvec) we used clostridium difficile toxin b-10463 (tcdb-10463) which inactivates rhoa/rac1/cdc42 by glucosylation and clostridium botulinum c3-toxin which inhibits rhoa/b/c by adp-ribosylation. exposure of huvec to 10 ng/ml tcdb-10463 or 2.5 microg/ml c3-toxin inhibited tnf-alpha (100 ng/ml)-induced expression of a nf-kappab-dependent reporter gene.  moreover, preincubation of huvec with 10 ng/ml tcdb-10463 reduced tnf-alpha-related expression of interleukin-8 (il-8), tnf-receptor associated factor-2 (traf2), and human inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (hiap1)-mrna. blocking of rho reduced nf-kappab dna-binding as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. tcdb-10463 and c3-toxin blocked tnf-alpha-related nuclear  translocation of nf-kappab although ikappa-balpha/beta was still degraded. in contrast, tcdb-10463 had no effect on il-1beta-related nf-kappab-translocation and activation in huvec. neither 1 microm rho kinase inhibitor y-27632 nor microfilament depolymerization by 50 ng/ml c. botulinum c2-toxin blocked tnf-alpha-induced degradation of ikappa-b, nuclear nf-kappab translocation or expression of a nf-kappab-dependent reporter gene. therefore, tnf-alpha-related ikappa-b-degradation is rho-independent in huvec, whereas a rho protein-dependent signal is necessary to induce nuclear transport of nf-kappab in these cells pointing to a novel and unique role of rho in nf-kappab-translocation.

TI  == molecular characterization of phenyllactate dehydratase and its initiator from clostridium sporogenes.
AB  == the heterotrimeric phenyllactate dehydratase from clostridium sporogenes, fldabc, catalyses the reversible dehydration of (r)-phenyllactate to (e)-cinnamate in two steps: (i) coa-transfer from the cofactor cinnamoyl-coa to phenyllactate to yield phenyllactyl-coa and the product cinnamate mediated by flda, a (r)-phenyllactate  coa-transferase; followed by (ii) dehydration of phenyllactyl-coa to cinnamoyl-coa mediated by heterodimeric fldbc, a phenyllactyl-coa dehydratase. phenyllactate dehydratase requires initiation by atp, mgcl2 and a reducing agent  such as dithionite mediated by an extremely oxygen-sensitive initiator protein (fldi) present in the cell-free extract. all four genes coding for these proteins were cloned and shown to be clustered in the order fldaibc, which shares over 95% sequence identity of nucleotide and protein levels with a gene cluster detected in the genome of the closely related clostridium botulinum hall strain a. flda shows sequence similarities to a new family of coa-transferases, which apparently do not form covalent enzyme coa-ester intermediates. an n-terminal strep ii-tag containing enzymatically active fldi was overproduced and purified from escherichia coli. fldi was characterized as a homodimeric protein, which contains one [4fe-4s]1+/2+ cluster with an electron spin s = 3/2 in the reduced form. the  amino acid sequence as well as the chemical and epr-properties of the pure protein are very similar to those of component a of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans (hgdc), which was able to replace fldi in the activation of phenyllactate dehydratase. only in the oxidized state,  fldi and component a exhibit significant atpase activity, which appears to be essential for unidirectional electron transfer. both subunits of phenyllactyl-coa dehydratase (fldbc) show significant sequence similarities to both subunits of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase (hgdab). the fldaibc gene cluster resembles the hadaibc gene cluster in the genome of clostridium difficile and the hadabc,i genes in c. botulinum. the four subunits of these deduced 2-hydroxyacid dehydratases (65-81% amino acid sequence identity between the had genes) probably code for a 2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydratase involved in leucine fermentation. this enzyme could be the target for metronidazole in the treatment of pseudomembranous enterocolitis caused by c. difficile.

AB  == rhoa, -b, and -c are adp-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by clostridium  botulinum c3 exoenzyme and related c3-like transferases. we report that rala gtpase, which is not adp-ribosylated by c3, inhibits adp-ribosylation of rhoa by  c3 from c. botulinum (c3bot), clostridium limosum (c3lim), and bacillus cereus (c3cer) but not from staphylococcus aureus (c3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. inhibition by rala occurs with the gdp- and guanosine 5'-3-o-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of rala and is overcome by increasing concentrations of c3. a direct interaction of rala with c3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with gst-rala-sepharose. the affinity constant (k(d)) of the binding of rala to c3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. rala increased the nad glycohydrolase activity of c3bot by about 5-fold. although rala had no effect on glucosylation of rho gtpases by clostridium difficile toxin b, c3bot and c3lim inhibited glucosylation of rala by clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. furthermore, c3bot decreased activation of phospholipase d by rala. the data indicate that several c3 exoenzymes directly interact with rala without adp-ribosylating the gtpase. the interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of c3 and rala.

TI  == characterization of the enzymatic component of the adp-ribosyltransferase toxin cdta from clostridium difficile.
AB  == certain strains of clostridium difficile produce the adp-ribosyltransferase cdt,  which is a binary actin adp-ribosylating toxin. the toxin consists of the binding component cdtb, which mediates receptor binding and cellular uptake, and the enzyme component cdta. here we studied the enzyme component (cdta) of the toxin using the binding component of clostridium perfringens iota toxin (ib), which is  interchangeable with cdtb as a transport component. ib was used because cdtb was  not expressed as a recombinant protein in escherichia coli. similar to iota toxin, cdta adp-ribosylates nonmuscle and skeletal muscle actin. the n-terminal part of cdta (cdta1-240) competes with full-length cdta for binding to the iota toxin binding component. the c-terminal part (cdta244-263) harbors the enzyme activity but was much less active than the full-length cdta. changes of glu428 and glu430 to glutamine, ser388 to alanine, and arg345 to lysine blocked adp-ribosyltransferase activity. comparison of cdta with c. perfringens iota toxin and clostridium botulinum c2 toxin revealed full enzyme activity of the fragment ia208-413 but loss of activity of several n-terminally deleted c2i proteins including c2i103-431, c2i190-431, and c2i30-431. the data indicate that  cdta belongs to the iota toxin subfamily of binary actin adp-ribosylating toxins  with respect to interaction with the binding component and substrate specificity. it shares typical conserved amino acid residues with iota toxin and c2 toxin that are suggested to be involved in nad-binding and/or catalytic activity. the enzyme components of cdt, iota toxin, and c2 toxin differ with respect to the minimal structural requirement for full enzyme activity.

AB  == rho family gtpases are critical molecular switches that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and cell function. in the current study, we investigated the involvement of rho gtpases in regulating neuronal survival using primary cerebellar granule neurons. clostridium difficile toxin b, a specific inhibitor of rho, rac, and cdc42, induced apoptosis of granule neurons characterized by c-jun phosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, and nuclear condensation. serum and  depolarization-dependent survival signals could not compensate for the loss of gtpase function. unlike trophic factor withdrawal, toxin b did not affect the antiapoptotic kinase akt or its target glycogen synthase kinase-3beta. the proapoptotic effects of toxin b were mimicked by clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, a selective inhibitor of rac/cdc42. although rac/cdc42 gtpase inhibition led to f-actin disruption, direct cytoskeletal disassembly with clostridium botulinum c2 toxin was insufficient to induce c-jun phosphorylation or apoptosis. granule neurons expressed high basal jnk and low p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activities that were unaffected by toxin b. however, pyridyl imidazole inhibitors of jnk/p38 attenuated c-jun phosphorylation. moreover, both pyridyl imidazoles and adenoviral dominant-negative c-jun attenuated apoptosis, suggesting that jnk/c-jun signaling was required for cell death. the results indicate that rac/cdc42 gtpases, in addition to trophic factors, are critical for survival of cerebellar granule neurons.

AB  == in this study the participation of rho family gtpases in the regulation of il-1-activated protein kinase cascades controlling il-2 synthesis was investigated in murine el-4 thymoma cells. the recombinant c3-like chimeric toxin, which consists of the c3 toxin of clostridium limosum and the n-terminal part of clostridium botulinum c2 toxin (c2in-c3) interacting with the c2ii binding subunit to facilitate uptake into cells, and selectively inactivates rho  a by adp-ribosylation, prevented il-1-stimulated activation of jun-nh2-terminal-kinases (jnk) and p38 mitogen-activated-protein kinases (mapk).  udp-monoglucosylation and concomitant inactivation of rho a and of rac-2 by clostridium difficile toxin b also inhibited il-1-induced activation of jnk and p38 mapk, but additionally inhibited activation of the extracellular-regulated-kinase pathway and dna binding of the transcription factor nfkappab. accordingly, pre-treatment of cells with c21n-c3 fusion toxin only decreased il-1-stimulated il-2 synthesis by 50%, while in c. difficile toxin b-treated cells il-1-induced il-2 secretion was reduced by 90%. these results imply that together with rho a an additional member of the rho family g proteins, i.e. rac-2, is critically involved as an upstream regulator in il-1-induced activation of different mapk, stress-activated protein kinases, and in nfkappab activation controlling il-2 gene expression in response to il-1, acting in close  proximity to the il-1-receptor complex.

TI  == bacterial inhibition of phagocytosis.
AB  == the concerted study of molecular mechanisms of phagocytosis and the inhibition of phagocytosis by specific products of extracellular bacterial pathogens has borne  considerable fruit. the importance of tyrosine phosphorylation and of the rho family of gtpases has become clear to cell biologists, but pathogenic bacteria recognized the importance of these signalling pathways in phagocytic cells long ago. the discoveries described in this review are only the beginning. the simultaneous pursuit of the mechanisms and molecules involved in the initiation and regulation of phagocytosis and that pathogenic bacteria use to inhibit phagocytosis will surely identify more interesting pathways on each side of the contest. are there any obvious possibilities? there are several bacterial factors that have the potential to inhibit known mechanisms of phagocytosis. clostridium  species, for example, make a number of exotoxins of interest. clostridium botulinum and clostridium tetani neurotoxins inactivate the regulated secretory machinery by proteolytic cleavage of snare proteins, and targets of tetanus toxin and botulinum b toxin inhibit the exocytotic delivery of membrane vesicles needed for phagocytosis of large particles (hackam et al., 1998). moreover, the c3 exotoxin of c. botulinum catalyses adp ribosylation and inactivation of rho family gtpases (wiegers et al., 1991), and toxins a and b of c. difficile udp-glucosylate and inactivate rho gtpases and thereby disrupt the actin cytoskeleton (just et al., 1995a,b). however, as clostridia lack the machinery for type iii secretion, these proteins are not rapidly targeted to the phagocyte  cytoplasm. more searching may reveal a pathogen that has combined the type iii secretory machinery with clostridia toxin-like substrates. a potentially unique strategy for remaining outside phagocytes is exhibited by helicobacter pylori, which contain a type iv secretion system. unopsonized virulent strains of h. pylori bind readily to macrophages but are only internalized after a delay of several minutes. such a delay appears to be sufficient for the bacteria to remain extracellular (allen et al., 2000). elucidation of the mechanism used by h. pylori to delay phagocytosis may reveal one or more novel virulence factors as well as one or more novel targets in the phagocyte that will add to the understanding of a fundamental process in host defence. another field ripe for further mechanistic investigation is complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis. dedicated study of the molecular events and molecular mediators of phagocytosis downstream of cr3 is likely to reveal interesting differences from fcgammar phagocytosis and is just as likely to reveal that microbes have discovered unique mechanisms for circumventing them. study of extracellular pathogens and the mechanisms that they use to remain outside phagocytic cells has revealed a great  deal about the initial encounter between pathogen and phagocyte. we can look forward to additional discoveries about the host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms and factors that each side uses to battle against the other.

TI  == bacterial toxins modifying the actin cytoskeleton.
AB  == numerous bacterial toxins recognize the actin cytoskeleton as a target. the clostridial binary toxins (iota and c2 families) adp-ribosylate the actin monomers causing the dissociation of the actin filaments. the large clostridial toxins from clostridium difficile, clostridium sordellii and clostridium novyi inactivate, by glucosylation, proteins from the rho family that regulate actin polymerization. in contrast, the cytotoxic necrotic factor from escherichia coli  activates rho by deamidation and increases the formation of actin filaments. the  enterotoxin of bacteroides fragilis is a protease specific for e-cadherin and it  promotes the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. the bacterial toxins that  modify the actin cytoskeleton induce various cell disfunctions including changes  in cell barrier permeability and disruption of intercellular junctions.

TI  == evidence for rho protein regulation of renal tubular epithelial cell function.
AB  == background: rho proteins are small guanine 5'-triphosphate (gtp)-binding proteins felt to be important regulators of several aspects of cell function, including the organization of the actin cytoskeleton. the effects of rho proteins on the regulation of renal tubular epithelial cell function are not known. methods: selected bacterial toxins that inhibit rho protein function were used to examine  the effect of rho in cultured renal tubular epithelial cells. results: clostridium difficile toxin a significantly and dose dependently inhibited llc-pk(1) cell (3)h-thymidine uptake and healing of small wounds made in confluent monolayers, and it induced apoptosis. a second clostridium difficile toxin (toxin b) that acted via a different receptor also impaired llc-pk(1) thymidine uptake and wound healing, and it induced apoptosis. a third bacterial toxin, c3 toxin from clostridium botulinum, also impaired llc-pk(1) thymidine uptake and stimulated apoptosis in llc-pk(1) cells. since rho inhibition disrupted organization of the actin cytoskeleton, we examined the effects of another agent that disrupted the actin cytoskeleton (cytochalasin d) and found significant dose-dependent effects that impaired llc-pk1 thymidine uptake and wound healing and that induced apoptosis. the effects of toxin a and cytochalasin d to induce apoptosis were not associated with significant changes in expression  of bcl-2, bad, or bak proteins and were significantly attenuated by a pancaspase  inhibitor. conclusions: our results suggest that rho proteins are important endogenous regulators of several aspects of renal tubular epithelial cell function, including proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. further studies are  needed to clarify the cellular mechanisms of rho regulation of renal epithelial cell function.

TI  == [detection of toxin-producing pathogenic bacterial strains by polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was used for detection of pathogenic clostridium  botulinum, clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, and escherichia coli.  with this aim in view, primers to botulinic toxins types a, b, c1, d, e, f, and g, perfringens enterotoxin, difficile toxin, and types 1 and 2 shigella-like toxins were chosen and synthesized. optimal amplification conditions were selected for each pair of primers, with dna and the respective agent as the reaction mixture matrices. pcr was highly specific and sensitive in all cases. its sensitivity was 10-100 cells/sample. among the tested c. botulinum, c. perfringens, c. difficile, and e. coli strains, specific amplification products of expected size were observed only in the strains containing the respective toxin genes. these findings recommend the use of these methods in clinical microbiology. strains containing type 2 shigella-like toxin gene were detected among e. coli strains isolated from patients with the hemolytic uremic syndrome,  which for the first time indicates that the problem with e. coli epidemic strain  o157 is valid for russia. as a result of our studies, test systems for detection  of types a, b, c, d, e, f, and g c. botulinum strains, c. perfringens and c. difficile, and e. coli o157 strains are now available.

TI  == activation of mmp-2 by clostridium difficile toxin b in bovine smooth muscle cells.
AB  == matrix metalloproteinase-2 (mmp-2) plays critical roles in cell migration through the breakdown of the extracellular matrix. cell movements require dynamic actin reorganization, which is controlled by rho family gtpases. in order to examine the relation between mmp-2 regulation and actin reorganization, we used several inhibitors of rho family gtpases. treatment of smooth muscle cells with clostridium difficile toxin b known to inactivate rho family gtpases activated mmp-2. however, neither c3 transferase, a rho inhibitor, nor y-27632, a specific  inhibitor of rho-kinase, induced mmp-2 activation. treatment with c3 transferase  and y-27632 caused morphological changes into the round and stellate shape, respectively, by inhibition of actin stress fiber formation. in addition, toxin b treatment induced expression and processing of mt1-mmp, a major activator of mmp-2. taken together, we suggest the involvement of rho family gtpases, although inhibition of neither rho nor rho-kinase is sufficient, in the activation of mmp-2 through expression and activation of mt1-mmp.

TI  == inhibition of rho protein stimulates inos expression in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.
AB  == inducible nitric oxide synthase (inos) in vascular smooth muscle cells (vsmcs) is upregulated in arterial injury and plays a role in regulating vsmc proliferation  and restenosis. inflammatory cytokines [e.g., interleukin-1beta (il-1beta)] released during vascular injury induce inos. small gtp-binding proteins of the ras superfamily play a major role in il-1beta-dependent signaling pathways. in this study, we examined the role of rho gtpases in regulating inos expression in  vsmcs. treatment of vsmcs with mevastatin, which inhibits isoprenylation of rho and other small gtp-binding proteins, produced significantly higher amounts of il-1beta-evoked no and inos protein compared with control. similarly, bacterial toxins [toxin b from clostridium difficile and c3 adp-ribosyl transferase (c3) toxin from clostridium botulinium] that specifically inactivate rho proteins increased nos products (no and citrulline) and inos expression. toxin b increased the activity of inos promoter-reporter construct in vsmcs. both toxins enhanced il-1beta-stimulated inos expression and no production. these data demonstrate for the first time that inhibition of rho induces inos and suggest a role for rho protein in il-1beta-stimulated no production in vsmcs.

TI  == a role for the small molecular weight gtpases, rho and cdc42, in muscarinic receptor signaling to focal adhesion kinase.
AB  == an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (fak) is elicited during neuronal growth cone remodeling and requires the maintenance of agonist-sensitive pools of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (pip2). rho family gtpases are putative regulators of both pip2 synthesis and growth cone remodeling, including neurite outgrowth elicited by muscarinic cholinergic receptor (machr) stimulation. in this study, we investigated the interrelationships among rho family gtpases, pip2 synthesis, and machr signaling  to fak in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cells. preincubation with clostridium difficile toxin b (tox b), an inhibitor of rho, rac, and cdc42, attenuated machr-stimulated fak and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation and lysophosphatidic acid (lpa)-induced fak phosphorylation to a similar extent (75% decreases at 200 pg/ml tox b) but did not affect mitogen-activated protein kinase activation elicited by either phorbol ester or an machr agonist. in contrast, preincubation with selective inhibitors of either rho (c3 exoenzyme) or rho kinase (ha-1 077) resulted in 80-90% reductions in lpa-induced fak phosphorylation but only 40-50% decreases in machr-stimulated phosphorylation. moreover, machr-mediated fak phosphorylation was significantly attenuated in cells scrape-loaded with dominant-negative n17cdc42 but not n17rac1. tox b had little or no effect on agonist-sensitive pools of pip2 but inhibited machr-driven actin cytoskeletal remodeling. the results suggest that the rho family gtpases, rho and cdc42, link machr stimulation to increases in fak phosphorylation independently of effects on pip2  synthesis.

TI  == inhibition of calcium release-activated calcium current by rac/cdc42-inactivating clostridial cytotoxins in rbl cells.
AB  == using large clostridial cytotoxins as tools, the role of rho gtpases in activation of rbl 2h3 hm1 cells was studied. clostridium difficile toxin b, which glucosylates rho, rac, and cdc42 and clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, which glucosylates rac and cdc42 but not rho, inhibited the release of hexosaminidase from rbl cells mediated by the high affinity antigen receptor (fcepsilonri). additionally, toxin b and lethal toxin inhibited the intracellular ca(2+) mobilization induced by fcepsilonri-stimulation and thapsigargin, mainly by reducing the influx of extracellular ca(2+). in patch clamp recordings, toxin b and lethal toxin inhibited the calcium release-activated calcium current by about 45%. calcium release-activated calcium current, the receptor-stimulated ca(2+) influx, and secretion were inhibited neither by the rho-adp-ribosylating c3-fusion toxin c2in-c3 nor by the actin-adp-ribosylating clostridium botulinum c2 toxin. the data indicate that rac and cdc42 but not rho are not only involved  in late exocytosis events but are also involved in ca(2+) mobilization most likely by regulating the ca(2+) influx through calcium release-activated calcium  channels activated via fcepsilonri receptor in rbl cells.

TI  == rho family proteins modulate rapid apoptosis induced by cytotoxic t lymphocytes and fas.
AB  == little is known about the role of rho proteins in apoptosis produced by stimuli evolved specifically to produce apoptosis, such as granzymes from cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) and fas. here we demonstrate that all three rho family members are involved in ctl- and fas-induced killing. dominant-negative mutants of each rho family member and clostridium difficile toxin b, an inhibitor of all family members, strongly inhibited the susceptibility of cells to ctl- and fas-induced apoptosis. fas-induced caspase-3 activation was inhibited by c. difficile toxin.  activated mutants of each gtpase increased susceptibility to apoptosis, and activation of cdc42 increased within 5 min of fas stimulation. in contrast, during the time required for ctl and fas killing, no apoptosis was produced by dominant-negative or activated mutants or by c. difficile toxin alone. inhibition of actin polymerization using latrunculin a reduced the ability of constitutively active gtpase mutants to stimulate apoptosis and blocked fas-induced activation of caspase-3. furthermore, the ability of rac to enhance apoptosis was decreased  by point mutations reported to block rac induction of actin polymerization. rho family proteins may regulate apoptosis through their effects on the actin cytoskeleton.

TI  == a rho-related gtpase is involved in ca(2+)-dependent neurotransmitter exocytosis.
AB  == rho, rac, and cdc42 monomeric gtpases are well known regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and phosphoinositide metabolism and have been implicated in hormone  secretion in endocrine cells. here, we examine their possible implication in ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis of neurotransmitters. using subcellular fractionation procedures, we found that rhoa, rhob, rac1, and cdc42 are present in rat brain synaptosomes; however, only rac1 was associated with highly purified synaptic vesicles. to determine the synaptic function of these gtpases, toxins that impair rho-related proteins were microinjected into aplysia neurons. we used lethal toxin from clostridium sordellii, which inactivates rac; toxin b from clostridium difficile, which inactivates rho, rac, and cdc42; and c3 exoenzyme from clostridium botulinum and cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 from escherichia coli, which mainly affect rho. analysis of the toxin effects on evoked acetylcholine release revealed that a member of the rho family, most likely rac1, was implicated in the control of neurotransmitter release. strikingly, blockage of acetylcholine release by lethal toxin and toxin b could be completely removed in  <1 s by high frequency stimulation of nerve terminals. further characterization of the inhibitory action produced by lethal toxin suggests that rac1 protein regulates a late step in ca(2+)-dependent neuroexocytosis.

TI  == rho and rac exert antagonistic functions on spreading of macrophage-derived multinucleated cells and are not required for actin fiber formation.
AB  == multinucleated giant cells (mngc) derived from avian blood monocytes present, like osteoclasts, an unusual cytoskeletal organization characterized by (1) cortical rings of actin filaments, (2) unique adhesion structures called podosomes and (3) vinculin containing focal complexes which are not visibly connected to f-actin structures. the rho family of small gtpases plays an essential role in the regulation and organization of cellular cytoskeletal structures including f-actin and vinculin associated structures. using bacterial  toxins such as modified exoenzyme c3 (c3b) and toxin b or overexpression of constitutively active rac and rho proteins fused to the green fluorescent protein (gfp), we show that rac and rho play antagonistic roles in regulating the morphology of osteoclast-like cells. inhibition of rho by c3b triggered mngc spreading whereas activated rho promoted cell retraction. however, inhibition or  activation of rho led to complete disorganization of fibrillar actin structures,  including podosomes. toxin b inhibition of rho, rac and cdc42 induced a time dependent f-actin and vinculin reorganization. initially, actin fibers with associated adhesion plaques formed and disappeared subsequently. finally, only small focal complexes remained at the mngc periphery before retracting. at the time when actin fibers formed, we observed that rac was already inhibited by toxin b. by combining c3b treatment and overexpression of a dominant negative form of rac (n17rac), we show that the formation of these focal adhesion and actin fiber structures required neither rho nor rac activity. moreover, our results show that podosomes are extremely unstable structures since any modifications of rho or rac activity resulted in their dissociation.

TI  == bacterial toxins inhibiting or activating small gtp-binding proteins.
AB  == amino acids located on the switch 1 or switch 2 domains of small gtpases of the ras and rho family are targets of several bacterial toxins. exoenzyme c3 from clostridium botulinum adp-ribosylates specifically rho at r43 and prevents the recruitment of rho on the cell membrane. this blocks the downstream effects of the rho gtpase. however, exoenzyme c3 is not a toxin, and chimeric proteins fusing c3 with the b moiety of either diphtheria toxin or pseudomonas aeruginosa  exotoxin a have been produced to intoxicate cells with low concentration of c3. c. difficile toxin b modifies by glucosylation rho on t37 and rac and cdc42 on t35. glucosylation of rho, rac, and cdc42 blocks the binding of these gtpases on  their downstream effectors. c. sordellii lethal toxin modifies ras, rap, and rac  on t35 by glucosylation. cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1 (cnf1), from uropathogenic escherichia coli strains, deamidates q63 of rho into e63, thereby blocking the intrinsic or gap-mediated gtpase of rho. this allows permanent activation of rho. thus, rho gtpases are targets for three different toxin activities. molecular mechanisms of these toxins are discussed.

TI  == involvement of rho gtpases in calcium-regulated exocytosis from adrenal chromaffin cells.
AB  == the rho gtpase family, including rho, rac and cdc42 proteins, is implicated in various cell functions requiring the reorganization of actin-based structures. in secretory cells, cytoskeletal rearrangements are a prerequisite for exocytosis. we previously described that, in chromaffin cells, the trimeric granule-bound go  protein controls peripheral actin and prevents exocytosis in resting cells through the regulation of rhoa. to provide further insight into the function of rho proteins in exocytosis, we focus here on their intracellular distribution in  chromaffin cells. by confocal immunofluorescence analysis, we found that rac1 and cdc42 are exclusively localized in the subplasmalemmal region in both resting and nicotine-stimulated cells. in contrast, rhoa is associated with the membrane of secretory granules. we then investigated the effects of clostridial toxins, which differentially impair the function of rho gtpases, on the subplasmalemmal actin network and catecholamine secretion. clostridium difficile toxin b, which inactivates rho, rac and cdc42, markedly altered the distribution of peripheral actin filaments. neither clostridium botulinum c3 toxin, which selectively adp-ribosylates rho, nor clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, which inactivates rac, affected cortical actin, suggesting that cdc42 plays a specific role in the  organization of subplasmalemmal actin. indeed, toxin b strongly reduced secretagogue-evoked catecholamine release. this effect on secretion was not observed in cells having their actin cytoskeleton depolymerized by cytochalasin e or clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, suggesting that the inhibition of secretion by toxin b is entirely linked to the disorganization of actin. c. sordellii lethal toxin also inhibited catecholamine secretion, but this effect was not related to  the actin cytoskeleton as seen in cells pretreated with cytochalasin e or c2 toxin. in contrast, c3 exoenzyme did not affect secretion. we propose that cdc42  plays an active role in exocytosis by coupling the actin cytoskeleton to the sequential steps underlying membrane trafficking at the site of exocytosis.

AB  == we present the first five reported cases of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad) in children with infant botulism caused by clostridium botulinum. we compare two fulminant cases of colitis in children with colonic stasis, the first caused by infant botulism and the second caused by hirschsprung's disease.  in both children, colitis was accompanied by hypovolemia, hypotension, profuse ascites, pulmonary effusion, restrictive pulmonary disease, and femoral-caval thrombosis. laboratory findings included pronounced leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia, hyponatremia, coagulopathy, and, when examined in the child with infant botulism, detection of c. difficile toxin in ascites. cdad recurred in both children, even though difficile cytotoxin was undetectable in stool after prolonged initial therapy. four children who had both infant botulism and milder  cdad also are described. colonic stasis, whether acquired, as in infant botulism, or congenital, as in hirschsprung's disease, may contribute to the susceptibility to and the severity of cdad.

TI  == tetr is a positive regulator of the tetanus toxin gene in clostridium tetani and  is homologous to botr.
AB  == the tetr gene immediately upstream from the tetanus toxin (tetx) gene was characterized. it encodes a 21,562-da protein which is related (50 to 65% identity) to the equivalent genes (botr) in clostridium botulinum. tetr has the feature of a dna binding protein with a basic pi (9.53). it contains a helix-turn-helix motif and shows 29% identity with other putative regulatory genes in clostridium, i.e., uvia from c. perfringens and txer from c. difficile.  we report for the first time the transformation of c. tetani by electroporation,  which permitted us to investigate the function of tetr. overexpression of tetr in c. tetani induced an increase in tetx production and in the level of the corresponding mrna. this indicates that tetr is a transcriptional activator of the tetx gene. overexpression of botr/a (60% identity with tetr at the amino acid level) in c. tetani induced an increase in tetx production comparable to that for overexpression of tetr. however, botr/c (50% identity with tetr at the amino acid level) was less efficient. this supports that tetr positively regulates the tetx  gene in c. tetani and that a conserved mechanism of regulation of the neurotoxin  genes is involved in c. tetani and c. botulinum.

TI  == inhibition of rho is required for camp-induced melanoma cell differentiation.
AB  == up-regulation of the camp pathway by forskolin or alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone induces melanocyte and melanoma cell differentiation characterized by stimulation of melanin synthesis and dendrite development. here we show that forskolin-induced dendricity is associated to a disassembly of actin stress fibers. since rho controls actin organization, we studied the role of this guanosine triphosphate (gtp)-binding protein in camp-induced dendrite formation.  clostridium botulinum c3 exotransferase, which inhibits rho, mimicked the effect  of forskolin in promoting dendricity and stress fiber disruption, while the escherichia coli toxin cytotoxic necrotizing factor-1 (cnf-1), which activates rho and the expression of a constitutively active rho mutant, blocked forskolin-induced dendrite outgrowth. in addition, overexpression of a constitutively active form of the rho target p160 rho-kinase (p160(rock)) prevented the dendritogenic effects of camp. our results suggest that inhibition  of rho and of its target p160(rock) are required events for camp-induced dendrite outgrowth in b16 cells. furthermore, we present evidence that rho is involved in  the regulation of melanogenesis. indeed, rho inactivation enhanced the camp stimulation of tyrosinase gene transcription and protein expression, while rho constitutive activation impaired these camp-induced effects. this reveals that, in addition to controlling dendricity, rho also participates in the regulation of melanin synthesis by camp.

TI  == inhibition of insulin-stimulated glucose transport in 3t3-l1 cells by clostridium difficile toxin b, clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, and clostridium botulinum  c2 toxin.
AB  == the role of the actin cytoskeleton and/or gtpases of the rho/rac-family in glucose transport regulation was investigated in 3t3-l1 cells with clostridial toxins which depolymerize actin by inactivation of rho/rac (clostridium difficile toxin b and clostiridium sordellii lethal toxin (lt)) or by direct adp-ribosylation (clostridium botulinum c2 toxin). toxin b and c2 reduced insulin-stimulated, but not basal, 2-deoxyglucose (2-dog) uptake rates in 3t3-l1  fibroblasts. in parallel, the toxins produced morphological alterations of the cells reflecting disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. both toxins reduced the maximum response to insulin but failed to alter the half-maximally stimulating concentrations of insulin. in 3t3-l1 adipocytes, the lethal toxin reduced the effect of insulin on 2-dog uptake, whereas toxin b and c2 failed to affect glucose transport or cell morphology. when cells were exposed to the toxins after treatment with insulin, both toxin b and the lethal toxin, in contrast to the phosphatidylinositol (pi) 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, failed to reduce the 2-dog uptake rates. thus, both translocation to the plasma membrane and internalization of glucose transporters were inhibited by the toxins, whereas the pi 3-kinase inhibitor selectively affects translocation. the data suggest that the effects of the clostridial toxins on trafficking of glucose transporters are  mediated by the depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton and are an indirect consequence of rho or rac inactivation. it is suggested that pathways signalling  through rac or rho may play a modulatory role in glucose transport regulation through their effects on the actin network.

TI  == glucosylation and adp ribosylation of rho proteins: effects on nucleotide binding, gtpase activity, and effector coupling.
AB  == we studied the effects of glucosylation of rhoa, rac1, and cdc42 at threonine-35  and -37 by clostridium difficile toxin b on nucleotide binding, gtpase activity,  and effector coupling and compared these results with the adp ribosylation of rhoa at asparagine-41 catalyzed by clostridium botulinum c3 transferase. whereas  glucosylation and adp ribosylation had no major effects on gdp release from rhoa, rac1, and cdc42, the rate of gtpgammas release from rho proteins was increased 3-6-fold by glucosylation. adp ribosylation decreased the rate of gtpgammas release by about 50%. glucosylation reduced the intrinsic activities of the gtpases by 3-7-fold and completely blocked gtpase stimulation by rho-gap. in contrast, adp ribosylation slightly increased gtpase activity ( approximately 2-fold) and had no major effect on gap stimulation of gtpase. whereas adp ribosylation did not affect the interaction of rhoa with the binding domain of protein kinase n, glucosylation inhibited this interaction. glucosylation of rac1 markedly diminished its ability to support the activation of the superoxide-generating nadph oxidase of phagocytes. glucosylated rac1 did not interfere with nadph oxidase activation by unmodified rac1, even when present in  marked molar excess, indicating that it was incapable of competing for a common effector. the data indicate that the functional inactivation of small gtpases by  glucosylation is mainly caused by inhibition of gtpase-effector protein interaction.

TI  == specific inhibition of phorbol ester-stimulated phospholipase d by clostridium sordellii lethal toxin and clostridium difficile toxin b-1470 in hek-293 cells. restoration by ral gtpases.
AB  == activation of m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (machr), stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (hek)-293 cells, leads to phospholipase d (pld) stimulation, a process apparently involving rho gtpases, as shown by studies with clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme and clostridium difficile toxin b (tcdb). direct activation of protein kinase c (pkc) by phorbol esters, such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma), also induces pld stimulation, which is additive to the machr action and which is only poorly sensitive to inactivation of rho proteins by tcdb. to study whether ras-like gtpases are involved in pld regulation, we studied the effects of the tcdb variant tcdb-1470 and clostridium  sordellii lethal toxin (tcsl), known to inactivate rac and some members of the ras protein family, on pld activities. tcdb-1470 and tcsl did not affect basal pld activity and pld stimulation by machr or direct g protein activation. in contrast, pma-induced pld stimulation was inhibited by tcdb-1470 and tcsl in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, without alteration in immunologically detectable pkc isozyme levels. in membranes of hek-293 cells pretreated with tcdb-1470 or tcsl, basal and stable gtp analog-stimulated pld activities measured with exogenous phosphatidylcholine, in the presence or absence of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, were not altered. in contrast, pretreatment with tcdb-1470 and tcsl, but not tcdb, strongly reduced pma-stimulated pld activity. the addition of recombinant rac1, serving as glucosylation substrate for tcdb, tcsl, and tcdb-1470, did not restore pld stimulation by pma. furthermore, pma-stimulated pld activity, suppressed by prior treatment with tcdb-1470 or tcsl, was not rescued by the addition of recombinant  ras (rasg12v) or rap proteins, acting as glucosylation substrates for tcsl only (ras) or tcdb-1470 and tcsl (rap). in contrast, the addition of recombinant ral proteins (rala and ralb), glucosylation substrates for tscl and tcdb-1470, but not for tcdb, to membranes of tcdb-1470- or tcsl-treated cells fully restored pld stimulation by pma without altering the strict mgatp dependence of pma-induced pld stimulation. rala-mediated restoration of pma-stimulated pld activity in membranes of tcsl-treated cells was not enhanced by coaddition of rasg12v. in conclusion, the data presented indicate that tcdb-1470 and tcsl selectively interfere with phorbol ester stimulation of pld and suggest an essential role of  ral proteins in pkc signaling to pld in hek-293 cells.

TI  == the natural beta-carbolines facilitate inositol phosphate accumulation by activating small g-proteins in human neuroblastoma cells (sh-sy5y).
AB  == the naturally occurring beta-carbolines exert psychotropic actions in humans and  have numerous behavioral effects in animals. the known in vitro activities of these substances do not provide a satisfactory explanation for their in vivo effects. the present study was undertaken to explore the possibility of a specific signal transduction pathway. the human neuroblastoma cell line sh-sy5y was used as a model system. high-affinity binding sites for [3h]norharman (synonymous: beta-carboline) were detected. pharmacological characterization revealed displacement of the ligand by beta-carbolines, to a weaker extent by indoleamines, but not by opioids, muscarinic receptor agonists, metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists or several peptide neurotransmitters. inositol phosphate accumulation was only slightly affected by the beta-carbolines. however, the action of carbachol was clearly facilitated in a dose-dependent and  pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. pretreatment of the cells with clostridium difficile toxin b blocked the facilitating effect of the beta-carbolines by concentrations which did not affect the action of carbachol alone. this suggests  that low molecular weight gtp-binding proteins are involved in the facilitating action of the beta-carbolines. this mechanism was further supported by experiments measuring the concentrations of phosphatidylinositol phosphates after various activating compounds. in conclusion, the facilitating effect of beta-carbolines on inositol phosphate accumulation could play a part in the actions of beta-carbolines and may be produced by stimulating the generation of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (ptdins-4,5-p2), the key component in the activation of phosphoinositide-phospholipase c.

AB  == we utilized clostridial toxins (with known specificities for inhibition of gtpases) to ascertain the contribution of candidate gtpases in physiologic insulin secretion from beta cells. exposure of normal rat islets or isolated beta (hit-t15) cells to clostridium difficile toxins a and b catalyzed the glucosylation (and thereby the inactivation) of rac, cdc42, and rho endogenous to beta cells; concomitantly, either toxin reduced glucose- or potassium-induced insulin secretion from rat islets and hit cells. treatment of beta cells with clostridium sordellii lethal toxin (lt; which modified only ras, rap, and rac) also reduced glucose- or potassium-induced secretion. however, clostridial toxin  c3-exoenzyme (which adp-ribosylates and inactivates only rho) was without any effect on either glucose- or potassium-induced insulin secretion. these data suggest that cdc42, rac, ras, and/or rap (but not rho) may be needed for glucose- or potassium-mediated secretion. the effects of these toxins appear to be specific on stimulus-secretion coupling, since no difference in metabolic viability (assessed colorimetrically by quantitating the conversion of the tetrazolium salt into a formazan in a reduction reaction driven by nutrient metabolism) was demonstrable between control and toxin (a or lt)-treated beta cells. toxin (a or lt) treatment also did not alter glucose- or potassium-mediated rises in cytosolic free calcium concentrations ([ca2+]i), suggesting that these gtpases are involved in steps distal to elevations in [ca2+]i. recent findings indicate that the carboxyl methylation of cdc42 is stimulated by only glucose, whereas that of rap (kowluru et al., j clin invest 98: 540-555, 1996) and rac (present study) are regulated by glucose or potassium. together, these findings provide direct evidence, for the first time, that the rho subfamily of gtpases plays a key regulatory role(s) in insulin secretion, and they suggest that cdc42 may be required for early steps in glucose stimulation of insulin release, whereas rap and/or rac may be required for a later step(s) in the stimulus-secretion coupling cascade (i.e. ca2+-induced exocytosis of insulin).

TI  == bacterial toxins block endothelial wound repair. evidence that rho gtpases control cytoskeletal rearrangements in migrating endothelial cells.
AB  == we investigated the effect of bacterial toxins that modify and inactivate rho gtp-binding proteins on the migratory response of endothelial cells to wounding.  c3-transferase from clostridium botulinum, edin from staphylococcus aureus, and toxin a from clostridium difficile blocked migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvecs) in an in vitro wound repair assay. migrating huvecs expressed actin microspikes (maximum at 10 minutes after wounding), ruffles (maximum at 12 hours), and fibers (maximum at 24 hours), and within these actin structures, vinculin-containing focal complexes/adhesions were formed. c3-transferase adp ribosylated rhoa, rhob, and rhoc in huvecs and abolished the formation of actin stress fibers/focal adhesions but had no effect on expression  of microspikes, ruffles, or the associated vinculin-containing focal complexes. similar results were obtained with edin and toxin a. these results indicate that  endothelial cells migrating into a wounded area express distinct combinations of  actin/vinculin structures in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. the gtpase rho selectively controls the formation of actin fibers/focal adhesions that occurs 2 to 24 hours after wounding. a mechanism is proposed by which rho-specific bacterial toxins could influence vascular repair, angiogenesis, or atherosclerosis.

TI  == antibody responses to clostridial infection in humans.
AB  == serum antibody responses to the major toxins produced by clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, clostridium septicum, clostridium tetani, and clostridium botulinum have been documented following infection. effective toxoid  vaccines for tetanus and enteritis necroticans due to c. perfringens type c demonstrate the potential of antitoxin responses. although individual serum and mucosal antibody responses to c. difficile enterotoxin (toxin a) vary, one-third  of patients with c. difficile diarrhea develop neutralizing serum antibodies. iga in the serum, not igg, is typically responsible for this neutralization, suggesting a unique role for serum iga in response to c. difficile infection, an  infection that is usually limited to the intestinal mucosa. the relationship of naturally occurring antitoxin antibodies to the clinical course of c. difficile infection is controversial. however, patients with chronic relapsing c. difficile diarrhea and low levels of igg to toxin a have shown clinical responses following intravenous therapy with immune globulin. antibody responses to non-toxin c. difficile proteins also occur, but their significance is only partially known.

TI  == involvement of rho family proteins in prostaglandin f2 alpha-induced phospholipase d activation in the osteoblast-like cell line mc3t3-e1.
AB  == to examine the role of rho family proteins in prostaglandin f2 alpha (pgf2 alpha)-mediated phospholipase d (pld) activation of osteoblast-like cell line mc3t3-e1 cells, we used toxin-b from clostridium difficile, which inhibits rho family proteins by monoglucosylation. pretreatment of [3h]myristic acid-labeled mc3t3-e1 cells with toxin b induced rounding-up of the cells and inhibited the pgf2 alpha-induced pld activation by 60%, but not the phospholipase c (plc) activation. cytochalasin d also induced rounding the cells, but showed a small inhibition in the pld activation. brefeldin a (bfa) had marginal inhibitory effect on the pgf2 alpha-induced pld activation. in digitonin-permeabilized mc3t3-e1 cells, [3h]p but formation was stimulated by guanosine 5'-o-(3-thiotriphosphate) (gtp gamma s) or 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (pma) in the presence of ca2+ (1 microm) and atp (1 mm), and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (pip2) was also required for its full pld activation. pretreatment of the digitonin-permeabilized mc3t3-e1 cells with toxin b reduced the gtp gamma s- and pma-stimulated pld activities by 80% and 60%, respectively.  on the other hand, c3 toxin which inhibits rho by adp-ribosylation, exerted a partial inhibitory effect on the gtp gamma s-stimulated pld activity. these results suggest that cdc42 as well as rhoa appear to be involved in the pld activation mediated by pgf2 alpha and also that the pld activation may be independent of actin cytoskeleton in mc3t3-e1 cells.

TI  == rho proteins play a critical role in cell migration during the early phase of mucosal restitution.
AB  == in the intestine, several growth factors stimulate migration of epithelial cells, contributing to the maintenance of tissue integrity. the ras-like gtpase rho regulates a signal transduction pathway linking growth factor receptors to the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, presumed to be important for motility. using an in vitro wound-induced migration assay, we have examined the role of rho gtpases in the migration of iec-6 and caco-2 cells, and provide evidence that the rho gtpases play an essential role in the initial phase of mucosal wound healing. treatment of the cells with clostridium difficile toxins a and b, inhibitors of the rho family gtpases inhibited migration in a dose-dependent fashion. microinjection of the inhibitory exchange factor rho-guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (gdi), or clostridium botulinum c3  adp-ribosyl transferase (c3) toxin, a rho-adp-ribosylating exoenzyme, potently inhibited migration. microinjection of rhot19n, a dominant negative form of rhoa, or in vitro adp-ribosylated rhoa impaired the ability of cells to migrate. rho-gdi and c3 exoenzyme also inhibited egf-induced migration of iec-6 cells. these results demonstrate that rho is required for endogenous and egf-induced migration of small intestinal crypt cells, and that rho proteins are essential elements of a mechanism by which growth factors induce cell migration to restitute mucosal integrity.

TI  == transcription analysis of the genes tcda-e of the pathogenicity locus of clostridium difficile.
AB  == to analyse the transcription pattern of the five tcda-e genes of the pathogenicity locus (paloc) of clostridium difficile a protocol was established to purify rna from strain vpi10463. transcription analysis of the five tcda-e genes showed that they were all transcribed. in the early exponential phase, a high level of tcdc and low levels of tcda,b,d,e transcripts were detectable; this was inverted in the stationary phase, suggesting that tcdc might have a negative  influence on transcription of the other genes. three transcription initiation sites, one for tcda and two for tcdb were determined by primer extension analysis. readthrough transcripts from outside the locus were not obtainable, so  that parts of the transcription of tcdd, tcdb, tcda and tcdc must occur by monocistronic transcription. within the locus all possible intergenic readthrough transcripts were detectable except that between tcdc and tcda, a stretch of dna interrupted by a functional transcription terminator. thus we found mono- and polycistronic transcription of tcda and tcdb to occur which should lead to production of a surplus of tcda over tcdb transcripts. this would explain the surplus of tcda over tcdb expression observed in vitro. due to its basic nature and similarity to bcna of clostridium perfringens and to orf-22 of clostridium botulinum, tcdd is most probably a regulatory protein with dna-binding properties. on the basis of the presented study we discuss a model for the growth-phase-related, coordinate regulation of toxin expression wherein tcdc has  a negative and tcdd a positive regulatory function on transcription of the tcdd,b,e and tcda genes.

TI  == increased activity of small gtp-binding protein-dependent phospholipase d during  differentiation in human promyelocytic leukemic hl60 cells.
AB  == in response to dibutyryl cyclic amp (dbcamp) and all-trans retinoic acid, human promyelocytic leukemic hl60 cells differentiate into granulocyte-like cells. in cell lysate and in vitro reconstitution system, phospholipase d (pld) activity in response to guanosine 5'-o-(3-thiotriphosphate) (gtpgammas) was up-regulated by dbcamp or all-trans retinoic acid treatment. in the present study, the mechanism(s) for increased pld activity during differentiation was examined. western blot analysis revealed that the contents of adp-ribosylation factor, rac2, and cdc42hs but not rhoa and rac1 in the cytosolic fraction were elevated during differentiation. however, the cytosolic fraction from undifferentiated cells was almost equally potent as the cytosolic fraction from differentiated cells in the ability to stimulate membrane pld activity. it was shown that the gtpgammas-dependent pld activity in membranes from differentiated cells was much  higher than that in membranes from undifferentiated cells, suggesting that the increased pld activity during differentiation was due to alterations in some membrane component(s). clostridium botulinum adp-ribosyltransferase c3 and c. difficile toxin b, which are known as inhibitors of rhoa and rho family proteins, respectively, effectively suppressed pld activity in membranes from differentiated cells. in fact, the amount of membrane-associated rhoa was increased during differentiation. furthermore, the extent of gtpgammas-dependent  pld activity partially purified from membranes from differentiated cells was greater than that from membranes from undifferentiated cells in the presence of recombinant adp-ribosylation factor 1. the pld (hpld1) mrna level was observed to be up-regulated during differentiation, as inferred by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. our results suggest the possibility that the increased rho proteins in membranes and the changed level of pld itself may be, at least in part, responsible for the increase in gtpgammas-dependent pld activity during granulocytic differentiation of hl60 cells.

AB  == the influence of different adp-ribosylating and glucosylating cytotoxins on stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion in rat basophilic leukemia (rbl) cells was studied. treatment of rbl cells with clostridium botulinum c2 toxin, which specifically adp-ribosylated monomeric g-actin and caused complete depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in intact cells, inhibited fc epsilon ri receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with maximal effects at 100 ng/ml c2i and 200 ng/ml c2i. c2 toxin (10 ng/ml c2i and 20 ng/ml c2ii) increased antigen- or calcium ionophore (a23187)-stimulated [3h]serotonin release maximally by about 3 fold. clostridium botulinum c3, which adp-ribosylated rho in intact rbl cells, had no effect on protein tyrosine phosphorylation and stimulated secretion. in contrast, the cytotoxic clostridium difficile toxin b (toxb), which glucosylated the rho-subtype family members rhoa and cdc42, blocked or reduced antigen- or calcium ionophore-mediated [3h]serotonin release, respectively, and decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of a 110 kda protein. the data indicate that different actin pools control tyrosine phosphorylation and secretion in rbl cells and suggest that rho subfamily proteins regulate secretion independently of the actin cytoskeleton.

TI  == regulation of phospholipase c and d activities by small molecular weight g proteins and muscarinic receptors.
AB  == the role of small molecular weight guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (g proteins) of the rho family in muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (machr) signaling to phospholipase c (plc) and phospholipase d (pld) was studied in human embryonic kidney (hek) cells, stably expressing the human m3 receptor subtype. evidence for the involvement of rho proteins in m3 machr signaling to both phospholipases is based on findings obtained with clostridium (c.) difficile toxin b and c. botulinum c3 exoenzyme, both of which specifically, although by different mechanisms, inactivate rho family g proteins. toxin b potently inhibited both the machr-stimulated plc and pld activities in intact cells as well as the stimulation of both phospholipases by the stable gtp analog gtpgammas in permeabilized cells, the latter effect being mimicked by c3 exoenzyme. in contrast, plc and pld activities, measured in the presence of exogenous phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [ptdins(4,5)p2], a substrate and cofactor for plc and pld, respectively, were not altered. these data suggested that the rho-inactivating toxins inhibit stimulation of plc and pld by reducing the cellular level of ptdins(4,5)p2, which was indeed found with both toxin b and c3  exoenzyme. in agreement with a crucial role of cellular ptdins(4,5)p2 supply for  plc signaling, we observed that short-term agonist (carbachol) treatment of hek cells caused a long-lasting increase in ptdins(4,5)p2 level, accompanied by a potentiation of receptor- and g protein-stimulated inositol phosphate formation.  finally, studies with tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphatase inhibitors strongly suggest that ptdins(4,5)p2 synthesis and machr-stimulated pld activity in hek cells apparently also involve a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism(s). thus, m3 machr signaling to plc and pld in hek cells requires the concerted action of various intracellular components, most notably the complex regulation of ptdins(4,5)p2 synthesis.

TI  == role of rho proteins in carbachol-induced contractions in intact and permeabilized guinea-pig intestinal smooth muscle.
AB  == 1. the aim of this study was to determine whether the low molecular mass gtpase rhoa or related proteins are involved in carbachol- and high-k(+)-induced contractions in intact intestinal smooth muscle as well as the carbachol-induced  increase in ca2+ sensitivity of the myofilaments in permeabilized preparations. 2. the carbachol-induced increase in the ca2+ sensitivity of force production in  beta-escin-permeabilized intestinal smooth muscle was enhanced in preparations that were loaded with the constitutively active mutant of rhoa, val14rhoa, and was inhibited by exoenzyme c3 from clostridium botulinum, which adp-ribosylates and inactivates small gtpases of the rho family. the effect of c3 on ca2+ sensitivity in the absence of the agonist was negligible, while the maximal ca(2+)-activated force was inhibited by about 20%. 3. inhibition of carbachol-induced force was associated with an increase in adp-ribosylation of a  protein band with a molecular mass of approximately 22 kda, corresponding to rho, and was partially reversed in the presence of ile41rhoa, which is not a substrate for c3. val14rhoa did not restore carbachol-induced ca2+ sensitization in c3-treated smooth muscle. 4. in intact intestinal smooth muscle, toxin b from clostridium difficile, which monoglucosylates members of the rho family, inhibited high-k(+)-induced contractions and the initial phasic response to carbachol by about 30%. the delayed contractile response to carbachol was completely inhibited. 5. in smooth muscle preparations that were permeabilized with beta-escin after treatment with toxin b, carbachol-and gtp gamma s-induced ca2+ sensitization was significantly inhibited. 6. these findings are consistent  with a role for rho or rho-like proteins in agonist-induced increase in ca2+ sensitivity of force production in intact and permeabilized intestinal smooth muscle.

TI  == inhibition by toxin b of inositol phosphate formation induced by g protein-coupled and tyrosine kinase receptors in n1e-115 neuroblastoma cells: involvement of rho proteins.
AB  == g protein-coupled receptors activate phospholipase c (plc)-beta isoforms by the alpha or beta gamma subunits of g proteins, whereas growth-factor receptors activate plc-gamma isoforms by phosphorylating tyrosine residues of the enzyme. as a common substrate for plc enzymes, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [ptdins(4,5)p2] may play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular plc activity. because small-molecular-weight g proteins have been implicated in the synthesis of ptdins(4,5)p2, we studied the effect of clostridium difficile toxin  b, which glucosylates and thereby inactivates small g proteins of the rho family, on receptor-stimulated plc activity. we report here that in n1e-115 neuroblastoma cells, stimulation of inositol phosphate formation by the g protein-coupled receptor agonists bradykinin and lysophosphatidic acid and by the tyrosine kinase receptor agonist platelet-derived growth factor is largely attenuated by toxin b  treatment. furthermore, inositol phosphate production stimulated by the stable gtp analog guanosine 5'-o-(3-thio)-triphosphate in permeabilized n1e-115 cells was inhibited by c3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates rho proteins. the inhibition by toxin b was apparently not caused by its effect on the cytoskeleton. in addition, the level of platelet-derived growth factor receptors, which was studied with immunoblotting, was unaffected by toxin b. using exogenous ptdlns(4,5)p2 as plc substrate, it was found that the intrinsic enzymatic activity of plc activated either by ca2+ or by guanosine 5'-o-(3-thio)triphosphate was not altered by toxin b. however, toxin b decreased  strongly, by up to 80%, the cellular level of ptdins(4,5)p2 in a concentration-dependent manner, without changing those of phosphatidylinositol and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate. these results, together with the recent finding that rho family proteins can regulate phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase activity, demonstrate that rho proteins are presumably important regulators of ptdins(4,5)p2 synthesis and, thereby, play an integral role in the  regulation of cellular signaling by plc enzymes.

AB  == the bacterial pathogen clostridium difficle synthesizes two high-molecular-weight toxins (a and b), which exhibit toxic effects in vivo and in vitro. here, we present evidence that the major intracellular targets of these two toxins are the rho gtpases. overexpression of rhoa, rhob, or rhoc gtpases in transfected hela cells conferred an increased resistance to toxins a and b, indicating that these  toxins cause their cytopathic effects primarily by affecting rho proteins. in addition, toxin a and b treatment appeared to result in modification of rho, since rho isolated from toxin-treated cells had a decreased ability to be adp-ribosylated by clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme. in contrast, the lethal toxin (lt) of clostridium sordellii, although structurally and immunologically related to c. difficile toxin b, appeared to induce cytopathic effects independently of the rho gtpases. overexpression of rhoa in transfected hela cells did not protect them from the effect of lt, and rho isolated from lysates of lt-treated cells was not resistant to modification by c3. immunofluorescence studies showed that lt treatment caused a cytopathic effect that was very different from those described for c. difficile toxins a and b, resulting in an increase in cortical f-actin, with a concomitant decrease in the number of stress fibers, and in the formation of numerous microvilli containing the actin-bundling protein fimbrin/plastin.

AB  == the synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. a vector free digoxigenin-dutp-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the cloned plc gene of c.perfringens strain atcc 13124. in a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of c.perfringens were tested for plc. none of the strains failed in hybridization. presence of plc was even demonstrated in c.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. none different clostridia sp. tested, e.g. c.bifermentans, c.tertium, c.novyi, c.chauvoei, c.sporogenes, c.difficile, c.putrifucum, c.sordellii, c.botulinum, c. septicum and c.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with dna hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of c.perfringens plc.

TI  == the low molecular mass gtp-binding protein rho is affected by toxin a from clostridium difficile.
AB  == enterotoxin a is one of the major virulence factors of clostridium difficile, and the causative agent of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis. in cell culture (nih-3t3, rat basophilic leukemia cells) toxin a inhibits clostridium botulinum adp-ribosyltransferase c3 (c3)-catalyzed adp-ribosylation of the low molecular mass gtp-binding rho proteins. rho participates in the regulation of the microfilament cytoskeleton. decrease in adp-ribosylation of rho occurs in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and precedes the toxin a-induced destruction of the actin cytoskeleton. action of toxin a is not due to proteolytical degradation of rho or to an inherent adp-ribosyltransferase activity of toxin a. toxin a-induced decrease in adp-ribosylation is observed also in cell lysates and with recombinant rhoa protein. a heat stable low molecular mass cytosolic factor is essential for the toxin effect on rho. thus, the enterotoxin (toxin a) resembles the effects of the c. difficile cytotoxin (toxin b) on rho proteins (just, i., g. fritz, k. aktories, m. giry, m. r. popoff, p. boquet, s. hegenbath, and c. von eichel-streiber. 1994. j. biol. chem. 269:10706-10712). the data indicate that despite different in vivo effects, toxin a and toxin b act on the same cellular target protein rho to elicit their toxic effects.

TI  == clostridial infection in children.
AB  == a survey of the isolation of clostridium spp. from 1543 specimens sent to anaerobic microbiology laboratories revealed 113 isolates from 107 specimens (7.0% of all specimens) from 96 children. the isolates comprised 43 (38%) unidentified clostridium spp., 37 (33%) c. perfringens, 13 (12%) c. ramosum, five (4%) c. innocuum, six (5%) c. botulinum, three (3%) c. difficile, two (2%) c. butyricum, and one isolate each of c. bifermentans, c. clostridiiforme, c. limosum and c. paraputrificum. most clostridial isolates were from abscesses (38), peritonitis (26), bacteraemia (10), and chronic otitis media (7). predisposing or underlying conditions were present in 31 (32%) cases. these were  immunodeficiency (12), malignancy (9), diabetes (7), trauma (7), presence of a foreign body (6) and previous surgery (6). the clostridia were the only bacterial isolates in 14 (15%) cases; 82 (85%) cases had mixed infection. the species most  commonly isolated with clostridia were anaerobic cocci (57); bacteroides spp. (b. fragilis group) (50), escherichia coli (22), pigmented prevotella or porphyromonas spp. (18) and fusobacterium spp. (10). most bacteroides and escherichia coli isolates with clostridia were from abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections adjacent to the rectal area; most pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas isolates were from oropharyngeal, pulmonary, and head and neck  sites. antimicrobial therapy was given to all patients, in conjunction with surgical drainage in 34 (35%). only two patients died. these data illustrate the  importance of clostridium spp. in paediatric infections.

TI  == probing the action of clostridium difficile toxin b in xenopus laevis oocytes.
AB  == clostridium difficile toxin b and clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme caused comparable morphological alteration of cho cells, which was accompanied by disaggregation of the microfilamental cytoskeleton. the cytotoxic effect of toxin b was correlated with a decrease in c3-catalyzed adp-ribosylation of the low-molecular-mass gtp-binding protein rho, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. we used xenopus laevis oocytes as a model to study the toxin effect on rho in more detail. toxin b treatment of oocytes caused a decrease in subsequent adp-ribosylation of cytoplasmic rho by c3. this decrease was observed when toxin b was applied externally or after microinjection. besides endogenous rho, microinjected recombinant rho-glutathione s-transferase fusion protein was affected. impaired adp-ribosylation of rho was neither due to altered guanine nucleotide binding nor to complexation with the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor, which is known to inactivate rho and to prevent rho modification by c3. proteolytical degradation of rho was excluded by immunoblot analysis. in intact oocytes toxin b caused neither adp-ribosylation nor phosphorylation of rho. the data indicate that c. difficile toxin b acts on rho proteins in xenopus oocytes to inhibit adp-ribosylation by c3. it is suggested that toxin b mediates its cytotoxic effect via functional inactivation of rho.

TI  == clostridium difficile toxin b acts on the gtp-binding protein rho.
AB  == clostridium difficile toxin b exhibits cytotoxic activity that is characterized by the disruption of the microfilamental cytoskeleton. here we studied whether the gtp-binding rho protein, which reportedly participates in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, is involved in the toxin action. toxin b treatment of chinese hamster ovary cells reveals a time- and concentration-dependent decrease  in the adp-ribosylation of rho by clostridium botulinum c3 exoenzyme in the cell  lysate. disruption of the microfilament system induced by c. botulinum c2 toxin or cytochalasin d does not cause impaired adp-ribosylation of rho. toxin b exhibits its effects on rho not only in intact cells but also when added to cell  lysates. besides endogenous rho, rhoa-glutathione s-transferase (rho-gst) fusion  protein added to cell lysate showed decreased adp-ribosylation after toxin b treatment. immunoblot analysis reveals identical amounts of rho-gst and no change in molecular mass after toxin b treatment compared with controls. adp-ribosylation of rho-gst purified from toxin b-treated cell lysate is inhibited, indicating a modification of rho itself. finally, transfection of rhoa dna under the control of a strong promoter into cells protects them from the activity of toxin b. altogether, the data indicate that c. difficile toxin b acts directly or indirectly on rho proteins to inhibit adp-ribosylation and suggest that the cytotoxic effect of toxin b involves rho.

TI  == cellular and molecular actions of binary toxins possessing adp-ribosyltransferase activity.
AB  == clostridial organisms produce a number of binary toxins. thus far, three complete toxins (botulinum, perfringens and spiroforme) and one incomplete toxin (difficile) have been identified. in the case of complete toxins, there is a heavy chain component (mr approximately 100,000) that binds to target cells and helps create a docking site for the light chain component (mr approximately 50,000). the latter is an enzyme that possesses mono(adp-ribosyl)transferase activity. the toxins appear to proceed through a three step sequence to exert their effects, including a binding step, an internalization step and an intracellular poisoning step. the substrate for the toxins is g-actin. by virtue  of adp-ribosylating monomeric actin, the toxins prevent polymerization as well as promoting depolymerization. the most characteristic cellular effect of the toxins is alteration of the cytoskeleton, which leads directly to changes in cellular morphology and indirectly to changes in cell function (e.g. release of chemical mediators). binary toxins capable of modifying actin are likely to be useful tools in the study of cell biology.

TI  == actin-specific adp-ribosyltransferase produced by a clostridium difficile strain.
AB  == by screening possible adp-ribosyltransferase activities in culture supernatants from various clostridium species, we have found one clostridium difficile strain  (cd196) (isolated in our laboratory) that is able to produce, in addition to toxins a and b, a new adp-ribosyltransferase that was shown to covalently modify  cell actin as clostridium botulinum c2 or clostridium perfringens e iota toxins do. the molecular weight of the cd196 adp-ribosyltransferase (cdt) was determined to be 43 kilodaltons, and its isoelectric point was 7.8. no cytotoxic activity on vero cells or lethal activity upon injection in mice was associated with this enzyme. cdt was neither related to c. difficile a or b toxins nor to c. botulinum c2 toxin component i. however, vero cells cultivated in the presence of c. difficile b toxin had a lower amount of actin able to be adp-ribosylated by cdt or c2 toxin in vitro. antibodies raised against cdt reacted by immunoblot analysis with a 43-kilodalton protein of c. perfringens type e culture supernatant producing the iota toxin.

TI  == partial characterization of the enzymatic activity associated with the binary toxin (type c2) produced by clostridium botulinum.
AB  == clostridium botulinum produces a binary toxin that possesses a heavy chain (approximately 100,000 daltons) and a light chain (approximately 50,000 daltons). the heavy chain is a binding component that directs the toxin to vulnerable cells, and the light chain is an enzyme that has mono(adp-ribosyl)ating activity. a number of experiments have been done to help characterize the enzymatic activity of the toxin. the data reveal that the enzyme has a ph optimum within the range of 7.0 to 8.0. it is not inhibited or stimulated by physiological concentrations of sodium, potassium, calcium, or magnesium. the enzyme is inhibited by high concentrations of salt, however, as well as high concentrations of nicotinamide, thymidine, theophylline, and histamine; and it is stimulated by  histone and lysolecithin. boiling irreversibly denatures the light chain of the toxin, but denaturation caused by guanidine and urea is substantially reversible. enzymatic activity is not altered by short exposure to lysosomal proteases, including cathepsin b, cathepsin h, dipeptidyl aminopeptidase, and catheptic carboxypeptidase b.

AB  == infant botulism results when clostridium botulinum spores germinate, colonize the gut, and there produce botulinal toxin, which after absorption causes flaccid muscle paralysis. the observed variation in the severity of the disease was linked to the infant's milk source, in that all sudden death cases indistinguishable from typical crib death occurred in infants who had been formula-fed, whereas the more gradual onset, hospitalized cases occurred in infants who were predominantly breast-fed. secretory iga antibody against c. botulinum vegetative cell antigens was found in human milk from mothers of both healthy infants and patients, a finding that further confirms the functioning of  the "mucosal immune system" in humans. the hypothesis that some crib deaths might also result from other intestinally produced bacterial toxins was investigated by injecting infant rhesus monkeys with microgram amounts of purified clostridium difficile toxins a and b; quiet death pathologically consistent with human crib death occurred within 4 hr to 10 hr. this and other evidence suggest that infant  botulism may be the prototype of a putative class of heretofore unrecognized diseases, the "toxigenic intestinal infections of infancy." collectively, these illnesses may account for a modest proportion of crib death, against which human  milk may provide relative protection.

AB  == anaerobic bacteria are part of the normal flora of mucous membranes and outnumber aerobic bacteria in the oral cavity and gastrointestinal tract. anaerobes can be  isolated from pediatric patients with various infections when appropriate techniques for transportation and cultivation of samples are employed. frequently anaerobes are isolated in combination with other facultative or aerobic bacteria. the genera or groups of anaerobes most frequently isolated from pyogenic infections in children are (in order of decreasing frequency) offteroides, clostridium, gram-positive cocci, fusobacterium, gram-positive rods (eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, actinomyces, and bifidobacterium), and gram-negative cocci (veillonella and acidaminococcus). clostridium perfringens causes bacteremia and wound infections. clostridium botulinum can produce a paralytic toxin that causes a lethal illness in adults and a paralytic syndrome in infants. clostridium difficile can cause antibiotic-associated colitis or diarrhea. bacteroides fragilis is most frequently involved in intraabdominal infections, infections of the female genital tract, subcutaneous abscesses, and bacteremia. bacteroides melaninogenicus and bacteroides oralis are the predominent anaerobes in orofacial infections and aspiration pneumonia. fusobacterium species are pathogens in aspiration pneumonia, brain abscesses, and orofacial infections. anaerobic gram-positive cocci can be recovered from all types of infections but predominate in respiratory tract and intra-abdominal infections. recognition of the pathogenic qualities of the various anaerobic organisms can assist in their prompt identification and in the initiation of appropriate therapy.

TI  == rapid death of infant rhesus monkeys injected with clostridium difficile toxins a and b: physiologic and pathologic basis.
AB  == clostridium botulinum can colonize and produce botulinal toxin in the human infant intestine, which the toxin then permeates to cause generalized flaccid paralysis, and occasionally, sudden death. this study was undertaken to test the  hypothesis that toxins produced by other intestinal clostridia, e.g., c. difficile, might also cause systemic illness and sometimes death in infants (j pediatr 100:568, 1982). because this hypothesis could not be evaluated clinically until the systemic manifestations of c. difficile toxins in primates were known,  infant rhesus monkeys were given 6 to 11 micrograms/kg of the recently purified c. difficile toxins a or b, either intravenously or intraperitoneally. the animals showed no abnormalities for several hours, but then developed lethargy, hypotonia, hypothermia, and, shortly before death, sudden elevation of serum concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus and of enzymes that derived mainly from skeletal muscle, heart and brain. five of six animals died quietly 3.5 to 8.0 hours after onset of symptoms. death appeared to result from cessation of breathing, after which the sinus tachycardia then deteriorated to a  flat ecg. necropsy findings were insufficient to explain the cause of death. it appears that in infant monkeys microgram amounts of c. difficile toxins a and b can produce a rapid quiet death, the cause of which is undetectable at necropsy,  a situation pathologically reminiscent of crib death in human infants, although the possible clinical identity of these two conditions has yet to be established.

AB  == freshly compared cell suspensions of clostridia (clostridium bifermentans, c. botulinum proteolytic type a, c. difficile, c. sordellii, and c. sporogenes) and  peptostreptococcus anaerobius converted leucine to isovaleric (iv) and isocaproic (ic) acids in the absence of other amino acids. the optimal ph for conversion was between 8 and 9 at 37 degrees c. the stoichiometry of reaction was compatible with that expected for the stickland reaction, as the ratio of iv to ic was 1:2,  the amount of co2 produced was equivalent to that of iv, and ammonium ion concentrations were equal to the total c5 and c6 acids formed. the presence of alanine and valine (proton donors in the stickland reaction) in incubations effectively increased the concentration of ic at the expense of iv production, implying that leucine acted there primarily as a proton acceptor. glycine and proline (proton acceptors) stimulated both iv and ic production from leucine, but increases in iv concentrations were proportionately greater than for ic so that leucine was primarily a proton donor in the presence of proton acceptors. glucose stimulated the conversion of leucine to volatile fatty acids but favoured ic production. production of ic from leucine was inhibited by surface active compounds (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and desoxycholate) as well as arsenite  and iodoacetate. the redox dyes methyl viologen and phenosafranine inhibited ic production more severely than iv production, as did the nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, metronidazole.

TI  == toxin-producing bacteria in infants. lack of an association with sudden infant death syndrome.
AB  == after finding enterotoxigenic (et) escherichia coli in two consecutive cases of sudden infant death syndrome (sids), we initiated a prospective search for et e coli in sids in manitoba; in addition, we looked for toxigenic clostridium botulinum and c difficile. in a 21-month period, small- and large-bowel contents  were obtained in 33 cases of sids, from 32 control subjects, and in ten suspected cases of sids. neither c botulinum nor et e coli was isolated from any of these;  c difficile was cultured from postmortem bowel contents of two sids and seven control cases. the overall isolation rate of c difficile was 17%. despite the fact that two of these cases had toxin detectable in the bowel contents, no evidence of colitis was found in any of the cases with c difficile. we conclude that c botulinum or et e coli have only a small role, if any, in the etiology of  sids, and that c difficile is found relatively commonly in the gastrointestinal tract of infants without apparent local or systemic effects.

TI  == the metabolism of pyrimidines by proteolytic clostridia.
AB  == uracil was used by growing cultures of clostridium sporogenes, and by proteolytic strains of c. botulinum types a and b. uracil was not used by c. bifermentans; c. botulinum, type b (non-proteolytic); c. botulinum, type f (non-proteolytic); c. botulinum, type e; c. butyricum; c. cochlearium; c. difficile; c. histolyticum; c. oedematiens, type a; c. paraputrificum; c. scatologenes; c. specticum; c. sordellii; c. sticklandii; c. tertium; c. tetani; c. tetanomorphum; c. welchii, types a, b, c, e and 4 untyped strains. the growth of c. sporogenes was not increased by uracil; it was reduced to dihydrouracil. experiments with washed cells of c. sporogenes showed that the uracil-reducing system was inducible. washed cell suspensions incubated under hydrogen with uracil, thymine, iso-barbituric acid, 5-amino uracil and cytosine consumed 1 mole h2/mole pyrimidine. the reduction product of cytosine was dihydrouracil indicating that it was deaminated before reduction. the reduction products of the remaining pyrimidines were the corresponding dihydro derivatives. extracts of c. sporogenes reduced uracil in the presence of nadph2 but not nadh2.
