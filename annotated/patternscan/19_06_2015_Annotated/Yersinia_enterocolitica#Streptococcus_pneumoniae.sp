TI  == technological and probiotic potential of bgra43 a natural isolate of lactobacillus helveticus.
AB  == lactobacillus helveticus bgra43 is a human intestinal isolate showing antimicrobial activity, amongst others, against yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, shigella flexneri, and streptococcus pneumoniae. bgra43 produces prth proteinase with proteolytic activity on both casein and beta-lactoglobulin (blg). bgra43 is able to reduce the allergenicity of blg. bioactive peptides released in bgra43 fermented milk are potent modulators of innate immunity by modulating the  production of proinflammatory cytokines il-6 and tnf-alpha. bgra43 is able to survive in simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. the growth of bgra43 in milk results in a fast acidification lowering the milk ph to 4.53 generating mild, homogeneous, and viscous yogurt-like product. the strain bgra43 grows suitably in pure cow or goat's milk as well as in milk containing inulin or nutrim even when they are used as the sole carbon source. it is suggested that strain bgra43 could be used as a single-strain culture for the preparation of yogurt-like products from bovine or caprine milk. overall, l. helveticus bgra43 could be considered as a potential probiotic candidate with appropriate technological properties attractive for the dairy industry.

TI  == [antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl  of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive  and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia  coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.

TI  == modulation of connexin signaling by bacterial pathogens and their toxins.
AB  == inherent to their pivotal tasks in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis, gap junctions, connexin hemichannels, and pannexin hemichannels are frequently involved in the dysregulation of this critical balance. the present paper specifically focuses on their roles in bacterial infection and disease. in particular, the reported biological outcome of clinically important bacteria including escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, helicobacter pylori, bordetella pertussis, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter rodentium, clostridium species, streptococcus pneumoniae, and staphylococcus aureus and their toxic products on connexin- and pannexin-related signaling in host cells is reviewed. particular attention is paid to the underlying molecular mechanisms of these effects as well as to the actual biological relevance of these findings.

TI  == sideromycins: tools and antibiotics.
AB  == sideromycins are antibiotics covalently linked to siderophores. they are actively transported into gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. energy-coupled transport across the outer membrane and the cytoplasmic membrane strongly increases their antibiotic efficiency; their minimal inhibitory concentration is  at least 100-fold lower than that of antibiotics that enter cells by diffusion. this is particularly relevant for gram-negative bacteria because the outer membrane, which usually forms a permeability barrier, in this case actively contributes to the uptake of sideromycins. sideromycin-resistant mutants can be used to identify siderophore transport systems since the mutations are usually in transport genes. two sideromycins, albomycin and salmycin, are discussed here. albomycin, a derivative of ferrichrome with a bound thioribosyl-pyrimidine moiety, inhibts seryl-t-rna synthetase. salmycin, a ferrioxamine derivative with  a bound aminodisaccharide, presumably inhibts protein synthesis. crystal structures of albomycin bound to the outer membrane transporter fhua and the periplasmic binding protein fhud have been determined. albomycin and salmycin have been used to characterize the transport systems of escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae and of staphylococcus aureus, respectively. the in vivo  efficacy of albomycin and salmycin has been examined in a mouse model using yersinia enterocolitica, s. pneumoniae, and s. aureus infections. albomycin is effective in clearing infections, whereas salmycin is too unstable to lead to a large reduction in bacterial numbers. the recovery rate of albomycin-resistant mutants is lower than that of the wild-type, which suggests a reduced fitness of  the mutants. albomycin could be a useful antibiotic provided sufficient quantities can be isolated from streptomycetes or synthesized chemically.

TI  == recombining population structure of plesiomonas shigelloides (enterobacteriaceae) revealed by multilocus sequence typing.
AB  == plesiomonas shigelloides is an emerging pathogen that is widespread in the aquatic environment and is responsible for intestinal diseases and extraintestinal infections in humans and other animals. virtually nothing is known about its genetic diversity, population structure, and evolution, which severely limits epidemiological control. we addressed these questions by developing a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) system based on five genes (fusa,  leus, pyrg, recg, and rpob) and analyzing 77 epidemiologically unrelated strains  from several countries and several ecological sources. the phylogenetic position  of p. shigelloides within family enterobacteriaceae was precisely defined by phylogenetic analysis of the same gene portions in other family members. within p. shigelloides, high levels of nucleotide diversity (average percentage of nucleotide differences between strains, 1.49%) and genotypic diversity (64 distinct sequence types; simpson's index, 99.7%) were found, with no salient internal phylogenetic structure. we estimated that homologous recombination in housekeeping genes affects p. shigelloides alleles and nucleotides 7 and 77 times more frequently than mutation, respectively. these ratios are similar to those observed in the naturally transformable species streptococcus pneumoniae with a high rate of recombination. in contrast, recombination within salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica was much less frequent. p. shigelloides thus stands out among members of the enterobacteriaceae. its high rate of recombination results in a lack of association between genomic background and o and h antigenic factors, as observed for the 51 serotypes found in our sample. given its robustness and discriminatory power, we recommend mlst as a reference method for population biology studies and epidemiological tracking of p. shigelloides strains.

TI  == albomycin is an effective antibiotic, as exemplified with yersinia enterocolitica and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  == albomycin belongs to the class of sideromycins, compounds composed of iron carriers linked to antibiotic moieties. albomycin was found to be active against  bacteria that have a functional ferric hydroxamate transport system meaning that  bacteria will actively transport albomycin until they die. we examined the activity spectrum of albomycin for bacterial pathogens and found that enterobacteriaceae except species of proteus and morganella were sensitive. resistance in the two genera was due to the lack of the ferric hydroxamate transport system. among gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae were highly sensitive, whereas streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus epidermidis were resistant. the in vivo efficacy of albomycin was examined in mice infected with s. pneumoniae or yersinia enterocolitica. a single dose of 10mg albomycin/kg body weight reduced the colony-forming units of y. enterocolitica by three to four orders of magnitude. a single dose of 1mg albomycin/kg body weight was sufficient to clear  s. pneumoniae infections in mice. in direct competition experiments with wild-type s. pneumoniae and its albomycin-resistant mutant, the recovery rate of  the mutant was lower than for the wild-type indicating that the mutant had reduced fitness in the mouse model. we conclude that albomycin is effective in clearing infections caused by both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria in a  mouse model. albomycin treatment reduces the bacterial load allowing the immune system to remove residual albomycin-resistant bacteria, and as such would make albomycin-based antibiotics an adjunct to treatment. the ferrichrome transport system serves as a trojan horse to get albomycin into bacteria.

TI  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039): a new methoxy quinolone antibacterial.
AB  == moxifloxacin (bay 12-8039) is a new 8 methoxy quinolone antibacterial. the mic90  values are < or = 0.25 mg/l for streptococcus pneumoniae (irrespective of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), morexella catarrhalis, bordetella pertussis, legionella sp., mycoplasma pneumoniae, clamydia pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide-sensitive or -resistant), listeria sp., most enterobacteriaceae, salmonella sp., shigella sp., neisseria gonorrhoeae, n. menigitidis, pasteurella  spp., vibrio spp. and yersinia enterocolitica. for mycobacterium intracellularae, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia sp., serratia sp., p. aeruginosa and other non-fermentive gram-negative rods, mic90s are in the range 0.5-4 mg/l. for anaerobic bacteria species, mic90s are also in the range 0.25-4 mg/l. moxifloxacin is bactericidal at concentrations 2- to 4-fold higher than the mic and is rapidly bactericidal against most common pathogen groups at concentrations achieved in serum with a 400 mg dose that is between 0.5-4 mg/l. there is a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. resistant mutants are at present difficult to select in the laboratory but in general, moxifloxacin has poorer activity against strains resistant to ciprofloxacin compared to those which are susceptible. animal and laboratory pharmacodynamic models indicate that the mic and area under the serum concentration time curve predict outcome. various animal models mainly of respiratory tract infection indicate equivalent or superior results compared to existing or other developmental agents. human pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers indicate linear pharmacokinetics over the dose range 50-800 mg/day. a single dose of 400 mg produces a maximum serum concentration of 2.5-4.5 mg/l, half-life of 11-15 h,  auc of 25-40 mg x h/l and volume of distribution of 2.5-3.5 l/kg. protein binding is about 50% and two metabolites have been identified (m-1 and m-2). bioavailability is > 85% and a minority of clearance is via the kidneys. no dose  modification is required in renal impairment. extra vascular penetration, where studied, is comparable to that of other quinolones. at present undergoing clinical trials, with a focus on respiratory tract infection, it is likely that moxifloxacin will provide effective therapy for pathogens with mics of < or = 0.25-0.5 mg/l. the safety profile in a large number of human subjects is awaited.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == high levels of igg class antibodies to recombinant hsp60 kda of yersinia enterocolitica in sera of patients with uveitis.
AB  == aims: to determine the levels of igg class antibodies to recombinant heat shock protein 60 kda of yersinia enterocolitica (rhsp60ye), klebsiella pneumoniae (rhsp60kp), escherichia coli (rhsp60ec), shigella flexneri (rhsp60sf), and streptococcus pyogenes (rhsp60sp) in the serum of patients with hla-b27 associated acute anterior uveitis (hla-b27 associated aau), idiopathic acute anterior uveitis (idiopathic aau), pars planitis, vogt-koyanagi-harada (vkh), and healthy subjects. methods: the genes that code for hsp60ye, hsp60kp, hsp60ec, hsp60sf, and hsp60sp were cloned by pcr from genomic dna. the rhsps were purified by affinity using a ni-nta resin. the serum levels of igg class antibodies to rhsp60s were determined by elisa in patients with uveitis (n = 42) and in healthy subjects (n = 25). results: the majority of patients with uveitis had higher levels of igg class antibodies to rhsp60ye compared with levels of healthy subjects (p = 0.01), although these differences were only observed in the hla-b27 associated aau (p = 0.005) and in pars planitis patients (p = 0.001). the levels  of igg antibodies to the rhsp60kp, rhsp60sf, rhsp60ec, and rhsp60sp were similar  in patients with uveitis and in healthy subjects (p>0.05). conclusion: the results suggest that hsp60ye could be involved in the aetiology of hla-b27 associated aau and pars planitis.

TI  == severe bacterial infection in transfusion-dependent patients with thalassemia major.
AB  == the incidence and clinical spectrum of severe bacterial infection were studied in 89 patients with thalassemia major that was diagnosed between january 1971 and march 2002. there were 20 patients with 24 episodes of severe bacterial infection, resulting in an incidence of 1.6 infections per 100 patient-years. the clinical spectrum included liver abscess (6 cases), septicemia (6 cases), soft-tissue infection (2 cases), osteomyelitis (2 cases), corneal ulcer (1 case), enteritis (1 case), and abscesses of the lung, kidney, intra-abdominal region, retropharynx, gums, and buttocks (1 case each). the leading causal microorganisms were gram-negative bacilli, especially klebsiella pneumoniae (10 of 20 isolates). other responsible pathogens were pseudomonas aeruginosa (2/20), vibrio vulnificus (2/20), acinetobacter baumanii (1/20), streptococcus intermidius (1/20), yersinia enterocolitica (1/20), staphylococcus aureus (1/20), escherichia coli (1/20), and salmonella species (1/20). splenectomy and delays in the start of iron-chelating  therapy were 2 independent risk factors.

TI  == prevention and management of infection in children with sickle cell anaemia.
AB  == sickle cell anaemia (sca) predisposes a child to infections for various reasons,  including increased bone marrow turnover, poor perfusion and functional asplenia  leading to decreased opsonisation of polysaccharide encapsulated organisms. bacteria and viruses that most frequently cause serious infections in children with sickle cell disease are streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae type b, salmonella spp., escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumoniae, parvovirus b19 and hepatitis a, b and c viruses. penicillin prophylaxis has decreased the incidence of infection-related  morbidity and mortality significantly in children with sca. children <3 years of  age are administered oral penicillin 125mg twice daily, and the dose is increased to 250mg twice daily for the >3 to 5 year age group. adherence to the penicillin  prophylactic regimen is recommended for children with sca who are >5 years of age. for children with sca who have recurrent invasive pneumococcal infections, an effort is made to keep the child on penicillin prophylaxis indefinitely. the administration of various childhood vaccines has also made an appreciable impact  on the overall morbidity and mortality associated with infection in children with sca. the administration of the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (pcv7)  has provided control of invasive pneumococcal infections, and the prophylactic use of the h. influenzae type b conjugate vaccine has reduced the incidence of septicaemia and meningitis caused by this organism. other vaccines used prophylactically in children with sca include hepatitis a and b, and vaccines against influenza and varicella viruses. the immediate administration of intravenous antibacterials, after appropriate blood and urine cultures, is of great importance in the treatment of the febrile child with sca. ceftriaxone and  cefotaxime have been recommended for the treatment of septic episodes in sca associated with s. pneumoniae, haemophilus and salmonella spp. infection with yersinia enterocolitica may be treated with cefotaxime or an aminoglycoside. the  prevalence of helicobacter pylori infection in sca is unknown. effective therapies include metronidazole, tetracycline or amoxicillin. parvovirus infections require supportive care and specific antiviral therapy is not indicated. the judicious use of antimicrobials is encouraged in view of the worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. the long term sequelae associated with infections in children with sca can be decreased with the implementation of immunisation programmes and effective and prompt treatment with appropriate antibacterials.

TI  == infections in e-beta thalassemia.
AB  == infection is a major complication and the leading cause of death in thalassemia,  especially e-beta thalassemia. the spectrum of infections in e-beta thalassemia include mild and severe infections, therapy-related infections such as yersinia enterocolitica infection associated with desferrioxamine (dfo) therapy, and transfusion-transmitted disease, as well as unique infections such as with pythiosis. prospective studies in thailand indicate that patients with e-beta thalassemia had more frequent episodes of both mild and severe infections. the former included upper respiratory tract infection, acute gastroenteritis, cutaneous abscess, and gingivitis. severe infections occurred more commonly in patients with splenectomy and included septicemia, pneumonia, biliary tract infection, salmonellosis, and urinary tract infection. responsible organisms were escherichia coli (26%), klebsiella pneumoniae (23%), salmonella (15%), and streptococcus pneumoniae (13%). other organisms included pseudomonas, staphylococci, burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), and aeromonas. patients undergoing dfo therapy are at risk for y. enterocolitica infection which may be localized to mesenteric nodes and tonsils or occur as a generalized form such as  septicemia. recently, we have seen a unique infection so-called vascular pythiosis. patients usually presented with clinical features of vascular occlusion of lower limbs from ascending arteritis and thrombosis. the causative organism, pythium insidiosum, is fungus-like, in the kingdom stramenopila, and in the class oomycetes. the mortality rate is high and the only effective treatment  has been early amputation or possibly immunotherapy. the predisposing factors of  infections in thalassemia include splenectomy, iron overload, anemia, and granulocyte dysfunctions. general management of infections in thalassemia consist of prevention, i.e., immunization with pneumococcal and hepatitis vaccines, oral  penicillins especially in patients with splenectomy, removal of predisposing factors such as gallstones, iron overload, and appropriate antibiotics.

TI  == gatifloxacin: a new fluoroquinolone.
AB  == gatifloxacin is a new 8-methoxy-fluoroquinoline antimicrobial agent. it has enhanced activity against gram-positive and atypical agents, while retaining broad-spectrum antigram-negative activity. for example, the mic(90) values for respiratory tract pathogens are < or = 0.5 microg/ml for organisms such as streptococcus pneumoniae (regardless of penicillin susceptibility), haemophilus influenzae (beta-lactamase positive or negative), moraxella catarrhalis (beta-lactamase positive or negative), legionella species, mycoplasma pneumoniae, methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (macrolide sensitive or resistant), neisseria species, most enterobacteriaceae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, pasteurella species, vibrio species and yersinia enterocolitica. for methicillin-resistant s. aureus, ciprofloxacin-resistant s. aureus, citrobacter freundii, providencia species, serratia species, pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli, the mic(90) are elevated. gatifloxacin is bactericidal and exhibits a post-antibiotic effect against gram-positive and -negative bacteria. the standard dose is 400 mg once daily and is available in both oral and iv. formulation. gatifloxacin appears to have a low propensity for the selection of resistant mutants. clinical trial data supports the use of gatifloxacin for treatment of patients with respiratory tract, urinary tract, skin and soft tissue infections.  the side effect profile for gatifloxacin is similar to that with other agents.

TI  == photochemical inactivation of pathogenic bacteria in human platelet concentrates.
AB  == platelet concentrates (pc) may be infrequently contaminated with low levels of bacteria that can cause septicemia and death in patients receiving transfusion therapy. we evaluated the efficacy of a photochemical decontamination (pcd) technique using 8-methoxypsoralen (8-mop) and long wavelength uv light (uva) to inactivate bacteria in standard therapeutic pc. twelve phylogenetically distinct  pathogenic bacteria, 5 gram-positive and 7 gram-negative organisms, were seeded into pc to a final challenge dose ranging from 10(5) to 10(7) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml. contaminated pc were treated with 8-mop (5 micrograms/ml) and 5 j/cm2 of uva, a pcd treatment regimen found to adequately preserve in vitro platelet function. greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of all 5 gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, listeria monocytogenes, and corynebacterium minutissimum) and 2 of the gram-negative (escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica) organisms were inactivated. the remaining 5 gram-negative organisms were more resistant, with less than 10(1) to 10(3.7) cfu/ml inactivated under these conditions. the inactivation efficiency for this resistant group of gram-negative organisms was improved when pc were resuspended in a synthetic storage medium with reduced plasma protein concentration (15%) and an increased 8-mop concentration (23.4 micrograms/ml). illumination with 3 j/cm2 of uva in this system inactivated greater than 10(5) cfu/ml of 4 resistant gram-negative organisms (salmonella choleraesuis, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella pneumoniae) and 10(4.1) cfu/ml of the most resistant gram-negative organism (pseudomonas aeruginosa). this level of pcd treatment did not adversely affect in vitro platelet function. these results demonstrate that pcd using 8-mop (5 to 23.4 micrograms/ml) effectively inactivated high levels of pathogenic bacteria in pc with adequate preservation of in vitro platelet properties.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

AB  == the new oral cephalosporins cefpodoxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefetamet and ceftibuten demonstrate enhanced activity against enterobacteriaceae susceptible to the established compounds as well (e.g. cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefadroxil). in  addition, cefpodoxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefetamet and ceftibuten include in their spectrum species hitherto resistant to oral cephalosporins (proteus vulgaris, providencia spp., yersinia enterocolitica). besides, the majority of these compounds demonstrate relevant activity (mic50 equal to or below 2 mg/l) against enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia spp. and morganella morganii. ceftibuten is the most potent oral cephalosporin against most of the enterobacteriaceae. non-fermentative bacilli (acinetobacter spp., pseudomonas spp.) remain completely resistant to oral cephalosporins (except some acinetobacter species against cefdinir and pseudomonas cepacia against ceftibuten). antistaphylococcal activity for oral cephalosporins is highest for cefdinir followed by bay 3522, cefprozil, cefuroxime and cefpodoxime. loracarbef, cefaclor and cefadroxil are about equally active, while the other compounds are only weakly active (cefixime) or inactive (cefetamet, ceftibuten). enterococci are insensitive to new generation oral cephalosporins as they have been to established compounds. the most active oral cephalosporins against hemolytic streptococci are cefdinir and cefprozil. streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus  milleri and streptococcus mitior are most susceptible to cefpodoxime, cefdinir, cefuroxime and bay 3522. penicillin resistant pneumococci have to be regarded as  resistant to all oral cephalosporins. fastidious pathogens like haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis and neisseria gonorrhoeae are more susceptible to cefpodoxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefetamet and ceftibuten than to the other oral  cephalosporins. the activity of oral cephalosporins is only weak against listeria spp., helicobacter pylori and anaerobic pathogens (except bay 3522). bordetella pertussis remains resistant to all absorbable cephalosporins. progress in antibacterial activity of oral cephalosporins was mainly achieved by cefpodoxime, cefixime, cefdinir, cefetamet and ceftibuten against enterobacteriaceae and the fastidious pathogens and against staphylococci and the nonenterococcal streptococci by cefdinir, bay 3522, cefprozil and cefpodoxime.

TI  == in-vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ly163892.
AB  == ly163892 is a new orally absorbed carbacephem. it inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae at less than or equal to 1 mg/l, but was less active against group b streptococci and groups c, f, g and bovis streptococci with mics  of 1 to 2 mg/l for most but as high as 8 mg/l for some isolates. mic90 of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus was 8 mg/l, but greater than 128 mg/l for methicillin-resistant staphylococci. ly163892 had activity similar to cefaclor and cephalexin with mic90 values of 16 mg/l for escherichia coli, 8 mg/l for klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, but was more active against haemophilus influenzae, and branhamella catarrhalis. it had no activity against enterobacter, providencia, serratia, and pseudomonas and bacteroides spp. ly163892 was more rapidly lytic than cephalexin. it was hydrolyzed by a number of plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. for tem-1, the km = 354.7 microm, vmax = 2.5 micromoles/min/mg of protein, p99 km = 24.3 microm, vmax = 28.9 microm/min/micrograms of protein, staph. aureus pc km = 47.4 microm,  vmax = 2.7 micromoles/min/mg of protein. overall it had beta-lactamase stability  similar to cefaclor, less than cephalexin, and markedly less than cefuroxime.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin.
AB  == the in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. ninety percent of hemolytic streptococci groups a and b, and  streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. activity of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin; erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci were not inhibited. azithromycin was more active than erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae (mic90 1 microgram/ml) and neisseria gonorrhoeae. it inhibited campylobacter spp. and pasteurella multocida, and had an mic50 of 8 micrograms/ml for escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp. and yersinia enterocolitica compared to an erythromycin value of greater than 64 micrograms/ml.

TI  == inactivation of bacteria by purogene.
AB  == the bacteriocidal efficacy of purogene, a stabilized aqueous solution of chlorine dioxide (clo2) was examined using bacteria of concern to public health. the organisms tested were: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, yersinia enterocolitica, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes group a, salmonella typhimurium and bacillus subtilis. the test organisms responded differently to inactivation by purogene. at least a 4 log reduction in bacterial counts was noted when purogene was applied at a concentration of 0.75 mg/l. since purogene is a stabilized complex, it was necessary to provide a chemical environment suitable for the release of clo2 in this solution. this was done by varying the ph of purogene from 3.5 to 8.6 (ph of purogene is 8.6) while keeping the ph of the experimental medium constant (ph 7.0). the results showed that purogene was most efficacious at the lowest ph tested (ph 3.5). this indicates that as chlorine dioxide solutions were reduced to chlorite (which predominates at ph 8.6), their bacteriocidal efficacy was reduced, suggesting free chlorine dioxide  as the active disinfecting species.

TI  == tigemonam, an oral monobactam.
AB  == tigemonam is an orally administered monobactam. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml it inhibited the majority of strains of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter diversus, proteus spp., providencia spp., aeromonas hydrophila, salmonella spp., shigella spp., serratia marcescens,  and yersinia enterocolitica. at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml it inhibited haemophilus spp., neisseria spp., and branhamella catarrhalis. it did not inhibit pseudomonas spp. or acinetobacter spp. tigemonam was more active than cephalexin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and inhibited many members of the family enterobacteriaceae resistant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. some enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii strains resistant to aminothiazole iminomethoxy cephalosporins and aztreonam were resistant to tigemonam. the mic for 90% of hemolytic streptococci of groups a, b, and c and for streptococcus pneumoniae was 16 micrograms/ml, but the mic for 90% of enterococci, listeria spp., bacteroides spp., and viridans group streptococci was greater than 64 micrograms/ml. tigemonam was not hydrolyzed by the common plasmid beta-lactamases such as tem-1 and shv-1 or by the chromosomal beta-lactamases of  enterobacter, morganella, pseudomonas, and bacteroides spp. tigemonam inhibited beta-lactamases of e. cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa but did not induce beta-lactamases. the growth medium had a minimal effect on the in vitro activity  of tigemonam, and there was a close agreement between the mics and mbcs.

TI  == [course of the diffusion of cefotiam in infected ascitic fluid].
AB  == the cefotiam (cft) penetration in infected ascitic fluid was investigated in 12 cirrhotic patients. cft (1 g every 8 h) was given intravenously and measured by hplc in plasmatic and ascitic samples. the mean ascitic concentrations (+/- sem), 1 h, 3 h and 8 h after the first injection (j1) were 14.6 +/- 4.6, 11.8 +/- 3 and 8.4 +/- 2.9 micrograms/ml respectively. these values were 38, 62 and 88% of the corresponding mean plasmatic concentrations and higher than the mic's for the organisms most commonly involved. the mean plasmatic and ascitic concentrations,  a few days later (4.5 or 6 days) (jn) were not significantly different from the corresponding values at j1. a significant decrease of polymorphonuclear cell count was observed between j1 and jn. these results suggest that cft diffusion into ascitic fluid is independent of inflammation and cft is an adequate antibiotic in cirrhotic patients with infected ascitic fluid.

TI  == pediatric gastroenteritis in primary care and in hospitalized patients.
AB  == one-hundred and fifty-seven consecutive children below seven years of age (primary care n = 48, hospitalized patients n = 109) with acute gastroenteritis of assumed infectious origin were studied. rotavirus was demonstrated by electron microscopy of faeces in 44% of all patients. the occurrence of rotavirus among patients in primary care, 15%, was significantly lower than among hospitalized patients, 57% (p less than 0.01). adenovirus was isolated in six per cent and enterovirus in two per cent of the patients with no differences between the two groups. yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter jejuni were demonstrated in each three per cent. salmonella and shigella spp. or giardia lamblia were not found in any cases. thus the cause of gastroenteritis was established in 58% of the patients. this figure was lower among patients in primary care (27%) than among hospitalized patients (72%), a difference mainly due to the high occurrence of rotavirus in the latter group. clostridium difficile was recovered in 20 cases (12%), eight of which harboured one more enteropathogenic agent. cultures from the nose and throat revealed streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis or group a, c and g streptococci in 58% of the patients with no differences regarding the occurrence of rotavirus in faeces. neither clostridium difficile nor respiratory tract pathogens were found to play a role in causation of gastroenteritis in the children investigated.

TI  == lymphocyte proliferative responses to bacterial antigens in b27-associated arthropathies.
AB  == lymphocyte transformation tests to yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 and 0:6, klebsiella pneumoniae and streptococcus faecalis antigens have been carried out in ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis/reiter's disease and controls. ankylosing spondylitis cases gave significantly lower responses than reactive arthritis/reiter's to yersinia enterocolitica 0:6 (p = 0.003) and klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.008), and less than controls to s. faecalis (p = 0.008). it appears, therefore, that within the b27 arthritis population there is heterogeneity of cell-mediated response to certain enteric bacteria, with the hyporesponders manifesting ankylosing spondylitis and the hyper-responders reactive arthritis/reiter's disease.

TI  == comparative susceptibility of yersinia enterocolitica, eikenella corrodens, and penicillin-resistant and penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae to beta-lactam and alternative antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined for 14 strains of yersinia enterocolitica, 28 strains of eikenella corrodens, 10 strains of penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, and 10 strains of penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae. y. enterocolitica was found to be susceptible to the aminoglycosides tested and to chloramphenicol, moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime but resistant to ampicillin and variably susceptible to carbenicillin, cefoxitin, and cefazolin. on a weight basis, cefotaxime and moxalactam were the most active agents against e. corrodens. most strains of e. corrodens were resistant to the aminoglycosides tested: gentamicin, tobramycin, kanamycin, and amikacin. penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae was most susceptible  to cefotaxime and moxalactam. cefotaxime was consistently active against all tested strains of y. enterocolitica, e. corrodens, and penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, three unusual but clinically significant pathogens.
