TI  - Acute-phase responses in cattle infected with hydatid cysts and microbial agents.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hydatid cysts and microbial agents on the acute-phase response in cattle. Twenty-seven cattle with hydatid cysts and eight apparently healthy cattle comprised the study and control groups, respectively. Parasitological, microbiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the liver and lungs were undertaken, and 49 of these organs were infected with cysts. In 14 of 31 (45.1%) livers and 10 of 18 (55.5%) lungs microbial growth was observed. The most frequent species occurring in the liver were Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter spp., whereas in the lungs the most common species was Candida spp., followed by Streptococcus spp., Mannheimia haemolytica, Corynebacterium spp., Micrococcus spp. and S. aureus. The concentration of serum interleukin (IL-6) in infected cattle, 455.35 +/- 39.68 pg/ml, was significantly higher than that of 83.02 +/- 17.87 pg/ml in the control group (P0.05). The highest concentrations of IL-6 were detected in serum of the cattle where microbial growth had been detected, followed by cattle infected with bacteria + Trichostrongylus sp. (P< 0.001). Consequently, SAA showed an important increase in the group infected with hydatid cysts, whereas haptoglobin level decreased. It was noticed that IL-6, like SAA, had a significant role in hydatid cyst infection. Therefore IL-6 and SAA appear to be major markers in the detection of infection of cattle with hydatid cysts.
TI  - Chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) grown in R. Macedonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (EOB) or leaves (EOL) of Juniperus excelsa Bieb. (Cupressaceae) growing wild in R. Macedonia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. Essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (GC/FID/MS) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: EOB yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for EOL. Two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in EOB and 33.83% in EOL), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in EOB and 28.52-29.49% in EOL), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene and alpha-thujene. The most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of EOB was Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 31 mul/ml). EOL have showed high activity towards: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Haemophilus influenzae (MIC = 125 mul/ml). The pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Corynebacterium spp. and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC >50%). The sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemopilus influenzae, Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (MIC >50%). No activity was observed toward Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: The analysis of EOB and EOL revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the Macedonian Juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.
TI  - Susceptibility to Campylobacter infection is associated with the species composition of the human fecal microbiota.
AB  - The gut microbiota is essential for human health, but very little is known about  how the composition of this ecosystem can influence and respond to bacterial infections. Here we address this by prospectively studying the gut microbiota composition before, during, and after natural Campylobacter infection in exposed poultry abattoir workers. The gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16S amplicon sequencing of fecal samples from poultry abattoir workers during the peak season of Campylobacter infection in Sweden. The gut microbiota compositions were compared between individuals who became culture positive for Campylobacter and those who remained negative. Individuals who became Campylobacter positive had a significantly higher abundance of Bacteroides (P = 0.007) and Escherichia (P = 0.002) species than those who remained culture negative. Furthermore, this group had a significantly higher abundance of Phascolarctobacterium (P = 0.017) and Streptococcus (P = 0.034) sequences than the Campylobacter-negative group, which had an overrepresentation of Clostridiales (P = 0.017), unclassified Lachnospiraceae (P = 0.008), and Anaerovorax (P = 0.015) sequences. Intraindividual comparisons of the fecal microbiota compositions yielded small differences over time in Campylobacter-negative participants, but significant long-term changes were found in the Campylobacter-positive group (P < 0.005). The results suggest that the abundance of specific genera in the microbiota reduces resistance to Campylobacter colonization in humans and that Campylobacter infection can have long-term effects on the composition of the human fecal microbiota. IMPORTANCE: Studies using mouse models have made important contributions to our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in resistance to bacterial enteropathogen colonization. The relative abundances of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides species have been pointed out as important determinants of susceptibility to Gram-negative pathogens in general and Campylobacter infection in particular. In this study, we assessed the role of the human gut microbiota in resistance to Campylobacter colonization by studying abattoir workers that are heavily exposed to these bacteria. Individuals with a certain composition of the gut microbiota became culture positive for Campylobacter. As their microbiotas were characterized by high abundances of Bacteroides spp. and E. coli, well in line with the findings with mouse models, these bacterial species likely play an important role in colonization resistance also in humans.
TI  - Impact of antibiotic use in the swine industry.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with pigs not only affects pig production but also has an impact on human health through the transfer of resistant organisms and associated genes via the food chain. This can compromise treatment of human infections. In the past most attention was paid to glycopeptide and streptogramin resistance in enterococci, fluoroquinolone resistance in campylobacter and multi-drug resistance in Escherichia coli and salmonella. While these are still important the focus has shifted to ESBL producing organisms selected by the use of ceftiofur and cefquinome in pigs. In addition Livestock-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) suddenly emerged in 2007. We also need to consider multi-resistant strains of Streptococcus suis. Environmental contamination arising from piggery wastewater and spreading of manure slurry on pastures is also a growing problem.
TI  - [New insight into bacterial zoonotic pathogens posing health hazards to humans].
AB  - This article presents the problem of evolutionary changes of zoonotic pathogens responsible for human diseases. Everyone is exposed to the risk of zoonotic infection, particularly employees having direct contact with animals, i.e. veterinarians, breeders, butchers and workers of animal products' processing industry. The article focuses on pathogens monitored by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), which has been collecting statistical data on zoonoses from all European Union countries for 19 years and publishing collected data in annual epidemiological reports. Currently, the most important 11 pathogens responsible for causing human zoonotic diseases are being monitored, of which seven are bacteria: Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium bovis, Brucella spp., Coxiella burnetti and Verotoxin-producing E. coli (VTEC)/Shiga-like toxin producing E. coli (STEC). As particularly important are considered foodborne pathogens. The article also includes new emerging zoonotic bacteria, which are not currently monitored by ECDC but might pose a serious epidemiological problem in a foreseeable future: Streptococcus iniae, S. suis, S. dysgalactiae and staphylococci: Staphylococcus intermedius, S. pseudintermedius. Those species have just crossed the animal-human interspecies barrier. The exact mechanism of this phenomenon remains unknown, it is connected, however, with genetic variability, capability to survive in changing environment. These abilities derive from DNA rearrangement and horizontal gene transfer between bacterial cells. Substantial increase in the number of scientific publications on this subject, observed over the last few years, illustrates the importance of the problem.
TI  - Preliminary molecular analysis of bacterial composition in periapical lesions with primary endodontic infections of deciduous teeth.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial composition of periapical lesions in deciduous teeth has not been well documented. This study was designed to explore the bacterial compositions, especially the dominant bacteria in periapical lesions using 16S rRNA sequencing. METHODS: Tissue samples were collected from 11 periapical lesions in deciduous teeth with primary endodontic infections. DNA was extracted from each sample and analyzed using 16S rRNA cloning and sequencing for the identification of bacteria. RESULTS: All DNA samples were positive for 16S rRNA gene PCR. One hundred and fifty-one phylotypes from 810 clones were identified to eight phyla, and each sample contained an average of 25.9 phylotypes. In addition, 59 phylotypes were detected in more than two samples, and Fusobacterium (F.) nucleatum (8/11), Dialister (D.) invisus (8/11), Campylobacter (C.) gracilis (7/11), Escherichia (E.) coli DH1 (6/11), Aggregatibacter (A.) segnis (6/11), and Streptococcus (S.) mitis (6/11) were the most prevalent species. Furthermore, 45 as-yet-uncultivated phylotypes were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic periapical lesions in deciduous teeth contained polymicrobial infections. F. nucleatum, D. invisus, C. gracilis, E. coli DH1, A. segnis, and S. mitis were the most prevalent species detected by 16S rRNA sequencing.
TI  - The complex microbiota of raw milk.
AB  - Here, we review what is known about the microorganisms present in raw milk, including milk from cows, sheep, goats and humans. Milk, due to its high nutritional content, can support a rich microbiota. These microorganisms enter milk from a variety of sources and, once in milk, can play a number of roles, such as facilitating dairy fermentations (e.g. Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Propionibacterium and fungal populations), causing spoilage (e.g. Pseudomonas, Clostridium, Bacillus and other spore-forming or thermoduric microorganisms), promoting health (e.g. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or causing disease (e.g. Listeria, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter and mycotoxin-producing fungi). There is also concern that the presence of antibiotic residues in milk leads to the development of resistance, particularly among pathogenic bacteria. Here, we comprehensively review these topics, while comparing the approaches, both culture-dependent and culture-independent, which can be taken to investigate the microbial composition of milk.
TI  - [Role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  - According to the data of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC),  at least 6 virus species (HPV, EBV, HHV-8/KSHV, HTLV-1, HBV, HCV), 4 helminthes species (Schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, Opisthorchis viverrini, Clonorchis sinensis) and I bacterium species (Helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. The analysis of the data available shows that Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), John Cunningham polyomavirus (JCV), monkey virus 40 (SV40), cytomegalovirus (CMV), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (XMRV), Helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, Campylobacter jejuni, Fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Prevotella spp., Streptococcus bovis and anginosus, Treponema denticola, Salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Propionibacterium acnes, Tropheryma whippelii, Schistosoma mansoni, Opistorchis felineus, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia solium, Candida spp., Paracoccidioides brasiliensis, Histoplasma capsulatum and Trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. Apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.
TI  - Rapid detection and respirometric profiling of aerobic bacteria on panels of selective media.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate high-throughput optical oxygen microrespirometry for selective  detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using GreenLight probe, standard 384-well plates and time-resolved fluorescence reader, a representative panel of 16 partially selective media and 9 aerobic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pyogenes, Salmonella typhimurium and Listeria innocua) were analysed. For each medium, bacterial strain and dilution, growth profiles were recorded, from which calibrations, doubling/generation times and growth patterns in different media were determined. Analytical performance, selectivity and general usability of the method were assessed, and mixed bacterial cultures were analysed. CONCLUSION: The microrespirometry platform facilitates simple, real-time detection and predictive identification of aerobic bacteria by looking at the patterns of their growth and respiration in several media and determining their growth and doubling times. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The new screening method can be used for routine microbiological analysis and testing of aerobic bacterial cultures as well as complex food, environmental and clinical samples.
TI  - Applications of PCR (real-time and MassTag) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in diagnosis of respiratory infections and diarrheal illness among deployed U.S. military personnel during exercise Balikatan 2009, Philippines.
AB  - Laboratory-based surveillance for diarrheal and respiratory illness was conducted at the 2009 Republic of the Philippines-United States Balikatan exercise to determine the presence of specific pathogens endemic in the locations where the military exercises were conducted. Ten stool and 6 respiratory specimens were obtained from individuals meeting case definitions for diarrhea or respiratory illness. Stool specimens were frozen in dry ice and remotely tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Rotavirus, Astrovirus, Adenovirus, Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia, and Cryptosporidium and polymerase chain reaction for enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, Vibrio, Salmonella, and Norovirus. Eight (4 for Campylobacter jejuni, 2 for Campylobacter coli, 1 for Norovirus genogroup II, and 1 for both Campylobacter coli and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli) of 10 samples were positive for at least 1 enteric pathogen. MassTag polymerase chain reaction for influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus groups A and B, human coronavirus-229E and human coronavirus-OC43, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 2,3, and 4a, human adenovirus, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumonia, and Mycoplasma pneumonia was done on respiratory specimens. Out of 6 samples, 3 tested positive for H. influenzae; 1 tested positive for both H. influenzae and human parainfluenza virus 3; and 2 tested negative. Laboratory-based surveillance can be useful in determining etiologies of diarrheal and respiratory illness of deployed military personnel.
TI  - Aerobic oral and rectal bacteria of free-ranging Steller sea lion pups and juveniles (Eumetopias jubatus) in Alaska.
AB  - Bacteriologic cultures from oral, rectal, and lesion samples from free-ranging Steller sea lion (SSL, Eumetopias jubatus) pups and juveniles in Alaska (2001-2005) were examined to determine frequency of infection by a specific subset of common and pathogenic aerobic bacteria. Associations between isolated bacteria and age, sex, body condition, location, and sampling season were investigated. Salmonella spp. isolates were further evaluated to determine spatial clustering (n=48) and to identify serovars (n=13) and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (n=11). We sampled 356 SSL pups (n=272) and juveniles (n=84), and identified 988 isolates of 13 bacterial genera of specific interest. Pasteurella spp. (43.8%), beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (30.6%), and Mannheimia spp. (18.2%) were the most commonly isolated oral bacteria (n=499 isolates), whereas Escherichia coli (47.6%), beta-hemolytic E. coli (32.4%), Salmonella spp. (10.4%), and Campylobacter spp. (7.8%) were the most frequently isolated rectal bacteria (n=460 isolates). Salmonella was most commonly found in pups from western stocks and in samples collected during fall/winter seasons. A significant Salmonella cluster was detected at the Perry Island haulout. Five serovars were isolated: Enteritidis, Infantis, Newport, Reading, and Stanley. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis provided evidence that Salmonella isolates were most likely being maintained within the SSL population in Alaska.
TI  - Identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against Campylobacter.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by Lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control Campylobacter and Salmonella in live poultry. This finding is of relevance since Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. In the present work, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the cecum of twenty Tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against Campylobacter were further characterized. Following their preliminary confirmation as LAB, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16S- 23S PCR, specific lactobacilli PCR, and a biphasic approach. Most of the LAB isolated belonged to the genus Lactobacillus, among them Lb. sakei (33.3%), Lb. salivarius (19.4%), Lb. reuteri (8.6%), and Lb. curvatus (8.6%). The other LAB strains included those of the genus Weissella (16.7%), Enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), Lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and Streptococcus sp. (2.7%). The Lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against C. jejuni and C. coli. The activity of three of them, Lb. salivarius SMXD51, Lb. salivarius MMS122, and Lb. salivarius MMS151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Analysis of Nsukka metropolitan abattoir solid waste and its bacterial contents in south eastern Nigeria: public health implication.
AB  - This study was conducted to determine the quantum of waste generation and management and presence of major bacteria genera of public health importance in Nsukka municipal abattoir/slaughter house. The environment and public health implications of unhygienic sanitary condition at the abattoir and environs as a consequence of poor waste disposal and management were studied. A total of 194 kg of solid (rumen/stomach) wastes was generated daily without any clearly defined system of disposal and management. Forty-five rumen/stomach waste samples were examined for bacterial isolates using standard procedures. The isolation frequency showed that E. coli, Bacillus sp., and Staphylococcus sp. were more frequently isolated, followed by Streptococcus sp., Salmonella sp., and Campylobacter sp. Appropriate strategies for efficient solid waste disposal and management in our abattoirs were recommended.
TI  - Osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and DNA-DNA hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (ORN). The purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible after radiation therapy. DESIGN: Bacterial DNA was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16S rRNA genes were PCR amplified, cloned, transformed into Escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. RESULTS: From the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. The predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were Campylobacter gracilis, Streptococcus intermedius, Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone FG014, uncultured bacterium clone RL178, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Prevotella spp. The study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in ORN. In contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. CONCLUSIONS: Diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of ORN in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. To better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with ORN is necessary.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between April 2007 and March 2008].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2007 to March 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, Anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both Bacteroides fragilis and Bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, B. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by B. fragilis, Bacteroides caccae and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. There were nine strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococci which show higher MIC against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/mL, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-MRSA antibiotics. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. METHODS: An evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. Scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). The scoring procedure was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. Independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. The zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. RESULTS: The following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic Escherichia coli. A second group of "significant importance" included Toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Clostridium botulinum, Staphylococcus aureus, Cryptosporidium parvum, Mycobacterium bovis, Echinococcus granulosus, Streptococcus spp., Echinococcus multilocularis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Mycobacterium avium, Fasciola hepatica, Giardia intestinalis, and Rotavirus. CONCLUSIONS: This methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. APPLICATIONS: These results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. They also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. Principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.
TI  - Pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  - This paper describes a new DNA chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. Probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus equi, Streptococcus canis, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus parauberis, Streptococcus uberis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma spp., Salmonella spp., Bacillus spp., Campylobacter spp., and Escherichia coli and related species. These groups were identified based on the 16S rRNA gene. For microarray validation, 22 strains from the American Type Culture Collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested. The results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. Moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of Mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. The universal array described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.
TI  - A DNA array based assay for the characterization of microbial community in raw milk.
AB  - An oligonucleotide array based on PCR method containing a combination of probes for taxonomic markers and species-specific virulence genes was developed for the simultaneous identification of 14 Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and food-borne pathogenic bacteria in raw milk. The hypervariable regions V3 and V6 of 16S, together with a variable region of 23S rRNA genes and several genes specific for virulence factors were selected. Universal primers and multiplex PCR were used for the rapid differentiation of bacterial species and low concentration of specific pathogenic and spoilage bacteria were detected in milk. The dominant species such as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, andLeuconostoc lactis were identified by indirect-labelling reactions based upon incorporation of amino-allyl dUTPs. The results regarding food-borne pathogens detection showed highly specific hybridisation patterns with the genomic DNA from Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Salmonella thyphimurium, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia enterocolitica. A clear differentiation of dominant species present in a complex microbial community such as raw milk was achieved by the application of short oligonucleotide probes which discriminate sequences differing by few nucleotides.
TI  - Towards on-site pathogen detection using antibody-based sensors.
AB  - In this paper, the recent progress within biosensors for plant pathogen detection will be reviewed. Bio-recognition layers on sensors can be designed in various ways, however the most popular approach is to immobilise antibodies for specific capture of analytes. Focus will be put on antibody surface-immobilisation strategies as well as the use of antibodies in the widely used sensors, quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance and cantilevers. We will describe the available data on antibody-based plant pathogen detection and furthermore use examples from detection of the pathogens Salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus anthracis, Campylobacter and Escherichia coli. We will touch upon optimal assay design and further discuss the strengths and limitations of current sensor technologies for detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi.
TI  - Skim milk enhances the preservation of thawed -80 degrees C bacterial stocks.
AB  - The results from bacterial strain recovery efforts following hurricanes Katrina and Rita are reported. Over 90% of strains frozen in 10% skim milk were recovered whereas various recovery rates were observed for glycerol-stored stocks (56% and 94% of Escherichia coli, depending upon the laboratory). These observations led to a viability comparison of Streptococcus pyogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Salmonella enterica subsp. Typhimurium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. coli strains stored in glycerol or skim milk. In all bacteria examined, 10% skim milk resulted in significantly longer viability after thawing than 15% glycerol solutions currently used in most laboratories.
TI  - Chemoenzymatic synthesis of polyprenyl phosphates.
AB  - Polyprenyl phosphates, including undecaprenyl phosphate and dolichyl phosphate, are essential intermediates in several important biochemical pathways including N-linked protein glycosylation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and prokaryotic cell wall biosynthesis. Herein, we describe the evaluation of three potential undecaprenol kinases as agents for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of polyprenyl phosphates. Target enzymes were expressed in crude cell envelope fractions and quantified via the use of luminescent lanthanide-binding tags (LBTs). The Streptococcus mutans diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) was shown to be a very useful agent for polyprenol phosphorylation using ATP as the phosphoryl transfer agent. In addition, the S. mutans DGK can be coupled with two Campylobacter jejuni glycosyltransferases involved in N-linked glycosylation to efficiently biosynthesize the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-linked disaccharide needed for studies of PglB, the C. jejuni oligosaccharyl transferase.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of the conserved hypothetical protein HP0892 of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0892 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25552) is a 90-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695, with a calculated pI of 9.38 and a molecular mass of 10.41 kDa. It belongs to the Plasmid stabilization system protein family (PF05016) in the Pfam database. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0892 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0892 using multidimentional heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. About 97.0% (422/ 435) of the HN, N, CO, C Alpha , C Beta resonances of 90 residues of HP0892 were assigned. On the basis of the resonance assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0892, and will be useful for studying its interaction with other molecules.
TI  - Use of genomic DNA control features and predicted operon structure in microarray  data analysis: ArrayLeaRNA - a Bayesian approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microarrays are widely used for the study of gene expression; however deciding on whether observed differences in expression are significant remains a challenge. RESULTS: A computing tool (ArrayLeaRNA) has been developed for gene expression analysis. It implements a Bayesian approach which is based on the Gumbel distribution and uses printed genomic DNA control features for normalization and for estimation of the parameters of the Bayesian model and prior knowledge from predicted operon structure. The method is compared with two other approaches: the classical LOWESS normalization followed by a two fold cut-off criterion and the OpWise method (Price, et al. 2006. BMC Bioinformatics. 7, 19), a published Bayesian approach also using predicted operon structure. The three methods were compared on experimental datasets with prior knowledge of gene expression. With ArrayLeaRNA, data normalization is carried out according to the genomic features which reflect the results of equally transcribed genes; also the statistical significance of the difference in expression is based on the variability of the equally transcribed genes. The operon information helps the classification of genes with low confidence measurements. ArrayLeaRNA is implemented in Visual Basic and freely available as an Excel add-in at http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/ArrayLeaRNA/ CONCLUSION: We have introduced a novel Bayesian model and demonstrated that it is a robust method for analysing microarray expression profiles. ArrayLeaRNA showed a considerable improvement in data normalization, in the estimation of the experimental variability intrinsic to each hybridization and in the establishment of a clear boundary between non-changing and differentially expressed genes. The method is applicable to data derived from hybridizations of labelled cDNA samples as well as from hybridizations of labelled cDNA with genomic DNA and can be used for the analysis of datasets where differentially regulated genes predominate.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of the immersion chilling procedure during poultry processing.
AB  - The development of treatments to reduce bacterial numbers on poultry carcasses is important for the overall hygienic quality of birds. The important washing effect of the immersion chilling procedure is discussed. Systematic monitoring of fecal bacterial indicators as well as some classic pathogens was performed at selected critical points in a water chiller ecosystem. Clostridium perfringens, fecal coliforms, Enterococcus sp., and Streptococcus sp. were found in all water chiller samples. The temperature of the chiller ecosystem varied according to location: Escherichia coli and Salmonella sp. were found at 16 degrees C, compared with the 4 degrees C location, where these species were found in lower numbers. Moreover, the psychrotrophic bacterium Pseudomonas was found only at this last location. The temperature of the water during the immersion chilling procedure was unfavorable for the growth of Campylobacter sp., whose presence was always strictly associated with a pH close to 6. Spore forms of C. perfringens were persistent in all locations and seemed to be a reliable indicator of contamination of the water chiller ecosystem.
TI  - Evaluation of the enteric microflora of captive whooping cranes (Grus americana)  and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis).
AB  - The enteric flora of captive whooping cranes (Grus americana) and sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) has not been well described, despite its potential importance in the understanding of both the normal condition of the intestinal physiology of these animals and the altered colonization within disease states in these birds. Nineteen whooping cranes and 23 sandhill cranes housed currently at the Calgary Zoo or its affiliated Devonian Wildlife Conservation Centre (DWCC) in Calgary, Alberta were sampled from October 2004-February 2005 by collecting aerobic and anaerobic cloacal swabs from each bird. There were seven major groupings of bacteria isolated from both species of crane. Gram-positive cocci, coliforms, and gram-negative bacilli were the most prevalent types of bacteria isolated for both crane species, with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus Group D, not Enterococcus the bacterial species isolated most commonly. There was a significant difference in the average number of isolates per individual between the two crane species but no differences between age or gender categories within crane species. Campylobacter sp. were isolated from five whooping cranes. The potential zoonotic pathogen Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from one whooping crane and C. upsaliensis was isolated from a second. Three other isolates were unspeciated members of the Campylobacter genus and likely belong to a species undescribed previously. The evaluation of the enteric cloacal flora of whooping cranes and sandhill cranes illustrates that differences exist between these two closely related crane species, and highlights the potential implications these differences may have for current practices involving captive wildlife.

TI  - [Aetiology and antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent outpatient infections].
AB  - The diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. During the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the Pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. Of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. One point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of Escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of Klebsiella pneumoniae were producers of this type of b-lactamases. Ninety-six point five percent of the 797 isolations of Salmonella serotipo Enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of Campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. Of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive to amoxyline. The Gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin B. Twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of Streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. Fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. Knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Effects of lactoferrin supplementation on ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility, gastrointestinal microbial populations, and immune characteristics of ileal cannulated, healthy, adult dogs.
AB  - Orally supplemented lactoferrin derived from bovine milk is purported to have beneficial effects on gut health of animals. Bovine lactoferrin (0, 60, or 120 mg/d) was fed to ileal cannulated, adult dogs in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design with 14 d periods. Control dogs tended (p = 0.06) to have higher fecal DM concentrations compared with dogs supplemented with 120 mg/d lactoferrin (34.5 vs. 32.9%). Fecal scores ranged from 3.0 - 3.3, suggesting that feces of all dogs was near the desired consistency, with dogs supplemented with 120 mg/d lactoferrin tending (p = 0.08) to have higher fecal scores. Ileal azoreductase activity tended (p < 0.10) to be higher in dogs supplemented with 60 or 120 mg/d lactoferrin (609 vs. 592 nmol/h per g ileal DM, respectively) as compared with unsupplemented dogs (272 nmol/h per g ileal DM). The following bacterial groups were measured: bifidobacteria, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium spp., eubacteria, Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. Fecal streptococci concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) for dogs receiving 60 mg/d lactoferrin (8.60 log10 cfu/g fecal DM) as compared with unsupplemented dogs (9.19 log10 cfu/g fecal DM) or dogs receiving 120mg lactoferrin/d (9.43 log10 cfu/g fecal DM). Dogs supplemented with 120mg/d lactoferrin tended (p = 0.08) to have higher fecal indole concentrations as compared to unsupplemented dogs (1.80 vs. 1.46 micromol/g fecal DM). Because most bacterial groups measured were unaffected, it appears that lactoferrin did not exhibit prebiotic activity, and based on the data collected, lactoferrin also did not appear to have major effects on indices of health in the dog.
TI  - The group B streptococcal sialic acid O-acetyltransferase is encoded by neuD, a conserved component of bacterial sialic acid biosynthetic gene clusters.
AB  - Nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (Sia), and several Sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. Some pathogens are also known to O-acetylate their Sias, although the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. We report that neuD, a gene located within the Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a Sia O-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (CPS) sialylation. Homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified Lys-123 as a critical residue for Sia O-acetyltransferase activity. Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neuD can determine whether GBS displays a "high" or "low" Sia O-acetylation phenotype. Complementation analysis revealed that Escherichia coli K1 NeuD also functions as a Sia O-acetyltransferase in GBS. In fact, NeuD homologs are commonly found within Sia biosynthetic gene clusters. A bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a Sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neuD. Included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens Legionella pneumophila, Vibrio parahemeolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for Sia expression. Phylogenetic analysis shows that NeuD homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-Sia O-acetyltransferase of E. coli K1. These studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of GBS Sia O-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.
TI  - Backbone 1H, 15N, and 13C resonance assignments and secondary-structure of conserved hypothetical protein HP0894 from Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - HP0894 (SwissProt/TrEMBL ID O25554) is an 88-residue conserved hypothetical protein from Helicobacter pylori strain 26695 with a calculated pI of 8.5 and a molecular weight of 10.38 kDa. Proteins with sequence similarity to HP0894 exist in Vibrio choierae, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli O157, etc. Here we report the sequence-specific backbone resonance assignments of HP0894. About 97.5% (418/429) of the HN, N, CO, Ca, Cbeta resonances of the 88 residues of HP0894 were assigned. On the basis of these assignments, three helical regions and four strand regions were identified using the CSI program. This study is a prerequisite for calculating the solution structure of HP0894, and studying its interaction with its substrates, if any, and/or with other proteins.
TI  - A survey of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary referral hospital in the United Arab Emirates.
AB  - Published data on antimicrobial resistance are lacking for the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Knowledge of local patterns of resistance is essential to optimize guidelines for empirical antimicrobial treatment. Awareness of susceptibility patterns in other parts of the world may be important for determining empirical antimicrobial therapy for travelers or patients transferred from abroad. Antibiograms from unique isolates of common hospital and community bacteria are described in a tertiary referral hospital in the UAE, which had no antimicrobial restrictions and limited resources. Antimicrobial resistance rates were unpredictable and were high for Gram-negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli, Shigella sonnei, Campylobacter spp, and also Streptococcus pneumoniae. In contrast, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) comprised less than 5% of S. aureus isolates and glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (GRE) were not detected during the surveillance period. Our results provide data on antimicrobial resistance for the UAE and highlight the need for resources for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Inhibition of Clostridium perfringens by a novel strain of Bacillus subtilis isolated from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens.
AB  - The objectives of this study were to isolate beneficial strains of microorganisms from the gastrointestinal tracts of healthy chickens and to screen them against Clostridium perfringens, a causative agent of necrotic enteritis in poultry. One of the bacteria isolated, a strain of Bacillus subtilis, was found to possess an anticlostridial factor that could inhibit the C. perfringens ATCC 13124 used in this study. The anticlostridial factor produced by B. subtilis PB6 was found to be fully or partially inactivated in the presence of pronase, trypsin, and pepsin. In contrast, the antimicrobial activity of the anticlostridial factor was not affected by treatment at 100 or 121 degrees C or by treatment with any of the organic solvents used in the study. The optimum growth temperature and optimum pH for production of the anticlostridial factor were 37 degrees C and 6.20, respectively. Using the mass spectroscopy-mass spectroscopy technique, the apparent molecular mass of the anticlostridial factor was estimated to be in the range from 960 to 983 Da. In terms of the antimicrobial spectrum, the anticlostridial factor was inhibitory toward various strains of C. perfringens implicated in necrotic enteritis in poultry, Clostridium difficile, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli.
TI  - Analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in a Japanese hospital.
AB  - Prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (TC(R)) genes--tet(L), tet(M), tet(K), tet(O), tet(S), tet(T), and tet(U)--which are known to be distributed to gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 Enterococcus faecalis and 46 Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a Japanese hospital. Any of the TC(R) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. The tet(M) was detected at highest rates in both E. faecalis (75.0%) and E. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(L), which was harbored in 6.7% of E. faecalis isolates and 30.4% of E. faecium isolates. The tet(O), tet(S), and tet(T) were detected in E. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(M), while tet(K) and tet(U) were not detected. Nucleotide sequences of tet(S) from E. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in Listeria monocytogenes. Sequences of tet(O) from two E. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. The tet(T), which had been reported only in Streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five E. faecalis strains. Sequence of the enterococcal tet(T) differed from that of S. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). Enterococcal strains with any one TC(R) gene or those with two TC(R) genes showed generally similar MICs of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance level was observed.
TI  - Extracellular secretion of polypeptides using a modified Escherichia coli flagellar secretion apparatus.
AB  - We developed a modified flagellar type III secretion apparatus to secrete heterologous polypeptides into the growth medium of Escherichia coli. The secretion was facilitated by fusing the 173-bp untranslated DNA fragment upstream of the gene fliC (encoding flagellin) as well as a transcriptional terminator from fliC, into the gene encoding the polypeptide of interest. The polypeptides secreted into the growth medium at concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 mg/l were from Campylobacter jejuni (262 residues in length), Streptococcus pneumoniae (434 residues), Staphylococcus aureus (115 residues), and N-terminal FliC hybrid proteins, for example, the eukaryotic green fluorescent protein (238 residues). The expressed proteins represented >50% of total secreted protein. Previously reported protein yields from extracellular secretion of foreign proteins in E. coli have been low, approximately 100 microg/l. The strengths of our method are the concentration and purity of the secreted proteins and its versatility with regard to the proteins' length and origin.
TI  - Detection and quantification of macrolide resistance mutations at positions 2058  and 2059 of the 23S rRNA gene by pyrosequencing.
AB  - A pyrosequencing method for detection and quantification of macrolide resistance  mutations at positions 2058 and 2059 (Escherichia coli numbering) of the 23S rRNA gene is described. The method was developed and tested for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycobacterium avium, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  - A rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. Nylon membrane was used as the array support. A mutation region of the 23S rRNA gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. A pair of universal primers was designed for PCR amplification of the 23S rRNA gene. Twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. The 23S rRNA gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. Hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. Results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella dysenteriae, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. Two other species (Salmonella enterica and Yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with E. coli, but the reaction did not affect their detection. After redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with Staphylococcus aureus, but not with Clostridium perfringens and Streptococcus pyogenes. The oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne infections. The superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - Small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  - Taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. Importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. Here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of Gram-positive and Gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. Large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two S. aureus libraries, highly representative. Consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. The use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - Prevalence and diversity of Arcobacter spp. isolated from the internal organs of  spontaneous porcine abortions in Denmark.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine the prevalence and possible significance of campylobacteria in pig abortions in Denmark. Surface-cauterised liver and kidney samples from 55 aborted pig fetuses submitted to the Danish Veterinary Laboratory were taken and a sensitive isolation procedure used to examine pooled tissue samples for Campylobacter, Arcobacter and Helicobacter spp. Routine microbiological, immunological, and histopathological examinations were also performed to identify concurrent infections or histopathological changes. The abortions tested negative for established abortifacient pathogens (Brucella, Leptospira, PPV, PRRSV), but Arcobacter spp. were recovered from 23/55 abortions. Co-infections with Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli, and haemolytic streptococci were observed in 7/23 Arcobacter-positive fetuses, and in 4/32 Arcobacter-negative fetuses. Histopathological analyses identified placentitis, pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis among the study group. However, no obvious pathologic features were solely associated with Arcobacter-positive cases, nor were Arcobacter-like bacteria observed in tissue samples. Protein profile analyses of the 27 Arcobacter isolates identified 11 as A. cryaerophilus and 10 as A. skirrowii. Six strains could not be classified into any existing species and were phenotypically distinct, thus, potentially representing at least one new species. The identification results showed that multiple taxa could be found in a single fetus, and in distinct aborted fetuses from a single sow. The high prevalence of arcobacters in Danish pig abortions may account for at least some of the >90% of cases in which no established abortifacient agent is detected, but further studies are needed to define the role of each species, especially where co-infections with other bacteria are present.
TI  - Cloning of the O-acetylserine lyase gene from the ruminal bacterium Selenomonas ruminantium HD4.
AB  - The gene coding for O-acetylserine lyase (OASL) was cloned from a Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 Lambda ZAP II genomic library by degenerative probe hybridization and complementation. Sequence analysis revealed a 933 bp ORF with a G + C content of 53%. The ORF had significant homology with enzymes involved in cysteine biosynthesis. A CuraBLASTN homology search showed that the ORF shared 59% nucleotide identity with the cysK of Bacillus subtilis. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high (>70%) similarity with the CysK of B. subtilis and other cysteine synthesis proteins from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae, and Spinacia oleracea. Further analysis predicted that the gene product was a member of the pyridoxal phosphate enzyme family and of cytoplasmic origin. Phylogenetic analysis clustered the S. ruminantium gene product with the OASLa isoform of B. subtilis and the OASLb isoforms of Streptococcus suis, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni. The OASL of S. ruminantium HD4 was also able to complement the cysM cysK double mutations in Escherichia coli NK3 and allow for growth on minimal media that contained either sulfate or thiosulfate as the sole source of sulfur. These results suggest that the gene functions as a cysM in S. ruminantium HD4. In conclusion, this research describes the cloning and expression of an O-acetylserine lyase gene from the predominant ruminal anaerobe S. ruminantium HD4. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing genes involved in sulfur metabolism from the genus Selenomonas.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Emerging mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  - Broad use of fluoroquinolones has been followed by emergence of resistance, which has been due mainly to chromosomal mutations in genes encoding the subunits of the drugs' target enzymes, DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV, and in genes that affect the expression of diffusion channels in the outer membrane and multidrug-resistance efflux systems. Resistance emerged first in species in which single mutations were sufficient to cause clinically important levels of resistance (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Subsequently, however, resistance has emerged in bacteria such as Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, in which multiple mutations are required to generate clinically important resistance. In these circumstances, the additional epidemiologic factors of drug use in animals and human-to-human spread appear to have contributed. Resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is currently low, will require close monitoring as fluoroquinolones are used more extensively for treating respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance and policy in Belgium.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is increasing worldwide, also in Belgium. A few examples to illustrate this problem: S. pneumoniae are becoming increasingly resistant to penicillin and erythromycin; resistance of S. pyogenes to erythromycin is increasing year-by-year; Salmonella and Campylobacter are becoming more and more resistant to the fluoroquinolones. In hospitals, the problem of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus appears to be decreasing, but two clones of ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter aerogenes are spreading throughout the Belgian hospitals. Antibiotic resistance has become a serious health care issue both in hospitals and in the community. The popular press has termed some of the multiresistant organisms "killer bugs" or "superbugs". Infection with such organisms has been associated with treatment failures, higher morbidity and mortality and increased costs. In this paper, we will review the problems of antibiotic resistance in the community setting. We will briefly discuss those pathogens with important consequences of morbidity and mortality in the community, such as: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Neisseria meningitidis, the enteric pathogens Salmonella and Campylobacter, and the urinary tract pathogen E. coli. This resistance has in response to various conditions and opportunities, such as: clustering and overcrowding, increased number of immunodeficient patients, increased elderly population, population mobility, increased use of (broad-spectrum) antibiotics, over-the-counter sale and self-dosing with antibiotics, inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions and lack of compliance, fewer resources for education and infection control, decreased funding for public health surveillance. In Belgium, we should be able to develop, implement and evaluate a good antibiotic policy. Our country has a wealth of information on antibiotic consumption in hospitals and the community. This information has been used for benchmarking of antibiotic consumption in hospitals. A unique system for reimbursement of prophylactic use of antibiotics in surgery was developed which resulted in a more adequate use of antibiotics. However, a policy should not be limited to the human ecosystem. Therefore, a Coordination Commission for Antibiotic Policy was installed recently by the Ministers of Social Affairs, Public Health and Agriculture.
TI  - Distribution and seasonality of microbial indicators and thermophilic campylobacters in two freshwater bathing sites on the River Lune in northwest England.
AB  - Two freshwater bathing sites, the Crook O'Lune and the University Boathouse, on the River Lune in the north-west of England, were monitored over a 2 year period for the faecal indicators, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci, the pathogens, Salmonella and Campylobacter, and compliance with the EU Directive on Bathing Water Quality. Faecal indicator numbers showed no seasonal variation, with numbers in the bathing season similar to those in the non-bathing season. They were consistently above the EU Guideline and Imperative standards so that if the EU Bathing Water Quality Directive (76/160/EEC) were applied, neither site would comply. Faecal indicator numbers in the sediments were an order of magnitude higher than in the overlying water. Campylobacter numbers showed seasonal variation in the water with higher counts in winter than in the summer, although numbers were low. Higher numbers were found in the sediments but there was no seasonal variation. Analysis of various inputs showed that indicators and campylobacters came from a mixture of sources, namely a sewage treatment works, agricultural run-off, streams and mallards. Microbial numbers in the water at the Crook O'Lune, which is closer to the sources of pollution, were twice those at the Boathouse. In the sediments they were six to eight times higher. Faecal coliforms were all identified as Escherichia coli of which 80% were a single biotype. Faecal streptococci were all enterococci of which 55% were E. avium, 38% E. faecalis and 7% E. durans. Salmonella was not isolated from either the water column or the sediments. Campylobacters were mainly Camp. jejuni, followed by Camp. coli, UPTC and Camp. lari.
TI  - Health risks associated with unpasteurized goats' and ewes' milk on retail sale in England and Wales. A PHLS Dairy Products Working Group Study.
AB  - A pilot study to determine the microbiological quality of unpasteurized milk from goats and ewes sampled from farm shops, health food shops, and other retail premises found that 47%, (47/100) of goats' and 50% (13/26) of ewes' milk samples failed the standards prescribed by the Dairy Products (Hygiene) Regulations 1995. In addition, Staphylococcus aureus, haemolytic streptococci or enterococci, were present in excess of 10(2) c.f.u./ml in 9 (7 %) 2 (2 %) and 19 (15%) samples, respectively. Salmonella, campylobacter, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes were not detected in the samples. At the time of purchase approximately half of the milk samples (58 %) were frozen, the rest were liquid. Farm outlets sold predominantly liquid milk, other retail premises sold a frozen product. The microbiological quality of goats' and ewes' milk, whether frozen or liquid, was not significantly different. Milk sold from farm shops was of lower quality than that from health food shops and other retail premises. In this pilot study most producers (92 %) supplied, and most retailers (76 %) sold unpasteurized goats' and ewes' milk that contained unacceptable levels of indicator organisms. The study was carried out during the winter when goats' milk production is reduced. The results indicate the need for a full representative study of unpasteurized goats' and ewes' milk on retail sale throughout the year.
TI  - Susceptibility in vitro of Helicobacter pylori to cetylpyridinium chloride.
AB  - The antimicrobial agent cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) which is used in therapy of oro-pharyngeal infections and for antiseptic treatment of the oral cavity is active against different bacterial species. Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) using the agar dilution technique revealed that the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori in vitro is highly susceptible to CPC as indicated by an MIC of 10 microM (3.4 microg ml(-1)) which was significantly lower than the MIC of CPC against other bacterial species, which were analyzed in comparison to H. pylori. Bacteria of the genus Campylobacter, various Streptococcus spp., Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli showed higher MICs ranging from 100 microM to 2 mM. In summary, this finding renders CPC-containing drugs candidates possibly useful for eradication or for the prevention of transmission of the gastric pathogen.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  - Cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. The objective of this study was to compare the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. The study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. Thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. Smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (PD >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared to non-smokers. Two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. Samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. The samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% CO2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. Isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits. Smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. Analysis of bacterial counts using the ANOVA (Mann-Whitney U-test) showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Campylobacter concisus, Escherichia coli, Bacteroides forsythus, C. gracilis, C. rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Selenomonas sputigena, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while Streptococcus intermedius, A. naeslundii, A. israelii and Eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. The isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as E. coli, C. albicans, A. fumigatus and S. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.
TI  - [Lumbar puncture in a pediatric emergency department: something more than a diagnostic technic].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to know the incidence of serious bacterial infections (SBI) in children without sepsis or intracranial infection in which spinal puncture (LP) was performed in an Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of all 471 previously healthy children between 1 month and 14 years of age in which a lumbar puncture was performed between July 1995 and March 1997 in the Emergency Department of our hospital was performed. RESULTS: Two hundred and three children (43%) had sepsis, meningitis or encephalitis (aseptic meningitis 149, 31.6%; sepsis-bacterial meningitis 26, 5.5%; nonspecific meningitis 26, 5.5%; encephalitis 2, 0.4%) and 14 (5.2%) had pneumonia. Of the other 254 children, 36 (14.1%) had a SBI: 19 urinary tract infections (E. coli), 11 bacteremia (Streptococcus pneumoniae 8, Salmonella enteritidis 1, Proteus mirabilis 1, E. coli 1, the latter two also having a positive urine culture) and 6 bacterial gastroenteritis (salmonella 5, Campylobacter jejuni 1). The incidence of SBI was significantly higher in the group of children younger than 5 years old (32/175, 18.2%) than in the older group (4/79, 5.0%, p = 0.009). Two patients died (one with pneumococcal meningitis and one with meningococcal sepsis). CONCLUSIONS: Children with fever and a normal result in the LP must be carefully examined and, especially in younger patients, urine, blood and stool (if stool abnormalities) cultures should be collected. These children must be closely observed in the hospital or at home and must be re-evaluated by their pediatrician in the following 24 hours.
TI  - [Resistance of respiratory and enteral bacteria to antibiotics].
AB  
TI  - Human milk glycoconjugates that inhibit pathogens.
AB  - Breast-fed infants have lower incidence of diarrhea, respiratory disease, and otitis media. The protection by human milk has long been attributed to the presence of secretory IgA. However, human milk contains large numbers and amounts of complex carbohydrates, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, mucins, and especially oligosaccharides. The oligosaccharides comprise the third most abundant solid constituent of human milk, and contain a myriad of structures. Complex carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides are synthesized by the many glycosyltransferases in the mammary gland; those with homology to cell surface glycoconjugate pathogen receptors may inhibit pathogen binding, thereby protecting the nursing infant. Several examples are reviewed: A fucosyloligosaccharide inhibits the diarrheagenic effect of stable toxin of Escherichia coli. A different fucosyloligosaccharide inhibits infection by Campylobacter jejuni. Binding of Streptococcus pneumoniae and of enteropathogenic E. coli to their respective receptors is inhibited by human milk oligosaccharides. The 46-kD glycoprotein, lactadherin, inhibits rotavirus binding and infectivity. Low levels of lactadherin in human milk are associated with a higher incidence of symptomatic rotavirus in breast-fed infants. A mannosylated glycopeptide inhibits binding by enterohemorrhagic E. coli. A glycosaminoglycan inhibits binding of gp120 to CD4, the first step in HIV infection. Human milk mucin inhibits binding by S-fimbriated E. coli. The ganglioside, GM1, reduces diarrhea production by cholera toxin and labile toxin of E. coli. The neutral glycosphingolipid, Gb3, binds to Shigatoxin. Thus, many complex carbohydrates of human milk may be novel antipathogenic agents, and the milk glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides may be a major source of protection for breastfeeding infants.
TI  - Host mutations (miaA and rpsL) reduce tetracycline resistance mediated by Tet(O)  and Tet(M).
AB  - The effects of mutations in host genes on tetracycline resistance mediated by the Tet(O) and Tet(M) ribosomal protection proteins, which originated in Campylobacter spp. and Streptococcus spp., respectively, were investigated by using mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The miaA, miaB, and miaAB double mutants of S. typhimurium specify enzymes for tRNA modification at the adenosine at position 37, adjacent to the anticodon in tRNA. In S. typhimurium, this involves biosynthesis of N6-(4-hydroxyisopentenyl)-2-methylthio-adenosine (ms2io6A). The miaA mutation reduced the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by both Tet(O) and Tet(M), but the latter showed a greater effect, which was ascribed to the isopentenyl (i6) group or to a combination of the methylthioadenosine (ms2) and i6 groups but not to the ms2 group alone (specified by miaB). In addition, mutations in E. coli rpsL genes, generating both streptomycin-resistant and streptomycin-dependent strains, were also shown to reduce the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by Tet(O) and Tet(M). The single-site amino acid substitutions present in the rpsL mutations were pleiotropic in their effects on tetracycline MICs. These mutants affect translational accuracy and kinetics and suggest that Tet(O) and Tet(M) binding to the ribosome may be reduced or slowed in the E. coli rpsL mutants in which the S12 protein is altered. Data from both the miaA and rpsL mutant studies indicate a possible link between stability of the aminoacyl-tRNA in the ribosomal acceptor site and tetracycline resistance mediated by the ribosomal protection proteins.
TI  - Identification of the tetracycline resistance gene, tet(O), in Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - Five isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to tetracycline but lacking tet(M) were studied. The tetracycline resistance gene, tet(O), was detected for the first time in the pneumococcus. The gene was amplified and sequenced and found to share 99% nucleotide sequence identity and 99, 99, and 98% deduced amino acid sequence identity with the tet(O) resistance genes of Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter jejuni, respectively.
TI  - Sepsis in children with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The Madrid HIV Pediatric Infection Collaborative Study Group.
AB  - The aims of this retrospective study were to review the frequency and patterns of bacterial sepsis in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus. The charts of 233 human immunodeficiency virus-infected children cared for during a 10-year period in 4 tertiary hospitals in Madrid were reviewed. There were 43 episodes of sepsis in 31 (13%) children. Twenty of them had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 10 were class PA2 and 1 was class P1B. The most common organisms recovered were: nontyphoidal Salmonella, 10 cases (23%); Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9 cases (21%); Staphylococcus epidermidis, 6 cases (14%); Escherichia coli, 5 cases (12%); Enterococcus faecalis, 4 cases (9%); Campylobacter jejuni, 2 cases (5%). In 28 episodes of bacteremia there were other sites of associated infection: pneumonia, 6 cases; urinary tract infection (UTI), 5 cases; gastrointestinal disease, 4 cases; catheter-related bacteremia, 12 cases. Eight patients had more than 1 episode of bacteremia. The rate of complications was high: 6 children had septic shock; and 2 of them developed disseminated intravascular coagulation. There was 1 death directly related to sepsis.
TI  - [Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies of SY5555 in the pediatric field].
AB  - Pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies on SY5555, a new oral penem, were carried out, and the following results were obtained. 1. MICs were determined for 6 drugs, SY5555, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin (CVA/AMPC), cefaclor (CCL), cefotiam (CTM), cefpodoxime (CPDX), cefdinir (CFDN) against 20 strains of bacteria isolated from patients who were subsequently treated with SY5555. MICs of SY5555 for Gram-positive cocci ranged from 0.05 to 0.10 microgram/ml against 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus. The MIC was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml against one strain of Streptococcus pyogenes, and MICs were from < or = 0.025 to 0.39 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae. These MIC values were equivalent or superior to those of the other 5 drugs. MICs of SY5555 for Gram-negative bacilli were 0.39 and 6.25 micrograms/ml against Haemophilus influenzae, and these values were equivalent to those of the other drugs, except CPDX. The MIC of SY5555 was 0.39 microgram/ml against 2 strains of Escherichia coli, and this value was equivalent or superior to those of CVA/AMPC and CCL, similar or inferior to those of CPDX and CFDN, and inferior to that of CTM. The MICs of several drugs were determined for 10 strains of Bordetella pertussis and 30 strains of Campylobacter jejuni isolated from patients before this clinical study. The MICs of SY5555 against the 10 strains of B. pertussis were compared with those of 7 drugs, CCL, CTM, CPDX, ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM) and erythromycin (EM). The MIC of SY5555 was 0.78 microgram/ml against all of the strains. This value was superior to those of CCL, CTM and CPDX, similar or inferior to that of IPM and inferior to those of PIPC and EM. The MICs of SY5555 against the 30 strains of C. jejuni were compared with those of 7 drugs. CCL, CTM, CPDX, CFDN, ABPC, IPM and EM, and the MIC of SY5555 was < or = 0.025 microgram/ml or 0.05 microgram/ml and these values were equivalent or superior to those of the 7 reference drugs. 2. SY5555 dry syrup was administered orally at 30 min. after meals, to a total of 5 patients, at doses of 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg to 2 patients each and at a dose of 15.0 mg/kg to one patient and the plasma concentrations were determined. Peak concentrations were detected 1 to 3 hours after administration in all patients and the peak concentrations were 0.93 and 1.21 micrograms/ml at the 5.0 mg/kg dose, 2.85 and 5.49 micrograms/ml at the 10.0 mg/kg dose and 5.79 micrograms/ml at the 15.0 mg/kg dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Hemolytic-uremic syndrome after verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli infection].
AB  - The haemolytic uraemic syndrome, first described in 1955 by Gasser, is the number one cause of acute renal failure in infants. There are three types of the haemolytic uraemic syndrome: the seasonal epidemic form with prodromic diarrhoea and generally favourable outcome which usually occurs in infants, a less typical form without signs of digestive tract involvement and no seasonal prevalence which occurs more readily in older children and sometimes in families has a less favourable prognosis, and finally drug- or disease-related forms. Currently, overall mortality due to haemolytic uraemic syndrome has been reduced to about 4%, usually as a result of damage to the central nervous system. Several microorganism, including Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Rickittsiae and certain viruses (Coksackiae, Influenzae, Epstein-Barr) have been identified as causative agents. In 1983, digestive tract infection due to an Escherichia coli strain producing verotoxin was identified as capable of producing haemolytic uraemic syndrome and more rarely thrombopenic thrombotic purpura. The germ produces two exotoxins (whose effect is accentuated by the E. coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin) which lead to the glomerular microangiopathy causing haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Diagnosis is based on identification (monoclonal antibodies, ELISA, PCR) of the verotoxins themselves or the two encoding genes in stool samples. Symptomatic treatment is essential but the effectiveness of antibiotics is still debated. Theoretically, antibiotics could worsen the syndrome by increasing endotoxin release from lysed bacteria, but inversely they could also prevent the syndrome if given early enough. Further research is required to acquire precise epidemiological data and identify animal reservoirs of verotoxin producing E. coli.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Monitoring of selected bacteria and fungi in sand and sea water along the Tel Aviv coast.
AB  - Monitoring sand and sea water of the Mediterranean Tel Aviv beaches during 1989-1991 for bacterial quality showed varying data and no correlation between standard bacteria parameters (SBP) and potential pathogenic bacteria (PPB). An exceptional feature was observed in 1989 when faecal coliforms including Escherichia coli and faecal Streptococcus were less in sand than in sea water. These results may be attributed to the low turbulent activity of the sea in 1989, particularly in summer, compared with the next two years. In 1990 the number of SBP and PPB was always higher in sand than in sea water. The most frequent micro-organisms isolated from sand were E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans. Intensive engineering work and the construction of a chlorinator for sewage probably caused a dramatic drop in the number of SBP and PPB in sea water and sand during 1990-1991 on some beaches. Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from sand, and may be considered a possible hazard factor for enteritis in the population bathing at these beaches.
TI  - Characterization of a new class of tetracycline-resistance gene tet(S) in Listeria monocytogenes BM4210.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline (Tc)-minocycline (Mc)-resistance determinant of plasmid pIP811 from Listeria monocytogenes BM4210 has been determined. The gene, designated tet(S), was identified by analysis of the start and stop codons as a coding sequence of 1923 bp, corresponding to a protein with a calculated M(r) of 72,912. The apparent 68-kDa size estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of the protein characterized in a cell-free coupled transcription-translation system was in good agreement with the calculated value. The tet(S) gene product exhibits 79 and 72% amino acid identity with Tet(M) from Streptococcus pneumoniae and Tet(O) from Campylobacter coli, respectively. The distribution of tet(S) in strains of Gram+ and Gram- genera resistant to Tc (TcR) and Mc (McR) was studied by hybridization under high stringency using a 590-bp intragenic probe. Homology with tet(S) was detected in two clinical isolates of L. monocytogenes isolated in different geographical areas.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - A multiple logistic model for predicting the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli in water.
AB  - A multiple logistic regression model was established to predict the occurrence of Campylobacter jejuni/coli, related to index bacteria such as faecal coliforms, faecal streptococci, and sulphite-reducing clostridia, in a water source in southern Norway. The fitted model indicated that faecal coliforms were strong predictors for C. jejuni/coli, although the water temperature also had a strong influence on results. Sulphite-reducing clostridia, faecal streptococci, and season of the year had no significant influence on the results, in spite of their apparent predictor value as separate variables. The model employed offers a new approach to the relationship between index bacteria and the occurrence of pathogenic bacteria in water. Similar models can also be established in general food microbiology.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. The size determinations of OG1X, a strain of E. faecalis widely used in many laboratories for genetic studies, using Sma I, Not I, and Sfi I alone or in combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. Using the same enzymes as with OG1X, the size of HH-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of E. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of JH2-2, an E. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. The size range generated for GE-1, a plasmid-free E. faecium strain, with the use of Sma I, Not I, and Apa I was 2,045-2,155 kb. Although OG1X differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. However, for both E. faecalis OG1X and E. faecium GE-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other two enzymes. The discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two enzymes are used to size a genome. The size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. The molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for Campylobacter, smaller than that of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (OG1X) or smaller (JH2-2, HH67, and GE-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Characterization of two plasmids from Campylobacter jejuni isolates that carry the aphA-7 kanamycin resistance determinant.
AB  - Two small plasmids of 11.5 and 9.5 kb, each carrying an aphA-7 kanamycin phosphotransferase gene, were studied. The MICs of kanamycin for the two human Campylobacter jejuni isolates harboring the plasmids were 10,000 and 5,000 micrograms/ml, while the MICs of amikacin were 32 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MICs of gentamicin and tobramycin were less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml for both isolates. The restriction endonuclease maps of the plasmids were similar, with the larger plasmid showing two discrete regions of additional DNA. When the aphA-7 gene from each plasmid was cloned into pBR322, the aphA-7 gene expressed the kanamycin resistance phenotype in Escherichia coli. For transformants containing the cloned aphA-7 gene, kanamycin MICs were greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. The aphA-7 gene was also subcloned from the plasmid pFKT4420 into the E. coli-Streptococcus shuttle vector pDL278 and was transformed into Streptococcus gordonii Challis. For streptococcal transformants containing the novel plasmid, kanamycin MICs were 4,000 micrograms/ml. In the presence of a tetracycline resistance plasmid, both small plasmids could be mobilized during conjugal matings to Campylobacter coli recipients.
TI  - [Preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  - The authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (IFP) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. The infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (Micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with IFP as well as in recommended standard media. Solid media used for cultivation of S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and C. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. All of these strains grew on the media prepared with IFP except S. pneumoniae when cultured in IFP diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. Only S. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. No more differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. The growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis was measured in liquid media after 8 hours. In solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in IFP-agar and Nutriente Agar by the number of colonies on Trypticase soy agar plates. Some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated in standard media. The average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of IFP was 5.03 mg/ml. The experiments showed that culture media prepared with IFP supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. It suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.
TI  - Campylobacter jejuni in acute diarrhoea in infancy and its relation to faecal leucocytic count.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to identify the relative risk of Campylobacter jejuni infection in 50 infants with acute diarrhoea, 24 infants with acute resistant diarrhoea and 25 healthy normal infants as a matching control group. Faecal samples were collected from the three groups and were cultured on both selective media for Campylobacter and other media for isolation of other organisms. Direct stool smears, stained with methylene blue, were examined for detection of faecal leucocyte in all samples. Campylobacter jejuni were isolated from 4 cases (8.0%) of the acute diarrhoeal group and 4 cases (16.6%) of acute resistant diarrhoeal group. The other bacterial pathogens isolated from our cases were Salmonella, Shigella, E. Coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio Parahaemolytious Klebsiella, Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. All cases from whom Campylobacter was isolated were bottle fed and their ages were below 6 months. Smears for faecal leucocytes were positive in 100% of Campylobacter isolated cases, 60% of Salmonella, 50% of Shigella, 14% of E. Coli and 100% were negative in all other cases. Thus it can be recommended that any case presenting with acute diarrhoea should be initially screened by faecal leucocytic counting, positive cases should be cultured for Campylobacter jejuni detection in addition to cultures for other organisms detection.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - Effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  - Pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees C to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. Pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. Harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. Pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except Bacillus cereus spores. Gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than Gram-positive ones. Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhimurium and Yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. Only less than one-log cfu/g of B. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that E. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic RNA at lower pressure than S. aureus. From the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia.
AB  - Results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. The sensitivity pattern of Staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. The resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. Brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. The resistance of E. coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. The gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). Gentamicin and amikacin resistance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). Salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella species, and enteropathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Ninety six percent of Gram-negative rods except P. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. In addition, P. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.
TI  - Study of haemolytic activity of some Campylobacter spp. on blood agar plates.
AB  - A total of 152 strains of Campylobacter jejuni, C. coli, C. laridis and C. fetus  subsp. fetus were tested for haemolysis on blood agar plates. Distinct haemolysis was detected in 92.3% (96/104) of strains of C. jejuni and 21.7% (5/23) of strains of C. coli on sheep blood heart infusion agar after incubation for 4 d microaerobically at 42 degrees C. Haemolysis was also detected on horse blood heart infusion agar. Haemolysis was not detected at 37 degrees C except with one of 50 strains of C. jejuni tested at this temperature, which was weakly positive. Campylobacter laridis was not haemolytic; C. fetus subsp. fetus, which does not grow at 42 degrees C, showed no haemolysis at 37 degrees C. Blood agar (Oxoid, BA Base No. 2) was not suitable for testing for haemolysis by these organisms. A microaerobic gas mixture containing hydrogen is better than that containing nitrogen because the medium has a brighter colour, making haemolysis easier to detect. There was no synergistic haemolysis with Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus agalactiae. The plate haemolysis test as described here may aid differentiation within the thermophilic campylobacters.
TI  - Natural transformation in Campylobacter species.
AB  - Growing cells of Campylobacter coli and C. jejuni were naturally transformed by naked DNA without the requirement for any special treatment. Transformation frequencies for homologous chromosomal DNA were approximately 10(-3) transformants per recipient cell in C. coli and 10(-4) in C. jejuni. Maximum competence was found in the early log phase of growth. Campylobacters preferentially took up their own DNA in comparison with Escherichia coli chromosomal DNA, which was taken up very poorly. Three new Campylobacter spp.-to-E. coli shuttle plasmids, which contained additional cloning sites and selectable markers, were constructed from the shuttle vector pILL550A. These plasmid DNAs were taken up by campylobacters much less efficiently than was homologous chromosomal DNA, and transformation into plasmid-free cells was very rare. However, with the use of recipients containing a homologous plasmid, approximately 10(-4) transformants per cell were obtained. The tetM determinant, originally obtained from Streptococcus spp. and not heretofore reported in Campylobacter spp., was isolated from an E. coli plasmid and was introduced, selecting for tetracycline resistance, by natural transformation into C. coli.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of a novel kanamycin resistance gene, aphA-7, from Campylobacter jejuni and comparison to other kanamycin phosphotransferase genes.
AB  - A novel kanamycin phosphotransferase gene, aphA-7, was cloned from a 14-kb plasmid obtained from a strain of Campylobacter jejuni and the nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined. The presumed open reading frame of the aphA-7 structural gene was 753 bp in length and encoded a protein of 251 amino acids with a calculated weight of 29,691 Da. A 29-kDa protein was demonstrated in Escherichia coli maxicells containing the cloned aphA-7 gene. A ribosomal binding site corresponding to 5 of 8 bases of the 3' end of the E. coli 16S rRNA was 8 bp upstream of the start codon. Sequences corresponding to the -35 and -10 regions of the consensus promoter sequences of E. coli were upstream of the presumed initiation codon of the gene. The DNA sequence was most closely related to the aphA-3 gene from Streptococcus faecalis, showing 55.4% sequence similarity. There was 45.6% identity at the amino acid level between the aphA-3 and the aphA-7 proteins. Of the three conserved regions noted previously in phosphotransferase genes, the aphA-7 amino acid sequence was identical to the six conserved amino acids in motif 3, but differed in one of the five conserved amino acids in motif 1 (if gaps are permitted) and 3 of the 10 conserved residues in motif 2. The 32.8% G + C ratio in the open reading frame of the aphA-7 kanamycin resistance gene, which is similar to that of the C. jejuni chromosome, suggests that the aphA-7 may be indigenous to Campylobacters.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - [The "diseased" or "dead" guillemots (Uria aalge), three-toed gulls (Rissa tridactyla), silver gulls (Larus argentatus) and laughing gulls (Larus ridibundus) found in the area of the German Bay, 1982-1985].
AB  - Between 1982 and 1985 the cadavers of 50 Guillemots (Uria aalge), 41 Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), 26 Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) and 34 Black-headed Gulls (Larus ridibundus) were examined pathological, bacteriological and virological. The probable cause of death was established. Parasitosis were particularly prevalent in Herring Gulls (49%), where the main infection--as in Black-headed Gulls--was with Cestoides. In Kittiwakes and Guillemots mainly Spiruroideae were recorded. The commonest bacterium isolated in organs and intestinal tract was Escherichia coli, followed by Aeromonas hydrophila and Clostridium perfringens. Salmonella were found in the organs of 5% and in the intestinal tract of 3% of the birds. The species of Salmonella most frequently isolated was Salmonella typhimurium varieties copenhagen. Also recorded were Yersinia intermedia Serovar 0:17 (1x), Pseudomonas spp. (2x), bacteria of the Haemophilus-Pasteurella-Actinobacillus group (1x), Pasteurella multocida (2x), Moraxella septicaemiae (1x), Campylobacter spec. (1x), Mycoplasma spec. (6x), DNase positive Staphylococcus spec. (4x) and Streptococcus spec. (6x). Less in evidence among the birds examined were fungus diseases with Aspergillus spec. (4x) and Blastomyces spec. (4x). As for viruses one Guillemot was found to have an Adenovirus and another one to have a Paramyxovirus. From one of the Herring Gulls there also was isolated a Paramyxovirus, from a second one to a Reovirus. Three other species isolated have get to be identified. The chief cause of sickness and death in the Guillemots was oil-contamination. The majority of the examined Kittiwakes and Herring Gulls were victims of pathogenic agents. Many of the Black-headed Gulls died through traumata as gunshots or road traffic etc. In order to establish the causes of sickness and death in seabirds and to ascertain the importance of the various species as possible carriers of infectious diseases, a systematic series of investigation will be necessary. Without this it will not be possible to assess their epidemiological relevance for other wild birds, domestic poultry and humans.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Coumamidines, new broad spectrum antibiotics of the cinodine type. III. Microbiologic activity of coumamidine gamma 1.
AB  - The coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. All microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. The MIC90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine are as follows: Staphylococcus aureus 1.0, Streptococcus pyogenes 8, Enterobacteriaceae 2.0, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli 1, Legionella pneumophila 8, Haemophilus influenzae 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, Neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. Coumamidine had MICs ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some Peptostreptococcus strains. The aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, P. aeruginosa BMH 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (MIC 0.2 micrograms/ml). Coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for S. aureus. The viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the MIC (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. The frequency of resistance development was less than 1 X 10(-9) for Escherichia coli and S. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the MIC. The Cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. Coumamidine is stable in serum. In mouse protection tests against S. aureus NCTC 10649 the ED50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. Coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. The antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new oral macrolide azithromycin was compared with that of erythromycin against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Ninety percent of hemolytic streptococci groups A and B, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml. Activity of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin; erythromycin-resistant staphylococci and streptococci were not inhibited. Azithromycin was more active than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 1 microgram/ml) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It inhibited Campylobacter spp. and Pasteurella multocida, and had an MIC50 of 8 micrograms/ml for Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica compared to an erythromycin value of greater than 64 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis of tetracycline resistance gene tetO from Streptococcus mutans DL5.
AB  - Streptococcus mutans DL5, isolated from the dental plaque of a pig, was resistant to high levels of streptomycin (Sm, 20 mg/ml), erythromycin (Em, 1 mg/ml), and tetracycline (Tc, greater than 100 micrograms/ml), but contained no detectable plasmid DNA. The Smr and Emr determinants were cloned from cellular DNA on the self-replicating 5-kilobase-pair (kbp) EcoRI fragment of pAM beta 1 and the 4.2-kbp cryptic plasmid pVA380-1, respectively, by transformation of Streptococcus sanguis Challis. Helper plasmid cloning, with a Challis host containing pVA380-1, was required to clone the Tcr determinant of strain DL5 on this vector. A single-colony isolate of the original Tcr clone contained a hybrid plasmid, pDL421, composed of 2.6 kbp of vector DNA and 11.4 kbp of S. mutans DNA. Plasmid pDL421 did not hybridize to plasmids containing the streptococcal Tcr determinants tetL, tetM, and tetN. A shortened derivative of this hybrid plasmid, pDL422, missing a 4.9-kbp HincII fragment from the S. mutans DNA but still encoding Tcr, was obtained by subcloning in S. sanguis Challis. The Tcr gene was located in a 1,917-base-pair open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to a 72-kilodalton protein. The ORF exhibited 99.4% sequence identity with the 1,917-base-pair tetO gene from a strain of Campylobacter coli (W. Sougakoff, B. Papadopoulou, P. Nordmann, and P. Courvalin, FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 44:153-160, 1987). A 1.67-kbp NdeI fragment, internal to the ORF from strain DL5, as well as pDL421 hybridized under stringent conditions to DNA from 10 of 10 Tcr strains of C. coli and Campylobacter jejuni from human and animal sources, but not to DNA from Tcs isolates of these two species.
TI  - A-61827 (A-60969), a new fluoronaphthyridine with activity against both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - A-61827 (A-60969 is the hydrochloric salt of A-61827) is a new aryl-fluoronaphthyridine which is active against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The MICs of A-61827 for 90% of strains (MIC90) of staphylococci and streptococci were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml and were generally 1 to 4 twofold dilutions less than those of ciprofloxacin for these bacteria. The MIC90S of A-61827 for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were also less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml. Ciprofloxacin was 1 to 3 twofold dilutions more active than A-61827 against these gram-negative bacteria. Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter jejuni, and Haemophilus influenzae were susceptible to less than 0.06 microgram of A-61827 per ml. The MIC90 of A-61827 for Legionella pneumophila was 0.25 microgram/ml. A-61827 was as potent or 1 to 2 twofold dilutions more potent than ciprofloxacin against these organisms. The MIC90 of A-61827 for all anaerobic bacteria was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml compared with less than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml for ciprofloxacin. In mouse protection tests, A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, and Salmonella typhimurium and 5 to 10 times more active than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. A-61827 was as active as ciprofloxacin against P. aeruginosa in a mouse pyelonephritis model and more active than ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in a mouse Bacteroides fragilis abscess model. After oral administration of 100 mg/kg to mice, the peak concentrations of A-61827 and ciprofloxacin in serum were 2.3 and 2.4 micrograms/ml and the half-lives in serum were 3.9 and 1.2 h, respectively.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence analysis and expression of a tetracycline-resistance gene from Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Resistance to tetracycline in the microaerophilic Gram-negative bacterium Campylobacter jejuni is plasmid-mediated. A 6.9-kb HindIII DNA fragment containing the tetracycline-resistance (TcR) gene (designated tetO) from the C. jejuni conjugative plasmid pUA466 was cloned into pUC8, and the resultant plasmid pUOA1 was used to transform Escherichia coli to Tc resistance. The tetO gene was localized at a 2.0-kb region comprising 0.2-kb and 1.8-kb HincII fragments, and the nucleotide sequences were determined. The protein coding region of tetO contained a 1911-bp open reading frame which corresponded to a 72.3-kDa protein. Upstream from the start codon were hexanucleotides that resembled the canonical sequences found at the -10 region, -35 region and the ribosome-binding site of the prokaryotic promoter. The tetO gene product was expressed utilizing an E. coli-derived in vitro transcription/translation system. The polypeptide had an apparent Mr of 68,000. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of TetO to those of TetM (derived from the Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae) revealed 76% homology. Hydrophilicity plot analyses of TetO and TetM proteins provided almost identical profiles. These results clearly support our earlier [Taylor et al., J. Bacteriol. 169 (1987) 2984-2989] suggestion that TcR determinants found in Gram-positive bacteria and in C. jejuni may have a common ancestry.
TI  - Spectrum and mode of action of azithromycin (CP-62,993), a new 15-membered-ring macrolide with improved potency against gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The macrolide antibiotic azithromycin (CP-62,993; 9-deoxo-9a-methyl-9a-aza-9a-homoerythromycin A; also designated XZ-450 [Pliva Pharmaceuticals, Zagreb, Yugoslavia]) showed a significant improvement in potency against gram-negative organisms compared with erythromycin while retaining the classic erythromycin spectrum. It was up to four times more potent than erythromycin against Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and twofold more potent against Branhamella catarrhalis, Campylobacter species, and Legionella species. It had activity similar to that of erythromycin against Chlamydia spp. Azithromycin was significantly more potent versus many genera of the family Enterobacteriaceae; its MIC for 90% of strains of Escherichia, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia was less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 16 to 128 micrograms/ml for erythromycin. Azithromycin inhibited the majority of gram-positive organisms at less than or equal to 1 micrograms/ml. It displayed cross-resistance to erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus and Streptococcus isolates. It had moderate activity against Bacteroides fragilis and was comparable to erythromycin against other anaerobic species. Azithromycin also demonstrated improved bactericidal activity in comparison with erythromycin. The mechanism of action of azithromycin was similar to that of erythromycin since azithromycin competed effectively for [14C]erythromycin ribosomebinding sites.
TI  - DNA probes for identification of tetracycline resistance genes in Campylobacter species isolated from swine and cattle.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant strains of Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli from swine and cattle colons were isolated and characterized by hybridization with DNA probes. A probe consisting of the 1.8-kilobase (kb) HincII fragment from pUA466 was highly specific for the detection of tetracycline resistance (Tcr) in C. jejuni and C. coli. The 5-kb tetM DNA probe from Streptococcus agalactiae plasmid pJI3 which has homology with the 1.8-kb HincII fragment from pUA466 could also be used to detect Tcr Campylobacter strains. However, the tetM probe had a much lower sensitivity and required a lower stringency of hybridization. Therefore, the 1.8-kb HincII fragment appeared to be more appropriate for the classification of Tcr in Campylobacter spp. No homology was detected between the Tcr determinant from Campylobacter spp. and the tetL and tetN probes from Streptococcus spp. DNA homology was demonstrated between pUA649, a derivative of plasmid pUA466 which had lost most of the Tcr region, and Tcr plasmids from C. jejuni and C. coli isolated from animal and human sources. There was also homology between pUA649 and the chromosomes of C. jejuni and C. coli strains. In this study, all but one of the tetracycline-resistant C. coli and C. jejuni strains contained plasmids of approximately 50 kb which hybridized with the 1.8-kb HincII probe. In one C. coli strain (UA703), Tcr appeared to be chromosomally mediated.
TI  - Evaluation of gamma radiation levels for reducing pathogenic bacteria and fungi in animal sewage and laboratory effluents.
AB  - Sewage samples collected from animal wastes and from effluents at an animal disease laboratory were inoculated with known numbers of pathogenic organisms and subjected to various doses of gamma radiation from a 60Co source. Surviving test organisms were quantitatively determined by selective and enrichment techniques. The experiment was modeled as a quantal assay in which probit analysis was applied to obtain D10 values. The D10 value represents the irradiating dose required to reduce the population by 90%. The D10 value ranged from 13.4 krad for Campylobacter fetus to 156.6 krad for Streptococcus faecalis in animal sewage. However, the D10 value for the laboratory effluent was generally lower. Based on the estimated D10 values, the rating of the test organisms in decreasing order of radiosensitivity appeared as follows: Brucella abortus, Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, Campylobacter laridis, Mycobacterium fortuitum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Salmonella muenster, Candida albicans, Clostridium difficile and Streptococcus faecalis. If the D5 and D1 values were utilized, this listing would be only slightly altered.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant of the pneumococcal transposon Tn1545: evolutionary relationships and transcriptional analysis of aphA-3 genes.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the kanamycin resistance determinant aphA-3 encoded by transposon Tn1545 from Streptococcus pneumoniae was determined and compared to those of plasmids pJH1 and pIP1433 from Streptococcus faecalis and Campylobacter coli, respectively. The three sequences were found to be identical and differed by two substitutions and the deletion of a codon from that of plasmid pSH2 from Staphylococcus aureus. Comparison of the 5' noncoding sequences indicated that the regions containing the aphA-3 gene in pJH1 and in Tn1545 evolved independently by deletion from a sequence similar to that found in pIP1433. In the latter plasmid, aphA-3 is transcribed from a promoter, P1, which is flanked by two 12-base pair direct repeats. The rearrangement observed in pJH1 removed one of these recombinogenic sites and altered the -10 and 3' flanking sequences of P1. The promoter thus generated. P1', allows expression of similar level of kanamycin resistance as P1. However, fusion experiments carried out with a promotorless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene indicated that the canonical promoter P1 is significantly less efficient than P1'. From analysis of the thermodynamic properties of these promoters, we conclude that this difference in strength reflects the melting properties of the -10 sequences. The transition from pIP1433 to pJH1 may correspond to the progression of a molecule structurally unstable to a more stable one combined with the need to maintain an efficient promoter upstream of the aphA-3 gene. The deletion event in Tn1545, which occurred between the two 12-base pair directly repeated sequences, removed P1 in its entirety.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - Evolution and transfer of aminoglycoside resistance genes under natural conditions.
AB  - 3'-Aminoglycoside phosphotransferases [APH(3')] were chosen as a model to study the evolution and the transfer of aminoglycoside resistance genes under natural conditions. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of APH(3') enzymes from transposons Tn903 (type I) and Tn5 (type II) detected in Gram-negative bacteria, from the Gram-positive Staphylococcus and Streptococcus (type III), from the butirosin-producing Bacillus circulans (type IV) and from a neomycin-producing Streptomyces fradiae (type V) indicate that they have diverged from a common ancestor. These structural data support the hypothesis that the antibiotic-producing strains were the source of certain resistance determinants. We have shown that kanamycin resistance in Campylobacter coli BM2509 was due to the synthesis of an APH(3')-III, an enzyme not detected previously in a Gram-negative bacterium. The genes encoding APH(3')-III in Streptococcus and Campylobacter are identical. These findings constitute evidence for a recent in-vivo transfer of DNA between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Nucleotide sequence of the tetM tetracycline resistance determinant of the streptococcal conjugative shuttle transposon Tn1545.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance gene tetM encoded by streptococcal conjugative shuttle transposon Tn1545 has been determined. The resistance gene was identified as a coding sequence of 1917 base pairs corresponding to a protein with a Mr of 72,500 daltons. This value is in good agreement with that, 68,000 daltons, estimated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of Escherichia coli minicell extracts. The tetM gene product does not exhibit any sequence homology with either the Gram-negative (tetA, tetB and tetC), or the Bacillus and Staphylococcus tetracycline resistance proteins. The average hydropathy value of the tetM gene product (-0.21) contrasts with those calculated for the other TET proteins which are markedly hydrophobic (0.76 to 0.93). Hybridization experiments performed with an intragenic tetM probe do not support the claim [Taylor, D. (1986), J. Bact. 165, 1037-1039)] that tetracycline resistance in Campylobacter is due to acquisition of tetM.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated tetracycline resistance in Campylobacter jejuni: expression in Escherichia coli and identification of homology with streptococcal class M determinant.
AB  - Plasmid pUA466, a 45-kilobase transmissible tetracycline resistance plasmid from  Campylobacter jejuni was mapped with AvaI, AvaII, BclI, HincII, PstI, XhoI, and XbaI. The resistance determinant was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and was homologous with a class M determinant from Streptococcus spp.
TI  - Two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography for the specific detection of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms.
AB  - Glycine, one of the end products of hippurate hydrolysis by microorganisms, was detected by a rapid, specific technique utilizing two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography. A loopful of growth of each organism from its suitable agar medium was washed, suspended, and incubated with 0.1% sodium hippurate for 30 min at 37 degrees C. The supernatant of the incubated suspension from each organism was then dansylated, and the dansyl derivatives were separated by two-dimensional thin-layer chromatography on polyamide sheets. Glycine, a product of hippurate hydrolysis, was detected under UV light. This technique does not require prolonged incubation and was found to be more specific and reliable than the standard ninhydrin reaction. In addition, it is inexpensive and can be easily conducted in a clinical microbiological reference laboratory. By this method, 100% (22/22) of Campylobacter jejuni and 0% (0/9) of Campylobacter coli reference strains were positive. In addition, 100% (13/13) of group B streptococci, 100% (24/24) of group D streptococci, and 90% (18/20) of Gardenerella vaginalis clinical isolates were positive for hippurate hydrolysis. This method is useful for the identification to the species level of Campylobacter organisms and the biotyping of Gardnerella organisms and for the detection of hippurate hydrolysis by unknown microorganisms.

TI  - Behaviour of Campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis in gnotobiotic pigs.
AB  - Gnotobiotic pigs were dosed orally with Campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis, either alone, or combined with rotavirus or non-pathogenic Escherichia coli and Streptococcus bovis to study the behaviour of C s mucosalis in defined conditions, to assess intracellular parasitism of enterocytes by C s mucosalis, and if possible to establish an experimental model of porcine intestinal adenomatosis. C s mucosalis colonised the gut of gnotobiotic pigs, persisting for up to 47 days after infection, but did not induce adenomatosis. Despite evidence of limited penetration of the mucosa up to two days after infection, the majority of C s mucosalis remained in the gut lumen. Rotavirus did not enhance invasion of enterocytes by C s mucosalis. The presence of E coli and S bovis caused an increase in the total numbers of C s mucosalis in the gut, but did not affect their distribution. Thus C s mucosalis was largely non-pathogenic in gnotobiotic pigs.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - The development of an altered gingival crevicular microflora in the alloxan-diabetic rat.
AB  - The microflora of the rat gingival crevice were examined at various time intervals after inducing experimental diabetes. A variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative cocci and short rods were isolated from the normal rat crevice. Within a week after alloxan administration, Leptotrichia buccalis was detected for the first time. Other features in the diabetic animals included an increased frequency of isolation of Proteus spp., Lactobacillus spp. and decrease of Escherichia coli. Occasionally, a decrease was also observed in Bacteroides spp. and Streptococcus spp. No difference was observed between diabetic and non-diabetic animals in the isolation of Selonomonas, Campylobacter, Bifidobacterium and Actinomyces. Plaque accumulation was markedly increased in the diabetic rats. It was concluded that the change in gingival microflora resulted from diabetes-induced alterations in the sulcular environment (such as increased substrate levels, e.g. glucose and urea, and decreased oxygen) and that the microbiological changes preceded the depending of the periodontal pocket.

TI  - [Clinical evaluation of cefotiam therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  - Cefotiam (CTM) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. Twenty-six  patients were treated with 40 to 200 mg/kg per day of CTM by intravenous administrations. The diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute bronchitis (1), pneumonia (4), empyema (2), urinary tract infection (2), typhoid fever (1), acute enterocolitis (2), partially-treated purulent meningitis (1), and suspected septicemia in neuroblastoma (1); and the remaining ten patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. The pathogens recovered were Streptococcus pyogenes (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (1), Staphylococcus aureus (4), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Escherichia coli (1), enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (1), Salmonella typhi (1), and Campylobacter jejuni (1). All but two patients of bacterial infections were cured after the CTM therapy, and the rate of efficacy was 87.5%. Diarrhea (3), urticaria (1), transient elevation of GOT and GPT (1), and transient eosinophilia (3) were found to be associated with the CTM therapy. However, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. Half life of the serum CTM level was 0.93 +/- 0.13 hours, and excretion into the urine was rapid. CSF concentration obtained 1 hour after an intravenous injection of 21 mg/kg of CTM in a case with inflamed meninges was 1.5 mcg/ml, and the CSF/serum ratio was 9.0%. From these data, CTM appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.

TI  - In-vitro effect of edta-tris-lysozyme solutions on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro effect of EDTA-Tris-lysozyme solution on 16 pathogenic bacteria of medical or veterinary importance was determined. Marked decreases in bacterial count occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Moraxella osloensis and Campylobacter fetus, and smaller decreses with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella boydii, Aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.
