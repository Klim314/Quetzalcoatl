TI  - Unacylated tridecaptin A(1) acts as an effective sensitiser of Gram-negative bacteria to other antibiotics.
AB  - A derivative of the linear cationic lipopeptide tridecaptin A(1)missing the N-terminal lipophilic acyl group, termed H-TriA(1), is devoid of antimicrobial activity but is extremely effective at sensitising Gram-negative bacteria to certain antibiotics. H-TriA(1)has low cytotoxicity compared with the natural peptide and in low concentrations it can substantially lower the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of some antibiotics against strains of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In particular, the MIC of rifampicin was lowered 256-512-fold against K. pneumoniae strains using low concentrations of H-TriA(1). H-TriA(1)does not exert its synergistic effect through partial membrane lysis, but does bind to model bacterial membranes in a manner akin to the natural peptide. Formation of this stable secondary structure on the outer membrane may account for the observed synergistic activity.
TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect Salmonella targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene.

TI  - Antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  - Grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. These metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. Grapes are used to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. Grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. This overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components against foodborne (Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, Staphylococcus aureus, Yersinia enterocolitica, Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus), medical (Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (Candida albicans, Botrytis cinerea), parasites (Eimeria tenella, Trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin A, Shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. Also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects associated with wine consumption. The collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship studies of N-terminal analogues of  the antimicrobial peptide tridecaptin A(1).
AB  - Chemical synthesis was used to increase the potency of the antimicrobial lipopeptide tridecaptin A1. Lipid tail modification proved to be an ideal platform for synthesizing structurally simpler analogues that are not readily accessible by isolation. The stereochemical elements of the tridecaptin A1 lipid tail are not essential for antimicrobial activity and could be replaced with hydrophobic aliphatic or aromatic groups. Some simpler analogues displayed potent antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, including Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli O157:H7, and multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - Influence of Asellus aquaticus on Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and naturally occurring heterotrophic bacteria in drinking water.
AB  - Water lice, Asellus aquaticus (isopoda), frequently occur in drinking water distribution systems where they are a nuisance to consumers and water utilities. Whether they are solely an aesthetic problem or also affect the microbial water quality is a matter of interest. We studied the influence of A. aquaticus on microbial water quality in non-chlorinated drinking water in controlled laboratory experiments. Pure cultures of the indicator organisms Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and the pathogen Campylobacter jejuni as well as naturally occurring heterotrophic drinking water bacteria (measured as heterotrophic plate counts, HPC) were investigated in microcosms at 7 degrees C, containing non-sterilised drinking water, drinking water sediment and A. aquaticus collected from a non-chlorinated ground water based drinking water supply system. Concentrations of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and C. jejuni decreased over time, following a first order decay with half lives of 5.3, 18.4 and 1.3 days, respectively. A. aquaticus did not affect survival of indicators and pathogens substantially whereas HPC were influenced by presence of dead A. aquaticus. Growth rates increased with an average of 48% for bacteria grown on R-2A agar and an average of 83% for bacteria grown on yeast extract agar when dead A. aquaticus were present compared to no and living A. aquaticus present. A. aquaticus associated E. coli, K. pneumoniae and C. jejuni were measured (up to 25 per living and 500 per dead A. aquaticus) and so were A. aquaticus associated heterotrophic bacteria (>1.8*10(4) CFU per living and >6*10(4) CFU per dead A. aquaticus). A. aquaticus did not serve as an optimised habitat that increased survival of indicators and pathogens, since A. aquaticus associated E. coli, K. pneumoniae and C. jejuni were only measured as long as the bacteria were also present in the water and sediment.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in North-West  Italy.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. The aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic E. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. Between March 2008 and June 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for E. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-PCR. E. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. Data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic E. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering E. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. The datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). Bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 Salmonella spp., 8 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 Klebsiella oxytoca, 11 Citrobacter freundii, 5 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 Serratia spp., 7 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Shigella spp., 2 Campylobacter spp. Rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. It was found in 35 samples (21.88% of the overall collected samples), while Adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). Rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. Data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic E. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have potential clinical implications. ABBREVIATIONS: CDEC, detaching E. coli; DAEC, diffusely adherent E. coli; EAggEC, enteroaggregative E. coli; EHEC, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli; EIEC, enteroinvasive E. coli; EPEC, enteropathogenic E. coli; ETEC, enterotoxigenic E. coli.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in patients with travellers' diarrhoea.
AB  - The identification of patients carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria is important, since these patients are at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical therapy if they become infected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ESBL-producing bacteria in patients with travellers' diarrhoea. Patients with travellers' diarrhoea (N = 242) having delivered stool samples for the diagnosis of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia or Campylobacter, were also examined for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The overall prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL-producing bacteria was 24% (58/242). Of the patients who had travelled in Europe, 3% (2/63) were found to be ESBL carriers in comparison to 36% (50/138) of those who had travelled outside Europe. ESBL-producing E. coli was especially common among patients returning from India (11/14), Egypt (19/38; 50%) and Thailand (8/38; 22%). In total, 90% of the genes of the ESBL-positive samples were of CTX-M type. The CTX-M-1 group dominated, followed by the CTX-M-9 group. The repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprint pattern showed that there was no similarity between the ESBL strains found. Patients who have travelled outside Europe are at high risk of being colonized with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and, if infected, are also at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents--special reference to bacteria isolated between April 2007 and March 2008].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2007 to March 2008 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 707 strains including 24 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 181 (79.0%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and ninety-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 288 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from postoperative infections aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp., and Staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. from postoperative infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae, E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Parvimonas micra was the highest from primary infections, followed by Streptococcus constellatus and Gemella morbillorum, and from postoperative infections, Anaerococcus prevotii was most predominantly isolated. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of both Bacteroides fragilis and Bilophila wadsworthia were the highest from primary infections, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and Campylobacter gracilis, and from postoperative infections, B. thetaiotaomicron was most predominately isolated, followed by B. fragilis, Bacteroides caccae and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa. There were nine strains of coagulase-negative Staphylococci which show higher MIC against teicoplanin more than 4 gg/mL, but all of them had good susceptibilities against various anti-MRSA antibiotics. We should carefully follow up B. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also Bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Comparison of the EntericBio multiplex PCR system with routine culture for detection of bacterial enteric pathogens.
AB  - The EntericBio system uses a multiplex PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of Campylobacter spp., Salmonella enterica, Shigella spp., and Escherichia coli O157 from feces. It combines overnight broth enrichment with PCR amplification and detection by hybridization. An evaluation of this system was conducted by comparing the results obtained with the system with those obtained by routine culture, supplemented with alternative PCR detection methods. In a study of 773 samples, routine culture and the EntericBio system yielded 94.6 and 92.4% negative results, respectively. Forty-two samples had positive results by culture, and all of these were positive with the EntericBio system. This system detected an additional 17 positive samples (Campylobacter spp., n = 12; Shigella spp., n = 1; E. coli O157, n = 4), but the results for 5 samples (Campylobacter spp., n = 2; Shigella spp., n = 1; E. coli O157, n = 2) could not be confirmed. The target for Shigella spp. detected by the EntericBio system is the ipaH gene, and the molecular indication of the presence of Shigella spp. was investigated by sequence analysis, which confirmed that the ipaH gene was present in a Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from the patient. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 99.3%, 91.5%, and 100%, respectively. Turnaround times were significantly reduced with the EntericBio system, and a result was available between 24 and 32 h after receipt of the sample in the laboratory. In addition, the amount of laboratory waste was significantly reduced by use of this system. In summary, the EntericBio system proved convenient to use, more sensitive than the conventional culture used in this study, and highly specific; and it generated results significantly faster than routine culture for the pathogens tested.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - [Aetiology and antibiotic sensitivity of the most frequent outpatient infections].
AB  - The diffusion of the outlines of antibiotic sensitivity is a practice that is recommended for improving the prescription of antibiotics and for controlling the appearance and spread of resistances. During the years 2003 and 2004, data was gathered on the sensitivity to antibiotics of the main bacteria isolated in outpatient urine cultures, coprocultures, faringoamygdal and otic smears in the Pamplona health area, which attends to a population of approximately 400,000 inhabitants. Of the 9,495 uropathogens isolated, 90% were sensitive to amoxicillin-clavulanate, 96.4% to 2nd generation cephalosporins, 95.3% to phosphomycin and 97.7% to nitrofurantoin. One point eight percent (1.8%) of the strains of Escherichia coli isolated in urine were producers of extended spectrum b-lactamases, while 0.5% of the urinary isolations of Klebsiella pneumoniae were producers of this type of b-lactamases. Ninety-six point five percent of the 797 isolations of Salmonella serotipo Enteritidis were sensitive to cotrimoxazol, and 97.5% of the 1,057 isolations of Campylobacter jejuni were sensitive to eritromycine. Of the 319 bacteria isolated in otitis media, 96.5% were sensitive to amoxyline. The Gram negative bacillae producers of otitis externa showed a sensitivity above 90% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin and polimixin B. Twenty-nine point seven percent of the isolations of Streptococcus pyogenes were resistant to eritromycine. Fourteen point three percent and 17.4% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolated in the years 2003 and 2004 respectively were resistant to methicillin. Knowledge of the map of antibiotic sensitivity of the microorganisms in circulation in each geographical area is information that is necessary for the empirical choice of antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  - 'Enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. Traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain Salmonella serotypes, notably: Salmonella typhi, a Gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. In addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter Cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia alcalifaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens, Francisella sp. and Yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of Citrobacter to be reported presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in Thailand.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - The EmulSiv filter removes microbial contamination from propofol but is not a substitute for aseptic technique.
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the ability of the EmulSiv filter (EF) to remove extrinsic microbial contaminants from propofol. METHODS: Aliquots of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Candida albicans (C. albicans), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), Moraxella osloensis (M. osloensis), Enterobacter agglomerans (E. agglomerans), Escherichia coli (E. coli), Serratia marcescens (S. marcescens), Moraxella catarrhalis (M. catarrhalis), Haemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) and Campylobacter jejuni (C. jejuni) were inoculated into vials containing 20 mL of sterile propofol. The unfiltered inoculated propofol solutions served as controls. Ten millilitres and 20 mL samples of the inoculated propofol were filtered through the EF. All solutions were then subplated onto three culture plates using a precision 1 micro L calibrated platinum loop and incubated. The number of colony forming units (CFU) were counted. Data were analyzed using a one-sample t test, and a P value of less than 0.05 was selected as the level of statistical significance. RESULTS: The EF was able to completely remove CFU of S. aureus, C. albicans, K. pneumoniae, M. osloensis, E. agglomerans, E. coli, S. marcescens, and M. catarrhalis (P < 0.05). A small number of H. influenzae CFU were able to evade filtration in both the 10 mL and 20 mL samples. C. jejuni CFU were able to evade filtration in only the 10 mL sample. CONCLUSIONS: The EF removes the majority of microbial contaminates from propofol with the exception of H. influenzae and C. jejuni. Although the EF is capable of removing most of the microbial contamination produced by H. influenzae and C. jejuni, a few CFU are capable of evading filtration. Consequently, even the use of a filter capable of removing microbial contaminants is not a substitute for meticulous aseptic technique and prompt administration when propofol is used.
TI  - Bacterial profile of dairy products sold in Chandigarh.
AB  - Gastrointestinal infections are known to occur due to bacterial contamination of  dairy products. A total of 141 dairy products viz. kulfi, ice cream and softy samples were investigated bacteriologically. Staphylococcus was the predominant organism isolated followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Campylobacter. Two of the samples also yielded Yersinia. The total bacterial counts obtained ranged from 2 x 10(1) to 5.2 x 10(11) colony forming units per ml (CFU/ml) for kulfi, 4 x 10(1) to 9 x 10(9) CFU/ml for ice cream and 2 x 10(1) to 2 x 10(10) CFU/ml for softy samples. The high degree of bacterial contamination seen indicates poor hygienic conditions and faults in manufacturing/handling of dairy products during and after processing and production.
TI  - Infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and healthy control subjects. METHODS: Sixty four patients with previous AAU and 64 sex and age matched controls were studied. Serum antibodies to Salmonellae, Yersiniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Borrelia burgdorferi were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence test. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), separated by density gradient centrifugation, were studied for Salmonella and Yersinia antigens by means of an immunofluorescence test, and for C pneumoniae DNA with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Neither prevalence nor levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and control subjects, or between subgroups of patients created on the basis of clinical characteristics. In logistic regression analysis, the high number of recurrences (>10) of AAU was independently related to the presence of single or multiple bacterial antibodies (p=0.04). None of the PBMC samples of the patients were positive for Yersinia or Salmonella antigens. C pneumoniae PCR was positive in a patient who was negative for C pneumoniae antibodies. CONCLUSION: Although neither the prevalence nor the levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and the controls, current data suggest that the presence of single or multiple antibodies in patients with many recurrences of AAU compared with patients with none or few recurrences may be a sign of repeated infections, antigen persistence, or raised innate immune responsiveness.
TI  - Bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins for alleviation of nitrosative stress  in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Escherichia coli MG1655 cells expressing novel bacterial hemoglobin and flavohemoglobin genes from a medium-copy-number plasmid were grown in shake flask cultures under nitrosative and oxidative stress. E. coli cells expressing these proteins display enhanced resistance against the NO(.) releaser sodium nitroprusside (SNP) relative to that of the control strain bearing the parental plasmid. Expression of bacterial hemoglobins originating from Campylobacter jejuni (CHb) and Vitreoscilla sp. (VHb) conferred resistance on SNP-challenged cells. In addition, it has been shown that NO(.) detoxification is also a common feature of flavohemoglobins originating from different taxonomic groups and can be transferred to a heterologous host. These observations have been confirmed in a specific in vitro NO(.) consumption assay. Protein extracts isolated from E. coli strains overexpressing flavohemoglobins consumed authentic NO(.) more readily than protein extracts from the wild-type strain. Oxidative challenge to the cells evoked nonuniform responses from the various cell cultures. Improved oxidative-stress-sustaining properties had also been observed when the flavohemoglobins from E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were expressed in E. coli.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - [Sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics (Zurich, 2000)].
AB  - This paper describes the frequency of susceptibility of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria against antibacterial agents. Data are based on all susceptibility tests performed at the Department of Medical Microbiology of the University of Zurich in 2000. The evaluation of the results from 1987 to 2000 shows that susceptibilities against the antimicrobial agents tested have not markedly changed with the following exceptions: 7% of Staphylococcus aureus are resistant against methicillin, 8% of pneumococci have a reduced susceptibility to penicillin, 1% is resistant to penicillin, and 10% are resistant to macrolides. 9% of group A streptococci are resistant to macrolides. Quinolone resistance is markedly high in the medical practice with 10% of E. coli strains and 32% of Campylobacter sp. Strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli producing extended spectrum betalactamases are isolated occasionally. Of all strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from clinical specimens in 2000, 4% were multi-drug resistant. The tables may be a help for the physician in his decision for a "calculated chemotherapy" of bacterial infections.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Novel hemoglobins to enhance microaerobic growth and substrate utilization in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Limited oxygen availability is a prevalent problem in microbial biotechnology. Recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the hemoglobin from Vitreoscilla (VHb) or the flavohemoglobin from Ralstonia eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus) (FHP) demonstrate significantly increased cell growth and productivity under microaerobic conditions. We identify novel bacterial hemoglobin-like proteins and examine if these novel bacterial hemoglobins can elicit positive effects similar to VHb and FHP and if these hemoglobins alleviate oxygen limitation under microaerobic conditions when expressed in E. coli. Several finished and unfinished bacterial genomes were screened using R. eutropha FHP as a query sequence for genes (hmp) encoding hemoglobin-like proteins. Novel hmp genes were identified in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Campylobacter jejuni. Previously characterized hmp genes from E. coli and Bacillus subtilis and the novel hmp genes from P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, C. jejuni, K. pneumoniae, and D. radiodurans were PCR amplified and introduced into a plasmid for expression in E. coli. Biochemically active hemoproteins were expressed in all constructs, as judged by the ability to abduct carbon monoxide. Growth behavior and byproduct formation of E. coli K-12 MG1655 cells expressing various hemoglobins were analyzed in microaerobic fed-batch cultivations and compared to plasmid-bearing control and to E. coli cells expressing VHb. The clones expressing hemoglobins from E. coli, D. radiodurans, P.aeruginosa, and S. typhi reached approximately 10%, 27%, 23%, and 36% higher final optical density values, respectively, relative to the plasmid bearing E. coli control (A(600) 5.5). E. coli cells expressing hemoproteins from P. aeruginosa, S. typhi, and D. radiodurans grew to similar final cell densities as did the strain expressing VHb (A(600) 7.5), although none of the novel constructs was able to outgrow the VHb-expressing E. coli strain. Additionally, increased yield of biomass on glucose was measured for all recombinant strains, and an approximately 2-fold yield enhancement was obtained with D. radiodurans hemoprotein-expressing E. coli relative to the E. coli control carrying the parental plasmid without any hemoglobin gene.
TI  - Enterobacterial antibodies in Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of microbial infection in rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Sera from 39 Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 52 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 51 healthy subjects (HS) were examined for IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium and enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (capsular serotypes 31 and 43), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In patients with RA, IgA class antibodies against all bacterial strains used as the antigen were increased when compared to healthy controls. In patients with AS, significantly elevated IgA levels were observed against Campylobacter and Klebsiella K43. IgM class antibodies were less frequently elevated in RA and in AS than IgA class antibodies. In RA patients, IgG antibodies against Klebsiella K43 and Proteus were significantly increased. No differences were observed in IgG class antibodies between AS patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Increases in serum bacterial antibodies in RA and AS suggest that in both diseases stimulation of the intestinal immune system by enterobacteria may have a role. However, the question whether this phenomenon is due to increased intestinal permeability and/or represents cross reactions between different enterobacteria remains open.
TI  - Bacterial flavohaemoglobins: a consensus sequence and identification of a discrete enterobacterial group and of further bacterial globins.
AB  - The amino acid sequences of haemoglobin-like proteins from the bacteria Alcaligenes eutrophus, Bacillus subtilis, Erwinia chrysanthemi, Escherichia coli, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vitreoscilla sp. and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were studied. Phylogenies based on distance and parsimony analysis showed that the eubacterial group can be easily distinguished from the other haemoglobin-like proteins. The construction of a consensus bacterial flavohaemoglobin based on the alignment of six bacterial and one yeast globins allowed the design of consensus primers to search for haemoglobin-like genes in other bacteria. PCR products of the expected size were found in Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Rhizobium leguminosarum, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Nested polymerase chain reaction strategy simultaneously targeting DNA sequences  of multiple bacterial species in inflammatory joint diseases. I. Screening of synovial fluid samples of patients with spondyloarthropathies and other arthritides.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacteria play a crucial pathogenetic role in Lyme arthritis (LA), reactive arthritis (ReA), other forms of spondyloarthropathy (SpA), and possibly in undifferentiated oligoarthritis (uOligo). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has been applied to detect bacterial DNA of individual microbes in synovial fluid (SF) of patients with arthritides. We screened for DNA sequences of 8 bacterial species simultaneously in SF of patients with inflammatory joint disease. METHODS: We examined 104 SF samples of 96 patients with ReA (n = 13), undifferentiated SpA (uSpA, n = 10), uOligo (n = 50), juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA, n = 13), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 10). A nested PCR approach was developed to detect DNA sequences of 8 bacteria: Chlamydia trachomatis, C. pneumoniae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella flexneri, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Borrelia burgdorferi. The detection limit was determined at 10 bacterial/sample. Serology and lymphocyte proliferation assay were done in parallel in most patients. RESULTS: In 12 cases bacterial DNA of B. burgdorferi (n = 7), C. trachomatis (n = 2), C. jejuni (n = 2), and C. pneumoniae (n = 1) was detected in patients with uOligo (n = 9) and JCA (n = 3), while no evidence of bacterial DNA was found in patients with ReA, uSpA, and RA. Shigella flexneri DNA was detected in 4 cases, but the significance of this finding remains uncertain due to the high sequence homology of this species with Escherichia coli. DNA of Y. enterocolitica, S. enteritidis, or K. pneumoniae was not found. A positive serologic response was found in 7/9 PCR positive patients. In 11/96 cases antibodies to 2 or more bacteria were found in parallel (11.5%). Antigen specific lymphocyte proliferation was observed in 5/9 PCR positive patients. CONCLUSION: Bacterial DNA was detected in peripheral joint of patients with uOligo and JCA, but not in ReA, uSpA, or RA in this study. The detection of bacterial DNA in synovial material by PCR technology gives useful diagnostic information, especially when antibodies against several microbes are present or antibodies are not detectable. Failure to detect bacterial DNA in patients with ReA and uSpA with longstanding disease suggests that in later stages autoimmune mechanisms may operate.
TI  - Trends in bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones.
AB  - The emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in virtually all species of bacteria was recognized soon after the introduction of these compounds for clinical use more than 10 years ago. Various resistance mechanisms, often interdependent, may explain different levels of resistance. Epidemiological factors, local antibiotic policies, patients' characteristics, origin of the strains, and geographic location are among the factors contributing to highly variable resistance rates. During the last several years, resistance to fluoroquinolones has remained very high among methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains and in intensive care unit patients, and it has increased among nosocomial isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. More worrisome are recent reports of an overall increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones among bacteria responsible for community-acquired infections, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Campylobacter species and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Inhibition of Campylobacter jejuni colonization in chicks by defined competitive  exclusion bacteria.
AB  - Campylobacter enteritis in humans has been linked to consumption of chicken. Reducing Campylobacter jejuni colonization in chickens can potentially reduce Campylobacter infections in humans. In this study, the reduction of C. jejuni colonization in chicks by oral administration of defined competitive exclusion (CE) cultures, 2.5% dietary carbohydrates, or CE cultures and carbohydrates was examined. Prevention, elimination, or direct challenge of Campylobacter infection was simulated by administering treatments before, after, or at the same time as that of the Campylobacter inoculation. Additionally, the effect of maintaining high levels of protective bacteria was evaluated by administering CE cultures on days 1 and 4 (booster treatment). All treatments reduced C. jejuni colonization. Protection by aerobically grown CE cultures was not statistically different from that by anaerobically grown CE cultures. A combination of Citrobacter diversus 22, Klebsiella pneumoniae 23, and Escherichia coli 25 (CE 3) was the most effective CE treatment. Maintaining high numbers of CE isolates by administering CE boosters did not increase protection. The greatest reduction of Campylobacter colonization was observed in schemes to prevent or eliminate C. jejuni infection. C. jejuni was not detected in the ceca of birds receiving the prevention treatment, CE 3 with mannose, representing a 62% reduction in the colonization rate. The protection factor (PF), a value combining the colonization rate and the level of infection, for CE 3 with mannose was high (> 13.2). Fructo-oligosaccharides alone strongly prevented Campylobacter colonization. Only 8% of the chicks in this group were colonized, with a PF of > 14.3.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacterial antibodies in HLA-B27+ healthy individuals.
AB  
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AM-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  - AM-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. AM-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecalis; its MICs for 90% of strains tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. The activity of AM-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against Xanthomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Campylobacter jejuni, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. At a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, AM-1155 inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Development of resistance to AM-1155 in S. aureus and S. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. In the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, AM-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. The efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of AM-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. Against experimental pneumonia with Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa, AM-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. AM-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa. These results suggest that AM-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.
TI  - Reduction of Campylobacter jejuni colonization of chicks by cecum-colonizing bacteria producing anti-C. jejuni metabolites.
AB  - Cecum-colonizing bacteria were isolated from Campylobacter jejuni-free White Leghorn (Gallus domesticus) laying hens and screened for the ability to produce anti-C. jejuni metabolites. Nine isolates were obtained that possessed this characteristic. The peroral administration of the nine isolates as a mixture (ca. 10(9) per chick) to 1-day-old chicks was followed 1 week later by peroral inoculation of Campylobacter jejuni (ca. 10(9) per chick) to determine if the cecal isolates could protect chicks from colonization by campylobacters. The nine-strain mixture of cecal bacteria provided from 41 to 85% protection from C. jejuni colonization. The protective bacteria were reduced to a mixture of three strains on the basis of their ability to utilize mucin as a sole substrate for growth. These strains included Klebsiella pneumoniae 23, Citrobacter diversus 22, and Escherichia coli (O13:H-) 25. Four feeding trials with this three-strain mixture provided from 43 to 100% (average, 78%) protection from C. jejuni colonization. The dominant cecal bacterium of chicks treated with the three-strain mixture was consistently E. coli O13:H-. Similarly, three trials with only E. coli 25 used as the protective bacterium resulted in 49 to 72% (average, 59%) protection from C. jejuni colonization, with E. coli O13:H- being the dominant cecal bacterium in all cases. Although not completely effective, E. coli 25 substantially reduced the incidence of C. jejuni colonization of chicks. For all trials, fewer C. jejuni were present in the ceca of colonized chicks receiving the protective bacteria before exposure to C. jejuni than in chicks receiving only C. jejuni.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Multicausal infectious respiratory tract disease of young fattening turkeys].
AB  - The outbreak of the disease occurred in a large multiple-age farm with about 50,000 meat turkeys, where groups of 6-8000 one-day-old birds were stalled up every 14 days. All the turkey poults housed were affected mostly in the 1.-3. week of the life. The respiratory disease spread rapidly within the flocks and were characterised clinically by inclination of huddle, ruffled feathers, anorexia, stunted growth, swelling of the infraorbital sinus and nasal discharge. The clinical apparent disease lasted 3 to 4 weeks on the average in the affected flocks and were associated with a mortality from 7-20 percent. The main pathoanatomical lesions were catarrhal-fibrinopurulent rhinitis, sinusitis, tracheitis, bronchopneumonia and air sacculitis as well as atrophy of the thymus. Fibrinous adhesive peri- and epicarditis, perihepatitis, miliary necrotic foci in the liver and diarrhea have been found less frequently. The results of cultural and serological examinations of moribund and dead turkey poults of 6 different flocks indicate that Bordetella avium and Chlamydia psittaci are the primary inciting agents of the respiratory disease. However, the following severe course of the disease were mainly caused by concurrent infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens. In some cases coccidiosis with lesions in ceca were additionally diagnosed. Campylobacter jejuni could be always isolated culturally from the liquid cecal content of diseased birds.
TI  - Alcohol dehydrogenase mediated acetaldehyde production by Helicobacter pylori--a  possible mechanism behind gastric injury.
AB  - Two standard Helicobacter pylori strains showed significant cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase activity and produced considerable amounts of acetaldehyde when incubated with an ethanol containing solution in vitro. The alcohol dehydrogenase activity of the Helicobacter pylori strains was almost as high as that found in Klebsiella pneumoniae and far greater than that in Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni. The amount of acetaldehyde produced by cytosol prepared from Helicobacter pylori exceeded that by any of the other bacteria studied. The bacterial production of acetaldehyde--a highly toxic and reactive substance--could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of Helicobacter pylori associated gastric injury and increased risk of gastric cancer.
TI  - [Preparation and use of fish fillet infusion as a basic medium for culturing bacteria].
AB  - The authors present the first results on the utilization of fish infusion (IFP) as a basic medium for the cultivation of bacteria. The infusion was obtained from a common marine fish, corvina (Micropogonias furnieri) according to the technique used in the preparation of beef infusion broth. Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis were cultured in liquid and solid media prepared with IFP as well as in recommended standard media. Solid media used for cultivation of S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis and C. jejuni were supplemented with 5% of defibrinated sheep blood and for the latter, substances recommended to increase aerotolerance were included in solid and liquid media. All of these strains grew on the media prepared with IFP except S. pneumoniae when cultured in IFP diluted 1:2 with a sodium chloride solution. Only S. pyogenes produced colonies smaller than those of the standard medium. No more differences were detect in the observation of colony morphology. The growth of E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and B. subtilis was measured in liquid media after 8 hours. In solid media, the growth index was expressed by dividing the number of colonies produced in IFP-agar and Nutriente Agar by the number of colonies on Trypticase soy agar plates. Some differences were observed in colonial size and morphology when compared with those generated in standard media. The average value obtained from the analyses of total proteins by biuret reaction in twelve batches of IFP was 5.03 mg/ml. The experiments showed that culture media prepared with IFP supported the growth of bacterial strains used in this work. It suggests that fish infusion has promising conditions of being an alternative substrate for cultural purposes.
TI  - Bacterial antibodies in ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Antibodies to Salmonellae, Yersiniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Chlamydia trachomatis were measured by ELISA in the sera of 99 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Increased prevalence of IgA and IgG class antibodies against K. pneumoniae and of IgA class against E. coli was observed in ankylosing spondylitis. No clear correlation between the disease activity and occurrence of antibodies was revealed. The results are in line with the previously published findings suggesting that K. pneumoniae may have a role in the aetiopathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis.
TI  - Production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11.
AB  - A monoclonal antibody (MAb 4E8C12) specific for Escherichia coli O157:H7 and O26:H11 was produced by immunizing BALB/c mice with a rough strain of E. coli O157:H7. The antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of E. coli O157:H7. No cross-reactivity was observed with strains of Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella dysenteriae, Proteus spp., Escherichia hermanii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter cloacae, Hafnia alvei, Aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of E. coli other than serotype O157:H7 (including strains of serotype O157 but not H7). The E. coli strains (all of serotype O26:H11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of E. coli O157:H7. MAb 4E8C12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin G2a and has a kappa light chain. Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of E. coli of different serotypes followed by Western immunoblot analysis revealed that MAb 4E8C12 reacted specifically with two proteins of EHEC strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. These proteins appeared to be markers specific for EHEC strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11. This MAb, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of EHEC isolates in clinical and food specimens.
TI  - Antibiotic sensitivity pattern; experience at University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia.
AB  - Results of sensitivity testing were discussed based on examination of 5192 isolates of the various bacteria isolated from clinical specimens from King Khalid University Hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae were sensitive to penicillin and erythromycin. The sensitivity pattern of Staphylococcus aureus was also predictable as they were fairly sensitive to both methicillin (98%) and erythromycin (96%). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (27%) showed a high level of resistance to penicillin. The resistance of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin and chloramphenicol was low. Brucella species was sensitive to tetracycline and rifampicin; resistance to streptomycin and cotrimoxazole was minimal being 1% and 6% respectively. The resistance of E. coli, Klebsiella species and Proteus species to second and third generation cephalosporins and amikacin was fairly low ranging from 1.3% to 3%. The gentamicin resistance for these organisms was also within the acceptable range (3%-10%). Gentamicin and amikacin resistance for Pseudomonas aeruginosa was low (2-8%). Salmonella typhi was sensitive to ampicillin, cotrimoxazole, and chloramphenicol. Salmonella enteritidis, Shigella species, and enteropathogenic E. coli were highly resistant to various antibiotics. Campylobacter jejuni was sensitive to gentamicin but 6% of isolates were resistant to erythromycin. Ninety six percent of Gram-negative rods except P. aeruginosa isolated from urine of patients having urinary tract infections were sensitive to amoxycillin-clavulanic acid. In addition, P. aeruginosa showed fairly low resistance to norfloxacin which is given orally to treat cystitis caused by this organism.
TI  - [Value of microbiologic studies for diagnosis of post-enteritis reactive arthritis].
AB  - Reactive arthritis may develop within a period of some days until upto 3 weeks after infections with Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Campylobacter jejuni/coli, Shigella and Salmonella. Intestinal infections with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile, Cryptosporidium, Strongyloides stercoralis, Taenia saginata and Schistosoma mansoni are, in some cases, considered to be responsible for reactive arthritis. Detection of pathogenic bacteria in feces is generally most successful in the early stage of the infection. A large spectrum of special tests is required in order to detect all the causative agents and to ensure reliable results. It is therefore necessary that the laboratory is provided with information about the diagnostic object and the tentative diagnosis. The detection of serum antibodies to Y. enterocolitica, Y. pseudotuberculosis, C. jejuni/coli, and Schistosoma may suggest connections between infection and reactive arthritis.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the field of pediatrics].
AB  - Bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (NFLX) were carried out in the field of pediatrics, and the results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. The MICs of NFLX against clinically isolated organisms were determined to compare with MICs of nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, cefaclor, erythromycin and fosfomycin. NFLX had low MICs against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and, particularly, showed higher antimicrobial activity to Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae and Campylobacter jejuni than any other drugs tested. 2. Seventeen pediatric patients (11 cases of enteritis, 4 cases of urinary tract infections, 1 case of tonsillitis and 1 case of pyoderma) were treated orally with NFLX in daily doses ranging from 3.1 to 16.7 mg/kg t.i.d. for 6-14 days. Rates of clinical effectiveness and bacterial elimination were 94.1% and 58.8%, respectively. 3. None of the treated children showed clinical symptoms indicating the occurrence of side effects nor abnormal laboratory findings except 1 patient with eosinophilia. These results indicate the usefulness of NFLX in the treatment of bacterial infections in the pediatric field.
TI  - Detection of antibodies to Helicobacter pylori cell surface antigens.
AB  - Serum IgG antibodies of Helicobacter pylori were detected in single-dilution ELISA using glycine extracted material. Among 148 endoscopy patients 59% displayed antibodies; as expected, a higher occurrence (90%) was found in patients with positive gastric culture for H. pylori than in culture negative patients (37%). Among 68 blood donors the frequency of H. pylori antibodies was 28%. In 73 children less than 15 years of age examined for unrelated disorders the occurrence was 4%. By immunoblotting using the same extract, 3 prominent bands, 29K, 54K and 60K and several weak bands were identified. These were formed by 57%, 92%, and 65%, respectively, of the ELISA positive patient sera. Comparing culture positive and negative patients, the 3 bands occurred more often among the culture positive subjects though between 18 and 61% of the sera from culture negative patients gave either of the bands. When comparing the glycine extracts of 4 different H. pylori strains with separate haemagglutinating patterns no differences in the position of the major bands emerged. By absorption experiments no immunological cross-reactivity with components of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni or C. fetus was found. Thus, the glycine extract seemed specific for the detection of antibodies to H. pylori.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - Etiology of acute childhood diarrhoea in Calcutta.
AB  - Of the 152 cases of acute diarrhoea, 124 (81.5%) revealed potential pathogens. Altogether 27 (21.2%) out of 127 strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter, Proteus and Acinetobacter produced enterotoxin. Single pathogenic bacteria (40 cases 26.3%), parasite (6; 6%), rota virus (6; 6%), toxigenic bacteria (19; 12.5%) and mixed agents (37; 24.24.3%) were recorded in 108 cases (71.0%). Another 14 (9.2%) cases exclusively revealed moderate to heavy growth of suspected enteric pathogens like K. pneumoniae, Proteus, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, anaerogenic E. coli and Citrobacter and 2 (1.3%) had high counts of T'. hominis. Of the known pathogens, the preponderance of A. hydrophila (24.4%), rota virus (15.7%) and Aeromonas hydrophila (14.0%) in 1-4 y, Vibrio cholerae (45.6%) and Trichuris trichiura (13.0%) in 4-14 y age group is highlighted. Other pathogenic bacteria were non-01 V. cholerae (3.2%), V. parahaemolyticus (2.6%), V. fluvialis (0.6), Plesiomonas shigelloides (3.9%), Salmonella (2.6%), Shigella (1.9%), EPEC (1.9%), EEC (5.2%) and Campylobacter jejuni (3.9%) and the parasites were Entamoeba histolytica (2.6%) and Giardia intestinalis (2.6). Comparative study of age matched controls with those of diarrhoea suggested the pathogenic role of E. histolytica and T. hominis.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of MT-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. The MICs of MT-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of Campylobacter jejuni, Clostridium difficile, and Bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the MICs of MT-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. In contrast, the bactericidal activity of MT-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive Proteus species, Serratia marcescens, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas cepacia, and Clostridium perfringens. In the treatment of systemic infections in mice, MT-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. It was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the MBCs than with the MICs. As the serum levels of MT-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of MT-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
TI  - Seroepidemiological studies with Campylobacter fetus.
AB  - 324 sera from unselected male and 581 sera from female patients as well as 268 sera from prostitutes were studied for antibodies against Campylobacter fetus using the complement fixation test. Antigen was Campylobacter fetus subspecies intestinalis. 3.9% of the sera showed low but relevant antibody titers. Statistically significant differences don't exist between the three population investigated. Serological cross reactions could not be observed using Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella flexneri, Escherichia coli O119 and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Antigenic relationship however was observed with the subspecies jejuni and fetus.
TI  - Erythromycin. New indications and toxicities.
AB  - Although erythromycin was introduced into clinical medicine more than 28 years ago, the indications for its use continue to expand. This antibiotic has emerged as appropriate therapy for Legionnaires' disease, chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus species, enteritis and colitis produced by Campylobacter fetus, and soft tissue and pleuropulmonary anaerobic infections in which Bacteroides fragilis plays no role. In combination with an aminoglycoside, erythromycin has proven to be effective for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colon surgery. Additional therapeutic indications continue to be explored. The renewed interest in erythromycin has resulted in a closer examination of its potential for toxicity. New untoward events attributed to erythromycin administration have been described. This antibiotic has produced both reversible hearing loss and pseudomembranous colitis. Erythromycin also possesses the ability to inhibit the degradation of theophylline.
