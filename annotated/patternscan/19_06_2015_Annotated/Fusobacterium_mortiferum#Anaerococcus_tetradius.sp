TI  == in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, bacitracin, and four other antimicrobials against intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == by using an agar dilution method, the in vitro activities of ramoplanin, teicoplanin, vancomycin, linezolid, and five other agents were determined against 300 gram-positive and 54 gram-negative strains of intestinal anaerobes. ramoplanin was active at <or=2 microg/ml against 287 of 300 (95.7%) gram-positive organisms, including 18 strains of clostridium difficile for which mics of ramoplanin were 0.25 to 0.5 microg/ml; for 3 of these, linezolid mics were 8 to 16 micro g/ml. nineteen clostridium innocuum strains for which the vancomycin mic at which 90% of strains were inhibited was 16 microg/ml were susceptible to ramoplanin at 0.06 to 0.25 microg/ml and to teicoplanin at 0.125 to 1.0 microg/ml. all strains of eubacterium, actinomyces, propionibacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. were inhibited by <or=0.25 microg of ramoplanin per ml and <or=1 microg of vancomycin per ml. ramoplanin was also active at <or=4 microg/ml against 15 of 22 of the prevotella and porphyromonas strains tested, but ramoplanin mics for all 31 strains of the bacteroides fragilis group, the fusobacterium mortiferum-fusobacterium varium group, and veillonella spp. were >or=256 microg/ml. ramoplanin displays excellent activity against c. difficile and other gram-positive enteric anaerobes, including vancomycin-resistant strains; however, it has poor activity against most gram-negative anaerobes and thus potentially has a lesser effect on the ecological balance of normal fecal flora.

TI  == activities of garenoxacin (bms-284756) and other agents against anaerobic clinical isolates.
AB  == a total of 590 clinical isolates consisting of 33 species of both gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes were collected from nine centers in the chicago area  in 1998-1999. the largest number of isolates (330 isolates, 56%) belonged to the  bacteroides group. isolates were tested by agar dilution against garenoxacin (bms-284756, t-3811 me), trovafloxacin, moxifloxacin, clindamycin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and cefoxitin. all but one species (2% of bacteroides vulgatus isolates) were fully susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam and imipenem. a number of species were resistant to clindamycin. among the fluoroquinolones, garenoxacin and trovafloxacin had an mic at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited of <4 micro g/ml for all but two species (fusobacterium mortiferum/varium and peptostreptococcus anaerobius).

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of abt-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of abt-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for actinomyces spp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus spp., propionibacterium spp., and porphyromonas spp. the mic(50)s and mic(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for eubacterium spp., lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and clostridium ramosum. the mic(90) for bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides ureolyticus, and campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for prevotella bivia and other prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. the mic(90) for fusobacterium nucleatum was 8  microg/ml, and that for fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. the mic(90)s for the bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for b. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus, bacteroides distasonis, and bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. telithromycin mics for the b. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than abt-773 mics. for all strains, abt-773  was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.

TI  == synergic activity, for anaerobes, of trovafloxacin with clindamycin or metronidazole: chequerboard and time-kill methods.
AB  == chequerboard titrations were used to test the activity of trovafloxacin, alone and in combination with clindamycin or metronidazole, against 156 gram-positive or gram-negative anaerobes, including 47 bacteroides fragilis group, 36 prevotella spp., 26 fusobacteria, 21 peptostreptococci and 26 clostridia. mic50/mic90 values (mg/l) of each drug alone against all 156 strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.5/1; clindamycin, 0.25/2; metronidazole, 1/2. synergy (fic indices </= 0.5) was seen in two strains with trovafloxacin plus clindamycin, and seven with trovafloxacin plus metronidazole. all other combinations were additive (fic indices >0. 5-2.0); no antagonism (fic indices >4.0) was seen. in addition,  synergy was tested by time-kill methodology for each of the above combinations against 12 gram-positive or gram-negative strains. results indicated that synergy (defined as a >/= 2 log(10) decrease in cfu/ml at 48 h compared with the more active drug alone) was found between trovafloxacin at or below the mic and both clindamycin and metronidazole at or below the mic in one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium varium, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus and clostridium bifermentans. synergy between trovafloxacin (</=mic) and metronidazole alone was  seen in one strain each of bacteroides distasonis, prevotella bivia, fusobacterium mortiferum, p. asaccharolyticus and c. bifermentans. in many cases  of synergy, including those at the trovafloxacin mic, regrowth after 48 h, which  was commonly seen with trovafloxacin alone, was inhibited, and 99.9% killing was  observed with the combination after 48 h, but not with trovafloxacin alone.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in  the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. subgingival paper point samples were  taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group a) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group b) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. there was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group a and group b in morphotypes of the different microflora. the predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: gemella, peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus, stomatococcus, streptococcus, actinomyces, eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, neisseria, veillonella, bacteroides, campylobacter, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, kingella, porphyromonas and prevotella species. there was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of kingella dentrificans isolated from group b sites. however, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (peptostreptococcus  prevotii and propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (eubacterium aerofaciens, fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium) was detected. these findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to  that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.

TI  == time-kill study of the activity of trovafloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam  against six anaerobes.
AB  == a time-kill method was developed to examine the killing kinetics of trovafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam against one strain each of bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium  mortiferum, peptostreptococcus magnus and clostridium perfringens. solutions and  suspensions were prepared inside an anaerobic glove box, using syringes and prereduced broth. bottles were then incubated outside the chamber and viability counts determined after incubation for 0, 6, 24 and 48 h in a shaking water bath, avoiding introduction of air. bacteriostatic/bactericidal concentrations (mg/l) after 48 h for the six strains were: trovafloxacin, 0.03-1/0.03-1; ciprofloxacin, 0.25-16/0.25-32; sparfloxacin, 0.06-2/0.06-8; metronidazole 1-64/1-64; cefoxitin, 0.125-16/0.125-32; piperacillin, 0.125-64/0.125-64; piperacillin/tazobactam, 0.06-2/0.125-8. bacteriostatic levels were within two dilutions of broth mics. by this time-kill method, trovafloxacin had the lowest bacteriostatic concentrations of all compounds tested.

TI  == in vitro activity of du-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of a new quinolone agent, du-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the national committee for clinical laboratory standards-approved wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of du-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin,  metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. du-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every  group of organisms. mics of du-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for bacteroides fragilis (57), other b. fragilis group species (84), bilophila wadsworthia (15), clostridium species (27) (including c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. ramosum), fusobacterium nucleatum (16), fusobacterium mortiferum-f. varium group species (10), peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and prevotella species (25).

TI  == the use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  == an anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. these included bacteroides spp (43%), peptococcus spp (26%),  peptostreptococcus spp (13%), veillonella spp (7%), fusobacterium spp (7%), clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of  the study period. miles and misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for f nucleatum, but no difference for b fragilis, b thetaiomicron, b uniformis, b bivius, b corrodens, f mortiferum, ps anaerobius, p prevotii or propionibacterium acnes. in almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. the anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. however, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.

TI  == biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-nitropyrene (1-np) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from salmonella typhimurium strain ta98 in the absence of s9 fraction in the salmonella-microsome test. it is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-np and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. we determined the 1-np nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. we found that the mutagenicity of 1-np mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. the product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-ap), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. the 1-np nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the  anaerobic bacteria, i.e., bacteroides fragilis, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, fusobacterium mortiferum, f. nucleatum, clostridium perfringens, c. sporogenes, bifidobacterium adolescentis, b. bifidum, eubacterium lentum, e. limosum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-np to 1-ap and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-np.

TI  == [antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  == antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, bacteroides and fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with  metronidazole. in addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against p. prevotii, b. fragilis ss. fragilis and f. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in gam broth containing  of 4 mic, 2 mic, 1 mic and 1/2 mic of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. all the strains of peptococcus and peptostreptococcus including p. anaerobius, p. saccharolyticus, p. prevotii and ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. a concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of bacteroides including b. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). to this concentration all strains of fusobacterium including f. varium (20 strains), f. mortiferum (2 strains) and other fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible.  on the contrary, propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml  or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. the antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium and fusobacterium. tinidazole was bactericidal against f. varium in a concentration of 2 mic till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on b. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. on the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against b. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against f. varium. against p. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding propionibacterium acnes and bifidobacterium adolescentis.

TI  == survival of anaerobic bacteria during transportation. 1. experimental investigations on the effect of evacuation of atmospheric air by flushing with carbon dioxide and nitrogen.
AB  == the effect of evacuation of atmospheric air during transportation on recovery of  anaerobic bacteria was investigated. evacuation of atmospheric air from glass tubes by flushing with pure carbon dioxide lowered the content of oxygen to about 0.4 per cent. three b. fragilis strains and one strain of fusobacterium mortiferum and of peptostreptococcus anaerobius were investigated. bacterial recovery was determined one hour and 24 hours after evacuation of atmospheric air by pure carbon dioxide and pure nitrogen, was compared to bacterial recovery from samples transported with free access to atmospheric air. evacuation by pure carbon dioxide significantly improved the recovery of one b. fragilis strain after 24 hours of transportation and significantly impaired the recovery of peptostreptococcus anaerobius after one hour of transportation, while evacuation  by pure nitrogen significantly improved the recovery of peptostreptococcus anaerobius after 24 hours of transportation. in all other cases, however, no statistically significant effect on bacterial recovery was found.

TI  == phosphatase activity of anaerobic organisms.
AB  == anaerobic organisms were tested for phosphatase activity in different ph ranges.  several groups of organisms displayed characteristic patterns. bacteroides fragilis, b. melaninogenicus, and b. ruminicola produced phosphatase with strongest activity at ph 8.6. fusobacterium mortiferum was the only species of this genus to show strong hydrolysis. the enzyme was active in both acid and alkaline ranges. the activity of gram-positive organisms was variable, the most active groups being clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus intermedius, p. micros, and peptococcus constellatus. the incorporation of phosphatase activity into the identification scheme of anaerobes seems feasible. there was a correlation of hydrolysis with several important pathogens.
