TI  == the culturome of the human nose habitats reveals individual bacterial fingerprint patterns.
AB  == the complex anatomy of the human nose might offer distinct microbial niches. microbiota composition may affect nose inflammatory diseases and staphylococcus aureus carriage. considering different nasal cavity locations, microbial colonization was analysed across individuals exhibiting chronic nasal inflammatory diseases (n = 18) and those without local inflammation signs (n = 16). samples were collected systematically during surgery and examined by an extensive culture-based approach and, for a subset, by 16s rrna gene community profiling. cultivation yielded 141 taxa with members of staphylococcus, corynebacterium and propionibacterium as most common isolates comprising the nasal core culturome together with finegoldia magna. staphylococcus aureus was most frequently found in association with staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, and the posterior vestibules were redefined as s. aureus' principle habitat. culturome analysis revealed host-specific bacterial 'fingerprints' irrespective of host-driven factors or intranasal sites. comparisons between cultivable and molecular fingerprints demonstrated that only  a small fraction of phylotypes (6.2%) was correlated. while the total number of different phylotypes was higher in the molecular dataset, the total number of identifications down to the species level was higher in the culturomic approach.  to determine host-specific microbiomes, the advantages of molecular approaches should be combined with the resolution and reliability of species identification  by culturomic analyses.

TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == identification of molecular mechanisms used by finegoldia magna to penetrate and  colonize human skin.
AB  == finegoldia magna is a gram-positive anaerobic commensal of the human skin microbiota, but also known to act as an opportunistic pathogen. two primary virulence factors of f. magna are the subtilisin-like extracellular serine protease sufa and the adhesive protein faf. this study examines the molecular mechanisms f. magna uses when colonizing or establishing an infection in the skin. faf was found to be essential in the initial adherence of f. magna to human skin biopsies. in the upper layers of the epidermis faf mediates adhesion through binding to galectin-7 - a keratinocyte cell marker. once the bacteria moved deeper into the skin to the basement membrane layer, sufa was found to degrade collagen iv which forms the backbone structure of the basement membrane. it also  degraded collagen v, whereby f. magna could reach deeper dermal tissue sites. in  the dermis, faf interacts with collagen v and fibrillin, which presumably helps the bacteria to establish infection in this area. the findings of this study paint a clear picture of how f. magna interacts with human skin and explain how it is such a successful opportunistic pathogen in chronic wounds and ulcers.

TI  == the influence of incubation time, sample preparation and exposure to oxygen on the quality of the maldi-tof ms spectrum of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms), bacteria can be identified quickly and reliably. this accounts especially for anaerobic bacteria. because growth rate and oxygen sensitivity differ among anaerobic bacteria, we aimed to study the influence of incubation time, exposure to oxygen and sample preparation on the quality of the spectrum using the bruker system. also, reproducibility and inter-examiner variability were determined. twenty-six anaerobic species, representing 17 genera, were selected based on gram-stain characteristics, growth rate and colony morphology.  inter-examiner variation showed that experience in the preparation of the targets can be a significant variable. the influence of incubation time was determined between 24 and 96 h of incubation. reliable species identification was obtained after 48 h of incubation for gram-negative anaerobes and after 72 h for gram-positive anaerobes. exposure of the cultures to oxygen did not influence the results of the maldi-tof ms identifications of all tested gram-positive species.  fusobacterium necrophorum and prevotella intermedia could not be identified after >24 h and 48 h of exposure to oxygen, respectively. other tested gram-negative bacteria could be identified after 48 h of exposure to oxygen. most of the tested species could be identified using the direct spotting method. bifidobacterium longum and finegoldia magna needed on-target extraction with 70% formic acid in order to obtain reliable species identification and peptoniphilus ivorii a full extraction. spectrum quality was influenced by the amount of bacteria spotted on  the target, the homogeneity of the smear and the experience of the examiner.

TI  == substrate profiling of finegoldia magna sufa protease, inhibitor screening and application to prevent human fibrinogen degradation and bacteria growth in vitro.
AB  == sufa, which belongs to the subtilisin-like serine protease family, contains a non-canonical asp-his-ser catalytic triad. under in vitro conditions, sufa is capable of human fibrinogen hydrolysis leading to inhibition of fibrin network formation, thus suggesting its important role in the development and progression  of finegoldia magna infections. in addition, it has been demonstrated that sufa can hydrolyze antibacterial peptides such as ll-37 and the chemokine mig/cxcl 9,  hence evading host defence mechanisms. although the sufa protease from f. magna was discovered several years ago, its optimal substrate preference has not yet been identified. considering the role of sufa, we have focused on the profiling of its substrate sequence preference spanning s1-s3 binding pockets using the fret (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) approach. next, based on the structure of the p1 residue of the developed substrate, we narrowed the inhibitor screening to the phosphonic analogues of amino acids containing an arginine-like  side chain. among all the compounds tested, only cbz-6-amnphth(p)(oph)2 showed any inhibitory activity against sufa displaying k2/ki value of 10,800 m(-1) s(-1). in addition, it prevented sufa-mediated human fibrinogen hydrolysis in vitro and exhibited potent antibacterial activity against f. magna, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. herein, we report on the substrate specificity, synthesis and kinetic evaluation of phosphonic inhibitors of sufa protease from f. magna which could help to establish its function in pathogenesis development and may lead to the elaboration of new antibacterial drugs.

TI  == identification of pili on the surface of finegoldia magna--a gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == pili have only been discovered in the major gram-positive pathogens in the past decade and they have been found to play an important role in colonisation and virulence. pili have been shown to have many important functions including attachment to host tissues, mediating bacterial aggregation, biofilm formation and binding to proteins in the extracellular matrix. in this study, sortase-dependent pili have been found to be expressed on the surface of finegoldia magna alb8. f. magna is a gram-positive anaerobic coccus that, primarily, is a commensal of the skin and mucous membranes, but has also been isolated from various clinical infection sites and is associated with soft-tissue abscesses, wound infections and bone and prosthetic joint infections. in this study, f. magna alb8 was found to harbour three sortases at the pilus locus, two  of which bear high similarity to class c sortases in streptococcus pneumoniae. two putative sortase-dependent pili proteins were found in the locus, with one being identified as the major pilus subunit, fmp1 (f. magna pilus subunit 1), due to its high similarity to other major pilus proteins in prominent gram-positive pathogens. the presence of sortase-dependent pili was confirmed experimentally through recombinant production of fmp1 and production of antiserum. the fmp1 antiserum was used in western blot to show the presence of a high molecular weight protein ladder, characteristic of the presence of pili, in trypsin released cell wall surface proteins from f. magna. the presence of sortase-dependent pili was visually confirmed by transmission electron microscopy, which showed the binding of gold labelled anti-fmp1 to individual pilus proteins along the pilus. furthermore, pili could also be found to bind and interact with keratinocytes in the epidermal layer of human skin, suggesting an adhesive role for pili on f. magna. our work represents the first description of  pilus structures in f. magna. this discovery further elucidates f. magna physiology and allows for additional analysis of host-bacterial interactions in future studies.

TI  == bone and joint infections due to anaerobic bacteria: an analysis of 61 cases and  review of the literature.
AB  == the diagnosis of anaerobic bone and joint infections (bji) were underestimated before the advent of molecular identification and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms). we report  61 cases of anaerobic infections based on our 4-year experience with the management of bji. a total of 75% of cases were post-surgical infections, associated with osteosynthesis devices (65%). early infections occurred in 27% of cases, delayed infections in 17.5% of cases, and late infections in 55% of cases. we recorded 36 species of 93 anaerobic strains using maldi-tof ms (91) and molecular methods (2). we identified 20 strains of propionibacterium acnes, 13 of finegoldia magna, six of peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, and six of p. harei. polymicrobial infections occurred in 50 cases. surgical treatment was performed in 93.5% of cases. the antibiotic treatments included amoxicillin (30%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (16%), metronidazole (30%), and clindamycin (26%). hyperbaric oxygen therapy was used in 17 cases (28%). the relapse rate (27%) was  associated with lower limbs localization (p = 0.001). p. acnes bji was associated with shoulder (p = 0.019), vertebra (p = 0.021), and head flap localization (p =  0.011), and none of these cases relapsed (p = 0.007). f. magna bji was associated with ankle localization (p = 0.014). anaerobic bji is typically considered as a post-surgical polymicrobial infection, and the management of this infection combines surgical and medical treatments. maldi-tof ms and molecular identification have improved diagnosis. thus, physicians should be aware of the polymicrobial nature of anaerobic bji to establish immediate broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment during the post-surgical period until accurate microbiological results have been obtained.

TI  == imparting albumin-binding affinity to a human protein by mimicking the contact surface of a bacterial binding protein.
AB  == attachment of a bacterial albumin-binding protein module is an attractive strategy for extending the plasma residence time of protein therapeutics. however, a protein fused with such a bacterial module could induce unfavorable immune reactions. to address this, we designed an alternative binding protein by  imparting albumin-binding affinity to a human protein using molecular surface grafting. the result was a series of human-derived 6 helix-bundle proteins, one of which specifically binds to human serum albumin (hsa) with adequate affinity (kd = 100 nm). the proteins were designed by transferring key binding residues of a bacterial albumin-binding module, finegoldia magna protein g-related albumin-binding domain (ga) module, onto the human protein scaffold. despite 13-15 mutations, the designed proteins maintain the original secondary structure  by virtue of careful grafting based on structural informatics. competitive binding assays and thermodynamic analyses of the best binders show that the binding mode resembles that of the ga module, suggesting that the contacting surface of the ga module is mimicked well on the designed protein. these results  indicate that the designed protein may act as an alternative low-risk binding module to hsa. furthermore, molecular surface grafting in combination with structural informatics is an effective approach for avoiding deleterious mutations on a target protein and for imparting the binding function of one protein onto another.

TI  == faf and sufa: proteins of finegoldia magna that modulate the antibacterial activity of histones.
AB  == many bacterial pathogens have developed methods to overcome the defences of the host innate immune system. one such defence is the release of antimicrobial peptides (amps). histones have been found to function as amps, in addition to their main biological function of packaging and organising dna into nucleosomes.  in this study, the gram-positive anaerobic coccus finegoldia magna was found to bind histones by western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis. f. magna, which is normally a commensal of the skin and mucous membranes, is also known to act as an opportunistic pathogen and has been isolated from various clinical infection sites. it was found to bind to histones extracted from human skin epidermis through its surface and extracellular adhesion protein faf. through faf binding,  f. magna was protected from histone bactericidal activity. furthermore, the histones were found to be degraded by sufa, a subtilisin-like extracellular serine protease of f. magna. hence, the results of the present study will give more insight into how f. magna persists both as a commensal organism at the basement membrane of the skin and as an opportunistic pathogen during infection.

TI  == ceftaroline plus avibactam demonstrates bactericidal activity against pathogenic  anaerobic bacteria in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  model.
AB  == anaerobic pathogens are often associated with polymicrobial infections, such as diabetic foot infections. patients with these infections are often treated with broad-spectrum, multidrug therapies targeting resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. the broad-spectrum, non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam has been combined with ceftaroline and may provide a single-product alternative for complicated polymicrobial infections. we compared  the activity of ceftaroline-avibactam (cpa) to that of ertapenem (ert) against common anaerobic pathogens in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) model. simulations of doses of ceftaroline-fosamil at 600 mg every 8 h (q8h) (maximum free drug concentration [fcmax], 17.04 mg/liter, and half-life [t1/2], 2.66 h) plus avibactam at 600 mg q8h (fcmax, 11.72 mg/liter, and t1/2, 1.8 h) and of ertapenem at 1 g q24h (fcmax, 13 mg/liter, and t1/2, 4 h) were evaluated against two strains of bacteroides fragilis, one strain of prevotella bivia, and  one strain of finegoldia magna in an anaerobic one-compartment in vitro pk/pd model over 72 h with a starting inoculum of approximately 8 log10 cfu/ml. bactericidal activity was defined as a reduction of >/=3 log10 cfu/ml from the starting inoculum. both cpa and ert were bactericidal against all four strains. cpa demonstrated improved activity against bacteroides strains compared to that of ert but had similar activity against finegoldia magna and p. bivia, although modest regrowth was observed with cpa against p. bivia. no resistance emerged from any of the models. the pharmacokinetics achieved were 92 to 105% of the targets. cpa has potent in vitro activity against common anaerobic pathogens at clinically relevant drug exposures and may be a suitable single product for the management of complicated polymicrobial infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == the albumin-binding domain as a scaffold for protein engineering.
AB  == the albumin-binding domain is a small, three-helical protein domain found in various surface proteins expressed by gram-positive bacteria. albumin binding is  important in bacterial pathogenesis and several homologous domains have been identified. such albumin-binding regions have been used for protein purification  or immobilization. moreover, improvement of the pharmacokinetics, through the non-covalent association to albumin, by fusing such domains to therapeutic proteins has been shown to be successful. domains derived from streptococcal protein g and protein pab from finegoldia magna, which share a common origin and  therefore represent an interesting evolutionary system, have been thoroughly studied structurally and functionally. their albumin-binding sites have been mapped and these domains form the basis for a wide range of protein engineering approaches. by substitution-mutagenesis they have been engineered to achieve a broader specificity, an increased stability or an improved binding affinity, respectively. furthermore, novel binding sites have been incorporated either by replacing the original albumin-binding surface, or by complementing it with a novel interaction interface. combinatorial protein libraries, where several residues have been randomized simultaneously, have generated a large number of new variants with desired binding characteristics. the albumin-binding domain has also been utilized to explore the relationship between three-dimensional structure and amino acid sequence. proteins with latent structural information built into their sequence, where a single amino acid substitution shifts the equilibrium in favor of a different fold with a new function, have been designed. altogether, these examples illustrate the versatility of the albumin-binding domain as a scaffold for protein engineering.

TI  == the role of molecular diagnostics in implant-associated bone and joint infection.
AB  == microbiological culture is the conventional method for establishing the diagnosis in implant-associated bone and joint infection, but it may lack both specificity  and sensitivity. molecular diagnosis has been an important step in the diagnosis  of infectious diseases. we review the principles and the role of molecular diagnosis in improving the aetiological diagnosis of implant-associated bone and  joint infection. currently, molecular diagnosis mainly includes conventional broad-range pcr and specific pcr assays. these tools are efficient, but several pitfalls exist that necessitate rigour in all steps of the process. in implant-associated bone and joint infection, molecular assays have been shown to  be useful in complementing culture techniques to identify microorganisms when patients have previously received antibiotics or in the presence of fastidious microorganisms. broad-range pcr targeting the 16s rrna sequence followed by sequencing must be performed in culture-negative specimens when infection is suspected on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms or inflammatory syndrome. this molecular tool has allowed not only increasing identification of anaerobic bacteria, such as finegoldia magna, but also the discovery of the role of tropheryma whipplei, an aetiological agent of implant-associated bone and joint infection in patients without whipple's disease. real-time pathogen-specific pcr  assays performed in a closed system are more sensitive and specific than broad-range pcr, but each assay is typically able to detect only a single microorganism. these assays should be performed to confirm the identification provided by broad-spectrum pcr, and also when broad-range pcr fails to detect a microorganism despite efficient dna extraction.

TI  == in vivo vl-targeted microbial superantigen induced global shifts in the b cell repertoire.
AB  == to subvert host defenses, some microbial pathogens produce proteins that interact with conserved motifs in v regions of b cell ag receptor shared by large sets of  lymphocytes, which define the properties of a superantigen. because the clonal composition of the lymphocyte pool is a major determinant of immune responsiveness, this study was undertaken to examine the in vivo effect on the host immune system of exposure to a b cell superantigen, protein l (ppl), a product of the common commensal bacterial species, finegoldia magna, which is one of the most common pathogenic species among gram-positive anaerobic cocci. libraries of vkappa l chain transcripts were generated from the spleens of control and ppl-exposed mice, and the expressed vkappa rearrangements were characterized by high-throughput sequencing. a total of 120,855 sequencing reads  could be assigned to a germline vkappa gene, with all 20 known vkappa subgroups represented. in control mice, we found a recurrent and consistent hierarchy of vkappa gene usage, as well as patterns of preferential vkappa-jkappa pairing. ppl exposure induced significant targeted global shifts in repertoire with reduction  of vkappa that contain the superantigen binding motif in all exposed mice. we found significant targeted reductions in the expression of clonotypes encoded by  14 specific vkappa genes with the predicted ppl binding motif. these rigorous surveys document the capacity of a microbial protein to modulate the composition  of the expressed lymphocyte repertoire, which also has broad potential implications for host-microbiome and host-pathogen relationships.

TI  == finegoldia magna (formerly peptostreptococcus magnus): an overlooked etiology for toxic shock syndrome?
AB  == finegoldia magna is an anaerobic gram positive coccus, previously classified as peptostreoptococcus magnus. it is normal flora of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract, and can be isolated from skin and the oral cavity and is often regarded as a contaminant in cultures. as the most frequently isolated anaerobic coccus, it is implicated in a range of mono- and polymicrobial infections, including skin and skin structure, bone and joint (native and prosthetic joints), infective endocarditis (native and prosthetic valves), necrotizing pneumonia, mediastinitis and meningitis. recently, whole genome sequencing furthered the understanding of the pathogenicity of this organism by elucidating both chromosomally encoded and mobile plasmid mediated virulence factors. although no cases of toxic shock syndrome have been attributed to f. magna, we present a case of a fatal monomicrobial f. magna bacteremia and hypothesize that superantigen activity, mediated via protein l binding the variable domain of the kappa light chains of igg, resulted in the syndrome observed in our patient. additionally, we suspect the overall significance of this pathogen is underestimated and with more sensitive detection methods, this organism will be identified more frequently in clinical cultures and associated with true infection.

TI  == biofilm-growing intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == sessile growth of anaerobic bacteria from the human intestinal tract has been poorly investigated, so far. we recently reported data on the close association existing between biliary stent clogging and polymicrobial biofilm development in  its lumen. by exploiting the explanted stents as a rich source of anaerobic bacterial strains belonging to the genera bacteroides, clostridium, fusobacterium, finegoldia, prevotella, and veillonella, the present study focused on their ability to adhere, to grow in sessile mode and to form in vitro mono- or dual-species biofilms. experiments on dual-species biofilm formation were planned on the basis of the anaerobic strains isolated from each clogged biliary stent, by selecting those in which a couple of anaerobic strains belonging to different  species contributed to the polymicrobial biofilm development. then, strains were  investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy to reveal if they are able to grow as mono- and/or dual-species biofilms. as far as we know, this is the first report on the ability to adhere and form mono/dual-species biofilms exhibited by strains belonging to the species bacteroides oralis, clostridium difficile, clostridium baratii, clostridium fallax, clostridium bifermentans, finegoldia magna, and fusobacterium necrophorum.

TI  == the b-cell superantigen finegoldia magna protein l causes pulmonary inflammation  by a mechanism dependent on myd88 but not b cells or immunoglobulins.
AB  == objective and design: to determine whether finegoldia magna protein l (pl) causes lung inflammation and, if so, whether the response is dependent on its immunoglobulin (ig)-binding b-cell superantigenic property. material: pulmonary inflammatory reactions were analyzed at various time points after intratracheal administration of pl to various strains of mice. results: pl caused peribronchial and perivascular inflammation that peaked at 18-24 h. polymorphonuclear cells (pmns) began to accumulate in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (balf) of pl-challenged mice by 4 h and accounted for >90% of leukocytes by 18-24 h. inflammation was marked by the appearance of mip-2, kc, tnf-alpha, and il-6 in the balf with peak levels attained 4 h after pl administration. pl-induced pulmonary inflammation was associated with increased airway hyper-reactivity following inhalation of methacholine. the inflammatory reaction was unabated in mice lacking b cells and immunoglobulins. in contrast, pl-induced inflammation was abrogated in myd88-deficient mice. pl-induced responses required alveolar macrophages. conclusions: these results strongly suggest that pl-induced lung inflammation is dependent on an innate myd88-dependent pathway rather than the ig-binding properties of this microbial b cell superantigen. we propose that this pulmonary inflammatory reaction is caused by the interaction of pl with a toll-like receptor expressed on alveolar macrophages.

TI  == an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  == preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose  (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p =  0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer  than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13  days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.

TI  == constitutive and inflammation-dependent antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelium are differentially processed and inactivated by the commensal finegoldia magna and the pathogen streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == epithelial linings serve as physical barriers and produce antimicrobial peptides  (amps) to maintain host integrity. examples are the bactericidal proteins midkine (mk) and brak/cxcl14 that are constitutively produced in the skin epidermal layer, where the anaerobic gram-positive coccoid commensal finegoldia magna resides. consequently, this bacterium is likely to encounter both mk and brak/cxcl14, making these molecules possible threats to its habitat. in this study, we show that mk expression is upregulated during inflammation, concomitant with a strong downregulation of brak/cxcl14, resulting in changed antibacterial conditions. mk, brak/cxcl14, and the inflammation-dependent antimicrobial beta-defensins human beta-defensin (hbd)-2 and hbd-3 all showed bactericidal activity against both f. magna and the virulent pathogen streptococcus pyogenes at similar concentrations. sufa, a released protease of f. magna, degraded mk and brak/cxcl14 but not hbd-2 nor hbd-3. cleavage was seen at lysine and arginine residues, amino acids characteristic of amps. intermediate sufa-degraded fragments of mk and brak/cxcl14 showed stronger bactericidal activity against s.  pyogenes than f. magna, thus promoting survival of the latter. in contrast, the cysteine-protease speb of s. pyogenes rapidly degraded all amps investigated. the proteins faf and sic, released by f. magna and s. pyogenes, respectively, neutralized the antibacterial activity of mk and brak/cxcl14, protein faf being the most efficient. quantitation and colocalization by immunoelectron microscopy  demonstrated significant levels and interactions of the molecules in in vivo and  ex vivo samples. the findings reflect strategies used by a permanently residing commensal and a virulent pathogen, the latter operating during the limited time course of invasive disease.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2009  and march 2010].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2009 to march 2010 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 671 strains including 16 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 174 (79.1%) of 220 patients with surgical infections. four hundred and eleven strains were isolated from primary infections, and 244 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas aeruginosa, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli  was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa and e. cloacae. among  anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, streptococcus constellatus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections,  followed by bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides ovatus and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by b. ovatus, b. wadsworthia and b. thetaiotaomicron, in this order. in this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa.  we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antibiotics, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactam antibiotics.

TI  == burden of emerging anaerobes in the maldi-tof and 16s rrna gene sequencing era.
AB  == the isolation of anaerobes from patients has declined in recent years, whereas their detection by molecular techniques has increased. in the present work, we analyzed the application of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) and 16s rrna gene sequencing to routine identification of anaerobes in clinical microbiology laboratory. we identified 544 isolates of 79 species by routine culture from deep samples in our hospital. maldi-tof ms allowed identification of 332 isolates (61%). the remaining 212 (39%) were identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing, allowing identification of 202 at the species level. the most common anaerobes were propionibacterium spp. (12%), finegoldia magna (4%), fusobacterium spp. (6%) and  bacteroides spp. (6%). however, among the 79 identified species, seven were new species or genera, including two prevotella conceptionensis, a species previously detected by our team by amplification and sequencing, five anaerococcus sp. and one prevotella sp. beyond the identification of these new species, we also identified several uncommon or previously not described associations between species and specific pathologic conditions. maldi-tof ms-based identification, which will become more effective with future spectra database improvement, will be likely responsible of a burden of emerging anaerobes in clinical microbiology.

TI  == anti-anaerobic activity of serum from patients treated with tigecycline for skin/soft tissue infections.
AB  == to gain additional data concerning the anti-anaerobic activity of tigecycline in  serum, we analyzed blood samples from six patients with a complicated skin/soft tissue infection who were receiving iv tigecycline 50 mg every 12 h. venous blood samples were obtained after multiple doses of tigecycline at 1, 6 and 12 h after  the initiation of a 1 h iv infusion. sera from these samples were tested to determine serum inhibitory and bactericidal activity over time against 4 anaerobic bacteria (bacteroides fragilis, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, prevotella bivia and finegoldia magna). an analysis of serum titers found that tigecycline exhibited early (1 h) and prolonged (12 h) inhibitory activity against each study isolate. moreover, it provided bactericidal activity for 12 h  against these strains with the exception of f. magna. tigecycline was found to exhibit antibacterial activity at serum concentrations below the mics of the anaerobic bacteria tested. this finding further supports that the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline can be greater than that suggested by the free fraction of drug and that serum appears to enhance this antibacterial activity.

TI  == identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) are part of the commensal microbiota of humans and are a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of organisms. to evaluate the suitability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) for the identification of gpac, a database was constructed, using reference strains of commonly encountered gpac and clinical isolates of which the sequence of the 16s rrna gene was determined. subsequently, the database was validated by identifying 107 clinical isolates of gpac. results  were compared with the identifications obtained by 16s sequencing or fluorescent  in situ hybridization (fish). strains belonging to the same species grouped together, in most cases, by maldi-tof ms analyses. strains with sequence similarities less than 98% to their closest relatives, formed clusters distinct from recognized species in the maldi-tof ms dendrogram and, therefore could not be identified. these strains probably represent new species. only three clinical  isolates (2 strains of finegoldia magna and 1 strain of anaerococcus vaginalis) could not be identified. for all the other gpac strains (96/107), reliable identifications were obtained. therefore, we concluded that maldi-tof ms is an excellent tool for the identification of phylogenetically heterogeneous groups of micro-organisms such as gpac.

TI  == complete genome sequence of a serotype 11a, st62 streptococcus pneumoniae invasive isolate.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing  a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. we sequenced the genome of a  serotype 11a, st62 s. pneumoniae invasive isolate (ap200), that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm(tr) determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. results: the genome sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 is 2,130,580 base pair in length. the genome carries 2216 coding sequences (cds), 56 trna, and 12 rrna genes. of the cdss, 72.9% have a predicted biological known function. ap200 contains the pilus islet 2 and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11a, it contains an 11d capsular locus. chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and  horizontal gene transfer events were observed. the chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm(tr)-carrying tn1806 and a functional prophage designated phispn_200. tn1806 is 52,457 bp in size and comprises 49 orfs. comparative analysis of tn1806 revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species finegoldia magna, anaerococcus prevotii and clostridium difficile. the genome of phispn_200 is 35,989 bp in size and is organized in 47 orfs grouped into five functional modules. prophages similar to phispn_200 were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. phispn_200 viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain. conclusions: the sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. the overall diversity of ap200 is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements tn1806 and phispn_200 that show large gene exchanges with other genetic  elements of different bacterial species. these genetic elements likely provide ap200 with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.

TI  == assessment of bacterial diversity in the cattle tick rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus through tag-encoded pyrosequencing.
AB  == background: ticks are regarded as the most relevant vectors of disease-causing pathogens in domestic and wild animals. the cattle tick, rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus, hinders livestock production in tropical and subtropical parts of the world where it is endemic. tick microbiomes remain largely unexplored. the objective of this study was to explore the r. microplus microbiome by applying the bacterial 16s tag-encoded flx-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap) technique to characterize its bacterial diversity. pyrosequencing was performed on adult males and females, eggs, and gut and ovary  tissues from adult females derived from samples of r. microplus collected during  outbreaks in southern texas. results: raw data from btefap were screened and trimmed based upon quality scores and binned into individual sample collections.  bacteria identified to the species level include staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, streptococcus dysgalactiae, staphylococcus sciuri, serratia marcescens, corynebacterium glutamicum, and finegoldia magna. one hundred twenty-one bacterial genera were detected in all the life stages and tissues sampled. the total number of genera identified by tick sample comprised:  53 in adult males, 61 in adult females, 11 in gut tissue, 7 in ovarian tissue, and 54 in the eggs. notable genera detected in the cattle tick include wolbachia, coxiella, and borrelia. the molecular approach applied in this study allowed us to assess the relative abundance of the microbiota associated with r. microplus.  conclusions: this report represents the first survey of the bacteriome in the cattle tick using non-culture based molecular approaches. comparisons of our results with previous bacterial surveys provide an indication of geographic variation in the assemblages of bacteria associated with r. microplus. additional reports on the identification of new bacterial species maintained in nature by r. microplus that may be pathogenic to its vertebrate hosts are expected as our understanding of its microbiota expands. increased awareness of the role r. microplus can play in the transmission of pathogenic bacteria will enhance our ability to mitigate its economic impact on animal agriculture globally. this recognition should be included as part of analyses to assess the risk for re-invasion of areas like the united states of america where r. microplus was eradicated.

TI  == surface bacteriology of venous leg ulcers and healing outcome.
AB  == aim: bacteria can be cultured from all venous leg ulcers (vlus) regardless of healing status, and the significance of a positive swab result in non-clinically  infected ulcers is unknown. the aim of this study was to characterise the bacteriological flora of vlus by routine culture to determine whether the data generated had prognostic value. methods: the ulcers of 178 patients were sampled  weekly for 12 weeks and healing outcome monitored while the limb was treated with graduated compression. wound bacteriology was assessed using culture methodology  standardised to ensure data reproducibility. results: 153 individual bacterial species were identified. the species most frequently found were staphylococcus aureus (64.3% of assessments), corynebacterium striatum (60.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (32.6%), helcococcus kunzii (22.0%), finegoldia magna (21.4%) and proteus mirabilis (16.1%). no single species or the presence of anaerobes and increasing diversity of bacterial species, previously thought to be predictive of impaired healing, was shown to be associated with healing outcome. the presence of c striatum was associated with healing outcome but not after adjusting for the known prognostic factors of wound area and duration. conclusion: routine bacteriological culture analysis of the vlu wound surface may be used to identify diverse flora in all ulcers. however, the data generated are of no additional value as a prognostic indicator of healing outcome. the presence of c striatum may represent colonisation of non-healing vlu by normal skin flora.

TI  == identification of clinically important anaerobic bacteria by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria can cause a wide variety of infections, and some of these infections can be serious. conventional identification methods based on biochemical tests are often lengthy and can produce inconclusive results. an oligonucleotide array based on the 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 28 species of anaerobic bacteria and veillonella. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions with universal primers,  followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of 35 oligonucleotide probes (17- to 30-mers) immobilized on a nylon membrane. the performance of the array was determined by testing 310 target strains (strains which we aimed to identify), including 122 reference strains and 188 clinical isolates. in addition, 98 nontarget strains were used for specificity testing. the sensitivity and the specificity of the array for the identification of pure cultures were 99.7 and 97.1%, respectively. the array was further assessed for its ability to detect anaerobic bacteria in 49 clinical specimens. two species (finegoldia magna and bacteroides vulgatus) were detected in two specimens by the array, and the results were in accordance with those obtained by culture. the whole procedure of array hybridization took about 8 h, starting with the isolated colonies. the array can be used as an accurate alternative to conventional methods for the identification of clinically important anaerobes.

TI  == bacterial surface protein l binds and inactivates neutrophil proteins s100a8/a9.
AB  == finegoldia magna is an anaerobic bacterial species that is part of the normal human flora on all nonsterile body surfaces, but it is also a significant opportunistic pathogen causing a wide range of infections. some isolates of f. magna that are more frequently associated with clinical infection express protein l, a surface protein containing multiple homologous domains (b1-b5) that bind igs through interactions with ig l chains. the present study shows that the n-terminal a domain of protein l binds s100a8/a9, antibacterial proteins present  in large amounts in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, but also extracellularly in tissues during inflammation. as a result, protein l-expressing f. magna are protected against killing by s100a8/a9. igs and s100a8/a9 were found to interact  independently with protein l, demonstrating that this bacterial surface protein is capable of manipulating both adaptive and innate immune defense mechanisms.

TI  == sufa of the opportunistic pathogen finegoldia magna modulates actions of the antibacterial chemokine mig/cxcl9, promoting bacterial survival during epithelial inflammation.
AB  == the anaerobic bacterium finegoldia magna is part of the human commensal microbiota, but is also an important opportunistic pathogen. this bacterium expresses a subtilisin-like serine proteinase, sufa, which partially degrade the  antibacterial chemokine mig/cxcl9. here, we show that mig/cxcl9 is produced by human keratinocytes in response to inflammatory stimuli. in contrast to the virulent human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes, the presence of f. magna had no enhancing effect on the mig/cxcl9 expression by keratinocytes, suggesting poor detection of the latter by pathogen-recognition receptors. when mig/cxcl9 was exposed to sufa-expressing f. magna, the molecule was processed into several smaller fragments. analysis by mass spectrometry showed that sufa cleaves mig/cxcl9 at several sites in the cooh-terminal region of the molecule. at equimolar concentrations, sufa-generated mig/cxcl9 fragments were not bactericidal against f. magna, but retained their ability to kill s. pyogenes. moreover, the sufa-generated mig/cxcl9 fragments were capable of activating the angiostasis-mediating cxcr3 receptor, which is expressed on endothelial cells, in an order of magnitude similar to that of intact mig/cxcl9. f. magna expresses a surface protein called faf that is released from the bacterial surface by sufa. soluble faf was found to bind and inactivate the antibacterial activity of mig/cxcl9, thereby further potentially promoting the survival of f. magna. the findings suggest that sufa modulation of the inflammatory response could be a mechanism playing an important role in creating an ecologic niche for f. magna, decreasing antibacterial activity and suppressing angiogenesis, thus providing advantage in survival for this anaerobic opportunist compared with competing pathogens during inflammation.

TI  == sufa - a bacterial enzyme that cleaves fibrinogen and blocks fibrin network formation.
AB  == finegoldia magna is a member of the normal human bacterial flora on the skin and  other non-sterile body surfaces, but this anaerobic coccus is also an important opportunistic pathogen. sufa was the first f. magna proteinase to be isolated and characterized. many bacterial pathogens interfere with different steps of blood coagulation, and here we describe how purified sufa efficiently and specifically  cleaves fibrinogen in human plasma. sufa is both secreted by f. magna and associated with the bacterial surface. successful gene targeting has previously not been performed in anaerobic cocci, but in order to study the role of the sufa that is present at the bacterial surface, we constructed an f. magna mutant that  expresses a truncated sufa lacking proteolytic activity. in contrast to wild-type bacteria that delayed the coagulation of human plasma, mutant bacteria had no such effect. wild-type and mutant bacteria adhered to keratinocytes equally well, but in a plasma environment only wild-type bacteria blocked the formation of fibrin networks surrounding adherent bacteria. the effective cleavage of fibrinogen by sufa suggests that the interference with fibrin network formation represents an adaptive mechanism of f. magna with potential implications also for pathogenicity.

TI  == identification of a novel protein promoting the colonization and survival of finegoldia magna, a bacterial commensal and opportunistic pathogen.
AB  == anaerobic bacteria dominate the human normal microbiota, but strikingly little is known about these commensals. finegoldia magna is a gram-positive anaerobe found  in the skin and at other non-sterile body surfaces, but it is also an opportunistic pathogen. this study describes a novel protein designated faf (f. magna adhesion factor) and expressed by more than 90% of f. magna isolates. the protein is present in substantial quantities at the f. magna surface but is also  released from the surface. faf forms large protein aggregates in solution and surface-associated faf causes bacterial clumping. in skin f. magna bacteria were  localized to the epidermis, where they adhere to basement membranes. faf was found to mediate this adhesion via interactions with bm-40, a basement membrane protein. the biological significance of faf is further underlined by the observation that it blocks the activity of ll-37, a major human antibacterial peptide. altogether, the data demonstrate that faf plays an important role in colonization and survival of f. magna in the human host.

TI  == alternate arrangement of ppl b3 domain and spa d domain creates synergistic double-site binding to vh3 and vkappa regions of fab.

TI  == complete genome sequence of finegoldia magna, an anaerobic opportunistic pathogen.
AB  == finegoldia magna (formerly peptostreptococcus magnus), a member of the gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac), is a commensal bacterium colonizing human skin and mucous membranes. moreover, it is also recognized as an opportunistic pathogen responsible for various infectious diseases. here, we report the complete genome sequence of f. magna atcc 29328. the genome consists of a 1,797,577 bp circular chromosome and an 189,163 bp plasmid (ppep1). the metabolic maps constructed based on the genome information confirmed that most f. magna strains cannot ferment most sugars, except fructose, and have various aminopeptidase activities. three homologs of albumin-binding protein, a known virulence factor useful for antiphagocytosis, are encoded on the chromosome, and  one albumin-binding protein homolog is encoded on the plasmid. a unique feature of the genome is that f. magna encodes many sortase genes, of which substrates may be involved in bacterial pathogenesis, such as antiphagocytosis and adherence to the host cell. the plasmid ppep1 encodes seven sortase and seven substrate genes, whereas the chromosome encodes four sortase and 19 substrate genes. these  plasmid-encoded sortases may play important roles in the pathogenesis of f. magna by enriching the variety of cell wall anchored surface proteins.

TI  == european surveillance study on antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive anaerobic cocci.
AB  == gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) are a heterogeneous group of microorganisms  frequently isolated from local and systemic infections. in this study, the antimicrobial susceptibilities of clinical strains isolated in 10 european countries were investigated. after identification of 299 gpac to species level, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin, imipenem, clindamycin, metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid were determined by the agar dilution method according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute. the majority of isolates were identified as finegoldia magna and parvimonas micra (formerly peptostreptococcus micros), isolated from skin and soft tissue infections. all isolates were susceptible to imipenem, metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid. twenty-one isolates (7%) were resistant to penicillin (n=13) and/or to clindamycin (n=12). four isolates were resistant to both agents. the majority of  resistant isolates were identified as f. magna and originated from blood, abscesses and soft tissue infections.

TI  == sufa--a novel subtilisin-like serine proteinase of finegoldia magna.
AB  == finegoldia magna is an anaerobic gram-positive bacterium and commensal, which is  also associated with clinically important conditions such as skin and soft tissue infections. this study describes a novel subtilisin-like extracellular serine proteinase of f. magna, denoted sufa (subtilase of finegoldia magna), which is believed to be the first subtilase described among gram-positive anaerobic cocci. sufa is associated with the bacterial cell surface, but is also released in substantial amounts during bacterial growth. papain was used to release sufa from the surface of f. magna and the enzyme was purified by ion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. a protein band on sds-page corresponding to the dominating proteolytic activity on gelatin zymography was analysed by ms/ms.  based on the peptide sequences obtained, the sufa gene was sequenced. the gene comprises 3466 bp corresponding to a preprotein of 127 kda. like other members of the subtilase family, sufa contains the catalytic triad of aspartic acid, histidine and serine with surrounding conserved residues. a sufa homologue was identified in 33 of 34 investigated isolates of f. magna, as revealed by pcr and  immunoprinting. the enzyme forms dimers, which are more proteolytically active than the monomeric protein. sufa was found to efficiently cleave and inactivate the antibacterial peptide ll-37 and the cxc chemokine mig/cxcl9, indicating that  the enzyme promotes f. magna survival and colonization.

TI  == development of 16s rrna-based probes for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == fluorescent probes targeted at 16s rrna were designed for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus stomatis (pana134), parvimonas micra (pamic1435), finegoldia magna (fmag1250), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (pnasa1254), peptoniphilus ivorii (pnivo731), peptoniphilus harei (pnhar1466), anaerococcus vaginalis (avag1280) and anaerococcus lactolyticus (alac1438), based on the 16s rrna sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. these strains were also used for validation of the probes. application  of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) could be identified with this set of probes. the 16s rrnas of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. most of these isolates were gpac that were not targeted by the probes. no clinical isolates of pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. the fmag1250, pamic1435, pnhar1466, pana134, pnasa1254 and pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. the avag1280 and alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. however, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for  the majority of clinical isolates.

TI  == [nonpuerperal breast abscess caused by finegoldia magna].
AB  == finegoldia magna is a species of strictly anaerobic gram-positive cocci, arranged in pairs, tetrads, and clusters. these organisms are components of the normal flora of the skin, gastrointestinal and genitourinary female tracts, and oral cavity. they are asaccharolytic and their major energy sources are aminoacids and peptones. the species is usually isolated in polymicrobial cultures from abscesses, soft tissue infections, bone and joints. in the case herein presented, f. magna was recovered in pure culture from a nonpuerperal breast abscess, which  adds to the two reported cases in related literature. species identification was  performed by special potency disks, standard bacteriological anaerobic tests, and production of saccharolytic and proteolytic enzymes. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by using the epsilometric test. the agents assayed and mics (microg/ml) values were: penicillin, 0.064; cephalotin, 1; metronidazole, 0.25; minocycline, < 0.016; azithromycin, 4; claritromycin, 2. we would like to highlight the importance of identifying anaerobic gram-positive cocci at species  level, and of determining the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern, when they are isolated in pure culture from appropriate samples, as in the case presently reported.

TI  == crystal structure of a bacterial albumin-binding domain at 1.4 a resolution.
AB  == the albumin-binding domain, or ga module, of the peptostreptococcal albumin-binding protein expressed in pathogenic strains of finegoldia magna is believed to be responsible for the virulence and increased growth rate of these strains. here we present the 1.4a crystal structure of this domain, and compare it with the crystal structure of the ga-albumin complex. an analysis of protein-protein interactions in the two crystals, and the presence of multimeric  ga species in solution, indicate the ga module is "sticky", and is capable of forming contacts with a range of protein surfaces. this might lead to interactions with different host proteins.

TI  == human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  == telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. in this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following  single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the  median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. against two azithromycin-resistant strains of streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (mic=0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. all three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin mic=4.0 microg/ml). both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (finegoldia [peptostreptococcus] magna peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella bivia, and prevotella melaninogenica). moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both prevotella species. in this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of s. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of h. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. these findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.

AB  == using an agar dilution method, we determined the in vitro activity of oritavancin, vancomycin, clindamycin and metronidazole against 114 unique clinical isolates of gram-positive anaerobes. mic(90)s (microg/ml) for oritavancin were as follows: clostridium perfringens 1.0, propionibacterium acnes 0.25, peptostreptococcus anaerobius 0.25, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus 0.5, finegoldia magna 0.25, micromonas. micros 0.25, and anaerococcus prevotii 0.25. on a weight basis, oritavancin is slightly more active than vancomycin against the strains tested. the oritavancin mics are comparable to those previously reported against staphylococci and enterococci. oritavancin shows excellent potential for treatment of infections containing gram-positive anaerobes such as  these.

TI  == anaerobic microbiology in 198 cases of pleural empyema: a bulgarian study.
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in 198 patients with pleural empyema and the susceptibility of isolates to eight antibacterial agents. isolates were identified by the crystal anaerobes identification system, api system rapid id 32 a and/or routine methods. susceptibility was tested by sceptor mic system for anaerobic bacteria and limited agar dilution method. anaerobic bacteria were found in 74.2% of the patients and included 247 strains within 21 genera. the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive anaerobic cocci (52 isolates), fusobacterium (51), microaerophilic streptococci (24), prevotella (19) and bacteroides species (11).  common species/groups were fusobacterium nucleatum (in 27.2% of specimens yielding anaerobes), micromonas micros (8.2%), finegoldia magna (7.5%), bacteroides fragilis group (6.8%), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6.1%) and f. necrophorum (5.4%). no resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin/sulbactam was detected. the susceptibility rates of gram-negative anaerobic isolates to penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and tetracycline were 63.8%, 90.2%, 87.8%, 58.6%, 98.8% and 71%, and those of gram-positive anaerobes were 79.2%, 100%, 84.3%, 68.4%, 41.9% and 75%, respectively. the wide diversity of isolated anaerobic genera and species and the susceptibility patterns of the isolates emphasize the role of the anaerobic microbiology in cases of pleural empyema.

TI  == [two cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and  haemophilus influenzae].
AB  == most of bartholin's gland abscesses have been thought to be caused by microorganisms found in opportunistic infections. however, we have encountered two very interesting cases of bartholin's gland abscesses caused by streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, two major pathogens of respiratory tract infections. in the first case, since abscess formation was not observed due to disintegration, cefdinir (cfdn), 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days was administered.  the treatment improved clinical symptoms, but relapse occurred 3 days after the administration was discontinued. microbiological examination of pus revealed the  presence of streptococcus pneumoniae and finegoldia magna, and it also showed that the isolated s. pneumoniae was penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp). after an incision and drainage of abscess, cefteram pivoxil (cftm-pi), 300 mg/day t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in the second case, after an incision and drainage of bartholin's gland abscess, amoxicillin (ampc), 750 mg/day, t.i.d. for 5 days, was administered. the treatment improved clinical symptoms temporarily. however, the symptoms deteriorated 7 days after the operation, and the patient was diagnosed with relapse. microbiological examination of pus revealed the presence of haemophilus influenzae and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and it also showed that the isolated h. influenzae was beta-lactamase-nonproducing ampicillin-resistant h. influenzae (blnar). after performing additional incision and drainage of abscess again, cftm-pi, 300 mg/day, t.i.d. for 7 days, was administered, and the cure was confirmed. in addition, the analysis of these two cases using pk/pd theory revealed that the time above mic reached 100% with administration of cftm-pi 300mg, t.i.d. suggesting that the dosage is sufficient for treating these infections. there are other cases of external genitalia infections caused by microorganisms usually associated with respiratory tract infections like cases that we are reporting here. therefore, it is necessary to consider a possible infection by drug-resistant bacteria even for a case of external genitalia infection. in addition, it was thought that adjusting dosage and method for administration of antibacterial agents based on pk/pd theory would help to rovide efficient treatment.

TI  == isolation and characterisation of an equol-producing mixed microbial culture from a human faecal sample and its activity under gastrointestinal conditions.
AB  == only about one third of humans possess a microbiota capable of transforming the dietary isoflavone daidzein into equol. little is known about the dietary and physiological factors determining this ecological feature. in this study, the in  vitro metabolism of daidzein by faecal samples from four human individuals was investigated. one culture produced the metabolites dihydrodaidzein and o-desmethylangolensin, another produced dihydrodaidzein and equol. from the latter, a stable and transferable mixed culture transforming daidzein into equol  was obtained. molecular fingerprinting analysis (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) showed the presence of four bacterial species of which only the  first three strains could be brought into pure culture. these strains were identified as lactobacillus mucosae epi2, enterococcus faecium epi1 and finegoldia magna epi3, and did not produce equol in pure culture. the fourth species was tentatively identified as veillonella sp strain ep. it was found that hydrogen gas in particular, but also butyrate and propionate, which are all colonic fermentation products from poorly digestible carbohydrates, stimulated equol production by the mixed culture. however, when fructo-oligosaccharides were added, equol production was inhibited. furthermore, the equol-producing capacity  of the isolated culture was maintained upon its addition to a faecal culture originating from a non-equol-producing individual.

TI  == crystal structure and biological implications of a bacterial albumin binding module in complex with human serum albumin.
AB  == many bactericide species express surface proteins that interact with human serum  albumin (hsa). protein pab from the anaerobic bacterium finegoldia magna (formerly peptostreptococcus magnus) represents one of these proteins. protein pab contains a domain of 53 amino acid residues known as the ga module. ga homologs are also found in protein g of group c and g streptococci. here we report the crystal structure of hsa in complex with the ga module of protein pab. the model of the complex was refined to a resolution of 2.7 a and reveals a novel binding epitope located in domain ii of the albumin molecule. the ga module is composed of a left-handed three-helix bundle, and residues from the second helix  and the loops surrounding it were found to be involved in hsa binding. furthermore, the presence of hsa-bound fatty acids seems to influence hsa-ga complex formation. f. magna has a much more restricted host specificity compared  with c and g streptococci, which is also reflected in the binding of different animal albumins by proteins pab and g. the structure of the hsa-ga complex offers a molecular explanation to this unusually clear example of bacterial adaptation.

TI  == nitroimidazole resistance genes (nimb) in anaerobic gram-positive cocci (previously peptostreptococcus spp.).
AB  == objectives: to investigate metronidazole resistance and the prevalence of nitroimidazole (nim) genes in clinically isolated anaerobic gram-positive cocci.  methods: metronidazole susceptibility was determined in 99 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci and pcr amplification for the nim gene carried out on 61 strains (metronidazole mic > or =0.5 mg/l). results: the nimb gene was detected in 34% (21/61) of the strains. these included two highly resistant finegoldia magna strains (mics >128 mg/l). the nimb gene was, however, also demonstrated in  90% (19/21) of susceptible strains. conclusions: although the nimb gene may be implicated in the high-level metronidazole resistance in 2 f. magna strains, the  alarmingly high prevalence of the nimb gene in anaerobic gram-positive cocci cannot be directly associated with resistance and the possibility of a silent nimb gene should be considered.

AB  == here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex pcr assay for identifying 14 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus (anaerococcus hydrogenalis, anaerococcus lactolyticus, anaerococcus octavius, anaerococcus prevotii, anaerococcus tetradius, anaerococcus vaginalis, finegoldia magna, micromonas micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, peptoniphilus harei, peptoniphilus indolicus, peptoniphilus ivorii and peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. fourteen type strains representing 14 gpac species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex pcr (multiplex pcr-g). since three of these genera (finegoldia, micromonas and peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, f. magna, m. micros and p. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex pcr-g. then six species of the genus anaerococcus (a. hydrogenalis, a. lactolyticus, a. octavius, a. prevotii, a. vaginalis and a. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex pcr assays (multiplex pcr-ia and multiplex pcr-ib). similarly, five species of the genus peptoniphilus (pn. asaccharolyticus, pn. harei, pn. indolicus, pn. ivorii and pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex pcr-iia and multiplex pcr-iib. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of gpac species that had been identified previously to the  species level by 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic tests. the identification obtained from multiplex pcr assays showed 100 % agreement with 16s rdna sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of gpac species. it will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various gpac species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.

AB  == background: telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of l-cladinose and a c(11)-c(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. we evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. methods: in the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against  180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), finegoldia magna (n = 20), bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin a, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. in the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by b. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). results: in the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of s. agalactiae, e. faecalis, n. gonorrhoeae, p. anaerobius, f. magna, b. fragilis and p. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. in the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. conclusions: these in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.

TI  == physical and genetic map of the finegoldia magna (formerly peptostreptococcus magnus) atcc 29328 genome.
AB  == a physical and genetic map of finegoldia magna (formerly peptostreptococcus magnus) atcc 29328 chromosome was constructed. the order of rare cleavage restriction fragments was determined by double digestion with the restriction enzymes i-ceui, sgrai, apai and pmei, cross-hybridization and apai-linking clones. the size of the circular chromosome of f. magna was estimated to be 1.9 mb. this strain also had a 200-kb megaplasmid. the chromosome contained four rrn  operons, and the orientation of two rrn operons was opposite to the others. fragment analysis of peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc 27337(t) chromosome suggested that its size was much smaller than that of f. magna atcc 29328.
