TI  == a c69-family cysteine dipeptidase from lactobacillus farciminis jcm1097 possesses strong gly-pro hydrolytic activity.
AB  == dipeptide gly-pro, a hard-to-degrade and collagenous peptide, is thought to be hydrolysed by prolidases that can work on various x-pro dipeptides. here, we found an entirely different type of dipeptidase from lactobacillus farciminis jcm1097 that cleaves gly-pro far more efficiently and with higher specificity than prolidases, and then investigated its properties by use of a recombinant enzyme. although l. farciminis dipeptidase was expressed in the form of an inclusion body in escherichia coli at 37 degrees c, it was smoothly over-expressed in a soluble form at a lower temperature. the maximal gly-pro hydrolytic activity was attained in e. coli at 30 degrees c. in contrast to prolidases that are metallopeptidases showing the modest or marginal activity toward gly-pro, this l. farciminis dipeptidase belongs to the cysteine peptidase  family c69. lactobacillus farciminis dipeptidase occurs in cytoplasm and utilizes the side chain of an amino-terminal cysteine residue to perform the nucleophilic  attack on the target amide bond between gly-pro after processing eight amino acid residues at the n-terminus. furthermore, l. farciminis dipeptidase is potent enough to synthesize gly-pro from gly and pro by a reverse reaction. these novel  properties could be revealed by virtue of the success in preparing recombinant enzymes in higher yield and in a stable form.

TI  == in vitro characterization of aggregation and adhesion properties of viable and heat-killed forms of two probiotic lactobacillus strains and interaction with foodborne zoonotic bacteria, especially campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == bacterial aggregation and/or adhesion are key factors for colonization of the digestive ecosystem and the ability of probiotic strains to exclude pathogens. in the present study, two probiotic strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lactobacillus farciminis cncm-i-3699, were evaluated as viable or heat-killed forms and compared with probiotic reference lactobacillus strains (lb. rhamnosus  gg and lb. farciminis cip 103136). the autoaggregation potential of both forms was higher than that of reference strains and twice that of pathogenic strains. the coaggregation potential of these two beneficial micro-organisms was evaluated against several pathogenic agents that threaten the global safety of the feed/food chain: escherichia coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and listeria monocytogenes. the strongest coaggregative interactions were demonstrated with campylobacter spp. by a coaggregation test, confirmed by electron microscopic examination for the two forms. viable forms were investigated for the nature of the bacterial cell-surface molecules involved, by  sugar reversal tests and chemical and enzymic pretreatments. the results suggest  that the coaggregation between both probiotic strains and c. jejuni cip 70.2(t) is mediated by a carbohydrate-lectin interaction. the autoaggregation potential of the two probiotics decreased upon exposure to proteinase, sds or licl, showing that proteinaceous components on the surface of the two lactobacilli play an important role in this interaction. adhesion abilities of both lactobacillus strains were also demonstrated at significant levels on caco-2 cells, mucin and extracellular matrix material. both viable and heat-killed forms of the two probiotic lactobacilli inhibited the attachment of c. jejuni cip 70.2(t) to mucin. in conclusion, in vitro assays showed that lb. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lb. farciminis cncm-i-3699, as viable or heat-killed forms, are adherent to different intestinal matrix models and are highly aggregative in vitro with pathogens, especially campylobacter spp., the most commonly reported zoonotic agent in the european union. this study supports the need for further in vivo investigations to demonstrate the potential food safety benefits of lb. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lb. farciminis cncm-i-3699, live or heat-killed, in the global feed/food chain.

TI  == structural similarity and distribution of small cryptic plasmids of lactobacillus curvatus and l. sake.
AB  == plasmid profiles of strains of lactobacillus curvatus and l. sake isolated from meat or sauerkraut were analysed to investigate plasmid homology and distribution in relation to the ecology of these organisms in fermenting foods. a hybridisation probe was constructed by cloning of plc2, a cryptic, 2.6-kbp plasmid from l. curvatus lth683, into the escherichia coli plasmid prv50. in southern hybridisations with the digoxygenine labeled plc2 probe, plc2-related small plasmids were frequently detected in meat-borne strains of l. casei subsp.  pseudoplantarum, l. curvatus, l. sake, l. alimentarius, l. farciminis and l. halotolerans and in l. curvatus and l. sake isolated from sauerkraut. among 27 lactobacillus type strains originally isolated from habitats other than meat this type of homology was detected only with plasmids of l. buchneri and l. mali. restriction-enzyme mapping of six small cryptic plasmids from l. curvatus and l.  sake revealed strong structural homology but no similarity to previously characterized plasmids of lactobacilli. the presence of a variable region in addition to a conserved one and the occurrence of deletions during cloning of plc2 suggest that vectors derived from these plasmids are likely to be structurally unstable.
