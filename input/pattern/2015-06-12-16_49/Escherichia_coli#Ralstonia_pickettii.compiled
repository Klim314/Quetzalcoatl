TI  - Assessment of copper and zinc salts as selectors of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Some metals are nowadays considered environmental pollutants. Although some, like Cu and Zn, are essential for microorganisms, at high concentrations they can be toxic or exert selective pressures on bacteria. This study aimed to assess the potential of Cu or Zn as selectors of specific bacterial populations thriving in wastewater. Populations of Escherichia coli recovered on metal-free and metal-supplemented culture medium were compared based on antibiotic resistance phenotype and other traits. In addition, the bacterial groups enriched after successive transfers in metal-supplemented culture medium were identified. At a concentration of 1mM, Zn produced a stronger inhibitory effect than Cu on the culturability of Enterobacteriaceae. It was suggested that Zn selected populations with increased resistance prevalence to sulfamethoxazole or ciprofloxacin. In non-selective culture media, Zn or Cu selected for mono-species populations of ubiquitous Betaproteobacteria and Flavobacteriia, such as Ralstonia pickettii or Elizabethkingia anophelis, yielding multidrug resistance profiles including resistance against carbapenems and third generation cephalosporins, confirming the potential of Cu or Zn as selectors of antibiotic resistant bacteria.
TI  - Saturation mutagenesis of Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1 toluene 4-monooxygenase at alpha-subunit residues proline 101, proline 103, and histidine 214 for regiospecific oxidation of aromatics.
AB  - A novel toluene monooxygenase (TMO) six-gene cluster from Bradyrhizobium sp. BTAi1 having an overall 35, 36, and 38 % protein similarity with toluene o-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) of Pseudomonas sp. OX1, toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, and toluene-para-monooxygenase (TpMO) of Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, respectively, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli TG1, and its potential activity was investigated for aromatic hydroxylation and trichloroethylene (TCE) degradation. The natural substrate toluene was hydroxylated to p-cresol, indicating that the new toluene monooxygenase (T4MO.BTAi1) acts as a para hydroxylating enzyme, similar to T4MO and TpMO. Some shifts in regiospecific hydroxylations were observed compared to the other wild-type TMOs. For example, wild-type T4MO.BTAi1 formed catechol (88 %) and hydroquinone (12 %) from phenol, whereas all the other wild-type TMOs were reported to form only catechol. Furthermore, it was discovered that TG1 cells expressing wild-type T4MO.BTAi1 mineralized TCE at a rate of 0.67 +/- 0.10 nmol Cl(-)/h/mg protein. Saturation and site directed mutagenesis were used to generate eight variants of T4MO.BTAi1 at alpha-subunit positions P101, P103, and H214: P101T/P103A, P101S, P101N/P103T, P101V, P103T, P101V/P103T, H214G, and H214G/D278N; by testing the substrates phenol, nitrobenzene, and naphthalene, positions P101 and P103 were found to influence the regiospecific oxidation of aromatics. For example, compared to wild type, variant P103T produced four fold more m-nitrophenol from nitrobenzene as well as produced mainly resorcinol (60 %) from phenol whereas wild-type T4MO.BTAi1 did not. Similarly, variants P101T/P103A and P101S synthesized more 2-naphthol and 2.3-fold and 1.6-fold less 1-naphthol from naphthalene, respectively.
TI  - Directed evolution of poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] depolymerase using cell surface display system: functional importance of asparagine at position 285.
AB  - Poly[(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate] (PHB) depolymerase from Ralstonia pickettii T1 (PhaZRpiT1) consists of three functional domains to effectively degrade solid PHB materials, and its catalytic domain catalyzes the ester bond cleavage of the substrate. We performed the directed evolution of PhaZRpiT1 targeted at the catalytic domain in combination with the cell surface display method to effectively screen for mutants with improved p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPC4) activity. Mutated PhaZRpiT1 genes generated by error-prone PCR were fused to the oprI gene to display them as fusion proteins on Escherichia coli cell surface. Some cells displaying the mutant enzymes showed a two- to fourfold increase in pNPC4 hydrolysis activity relative to cells displaying wild-type enzyme. These mutant genes were recombined by a staggered extension process and the recombined enzymes were displayed to result in a five- to eightfold higher pNPC4 hydrolysis activity than the wild type. To further evaluate the mutation effects, unfused and undisplayed enzymes were prepared and applied to the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters having different chain lengths (pNPCn; n = 2-6) and PHB degradation. One specific second-generation mutant showed an approximately tenfold increase in maximum rate for pNPC3 hydrolysis, although its PHB degradation efficiency at 1 mug/mL of enzyme concentration was approximately 3.5-fold lower than that of the wild type. Gene analysis showed that N285D or N285Y mutations were found in six of the seven improved second-generation mutants, indicating that Asn285 probably participates in the regulation of substrate recognition and may be more favorable for PHB degradation process than other amino acid residues.
TI  - Analysis of two gene clusters involved in 2,4,6-trichlorophenol degradation by Ralstonia pickettii DTP0602.
AB  - Ralstonia pickettii DTP0602 utilizes 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (2,4,6-TCP) as sole source of carbon and energy. We have characterized hadABC which is involved in the degradation of 2,4,6-TCP. To identify the other genes involved in 2,4,6-TCP degradation, the DNA sequence around hadABC was determined. A regulatory gene, hadR, homologous to the LysR-type transcriptional regulator was located upstream of hadA, but no maleylacetate (MA) reductase gene was located near hadABC. An 8.4-kb DNA fragment containing a MA reductase gene, hadD, was cloned using a DNA probe designed from the N-terminal sequence of purified MA reductase. hadD was located upstream of an open reading frame, hadS, which codes for a homolog of the LysR-type transcriptional regulator. A hadS insertion mutant, DTP62S, constitutively expressed MA reductase when grown on aspartate in the absence of 2,4,6-TCP. MA reductase was repressed in DTP62S supplemented with hadS. HadR and HadS are proposed to be a positive and a negative regulator, respectively. A draft genome sequence analysis revealed that the hadRXABC and hadSYD clusters were separated by 146-kb on the 8.1-Mb chromosome.
TI  - Characterization of a novel copper-haem c dissimilatory nitrite reductase from Ralstonia pickettii.
AB  - NiRs (nitrite reductases) convert nitrite into NO in the denitrification process. RpNiR (Ralstonia pickettii NiR), a new type of dissimilatory Cu-containing NiR with a C-terminal haem c domain from R. pickettii, has been cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The enzyme has a subunit molecular mass of 50515 Da, consistent with sequence data showing homology to the well-studied two-domain Cu NiRs, but with an attached C-terminal haem c domain. Gel filtration and combined SEC (size-exclusion chromatography)-SAXS (small angle X-ray scattering) analysis shows the protein to be trimeric. The metal content of RpNiR is consistent with each monomer having a single haem c group and the two Cu sites being metallated by Cu(2+) ions. The absorption spectrum of the oxidized as-isolated recombinant enzyme is dominated by the haem c. X-band EPR spectra have clear features arising from both type 1 Cu and type 2 Cu centres in addition to those of low-spin ferric haem. The requirements for activity and low apparent K(m) for nitrite are similar to other CuNiRs (Cu-centre NiRs). However, EPR and direct binding measurements of nitrite show that oxidized RpNiR binds nitrite very weakly, suggesting that substrate binds to the reduced type 2 Cu site during turnover. Analysis of SEC-SAXS data suggests that the haem c domains in RpNiR form extensions into the solvent, conferring a high degree of conformational flexibility in solution. SAXS data yield R(g) (gyration radius) and D(max) (maximum particle diameter) values of 43.4 A (1 A=0.1 nm) and 154 A compared with 28 A and 80 A found for the two-domain CuNiR of Alcaligenes xylosoxidans.
TI  - Specific inhibition of bacterial RNase T2 by helix 41 of 16S ribosomal RNA.
AB  - Ribonuclease (RNase) T2 is involved in scavenging exogenous RNAs in the periplasmic space of bacteria. In Escherichia coli, although the 30S ribosomal subunit has long been known as a specific inhibitor of RNase T2 (designated as RNase I in E. coli), both the biochemical mechanisms and physiological roles of this interaction remain to be elucidated. Here we show, by creating hybrid ribosomes and mutational studies, that helix 41 (h41) of the E. coli 16S ribosomal RNA has a crucial role in the specific inhibition of RNase I. Notably, h41-mutant strains exhibit a lower survival rate at stationary phase and severe cell lysis when the post-segregation killing protein SrnB is expressed. These phenotypic defects accompany significant RNA degradation caused by RNase I. Thus, h41 in 16S rRNA provides a physiological benefit for the host cells in coping with the potential cytotoxicity of RNase T2.
TI  - Display of functionally active PHB depolymerase on Escherichia coli cell surface.
AB  - The display of PHB depolymerase (PhaZ(RpiT1) ) from R. pickettii T1 on the surface of E. coli JM109 cells is realized using OprI of P. aeruginosa as the anchoring motif. The fusion protein is stably expressed and its surface localization is verified by immunofluorescence microscopy. The displayed PhaZ(RpiT1) retains its cleaving ability for soluble substrates as well as its ability to adsorb to the PHB surface, and also remains catalycically active in the degradation of insoluble polyester materials, in spite of the possible suppression of the enzyme movement on the polymer surface. The results demonstrate that PhaZ(RpiT1) -displaying E. coli shows potential for use as a whole-cell biocatalyst for the production of (R)-3-hydroxybutyrate monomers from insoluble PHB materials.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid pD403 from Lactobacillus plantarum and construction of shuttle vectors based on its replicon.
AB  - A cryptic plasmid pD403 was isolated from Lactobacillus plantarum D403 derived from fermented dairy products. It was 2,791 bp in size with a G+C content of 37%. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two open reading frames, orf1 and orf2. ORF1 (318 amino acids) was identified as a replication protein (RepA). ORF2 (137 amino acids) shared 31% similarity with the transcriptional regulator of Ralstonia pickettii 12D. Functional investigation indicated that ORF2 (Tra) had the ability of improving the transformation efficiency. The origin of replication was predicted, suggesting that pD403 was a rolling-circle-replication (RCR) plasmid. An Escherichia coli/Lactobacillus shuttle vector pCD4032 was constructed based on the pD403 replicon, and proved to be successfully transformed into various lactobacilli including Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, and Lactobacillus brevis. The transformation efficiencies were ranged from 1.3 x 10(2) to 7 x 10(4) transformants per microgram DNA. Furthermore, an expression vector pCD4033 was developed with the promoter of the lactate dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus delbrueckii 11842. The green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a reporter was expressed successfully in various lactobacilli tested, suggesting that the expression vector pCD4033 had the potential to be used as a molecular tool for heterologous gene cloning and expression in lactobacilli.
TI  - Metagenomics reveals diversity and abundance of meta-cleavage pathways in microbial communities from soil highly contaminated with jet fuel under air-sparging bioremediation.
AB  - The extradiol dioxygenase diversity of a site highly contaminated with aliphatic  and aromatic hydrocarbons under air-sparging treatment was assessed by functional screening of a fosmid library in Escherichia coli with catechol as substrate. The 235 positive clones from inserts of DNA extracted from contaminated soil were equivalent to one extradiol dioxygenase-encoding gene per 3.6 Mb of DNA screened, indicating a strong selection for genes encoding this function. Three subfamilies were identified as being predominant, with 72, 55 and 43 fosmid inserts carrying genes, related to those encoding TbuE of Ralstonia pickettii PK01 (EXDO-D), IpbC of Pseudomonas sp. JR1 (EXDO-K2) or DbtC of Burkholderia sp. DBT1 (EXDO-Dbt), respectively, whereas genes encoding enzymes related to XylE of Pseudomonas putida mt-2 were not observed. Genes encoding oxygenases related to isopropylbenzene dioxygenases were usually colocalized with genes encoding EXDO-K2 dioxygenases. Functional analysis of representative proteins indicated a subcluster of EXDO-D proteins to show exceptional high affinity towards different catecholic substrates. Based on V(max)/K(m) specificity constants, a task-sharing between different extradiol dioxygenases in the community of the contaminated site can be supposed, attaining a complementary and community-balanced catalytic power against diverse catecholic derivatives, as necessary for effective degradation of mixtures of aromatics.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical analyses of chlorobenzene degradation gene clusters in Pandoraea sp. strain MCB032.
AB  - Pandoraea sp. strain MCB032 was isolated as an emerging chlorobenzene degrader from a functionally stable bioreactor where species succession had occurred. In this study, two gene clusters encoding chlorobenzene metabolic functions have been cloned. Within the cbs gene cluster, CbsA and CbsB are similar to the chlorobenzene dioxygenase and the cis-chlorobenzene dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in Ralstonia sp. JS705 and shown to transform chlorobenzene to 3-chlorocatechol. The clc gene cluster shows strong similarity to the clc genes of Ralstonia sp. JS705 and encodes chlorocatechol 1,2-dioxygenase (ClcA) and other enzymes, which catalyze the conversion of chlorocatechol to 3-oxoadipate. The Michaelis constants (K (m)) values of ClcA for catechol, 3-methylcatechol and 3-chlorocatechol were determined as 10.0, 8.9 and 3.4 muM, respectively. CbsX, a putative transport protein present in the cbs cluster of strain MCB032 but not in those of other chlorobenzene degraders, shows 76 and 53% identities to two previously identified transport proteins involved in toluene degradation, TbuX from Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 and TodX from Pseudomonas putida F1. The presence of the transport protein in strain MCB032 likely provides a mechanistic explanation for its higher chlorobenzene affinity and may well be the basis for the competitive advantage of this strain in the bioreactor.
TI  - Outer-membrane transport of aromatic hydrocarbons as a first step in biodegradation.
AB  - Bacterial biodegradation of hydrocarbons, an important process for environmental  remediation, requires the passage of hydrophobic substrates across the cell membrane. Here, we report crystal structures of two outer membrane proteins, Pseudomonas putida TodX and Ralstonia pickettii TbuX, which have been implicated in hydrocarbon transport and are part of a subfamily of the FadL fatty acid transporter family. The structures of TodX and TbuX show significant differences with those previously determined for Escherichia coli FadL, which may provide an explanation for the substrate-specific transport of TodX and TbuX observed with in vivo transport assays. The TodX and TbuX structures revealed 14-stranded beta-barrels with an N-terminal hatch domain blocking the barrel interior. A hydrophobic channel with bound detergent molecules extends from the extracellular surface and is contiguous with a passageway through the hatch domain, lined by both hydrophobic and polar or charged residues. The TodX and TbuX structures support a mechanism for transport of hydrophobic substrates from the extracellular environment to the periplasm via a channel through the hatch domain.
TI  - Kinetics of 1,4-dioxane biodegradation by monooxygenase-expressing bacteria.
AB  - 1,4-Dioxane is a probable human carcinogen, and an important emerging water contaminant. In this study, the biodegradation of dioxane by 20 bacterial isolates was evaluated, and 13 were found to be capable of transforming dioxane. Dioxane served as a growth substrate for Pseudonocardia dioxanivorans CB1190 and Pseudonocardia benzenivorans B5, with yields of 0.09 g protein g dioxane(-1) and 0.03 g protein g dioxane(-1), respectively. Cometabolic transformation of dioxane was observed for monooxygenase-expressing strains that were induced with methane, propane, tetrahydrofuran, or toluene including Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, Mycobacterium vaccae JOB5, Pseudonocardia K1, Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, Burkholderia cepacia G4, and Rhodococcus RR1. Product toxicity resulted in incomplete dioxane degradation for many of the cometabolic reactions. Brief exposure to acetylene, a known monooxygenase inhibitor, prevented oxidation of dioxane in all cases, supporting the hypothesis that monooxygenase enzymes participated in the transformation of dioxane by these strains. Further, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene-2- and toluene-4-monooxygenases of G4, KR1 and PKO1 were also capable of cometabolic dioxane transformation. Dioxane oxidation rates measured at 50 mg/L ranged from 0.01 to 0.19 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for the metabolic processes, 0.1-0.38 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for cometabolism by the monooxygenase-induced strains, and 0.17-0.60 mg hr(-1) mg protein(-1) for the recombinant strains. Dioxane was not degraded by M. trichosporium OB3b expressing particulate methane monooxygenase, Pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing a toluene side-chain monooxygenase, and PseudomonasJS150 and Pseudomonas putida F1 expressing toluene-2,3-dioxygenases. This is the first study to definitively show the role of monooxygenases in dioxane degradation using several independent lines of evidence and to describe the kinetics of metabolic and cometabolic dioxane degradation.
TI  - Characterization of two 3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenases in poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)-degradable bacterium, Ralstonia pickettii T1.
AB  - Two D-(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) dehydrogenases, BDH1 and BDH2, were isolated and purified from a poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB)-degradable bacterium, Ralstonia pickettii T1. BDH1 activity increased in R. pickettii T1 cells grown on several organic acids as a carbon source but not on 3HB, whereas BDH2 activity markedly increased in the same cells grown on 3HB or PHB. To examine their biochemical properties, bdh1 and bdh2 were cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and their purified products were characterized. The kinetic parameters indicate that BDH1 is more suitable for converting acetoacetate to 3HB than BDH2, whereas BDH2 is more efficient for the reverse reaction than BDH1. Thus, R. pickettii T1 contains two BDHs with different biochemical properties and physiological roles: BDH1 for cell growth on organic acids other than 3HB and BDH2 for cell growth on 3HB or PHB.
TI  - Cloning of an intracellular D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate-oligomer hydrolase gene from Ralstonia eutropha H16 and identification of the active site serine residue by site-directed mutagenesis.
AB  - An intracellular D(-)-3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB)-oligomer hydrolase gene from Ralstonia eutropha (formerly Alcaligenes eutrophus) H16 was cloned, sequenced, and characterized. As a hybridization probe to screen restriction digests of chromosomal DNA, an extracellular 3HB-oligomer hydrolase gene from Ralstonia pickettii strain (formerly Pseudomonas sp. strain) A1 was used. A specific hybridization signal was obtained and a 6.5-kbp SmaI fragment was cloned in an Escherichia coli phagemid vector. The crude extract from E. coli with this plasmid showed 3HB-trimer hydrolase activity. The subcloned 3.2-kbp fragment still showed 3HB-trimer hydrolase activity in E. coli and expressed an approximately 78-kDa protein in an in vitro transcription-translation system. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 3.2-kbp fragment showed an open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide with a deduced molecular weight of 78,510. The putative amino acid sequence showed 54% identity with that of the oligomer hydrolase from R. pickettii A1. By site-directed mutagenesis, a novel amino acid sequence (S-V-S*-N-G) containing an essential serine residue in the catalytic center of the enzyme was determined. The gene product was found in PHB-rich cells of R. eutropha by immunodetection. The expressed 3HB-oligomer hydrolase localized both in the supernatant fraction and the PHB granules of the cells.
TI  - Cloning and sequence analysis of hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase gene in 2,4,6-trichlorophenol-degrading Ralstonia pickettii DTP0602 and characterization of its product.
AB  - A gene encoding hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase was cloned from 2,4,6-trichlorophenol-degrading Ralstonia (Pseudomonas) pickettii strain DTP0602. Cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli containing a cloned 1.4-kb StuI-XhoI DNA fragment of R. pickettii DTP0602 hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase converted hydroxyquinol into maleylacetate and also degraded 6-chlorohydroxyquinol. The 1.4-kb DNA fragment contained one open reading frame (designated hadC) composed of 948 nucleotides. The molecular mass of 34,591 deduced from the gene product (HadC) was in agreement with the size (35 kDa) of the purified HadC protein determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The amino acid sequence of HadC exhibited high homology to that of the hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid-degrading Burkholderia cepacia AC1100 (Daubaras, D. L. et al., Appl. Environ. Microbiol., 61, 1279-1289, 1995). The active enzyme had a molecular mass of 68 kDa, suggesting that it is functional as a homodimer. The enzyme also catalyzed the oxidation of pyrogallol and 3-methylcatechol, possible intermediates in the degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, in addition to 6-chlorohydroxyquinol and hydroxyquinol. The dioxygenase catalyzed both ortho- and meta-cleavage of 3-methylcatechol.
TI  - Properties of a novel intracellular poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) depolymerase with high specific activity (PhaZd) in Wautersia eutropha H16.
AB  - A novel intracellular poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) depolymerase (PhaZd) of Wautersia eutropha (formerly Ralstonia eutropha) H16 which shows similarity with the catalytic domain of the extracellular PHB depolymerase in Ralstonia pickettii T1 was identified. The positions of the catalytic triad (Ser190-Asp266-His330) and oxyanion hole (His108) in the amino acid sequence of PhaZd deduced from the nucleotide sequence roughly accorded with those of the extracellular PHB depolymerase of R. pickettii T1, but a signal peptide, a linker domain, and a substrate binding domain were missing. The PhaZd gene was cloned and the gene product was purified from Escherichia coli. The specific activity of PhaZd toward artificial amorphous PHB granules was significantly greater than that of other known intracellular PHB depolymerase or 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) oligomer hydrolases of W. eutropha H16. The enzyme degraded artificial amorphous PHB granules and mainly released various 3-hydroxybutyrate oligomers. PhaZd distributed nearly equally between PHB inclusion bodies and the cytosolic fraction. The amount of PHB was greater in phaZd deletion mutant cells than the wild-type cells under various culture conditions. These results indicate that PhaZd is a novel intracellular PHB depolymerase which participates in the mobilization of PHB in W. eutropha H16 along with other PHB depolymerases.
TI  - Regiospecific oxidation of naphthalene and fluorene by toluene monooxygenases and engineered toluene 4-monooxygenases of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1.
AB  - The regiospecific oxidation of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons naphthalene and fluorene was examined with Escherichia coli strains expressing wildtype toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) from Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, toluene para-monooxygenase (TpMO) from Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) from Burkholderia cepacia G4, and toluene/ortho-xylene monooxygenase (ToMO) from P. stutzeri OX1. T4MO oxidized toluene (12.1+/-0.8 nmol/min/mg protein at 109 microM), naphthalene (7.7+/-1.5 nmol/min/mg protein at 5 mM), and fluorene (0.68+/-0.04 nmol/min/mg protein at 0.2 mM) faster than the other wildtype enzymes (2-22-fold) and produced a mixture of 1-naphthol (52%) and 2-naphthol (48%) from naphthalene, which was successively transformed to a mixture of 2,3-, 2,7-, 1,7-, and 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalenes (7%, 10%, 20%, and 63%, respectively). TOM and ToMO made 1,7-dihydroxynaphthalene from 1-naphthol, and ToMO made a mixture of 2,3-, 2,6-, 2,7-, and 1,7-dihydroxynaphthalene (26%, 22%, 1%, and 44%, respectively) from 2-naphthol. TOM had no activity on 2-naphthol, and T4MO had no activity on 1-naphthol. To take advantage of the high activity of wildtype T4MO but to increase its regiospecificity on naphthalene, seven engineered enzymes containing mutations in T4MO alpha hydroxylase TmoA were examined; the selectivity for 2-naphthol by T4MO I100A, I100S, and I100G was enhanced to 88-95%, and the selectivity for 1-naphthol was enhanced to 87% and 99% by T4MO I100L and G103S/A107G, respectively, while high oxidation rates were maintained except for G103S/A107G. Therefore, the regiospecificity for naphthalene oxidation was altered to practically pure 1-naphthol or 2-naphthol. All four wildtype monooxygenases were able to oxidize fluorene to different monohydroxylated products; T4MO oxidized fluorene successively to 3-hydroxyfluorene and 3,6-dihydroxyfluorene, which was confirmed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. TOM and its variant TomA3 V106A oxidize fluorene to a mixture of 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyfluorene. This is the first report of using enzymes to synthesize 1-, 3-, and 4-hydroxyfluorene, and 3,6-dihydroxyfluorene from fluorene as well as 2-naphthol and 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene from naphthalene.
TI  - Aerobic biodegradation of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) by axenic bacterial strains.
AB  - The water contaminant N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a probable human carcinogen whose appearance in the environment is related to the release of rocket fuel and to chlorine-based disinfection of water and wastewater. Although this compound has been shown to be biodegradable, there is minimal information about the organisms capable of this degradation, and little is understood of the mechanisms or biochemistry involved. This study shows that bacteria expressing monooxygenase enzymes functionally similar to those demonstrated to degrade NDMA in eukaryotes have the capability to degrade NDMA. Specifically, induction of the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) expressed by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, the propane monooxygenase (PMO) enzyme of Mycobacterium vaccae JOB-5, and the toluene 4-monooxygenases found in Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 and Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 resulted in NDMA degradation by these strains. In each of these cases, brief exposure to acetylene gas, a suicide substrate for certain monooxygenases, inhibited the degradation of NDMA. Further, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan) containing recombinant plasmids derived from the toluene monooxygenases found in strains PKO1 and KR1 mimicked the behavior of the parent strains. In contrast, M. trichosporium OB3b expressing the particulate form of MMO, Burkholderia cepacia G4 expressing the toluene 2-monooxygenase, and Pseudomonas putida mt-2 expressing the toluene sidechain monooxygenase were not capable of NDMA degradation. In addition, bacteria expressing aromatic dioxygenases were not capable of NDMA degradation. Finally, Rhodococcus sp. RR1 exhibited the ability to degrade NDMA by an unidentified, constitutively expressed enzyme that, unlike the confirmed monooxygenases, was not inhibited by acetylene exposure.
TI  - Oxidation of benzene to phenol, catechol, and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene by toluene  4-monooxygenase of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 and toluene 3-monooxygenase of Ralstonia pickettii PKO1.
AB  - Aromatic hydroxylations are important bacterial metabolic processes but are difficult to perform using traditional chemical synthesis, so to use a biological catalyst to convert the priority pollutant benzene into industrially relevant intermediates, benzene oxidation was investigated. It was discovered that toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1, toluene 3-monooxygenase (T3MO) of Ralstonia pickettii PKO1, and toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) of Burkholderia cepacia G4 convert benzene to phenol, catechol, and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene by successive hydroxylations. At a concentration of 165 microM and under the control of a constitutive lac promoter, Escherichia coli TG1/pBS(Kan)T4MO expressing T4MO formed phenol from benzene at 19 +/- 1.6 nmol/min/mg of protein, catechol from phenol at 13.6 +/- 0.3 nmol/min/mg of protein, and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene from catechol at 2.5 +/- 0.5nmol/min/mg of protein. The catechol and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene products were identified by both high-pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. When analogous plasmid constructs were used, E. coli TG1/pBS(Kan)T3MO expressing T3MO formed phenol, catechol, and 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene at rates of 3 +/- 1, 3.1 +/- 0.3, and 0.26 +/- 0.09 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively, and E. coli TG1/pBS(Kan)TOM expressing TOM formed 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene at a rate of 1.7 +/- 0.3 nmol/min/mg of protein (phenol and catechol formation rates were 0.89 +/- 0.07 and 1.5 +/- 0.3 nmol/min/mg of protein, respectively). Hence, the rates of synthesis of catechol by both T3MO and T4MO and the 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene formation rate by TOM were found to be comparable to the rates of oxidation of the natural substrate toluene for these enzymes (10.0 +/- 0.8, 4.0 +/- 0.6, and 2.4 +/- 0.3 nmol/min/mg of protein for T4MO, T3MO, and TOM, respectively, at a toluene concentration of 165 microM).
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and overexpression in Escherichia coli of a phenylserine dehydratase gene from Ralstonia pickettii PS22.
AB  - The structural gene coding for phenylserine dehydratase from Ralstonia pickettii  PS22 was cloned into Escherichia coli cells, and the nucleotide sequence was identified. The predicted amino acid sequence had high sequence similarity to biodegradative and biosynthetic threonine dehydratases from E. coli and serine dehydratase from human liver. Transformed E. coli cells overproduced phenylserine dehydratase, and the recombinant enzyme was purified to homogeneity with a high yield and characterized.
TI  - Endotoxin levels in steam and reservoirs of table-top steam sterilizers.
AB  - PURPOSE: To document endotoxin levels in "Statim" cassette sterilizer reservoirs  and in steam delivered to the cassette in the unwrapped instrument cycle. To document endotoxin levels in sterilizer reservoir water using different management protocols. METHODS: Endotoxin levels were determined using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate test. Endotoxin preparations were from Escherichia coli and Ralstonia pickettii. All samples were collected in depyrogenated glassware and stored at -20 degrees C until assayed. RESULTS: The majority of water samples contained < 1.0 Endotoxin Unit (EU)/ml. The highest level found in sterilizers in clinical use was 5.3 EU/ml. Endotoxin was not detected in steam condensate within the limits of the assay. When the endotoxin level in the reservoir water was experimentally enhanced to 200 EU/ml, cassette steam condensate endotoxin levels were from 0.5% to 5% of the reservoir level. Daily and weekly emptying of the cassette reservoir consistently yielded low endotoxin levels as did monthly emptying, but with the latter there was a trend toward higher levels that favors weekly emptying as a precautionary measure. CONCLUSIONS: Endotoxin levels in the reservoirs of 23 sterilizers involving 240 samplings were never high enough to yield detectable endotoxin levels in steam in the sterilizer cassette. Regular weekly emptying of sterilizer reservoirs would eliminate the risk of endotoxin transfer during steam sterilization.
TI  - Characterization and role of tbuX in utilization of toluene by Ralstonia pickettii PKO1.
AB  - The tbu regulon of Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 encodes enzymes involved in the catabolism of toluene, benzene, and related alkylaromatic hydrocarbons. The first operon in this regulon contains genes that encode the tbu pathway's initial catabolic enzyme, toluene-3-monooxygenase, as well as TbuT, the NtrC-like transcriptional activator for the entire regulon. It has been previously shown that the organization of tbuT, which is located immediately downstream of tbuA1UBVA2C, and the associated promoter (PtbuA1) is unique in that it results in a cascade type of up-regulation of tbuT in response to a variety of effector compounds. In our efforts to further characterize this unusual mode of gene regulation, we discovered another open reading frame, encoded on the strand opposite that of tbuT, 63 bp downstream of the tbuT stop codon. The 1,374-bp open reading frame, encoding a 458-amino-acid peptide, was designated tbuX. The predicted amino acid sequence of TbuX exhibited significant similarity to several putative outer membrane proteins from aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria, as well as to FadL, an outer membrane protein needed for uptake of long-chain fatty acids in Escherichia coli. Based on sequence analysis, transcriptional and expression studies, and deletion analysis, TbuX seems to play an important role in the catabolism of toluene in R. pickettii PKO1. In addition, the expression of tbuX appears to be regulated in a manner such that low levels of TbuX are always present within the cell, whereas upon toluene exposure these levels dramatically increase, even more than those of toluene-3-monooxygenase. This expression pattern may relate to the possible role of TbuX as a facilitator of toluene entry into the cell.
