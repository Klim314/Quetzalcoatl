TI  - [Balanitis and infectious agents. A prospective study of 100 cases].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was: 1) to evaluate the rate of micro-organism isolation in 100 patients consulting for balanitis at the Centre of sexually transmitted diseases at the St. Louis Hospital in Paris in comparison with that of micro-organisms isolated in 60 men without balanitis; 2) to search for a possible correlation between the clinical aspect of the disease and the nature of the infectious agent identified. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients were included in the study. All underwent a clinical examination and samples were taken for bacteriology, mycology and virology examinations. Sixty healthy volunteers served as controls. Two samples were taken from the balanopreputial groove in search for fungi and bacteria. RESULTS: Candida albicans (CA) was isolated in 33 p. 100 of the patients. A pathogenic bacteria (beta-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella), or a potentially pathogenic germ (Haemophilus parainfluenzae, anaerobic bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, Streptococcus milleri, group HB5) was found without CA in 28 p. 100 of the cases, a commensal flora (enterobacteria, group D streptococci) was found without CA in 8 p. 100 and in 31 p. 100 of the cases non causal agent could be identified. DISCUSSION: This series confirms the non-pathogenic nature of commensal bacteria: the number of isolations was similar in the subjects with and without balanitis (p < 0.9). The role played by the other bacteria in the development of balanitis is discussed: saprophytic association or direct pathogenesis? The significant difference in the rate of bacteria isolations in patients with balanitis compared with controls (p < 0.001) is in favour of a pathogenic role. The clinical presentation was not predictive of the presence of any particular micro-organism excepting the presence of pustules which were highly suggestive of candidiasis.
TI  - Clinical and microbiologic features of urethritis in men in Toulouse, France.
AB  - On hundred twenty-six men who attended a hospital microbiology laboratory and 99  men who attended a private laboratory in Toulouse, France, for symptoms of urethritis were examined during 1988, for evidence of urethral pathogens. The following incidences were found: Neisseria gonorrhoeae: 24 (10.7%); Chlamydia trachomatis: 58 (25.8%); Ureaplasma urealyticum: 46 (20.4%); Gardnerella vaginalis: 21 (9.3%); Haemophilus parainfluenzae: 21 (9.3%); Streptococcus agalactiae: 15 (6.7%); Candida albicans: 10 (4.4%); and Trichomonas vaginalis: 4 (1.8%). The prevalence of these microorganisms was similar in the two groups of patients. No pathogen was isolated from 71 patients (31.6%). Mixed infections with at least two pathogens were found in 49 men (21.8%). Another goal of this study was to determine the relative prevalence of urethral pathogens in relation to clinical findings. N. gonorrhoeae was isolated significantly more often in patients who had a urethral discharge (P less than .05) that contained five or more polymorphonuclear cells per high-power field (PMN/HPF) (P less than .001). G. vaginalis was isolated significantly more often in patients who did not have an urethral discharge (P less than .05) and in men with less than five PMN/HPF (P less than .05). Isolation of C. albicans was significantly associated with pruritus (P less than .05) and balanitis (P less than .001). Like the clinical features, the gram-stained urethral smear was of limited value in diagnosis and therapeutic decision-making regarding non-gonococcal urethritis. In contrast, this study underlines the importance of full identification of urethral isolates in the management of urethritis in men.
TI  - Identification of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp., and other fastidious gram-negative bacteria with the MicroScan Haemophilus-Neisseria identification panel.
AB  - The Haemophilus-Neisseria identification (HNID) panel (American MicroScan, Sacramento, Calif.) is a 4-h microdilution format system for identification of Haemophilus and Neisseria spp., Branhamella (Moraxella) catarrhalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis. The HNID panel was evaluated by using 423 clinical isolates and stock strains of these organisms, and HNID identifications were compared with those obtained by conventional methods. In addition, 32 isolates representing six genera not included in the HNID data base were tested to determine whether these organisms would produce unique biotype numbers for possible inclusion in the data base. The HNID panel correctly identified 95.3% of 86 Neisseria gonorrhoeae strains, 96% of 25 G. vaginalis strains, and 100% of 28 Neisseria lactamica strains and 48 B. catarrhalis strains. Only 64.7% of 68 Neisseria meningitidis isolates were identified correctly owing to false-negative or equivocal carbohydrate and/or aminopeptidase reactions. Among the Haemophilus spp., 98.8% of 83 H. influenzae strains, 97.1% of 34 H. parainfluenzae strains, and 80% of 15 H. aphrophilus and H. paraphrophilus strains were correctly identified. Eight strains of Neisseria cinerea, a species not included in the data base, produced profiles identical with those for B. catarrhalis and N. gonorrhoeae. Isolates of other species not included in the data base, including Eikenella corrodens, Kingella spp., and Cardiobacterium hominis, produced unique biochemical reaction patterns on the panel. Modification of interpretative criteria for certain tests, expansion of the data base to include other species, and suggestions for additional confirmatory tests will increase the accuracy and utility of the HNID panel.
TI  - Clinical evaluation of the Vitek Neisseria-Haemophilus Identification card.
AB  - A clinical evaluation of the Vitek Neisseria-Haemophilus Identification (NHI) card (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.) was performed with 480 clinical isolates and stock strains of Neisseria spp., Haemophilus spp., and other fastidious microorganisms included in the data base of the system. Identifications obtained with the NHI card were compared with those determined by conventional methods. The card identified 83.2% of 244 Neisseria spp. and Branhamella catarrhalis, 54.9% of 164 Haemophilus spp., and 84.7% of 72 fastidious gram-negative species with no further testing required. Some isolates produced good confidence-marginal separation identifications, in which the correct identification was listed with one or two other possible identifications and extra tests were required and suggested. When isolates producing good confidence-marginal separation identifications were included, correct identifications of these organism groups increased to 97.1, 92.7, and 94.4%, respectively. Among the commonly isolated microorganisms, the NHI card identified 99.1% of 110 N. gonorrhoeae, 98.5% of 68 N. meningitidis, 93.9% of 98 H. influenzae, and 95.6% of 46 H. parainfluenzae strains. All of these organisms produced excellent to very good confidence level identifications except for H. influenzae biotypes II, III, and VII, for which hemolytic reactions were required for differentiation from H. haemolyticus. The NHI card reliably identified other fastidious gram-negative species, including H. aphrophilus, Eikenella corrodens, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Kingella denitrificans.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition of Haemophilus species, Pasteurella multocida, Actinobacillus Actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus vaginalis (Corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  - The fatty acid composition of 35 Haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-OH-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. The three C18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. This general pattern was also found for most of the other species of Haemophilus examined (H. aegyptius, H. aphrophilus, H. canis, H. gallinarum, H. haemolyticus, and H. parainfluenzae). Small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for H. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species H. paraphrohaemolyticus, H. paraphrophilus and H. suis. Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from H. influenzae. Pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely related to that of Haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the C18 fatty acids. The fatty acid pattern of H. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. This species lacked 3-OH-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.
