TI  - Distinctive Intestinal Lactobacillus Communities in Six-Month-Old Infants From Rural Malawi and South-Western Finland.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to compare the composition and diversity of Lactobacillus microbiota in infants living in Malawi and south-western Finland. METHODS: The composition and diversity of the Lactobacillus group was analyzed in the feces of healthy six-month-old infants living in rural Malawi (n = 44) and south-western Finland (n = 31), using the quantitative polymerase chain reaction method (qPCR) and PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprinting (DGGE). RESULTS: Malawian infants had higher counts of lactobacilli than their Finnish counterparts (7.45 log cells/g vs. 6.86 log cells/g, p < 0.001, respectively) and the Lactobacillus community was richer and more diverse in the Malawian infants. Leuconostoc citreum and Weissella confusa were the predominant species in both study groups, but Malawian infants were more often colonized by these species (100 % vs. 74.2 % p < 0.001; 95.5 % vs. 41.9 %, p < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, Lactobacillus ruminis, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus mucosae were detected more often in the Malawian infants (59.1 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 38.6 % vs. 9.7 %, p = 0.004; 29.5 % vs. 0.0 %, p < 0.001; 22.7 % vs. 3.2 %, p = 0.017, respectively). However, Lactobacillus casei group species were only detected in the Finnish infants. CONCLUSIONS: Malawian infants have a more abundant Lactobacillus microbiota with a distinct composition compared to Finnish infants. The environment, including diet and hygiene, may be among the factors influencing these differences.
TI  - An assessment of adhesion, aggregation and surface charges of Lactobacillus strains derived from the human oral cavity.
AB  - There is limited information concerning the adhesion and aggregation of human oral lactobacilli. In this study, the adhesion of 10 Lactobacillus species was investigated using H357 oral keratinocyte cells as an in vitro model for oral mucosa. Coaggregation with the representative oral pathogen, Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175, and the physicochemical cell properties was also evaluated. The results demonstrated significant variations in adhesion (42-96%) and aggregation (autoaggregation, 14-95%; coaggregation, 19-65%). All strains showed a high affinity for chloroform, and most strains had a moderate-to-high hydrophobicity. All strains, except Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus gasseri, showed a moderate affinity for ethyl acetate. There was a strong association of autoaggregation with coaggregation (rs = 0.883, P < 0.001). The highest mean for autoaggregation (74%) and coaggregation (47%) belonged to the Lact. gasseri strains. Correlations between the adhesion and surface characteristics and aggregation were observed among the Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus paracasei strains; however, there was a variation in the strains properties within and between species. This study indicated that the Lact. gasseri, Lact. fermentum, and Lact. paracasei strains might be potential probiotics for the human oral cavity given their desirable properties. It should also be emphasized that a selective process for probiotic strains is required. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Adhesion to host tissues and bacterial aggregation (auto- and coaggregation) are the highly important criteria for selecting strains with probiotic potential. These abilities are commonly involved with surface-charged characteristics. This is the first study to investigate the oral Lactobacillus species using an oral keratinocyte cell line. Significant results were found for the correlations between the adhesion and surface charge characteristics and for aggregation among certain strains of Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus fermentum and Lactobacillus paracasei. This observation could be useful when collecting background information for the selection of probiotic strains for use in oral health.
TI  - Probiotic and technological properties of Lactobacillus spp. strains from the human stomach in the search for potential candidates against gastric microbial dysbiosis.
AB  - This work characterizes a set of lactobacilli strains isolated from the stomach of healthy humans that might serve as probiotic cultures. Ten different strains were recognized by rep-PCR and PFGE fingerprinting among 19 isolates from gastric biopsies and stomach juice samples. These strains belonged to five species, Lactobacillus gasseri (3), Lactobacillus reuteri (2), Lactobacillus vaginalis (2), Lactobacillus fermentum (2) and Lactobacillus casei (1). All ten strains were subjected to a series of in vitro tests to assess their functional and technological properties, including acid resistance, bile tolerance, adhesion to epithelial gastric cells, production of antimicrobial compounds, inhibition of Helicobacter pylori, antioxidative activity, antibiotic resistance, carbohydrate fermentation, glycosidic activities, and ability to grow in milk. As expected, given their origin, all strains showed good resistance to low pH (3.0), with small reductions in counts after 90 min exposition to this pH. Species- and strain-specific differences were detected in terms of the production of antimicrobials, antagonistic effects toward H. pylori, antioxidative activity and adhesion to gastric epithelial cells. None of the strains showed atypical resistance to a series of 16 antibiotics of clinical and veterinary importance. Two L. reuteri strains were deemed as the most appropriate candidates to be used as potential probiotics against microbial gastric disorders; these showed good survival under gastrointestinal conditions reproduced in vitro, along with strong anti-Helicobacter and antioxidative activities. The two L. reuteri strains further displayed appropriated technological traits for their inclusion as adjunct functional cultures in fermented dairy products.
TI  - The effect of probiotics supplementation on Helicobacter pylori eradication rates and side effects during eradication therapy: a meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous meta-analyses reported that probiotics improve the effectiveness of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication during antibiotic therapy, while results regarding a possible reduction of side effects remained inconclusive. Moreover, the effectiveness of different strains of probiotics has not been studied so far. It is further conceivable that probiotics will produce additional effects only if antibiotics are relatively ineffective. METHODS: This meta-analysis includes eligible randomized controlled trials examining effects of probiotics supplementation on eradication rates (ER) and side effects, published up to May 2014. Sub-group analysis was performed to compare different probiotic strains and antibiotic therapies with different effectiveness in controls (ER <80% vs.>80%). Publication bias was assessed with funnel plots and Harbord's test. The quality of the trials was assessed with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Thirty-three RCTs involving a total of 4459 patients met the inclusion criteria in case of eradication rates of which 20 assessed total side effects in addition. Overall, the pooled eradication rate in probiotics supplementation groups was significantly higher than in controls (ITT analysis: RR 1.122, 95% CI 1.086-1.159, PP analysis: RR 1.114, 95% CI 1.070-1.159). Sub group-analysis could, however, confirm this finding only for four individual strains (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei DN-114001, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Bifidobacterium infantis 2036) and for relatively ineffective antibiotic therapies. There was a significant difference between groups in the overall incidence of side effects (RR 0.735, 95% CI 0.598-0.902). This result was, however, only confirmed for non-blinded trials. CONCLUSIONS: The pooled data suggest that supplementation with specific strains of probiotics compared with eradication therapy may be considered an option for increasing eradication rates, particularly when antibiotic therapies are relatively ineffective. The impact on side effects remains unclear and more high quality trials on specific probiotic strains and side effects are thus needed.
TI  - Identification of Lactobacilli from deep carious lesions by means of species-specific PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to compare MALDI-TOF results for the identification of 87 lactobacilli, isolated from soft or hard carious dentin from 70 first molars of 7- to 8-year-old children with those obtained by species-specific PCR. METHODS: The 87 isolates were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Microflex LT, MALDI Biotyper 3.0, Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany), using a reference data base of 4110 strains including > 90 lactobacillus species. For the identification with species-specific PCR, oligonucleotide primers (16S rRNA) specific for L. casei, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. plantarum, and L. acidophilus were used; type strains served as controls. The PCR-products were separated electrophoretically on a 1.5% agarose gel and identified by their position on the gel. RESULTS: For 93% of the strains both methods produced concordant results: 40 strains were identified as L. rhamnosus, 16 as L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, 15 as L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, 4 as L. paracasei, 3 as L. gasseri, 2 as L. plantarum, and 1 as L. casei. In 4.5% of the cases the results were discordant. Of the 3 strains, not identified by species-specific PCR, 1 strain was identified by MALDI-TOF MS as L. spec. and 1 as L. parabuchneri. One strain could not be identified by either method. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods are highly sensitive. Limitations can be the precision of the primers (PCR) or the scarcity of strains from a certain habitat in the data base. Additional information is necessary for the strains without or with discordant identification.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces as potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages.
AB  - A total of 109 lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces were identified by partial 16S rRNA, cpn60 and/or pheS sequencing. Lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by Enterococcus (38%). Lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and Enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. A further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on Lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant genus in this type of product. Lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. The best strains according to the results obtained were Lactobacillus casei/paracasei CTC1677, L. casei/paracasei CTC1678, Lactobacillus rhamnosus CTC1679, L. gasseri CTC1700, L. gasseri CTC1704, Lactobacillus fermentum CTC1693. Those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. L. casei/paracasei CTC1677, L. casei/paracasei CTC1678 and L. rhamnosus CTC1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) CFU/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.
TI  - Molecular identification of Lactobacillus spp. associated with puba, a Brazilian  fermented cassava food.
AB  - Puba or carima is a Brazilian staple food obtained by spontaneous submerged fermentation of cassava roots. A total of 116 lactobacilli and three cocci isolates from 20 commercial puba samples were recovered on de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe agar (MRS); they were characterized for their antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens and identified taxonomically by classical and molecular methods. In all samples, lactic acid bacteria were recovered as the dominant microbiota (7.86 +/- 0.41 log10 CFU/g). 16S-23S rRNA ARDRA pattern assigned 116 isolates to the Lactobacillus genus, represented by the species Lactobacillus fermentum (59 isolates), Lactobacillus delbrueckii (18 isolates), Lactobacillus casei (9 isolates), Lactobacillus reuteri (6 isolates), Lactobacillus brevis (3 isolates), Lactobacillus gasseri (2 isolates), Lactobacillus nagelii (1 isolate), and Lactobacillus plantarum group (18 isolates). recA gene-multiplex PCR analysis revealed that L. plantarum group isolates belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum (15 isolates) and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (3 isolates). Genomic diversity was investigated by molecular typing with rep (repetitive sequence)-based PCR using the primer ERIC2 (enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus). The Lactobacillus isolates exhibited genetic heterogeneity and species-specific fingerprint patterns. All the isolates showed antagonistic activity against the foodborne pathogenic bacteria tested. This antibacterial effect was attributed to acid production, except in the cases of three isolates that apparently produced bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances. This study provides the first insight into the genetic diversity of Lactobacillus spp. of puba.
TI  - Molecular analysis and clinical significance of Lactobacillus spp. recovered from clinical specimens presumptively associated with disease.
AB  - Lactobacillus spp. are part of the normal human flora and are generally assumed to be nonpathogenic. We determined the genotypic identification of >100 Lactobacillus isolates from clinical specimens in the context of presumed pathogenic potential (e.g., recovered as the single/predominant isolate from a sterile site or at >/=10(5) CFU/ml from urine). This study assessed the clinical significance and the frequency of occurrence of each Lactobacillus sp. We identified 16 species of Lactobacillus by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, 10 of which could not be associated with disease. While Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus paracasei were associated with infections, L. gasseri was also a common colonizing/contaminating species. Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus johnsonii, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii were associated with at least one infection. Species commonly used in probiotic products (e.g., L. rhamnosus and L. casei) were identical, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, to our isolates associated with disease. Human isolates of Lactobacillus spp. have differing site associations and levels of clinical significance. Knowing the niche and pathogenic potential of each Lactobacillus sp. can be of importance to both clinical microbiology and the food and probiotic supplement industry.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate Mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactobacillus jensenii, L. iners, L. crispatus and L. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. However, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. The present study was performed to genetically determine the identity of Lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (BV) intermediate Mexican women. METHODS: In a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as Lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant Mexican women. The samples were classified into groups according to the Nugent score criteria proposed for detection of BV: normal (N), intermediate (I) and bacterial vaginosis (BV). We examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. Enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (ERIC) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. RESULTS: Clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16S rRNA gene: L. acidophilus (14/25), L. reuteri (6/25), L. casei (4/25) and L. buchneri (1/25). The remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as Enterococcus species. Within the L. acidophilus group, L. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by L. jensenii and L. crispatus. L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus and L. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the L. reuteri, L. casei and L. buchneri groups, respectively. ERIC profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the L. gasseri and L. fermentum species. CONCLUSIONS: These findings agree with previous studies showing that L. crispatus, L. gasseri and L. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. Additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant Mexican (Hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.
TI  - Differences in TLR9-dependent inhibitory effects of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and NF-kappa B/I kappa B-alpha system activation by genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) show anti-inflammatory effects, and their genomic DNA  was identified as one of the anti-inflammatory components. Despite the differences in anti-inflammatory effects between live LAB dependent not only on genus but also species, this effect has not been compared at the genomic DNA level. We compared the anti-inflammatory effects of the genomic DNA from five Lactobacillus species-Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus reuteri-using Caco-2 cells. To evaluate anti-inflammatory effects, decreases in H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation were examined. All LAB genomic DNAs dose-dependently decreased H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibited H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation. Comparison of these effects between Lactobacillus species showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of L. acidophilus genomic DNA are lower than those of the other species. Furthermore, suppression of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9), a specific receptor of bacterial DNA, expression by RNAi abolished the decrease of H(2)O(2)-induced IL-8 secretion and inhibition of H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB/IkappaB-alpha system activation by LAB genomic DNA. Our results demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory effects of genomic DNA differ between Lactobacillus species and TLR9 is one of the major pathways responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of LAB genomic DNA.
TI  - Effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination  on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats.
AB  - Probiotic bacteria and phytosterols are natural hypocholesterolemic agents with potential cardiovascular benefits. Accordingly, the present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of supplementation of probiotics and phytosterols alone or in combination on serum and hepatic lipid profiles and thyroid hormones of hypercholesterolemic rats. Mixed probiotics treatment consisted of 8 probiotic strains: 2 strains of each of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, and Lactobacillus reuteri. The rats were fed for 8 wk with the given treatments in addition to a high-fat-high-cholesterol basal diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. Results showed that supplementation significantly reduced serum total cholesterol, low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with the controls. The symbiotic treatment was more effective in lowering LDL-C, whereas mixed probiotics treatment more effectively lowered serum total cholesterol and LDL-C than the phytosterol-containing treatment. The phytosterol-containing treatments induced the increased activity of thyroid glands, as evident by elevated levels of serum total thyroxine, total triiodothyronine, and free triiodothyronine. In conclusion, the lipid profile can effectively be reduced to lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease using combinations of Lactobacillus-based probiotics and phytosterols in functional foods.
TI  - Acid production and growth by oral Lactobacillus species in vitro.
AB  - AIM: To analyze the acid-producing and growth abilities of different oral Lactobacillus species. METHODS: Thirty-nine oral clinical strains and type strains of Lactobacillus, representing nine species, including Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus mucosae, Lactobacillus oris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus vaginalis were studied. Anaerobically-grown bacterial cells were inoculated overnight in de Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe broth containing 2% glucose (pH 7.0). Acid production and growth were measured at 0, 1.5, 3, 5, 7, and 24 h. RESULTS: Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, and Lactobacillus plantarum grew rapidly and reached an optical density higher than other species. They also produced more acid than the others. Lactobacillus vaginalis showed the lowest rate of growth and acid production. These findings demonstrated that the different species of Lactobacillus showed different abilities to generate acid, allowing the species to be categorized into three groups: strongly, moderately, and weakly acidogenic. CONCLUSION: There was variation in acid production and growth between the Lactobacillus species. The strongest acid producers were Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, respectively. It seems possible that these species might play a more important role in caries development than the others.
TI  - Comparison of fructooligosaccharide utilization by Lactobacillus and Bacteroides  species.
AB  - The utilization of 1-kestose (GF(2)) and nystose (GF(3)), the main components of  fructooligosaccharides (FOS), by Lactobacillus and Bacteroides species was examined. Of seven Lactobacillus and five Bacteroides strains that utilized FOS, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, and L. gasseri utilized only GF(2), whereas L. acidophilus and all the Bacteroides strains utilized both GF(2) and GF(3). Only the strains able to utilize both GF(2) and GF(3) had beta-fructosidase activity in the culture supernatants. The culture supernatants of the Lactobacillus strains had higher beta-fructosidase activity for GF(2) than for GF(3), whereas those of the Bacteroides strains had higher activity for GF(3) than for GF(2). Furthermore, beta-fructosidase activity of the culture supernatants of the Lactobacillus cells grown in the GF(3) medium was much higher than that of the cells grown in the GF(2) medium, whereas the activity of the culture supernatants of the Bacteroides cells grown in the GF(3) medium was almost the same as that of the cells grown in the GF(2) medium. These results indicate that Lactobacillus species metabolize FOS in a different way from that of Bacteroides species.
TI  - Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria induce differential interferon-beta profiles in dendritic cells.
AB  - The health promoting effects of probiotics are well-documented; however, current  knowledge on immunostimulatory effects is based on data from a single strain or a limited selection of strains or species. Here, we compared the capacity of 27 lactobacilli and 16 bifidobacteria strains to stimulate bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC). Most lactobacilli strains, including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum, induced strong IL-12 and TNF-alpha production and up-regulation of maturation markers. In contrast, all bifidobacteria and certain lactobacilli strains were low IL-12 and TNF-alpha inducers. IL-10 and IL-6 levels showed less variation and no correlation with IL-12 and TNF-alpha. DC matured by strong IL-12-inducing strains also produced high levels of interferon (IFN)-beta. When combining two strains, low IL-12 inducers inhibited this IFN-beta production as well as IL-12 and Th1-skewing chemokines. The IFN-beta induction was mediated through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) irrespective of the stimulating strain. The inhibitory bacteria induced higher levels of the transcription factor c-Jun dimerization protein (JDP)-2, thereby counteracting the effect of JNK. Our data demonstrate that lactobacilli can be divided into two groups of bacteria featuring contrasting effects, while all bifidobacteria exhibit uniform effects. This underlines the importance of selecting the proper strain(s) for probiotic purposes.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against oral pathogens.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the inhibitory effect of oral Lactobacillus against putative oral pathogens. METHODS AND RESULTS: Total 357 strains comprising 10 species of oral Lactobacillus, Lactobacillus fermentum (195), Lactobacillus salivarius (53), Lactobacillus casei (20), Lactobacillus gasseri (18), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (14), Lactobacillus paracasei (12), Lactobacillus mucosae (12), Lactobacillus oris (12), Lactobacillus plantarum (11) and Lactobacillus vaginalis (10) were used as producer strains. Inhibitory effect against a panel of indicators, periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens, was assessed. Most oral Lactobacillus was able to inhibit the growth of both periodontitis- and caries-related pathogens. The strongest inhibitory activity was associated with Lact. paracasei, Lact. plantarum, Lact. rhamnosus, Lact. casei and Lact. salivarius. Lactobacillus SD1-SD6, representing the six species with the strong inhibitory effect, inhibited growth of Streptococcus mutans ATCC 25175 in the biofilm model. Also, it was demonstrated that growth of Strep. mutans was inhibited in a mixture with Lact. paracasei SD1. The inhibition was enhanced in acidic condition and 5% glucose. CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that oral Lactobacillus SD1-SD6 showed a strong inhibitory effect against Strep. mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus, as well as, Gram-negative periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results indicated that Lactobacillus may be of benefit as probiotics for the prevention of oral diseases.
TI  - Phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. However, the phylogenetic relationships among LAB species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. RESULTS: We performed a phylogenetic analysis of LAB species based on 232 genes from 28 LAB genome sequences. Regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. The LAB species examined were divided into two groups. Group 1 included families Enterococcaceae and Streptococcaceae. Group 2 included families Lactobacillaceae and Leuconostocaceae. Within Group 2, the LAB species were divided into two clades. One clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus Lactobacillus and two other species, Lb. sakei and Lb. casei. In the acidophilus complex, Lb. delbrueckii separated first, while Lb. acidophilus/Lb. helveticus and Lb. gasseri/Lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. The other clade within Group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, Lb. salivarius, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. reuteri, Lb. fermentum, and the genera Pediococcus, Oenococcus, and Leuconostoc. In this clade, Lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to Lb. plantarum/Lb. brevis pair and Pediococcus, and the other including Oenococcus/Leuconostoc pair and Lb. reuteri/Lb. fermentum pair. In addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be more useful than others. The genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (TRSB), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein B (uvrB), DNA polymerase III (polC) and penicillin binding protein 2B (pbpB). CONCLUSIONS: Our phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of LAB species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. We infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in LAB species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. Further analyses of more genes from additional, representative LAB species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of LAB species to various environmental niches.
TI  - Protective effect of Ssanghwa-tang fermented by Lactobacillus fermentum against carbon tetrachloride-induced acute hepatotoxicity in rats.
AB  - Ssanghwa-tang (SHT) is a traditional herbal medicine formula that has been used for the development of physical strength, relief of pain, and the reduction of fatigue. In this study, we fermented SHT with Lactobacillus fermentum (L. fermentum), Lactobacillus gasseri (L.gasseri), or Lactobacillus casei (L.casei) to investigate the hepatoprotective effects of SHT and fermented SHT with Lactobacillus on carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced liver injury in rats. Rats were given CCl(4) (1 ml/kg, 50% CCl(4) in olive oil) intraperitoneally and either SHT or fermented SHTs (15 ml/kg) was administered 30 min before CCl(4). At 24 hr after CCl(4) injection, the levels of transaminases in the serum were markedly increased. These increases were significantly attenuated by either SHT + L. fermentum or SHT+ L.gasseri. However, SHT and SHT + L.casei showed slight suppression of the increase of transaminases. The liver histological changes were diminished by treatment with SHT + L. fermentum. Additionally, the potential hepatoprotective effect of fermented-SHTs correlated with the amount of unknown metabolite which is produced during fermentation process with L. fermentum, L.gasseri, or L.casei. Therefore, these results suggest that the hepatoprotective effect of SHT may be improved by fermentation with L. fermentum and the intestinal bacterial enzyme activities may likely play an important role in the pharmacological action of herbal medicines.
TI  - Lactic acid bacteria colonization and clinical outcome after probiotic supplementation in conventionally treated bacterial vaginosis and vulvovaginal candidiasis.
AB  - This randomized double-blind placebo controlled study assessed the vaginal colonization of lactic acid bacteria and clinical outcome. Vaginal capsules containing L gasseri LN40, Lactobacillus fermentum LN99, L. casei subsp. rhamnosus LN113 and P. acidilactici LN23, or placebos were administered for five days to 95 women after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis. Vulvovaginal examinations and vaginal samplings were performed before and after administration, after the first and second menstruation, and after six months. Presence of LN strains was assessed using RAPD analysis. LN strains were present 2-3 days after administration in 89% of the women receiving LN strains (placebo: 0%, p < 0.0001). After one menstruation 53% were colonized by at least one LN strain. Nine percent were still colonized six months after administration. Ninety-three percent of the women receiving LN strains were cured 2-3 days after administration (placebo: 83%), and 78% after one menstruation (placebo: 71%) (ns). The intervention group experienced less malodorous discharge 2-3 days after administration (p = 0.03) and after the second menstruation (p = 0.04), compared with placebo. In summary, five days of vaginal administration of LN strains after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis and/or vulvovaginal candidiasis lead to vaginal colonization, somewhat fewer recurrences and less malodorous discharge.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of automated ribotyping and RAPD-PCR for typing of Lactobacillus spp. occurring in dental caries.
AB  - A group of 67 Lactobacillus spp. strains containing Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus salivarius species isolated from early childhood caries and identified to the species level in a previous study (Svec et al., Folia Microbiol 54:53-58, 2009) was characterized by automated ribotyping performed by the RiboPrinter microbial characterization system and by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA fingerprinting (RAPD-PCR) with M13 primer to evaluate these techniques for characterization of lactobacilli associated with dental caries. Ribotyping revealed 55 riboprints among the analysed group. The automatic identification process performed by the RiboPrinter system identified 18 strains to the species level, however cluster analysis divided obtained ribotype patterns into individual clusters mostly corresponding to the species assignment of particular strains. RAPD-PCR fingerprints revealed by the individual Lactobacillus spp. showed higher variability than the ribotype patterns and the fingerprint profiles generated by the analysed species were distributed among one to four clusters. In conclusion, ribotyping is shown to be more convenient for the identification purposes while RAPD-PCR fingerprinting results indicate this method is a better tool for typing of Lactobacillus spp. strains occurring in dental caries.
TI  - Lactobacillus spp. associated with early childhood caries.
AB  - A group of 69 lactobacilli was isolated from caries lesions and root canals of early childhood caries (ECC) affected children treated in the Department of Pedodontics (Children's Teaching Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic). Biochemical and physiological properties of all strains were characterized by API 50 CH kit and conventional tube tests. The rep-PCR fingerprinting with the (GTG)(5) primer was used for genotypic grouping of the isolates. The (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting grouped all analyzed strains into a few clusters in nearly full agreement with phenotype identification results and clarified the taxonomic position of 13 biochemically unidentified strains. In total, 20 strains of Lactobacillus fermentum, 17 L. rhamnosus, 14 L. casei/paracasei, 7 L. gasseri, 7 L. salivarius and 4 L. plantarum were identified. Mixtures of two or even three Lactobacillus spp. were isolated from a few root canal content samples. Results obtained by biotyping and (GTG)(5)-PCR were generally comparable except for L. gasseri strains that were not biochemically identified. The (GTG)(5)-PCR fingerprinting was shown to be quicker, easier to perform and more reliable than biotyping. Our results imply this molecular method as a good tool for screening and identification of Lactobacillus spp. inhabiting dental plaque.
TI  - Bacteriophages of lactobacillus.
AB  - In this review, we are listing Lactobacillus phages that have been reported in peer-reviewed articles published since 1960. Putative phages that are defective or have not been shown to be infectious, such as phage-like particles, are not discussed. Our literature searches led to the identification of 231 Lactobacillus phages, 186 of which have been observed by electron microscopy, with 109 belonging to the Siphoviridae family, 76 to the Myoviridae family, and 1 to the Podoviridae family. Model phages infecting Lb delbrueckii, casei, rhamnosus, plantarum, and gasseri are highlighted, as well as prophages of Lactobacillus hosts. To date, nine complete Lactobacillus phage genomes are available for comparisons and evolution studies. Features such as phage receptors and endolysins are also reviewed, as well as phage-derived genetic tools. Lactobacillus phage research has progressed significantly over the past decade but a thorough understanding of their biology is still lacking. Because of the risks they represent and the knowledge gaps that need to be filled, the outlook for research on Lactobacillus phages is bright.
TI  - Complete nucleotide sequence of plasmid plca36 isolated from Lactobacillus casei  Zhang.
AB  - The complete 36,487 bp sequence of plasmid plca36 from Lactobacillus casei Zhang  was determined. Plca36 contains 44 predicted coding regions, and to 23 of them functions could be assigned. For the first time, we identified a relBE toxin-antitoxin (TA) locus in a Lactobacillus genus, perhaps indicating a potential role for plca36 in host survival under extreme nutritional stress. A region encoding a cluster of conjugation genes (tra) was also identified. The cluster showed high similarity and co-linearity with tra regions of pWCFS103 and pMRC01 from Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis, respectively. Comparative gene analysis revealed that plasmids from the genus Lactobacillus may have contributed to the environmental adaptation mainly by providing carbohydrate and amino acid transporters. In addition, two chromosome-encoded relBE systems in Lactobacillus johnsonii and Lactobacillus gasseri were identified.
TI  - Mutational and biochemical analyses of the endolysin Lys(gaY) encoded by the Lactobacillus gasseri JCM 1131T phage phi gaY.
AB  - The Lys(gaY) of Lactobacillus gasseri JCM 1131(T) phage phigaY endolysin was purified to homogeneity using the Escherichia coli/His.Tag system. Zymographic and spectrophotometric assays showed that Lys(gaY) lysed over 20 heated Gram-positive bacterial species as the substrates, including lactobacilli, lactococci, enterococci, micrococci, and staphylococci. The enzymatic activity had the pH and temperature optima of about 6.5 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Amino-acid substitution analysis revealed that 13 residues of Lys(gaY) were involved in cell-lytic activity: in the beta/alpha(gaY) domain, G10, D12, E33, D36, H60, Y61, D96, E98, V124, L132, and D198; in the SH3b(gaY) domain, Y272 and W284. In addition, deletion analysis demonstrated that the beta/alpha(gaY) domain of N-terminal 216 residues is the core enzyme portion, although the cell-lytic ability is lower than that of Lys(gaY). These mutational experiments suggested that beta/alpha(gaY) (in which two acidic residues of D12 and E98 likely act as catalytic residues) is responsible for cell-lytic activity, and SH3b(gaY) promotes beta/alpha(gaY) possibly through cell-wall binding function. The purified His-tagged SH3b(gaY) domain containing 94 residues from S217 to K310 (i) bound to Gram-positive bacteria susceptible to Lys(gaY), (ii) induced aggregation of exponentially growing cells of L. gasseri JCM 1131(T), L. casei IAM 1045, Lactococcus lactis C2, L. lactis MG 1363, and Enterococcus hirae IAM 1262 by forming thread-like chained cells, (iii) inhibited lytic activity of Lys(gaY), and (iv) impeded autolysis of L. gasseri JCM 1131(T) in buffer systems. A truncated protein HDeltaSH3b(gaY) lacking in N-terminal 21 residues (from S217 to E237) of SH3b(gaY) and an amino-acid substituted protein HSH3b(gaY)G (W284G) lost the activities of HSH3b(gaY), showing that the N-terminal region and W284 probably play important roles in the SH3b(gaY) function(s).
TI  - Are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  - GOALS: Assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. As a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. STUDY: The feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: E. coli Nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (Mutaflor), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (Bioflorin), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (Infloran), Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (Omniflora), Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (Antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus casei Immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (Actimel). Ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and DNA was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. RESULTS: Fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of Mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking Bioflorin, and from 1/6 after Infloran. Cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of Antibiophilus, Omniflora and Actimel. CONCLUSIONS: After oral consumption of probiotics, E. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). In contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.
TI  - Diversity and mechanisms of alkali tolerance in lactobacilli.
AB  - We determined the maximum pH that allows growth (pHmax) for 34 strains of lactobacilli. High alkali tolerance was exhibited by strains of Lactobacillus casei, L. paracasei subsp. tolerans, L. paracasei subsp. paracasei, L. curvatus, L. pentosus, and L. plantarum that originated from plant material, with pHmax values between 8.5 and 8.9. Among these, L. casei NRIC 1917 and L. paracasei subsp. tolerans NRIC 1940 showed the highest pHmax, at 8.9. Digestive tract isolates of L. gasseri, L. johnsonii, L. reuteri, L. salivarius subsp. salicinius, and L. salivarius subsp. salivarius exhibited moderate alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 8.1 and 8.5. Dairy isolates of L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, and L. helveticus exhibited no alkali tolerance, with pHmax values between 6.7 and 7.1. Measurement of the internal pH of representative strains revealed the formation of transmembrane proton gradients (DeltapH) in a reversed direction (i.e., acidic interior) at alkaline external-pH ranges, regardless of their degrees of alkali tolerance. Thus, the reversed DeltapH did not determine alkali tolerance diversity. However, the DeltapH contributed to alkali tolerance, as the pHmax values of several strains decreased with the addition of nigericin, which dissipates DeltapH. Although neutral external-pH values resulted in the highest glycolysis activity in the presence of nigericin regardless of alkali tolerance, substantial glucose utilization was still detected in the alkali-tolerant strains, even in a pH range of between 8.0 and 8.5, at which the remaining strains lost most activity. Therefore, the alkali tolerance of glycolysis reactions contributes greatly to the determination of alkali tolerance diversity.
TI  - Quantitative evaluation of adhesion of lactobacilli isolated from human intestinal tissues to human colonic mucin using surface plasmon resonance (BIACORE assay).
AB  - AIMS: To isolate lactobacilli from the mucus layer of the human intestine and evaluate their adhesion abilities using a BIACORE assay. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty strains of lactobacilli were isolated from the mucus layer of normal human intestinal tissues using conventional plate culture. The strains were identified using homology comparisons of the 16S rDNA sequence to databases as Lactobacillus salivarius (26%), Lactobacillus fermentum (13%), Lactobacillus gasseri (10%), Lactobacillus paracasei (7%), Lactobacillus casei (3%), Lactobacillus mucosae (3%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (3%). Lactobacillus plantarum LA 318 shows the highest adhesion to human colonic mucin (HCM) using the BIACORE assay at 115.30 +/- 12.37 resonance unit (RU). The adhesion of cell wall surface proteins from strain LA 318 was significantly higher to HCM than to bovine serum albumin (BSA; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We isolated 30 strains of lactobacilli. Lactobacillus salivarius was the predominant species of lactobacilli isolated in this study. The adhesion of strain LA 318 isolated from human transverse colon to its mucin was shown. The adhesion could be mediated by lectin-like components on the bacterial cell surface. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first study where lactobacilli were isolated from human intestinal tissues and shown to adhere to HCM.
TI  - Similarity and differences in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group identified by polyphasic analysis and comparative genomics.
AB  - A set of lactobacilli were investigated by polyphasic analysis. Multilocus sequence analysis, DNA typing, microarray analysis, and in silico whole-genome alignments provided a remarkably consistent pattern of similarity within the Lactobacillus acidophilus complex. On microarray analysis, 17 and 5% of the genes from Lactobacillus johnsonii strain NCC533 represented variable and strain-specific genes, respectively, when tested against four independent isolates of L. johnsonii. When projected on the NCC533 genome map, about 10 large clusters of variable genes were identified, and they were enriched around the terminus of replication. A quarter of the variable genes and two-thirds of the strain-specific genes were associated with mobile DNA. Signatures for horizontal gene transfer and modular evolution were found in prophages and in DNA from the exopolysaccharide biosynthesis cluster. On microarray hybridizations, Lactobacillus gasseri strains showed a shift to significantly lower fluorescence intensities than the L. johnsonii test strains, and only genes encoding very conserved cellular functions from L. acidophilus hybridized to the L. johnsonii array. In-silico comparative genomics showed extensive protein sequence similarity and genome synteny of L. johnsonii with L. gasseri, L. acidophilus, and Lactobacillus delbrueckii; moderate synteny with Lactobacillus casei; and scattered X-type sharing of protein sequence identity with the other sequenced lactobacilli. The observation of a stepwise decrease in similarity between the members of the L. acidophilus group suggests a strong element of vertical evolution in a natural phylogenetic group. Modern whole-genome-based techniques are thus a useful adjunct to the clarification of taxonomical relationships in problematic bacterial groups.
TI  - Genomic diversity of cultivable Lactobacillus populations residing in the neonatal and adult gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the cultivable Lactobacillus population in adult and infant faecal material to identify strains shared across a number of individuals. A range of lactobacilli isolated on Lactobacillus-selective agar from faeces of 16 infants and 11 adults were genetically fingerprinted and further characterized by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The relatedness of all the Lactobacillus strains isolated to known species was also determined both genetically and phenotypically. This study revealed that the human intestine is initially colonized by only a few (1-2) different cultivable strains whereas in adults the pattern becomes more complex with a higher diversity of strains. The adult samples contained three genetically distinct Lactobacillus strains in some cases, while infant samples generally harboured only one dominant Lactobacillus strain. Moreover, the species in general appeared to differ with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus casei/paracasei found mainly in adults, whereas Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus salivarius were more commonly isolated in infant samples. The data reaffirm the differences in Lactobacillus populations both between individual subjects and between the infant and adult, with an overall change in the diversity and complexity from early stages of life to adulthood.
TI  - Culture-independent analysis of the microbial composition of the African traditional fermented foods poto poto and degue by using three different DNA extraction methods.
AB  - The microbial composition of the traditional fermented foods poto poto (a maize dough from the Rep. of Congo) and degue (a millet dough from Burkina Faso) was studied by a culture-independent approach using TTGE to separate the amplified target V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene from total microbial community, followed by DNA sequencing and homology search. Three different extraction methods were used. Guanidium thiocyanate-based DNA extraction provided better performance regarding purity and DNA yield, allowing the detection of a higher number of DNA bands by TTGE in poto poto. By contrast, all three methods yielded similar results for degue samples, indicating that the performance of the DNA extraction method largely depends on the food composition. Sequencing of DNA bands from TTGE gels corresponding to poto poto samples revealed the presence of Lactobacillus gasseri, Enterococcus sp., Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus plantarum/paraplantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Bacillus sp., Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus casei. The following bacteria were identified in degue: L. gasseri, Enterococcus sp., E. coli, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, and L. casei.
TI  - Characterisation of prototype Nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and PCR-DGGE.
AB  - Undefined Nurmi-type cultures (NTCs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. Such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. These cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. Due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. In this study, 10 batches of prototype NTCs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. Traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), were applied to characterise these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the NTCs were identical. Culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology, Gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (API, BioMerieux, France). Two sets of PCR-DGGE studies were performed. These involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (LAB)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16S rRNA gene by PCR. Resultant amplicons were subjected to DGGE. Sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant DGGE profiles using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). Microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Bifidobacterium, Enterococcus, Clostridium, Escherichia, Pediococcus and Enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, Actinomyces, Bacteroides, Propionibacterium, Capnocytophaga, Proteus, and Klebsiella. Bacteroides, Enterococcus, Escherichia, Brevibacterium, Klebsiella, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, Bacillus, Eubacterium, Serratia, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pectobacterium and Pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the NTCs using universal PCR-DGGE analysis. A number of the sequences detected by LAB-specific PCR-DGGE were homologous to those of a number of Lactobacillus spp., including L. fermentum, L. pontis, L. crispatus, L. salivarius, L. casei, L. suntoryeus, L. vaginalis, L. gasseri, L. aviaries, L. johnsonii, L. acidophilus, and L. mucosae in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. While NTCs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of Lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the NTC cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. PCR-DGGE proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. In conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or PCR-DGGE alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of NTCs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. Moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype NTCs during their development, PCR-DGGE overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. This study demonstrated that PCR-DGGE is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various NTCs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during NTC production.
TI  - Characterization of a new virulent phage (MLC-A) of Lactobacillus paracasei.
AB  - A new virulent bacteriophage (MLC-A) was recently isolated in Argentina from a probiotic dairy product containing a strain of Lactobacillus paracasei. Observation of the lysate with an electron microscope revealed bacteriophage particles with an icosahedral capsid of 57 +/- 2 nm; with a collar and a noncontractile tail of 156 +/- 3 nm terminating with a baseplate to which a tail fiber was attached. Therefore, phage MLC-A belongs to the Siphoviridae family. This phage was able to survive the pasteurization process and was resistant to alcohols and sodium hypochlorite (400 mg/kg). Only peracetic acid could inactivate high-titer suspensions of phages in a short time. The maximum rates of phage adsorption to its host cells were obtained at 30 degrees C with a pH between 5 and 7, and in the presence of calcium or magnesium ions. The host range of phage MLC-A encompassed L. paracasei and Lactobacillus casei strains, but it was not able to infect Lactobacillus rhamnosus or Lactobacillus gasseri strains. One-step growth kinetics of its lytic development revealed latent and burst periods of 30 and 135 min, respectively, with a burst size of about 69 +/- 4 plaque-forming units per infected cell. Phage MLC-A had a distinctive restriction profile when compared with the 2 well-studied Lactobacillus phages, PL-1 and J-1. The genome size of the MLC-A phage was estimated to be approximately 37 kb. This study presents the description of the first phage specific for L. paracasei isolated in Argentina. The isolation of phage MLC-A indicates that, beside lactic acid bacteria starters, probiotic cultures can also be sensitive to virulent phages in industrial processes.
TI  - Comparative genomics and transcriptional analysis of prophages identified in the  genomes of Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus salivarius, and Lactobacillus casei.
AB  - Lactobacillus gasseri ATCC 33323, Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius UCC  118, and Lactobacillus casei ATCC 334 contain one (LgaI), four (Sal1, Sal2, Sal3, Sal4), and one (Lca1) distinguishable prophage sequences, respectively. Sequence analysis revealed that LgaI, Lca1, Sal1, and Sal2 prophages belong to the group of Sfi11-like pac site and cos site Siphoviridae, respectively. Phylogenetic investigation of these newly described prophage sequences revealed that they have not followed an evolutionary development similar to that of their bacterial hosts and that they show a high degree of diversity, even within a species. The attachment sites were determined for all these prophage elements; LgaI as well as Sal1 integrates in tRNA genes, while prophage Sal2 integrates in a predicted arginino-succinate lyase-encoding gene. In contrast, Lca1 and the Sal3 and Sal4 prophage remnants are integrated in noncoding regions in the L. casei ATCC 334 and L. salivarius UCC 118 genomes. Northern analysis showed that large parts of the prophage genomes are transcriptionally silent and that transcription is limited to genome segments located near the attachment site. Finally, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blot hybridization with specific prophage probes indicates that these prophage sequences are narrowly distributed within lactobacilli.
TI  - Lactobacillus bacteremia, species identification, and antimicrobial susceptibility of 85 blood isolates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data regarding antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical Lactobacillus isolates are scarce, and appropriate interpretation criteria for susceptibility tests are not available. METHODS: We examined 85 cases of Lactobacillus bacteremia, of which 47 cases have been included in our previous studies. Overall, 14 antimicrobial agents were evaluated by the E-test method, and these results were compared with disk diffusion test findings. The clinical outcomes of the patients and their antimicrobial treatments were registered. RESULTS: The antimicrobial susceptibility of Lactobacillus strains was species dependent. The considerable number of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (n=46), Lactobacillus fermentum (n=12), and Lactobacillus casei (n=12) strains available for testing made it possible to compare the susceptibilities within 1 species, as well. Of the 46 L. rhamnosus isolates, 22 were identified as L. rhamnosus GG type by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. All Lactobacillus isolates demonstrated low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin. MICs of vancomycin were high (>256 microg/mL) for all other species except Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus jensenii. Disk diffusion and E-test results were concordant. The MICs of cephalosporins varied; cefuroxime demonstrated a higher level of activity than did ceftriaxone. Benzylpenicillin and ampicillin MICs had variable ranges between different species. Combination therapy was given to 83% of the patients, but, in 54% of them, therapy included only 1 microbiologically active agent, according to results of the susceptibility tests. Mortality at 1 week was 12% among patients who presumably were receiving adequate treatment and 27% among patients who were receiving inadequate treatment (P=.131, by E-test). CONCLUSION: Most clinical Lactobacillus blood isolates demonstrated low MICs of imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, erythromycin, and clindamycin, but they had variable susceptibility to penicillin and cephalosporins.
TI  - Lactobacillus species isolated from the vagina: identification, hydrogen peroxide production and nonoxynol-9 resistance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lactic acid production is considered to be the major protection mechanism of lactobacilli against vaginal infections due to genital pathogens. Some species of Lactobacillus are also hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) producers. Nonoxynol-9 (N-9) is a nonionic detergent and is the active component of many spermicidal preparations. It immobilizes sperm by disrupting the cell membrane and is believed to act similarly on a number of bacteria and viruses. It is known that N-9 inhibits Lactobacilli in vitro at concentrations of 0.1% to 1%. PURPOSE: The present study was conducted to identify the species of Lactobacillus isolated from vaginal fluids of reproductive-age women and to characterize the H(2)O(2)-producing and N-9-resistant strains in an Argentine population. RESULTS: We identified Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. fermentum, L. gasseri, L. jensenii, L. casei subsp. casei, L. brevis and L. delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii as the most frequent species. In this Argentine, South American population, 62% of women had H(2)O(2)-producing vaginal lactobacilli. We found a high number of sensitive strains. Sixty-two H(2)O(2)-producer strains were detected, 50 (80.6%) strains were sensitive to N-9 and 12 (19.4%) strains were resistant to the inhibitory effect of N-9. DISCUSSION: The vaginal microecologic findings are comparable to those found in other populations and suggest that (1) vaginal microecologic conditions are likely to be similar among Argentine women as in other countries, and (2) N-9 may have deleterious effects as in other populations.
TI  - Oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. However, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. We aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative oral pathogens. METHODS: A total of 238 Lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. In all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus mutans, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia was assessed. RESULTS: Lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. The most prevalent strains in healthy persons were Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, Lactobacillus plantarum. Obligately homofermentatives, particularly L. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for L. gasseri, P < 0.01). Sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited S. mutans, 88% A. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% P. gingivalis and 65% P. intermedia. The strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with Lactobacillus paracasei, L. plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, and Lactobacillus salivarius. The strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against S. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. CONCLUSION: The composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly L. gasseri, in the latter group. Both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.
TI  - [Antifungal effect in selected natural compounds and probiotics and their possible use in prophylaxis of vulvovaginitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: a survey of effective natural compounds and probiotics with antifungal activity and their possible use in vulvovaginitis as a prophylactic or therapeutic drug. DESIGN: review of literature. SETTING: Charles University at Prague, Pharmaceutical Faculty at Hradec Kralove. METHODS: and review of literature and publications from medical data-bases. CONCLUSIONS: certain natural compounds were proved to exert antimycotic effects. The efficiency of garlic extract under in vitro conditions against yeast of C. albicans family becomes manifest within one hour. Essential oils present in the Cayenne pepper (Capsodum frutescens) exert considerable antifungal activity against C. albicans as well. Clove exerts lower antimycotic effects. The effects of Chinese leek are similar to garlic. Propolis also possesses antifungal properties, and sensitivity of the yeast strains decreases in the following order: C. albicans > C. tropicalis > C. crusei > C. guilliermondii. Its efficiency depends on the composition and place of origin. Tea trea oil (Melalauca alternifolia) is inhibiting strains of Candida family (genus) in minimal inhibiting concentration, higher concentrations are necessary for C. crusei and C. norvengensis. In the prophylaxis of vaginal candidoses, oral administration of the strains of Lactobacilus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. fermentum RC-14, B-54 may be recommended. Moreover there are suitable strains of L. brevis CD-2, L. salivarius FV-2, L. gasseri MB 335, L. plantarum, useful in the form of gel capsules (L. plantarum) or vaginal tablets (L. gasseri). The strains of L. acidophilus CRL 1294 and L. salivarius CRL 1328 display the capacity of self aggregation and co-aggregation with Candida. It should be pointed out that the probiotic strain of Lactobacillus (especially L. casei and L. rhamnosus) may, in exceptional cases, cause bacteriemia and sepsis, especially in immunodeficient patients and those who underwent surgery of alimentary tract. No protective effect against yeast infection was detected with vitamin E, any positive effect was not unequivocally confirmed with zinc, but adjusting zinc levels to normal may be recommended.
TI  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide inhibits adhesion of pathogenic Escherichia coli strains to human cells in culture.
AB  - Caseinoglycomacropeptide (CGMP) derived from kappa-casein was investigated for its ability to inhibit the adhesion of 3 strains of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli (VTEC) and 3 strains of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) to human HT29 tissue cell cultures. Effects on adhesion of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus gasseri were also investigated. Generally, CGMP exerted effective anti-adhesive properties at a dose of 2.5 mg/mL, albeit with a high degree of strain specificity. The CGMP reduced adhesion of VTEC strains to <50% of the control and reduced adhesion of EPEC strains to between 80 and 10% of the control. The CGMP also reduced the adhesion of L. pentosus and L. casei to 44 and 42%, respectively. A slight but significant reduction of L. acidophilus, to 81%, was observed, but no significant effects were detected with either Dsv. desulfuricans or L. gasseri. Further investigation of the dose response relationships with the E. coli strains gave IC50 values ranging between 0.12 and 1.06 mg/mL.
TI  - A double-blind treatment study of bacterial vaginosis with normal vaginal lactobacilli after an open treatment with vaginal clindamycin ovules.
AB  - The expected 4-week cure rate after conventional treatment of bacterial vaginosis are only 65-70%. In an attempt to improve the cure rate by adding probiotic lactobacilli we performed a double-blind placebo-controlled study of adjuvant lactobacilli treatment after an open treatment with vaginal clindamycin ovules. Women with bacterial vaginosis as defined by Amsel's criteria were treated with clindamycin ovules. Vaginal smears were collected and analysed according to Nugent's criteria. During the following menstruation period the women used, as an adjuvant treatment, either lactobacilli-prepared tampons or placebo tampons. The lactobacilli tampons were loaded with a mixture of freeze-dried L. fermentum, L. casei var. rhamnosus and L. gasseri. The cure rate was recorded after the second menstruation period. There was no improvement in the cure rate after treatment with lactobacilli-containing tampons compared to placebo tampons; the cure rates as defined by Amsel's criteria were 56% and 62%, respectively, and 55% and 63%, as defined by Nugent's criteria. This is the first study to report cure rates for women with 'intermediate' wet smear ratings according to Nugent's classification and this group had an overall cure rate of 44%. The cure rate of treatment of bacterial vaginosis was not improved by using lactobacilli-prepared tampons for one menstruation.
TI  - Rapid identification of probiotic Lactobacillus species by multiplex PCR using species-specific primers based on the region extending from 16S rRNA through 23S rRNA.
AB  - This study aimed to develop a novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set for the identification of seven probiotic Lactobacillus species such as Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus reuteri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The primer set, comprising of seven specific and two conserved primers, was derived from the integrated sequences of 16S and 23S rRNA genes and their rRNA intergenic spacer region of each species. It was able to identify the seven target species with 93.6% accuracy, which exceeds that of the general biochemical methods. The phylogenetic analyses, using 16S rDNA sequences of the probiotic isolates, also provided further support that the results from the multiplex PCR assay were trustworthy. Taken together, we suggest that the multiplex primer set is an efficient tool for simple, rapid and reliable identification of seven Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Quantitative analysis of diverse Lactobacillus species present in advanced dental caries.
AB  - Our previous analysis of 65 advanced dental caries lesions by traditional culture techniques indicated that lactobacilli were numerous in the advancing front of the progressive lesion. Production of organic acids by lactobacilli is considered to be important in causing decalcification of the dentinal matrix. The present study was undertaken to define more precisely the diversity of lactobacilli found in this environment and to quantify the major species and phylotypes relative to total load of lactobacilli by real-time PCR. Pooled DNA was amplified by PCR with Lactobacillus genus-specific primers for subsequent cloning, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis. Based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence comparisons, 18 different phylotypes of lactobacilli were detected, including strong representation of both novel and gastrointestinal phylotypes. Specific PCR primers were designed for nine prominent species, including Lactobacillus gasseri, L. ultunensis, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus, L. casei, L. crispatus, L. delbrueckii, L. fermentum, and L. gallinarum. More than three different species were identified as being present in most of the dentine samples, confirming the widespread distribution and numerical importance of various Lactobacillus spp. in carious dentine. Quantification by real-time PCR revealed various proportions of the nine species colonizing carious dentine, with higher mean loads of L. gasseri and L. ultunensis than of the other prevalent species. The findings provide a basis for further characterization of the pathogenicity of Lactobacillus spp. in the context of extension of the carious lesion.
TI  - Use of group-specific and RAPD-PCR analyses for rapid differentiation of Lactobacillus strains from probiotic yogurts.
AB  - The increasing interest in probiotic lactobacilli implicates the requirement of techniques that allow a rapid and reliable identification of these organisms. In this study, group-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR analyses were used to identify strains of the Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus acidophilus groups most commonly used in probiotic yogurts. Group-specific PCR with primers for the L. casei and L. acidophilus groups, as well as L. gasseri/johnsonii, could differentiate between 20 Lactobacillus strains isolated from probiotic yogurts and assign these into the corresponding groups. For identification of these strains to species or strain level, RAPD profiles of the 20 Lactobacillus strains were compared with 11 reference strains of the L. acidophilus and L. casei group. All except one strain could be attributed unambigously to the species L. acidophilus, L. johnsonii, L. crispatus, L. casei, and L. paracasei. DNA reassociation analysis confirmed the classification resulting from the RAPD-PCR.
TI  - The effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli infection of human intestinal cells in vitro.
AB  - There are many examples of probiotic effects of various lactic bacteria on enteropathogens. In this study, Lactobacillus strains (L. rhamnosus, L. gasseri, L. casei and L. plantarum) were tested in an in vitro model of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection of a human colon epithelial cell line, C2BBe1. While the adhesion and colonization of EHEC was not affected by any of the lactobacillus strains tested, the internalization of EHEC into the cell line was markedly suppressed by L. rhamnosus, though not by others. Concerning the possible mechanisms, the viabilities of EHEC and host cell were not affected by the presence of L. rhamnosus. Simple competitions at certain receptors were unlikely because the suppressive effect on EHEC internalization was strictly dependent on viable L. rhamnosus and could not be observed with the conditioned medium or killed L. rhamnosus. The fact that L. rhamnosus showed outstanding potential for adhering to the colon epithelial cell line, compared with other strains, suggested that an avid interaction between L. rhamnosus and the host cell might be modulating intra-cellular events responsible for the internalization of EHEC.
TI  - Assessment of safety of lactobacillus strains based on resistance to host innate  defense mechanisms.
AB  - Seven Lactobacillus strains belonging to four species were evaluated for pathogenicity as well as for in vitro sensitivity to the bactericidal mechanisms of macrophages in a rabbit infective endocarditis (IE) model. Two bacteremia-associated strains, L. rhamnosus PHLS A103/70 and L. casei PHLS A357/84, as well as the L. rhamnosus type strain and the probiotic L. rhamnosus strain ATCC 53103, showed moderate infectivity, and the virulence of the probiotic L. casei strain Shirota and type strains such as L. acidophilus ATCC 4356(T) and L. gasseri DSM 20243(T) in the model was negligible. The strains that showed pathogenic potential in the rabbit IE model (PHLS A357/84, PHLS A103/70, and ATCC 53103) were more resistant than strain Shirota to intracellular killing activity by mouse macrophages in vitro and also to bactericidal nitrogen intermediates, such as nitric oxide and NO(2)(-) ions. These results suggest that resistance to host innate defense systems, which would function at inflammatory lesions, should be considered in the safety assessment of Lactobacillus strains.
TI  - Lactobacillus casei NY1301 increases the adhesion of Lactobacillus gasseri NY0509 to human intestinal caco-2 cells.
AB  - In the presence of Lactobacillus casei NY1301, the adhesion of Lactobacillus gasseri NY0509 to cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cells was significantly increased (P<0.01). In contrast, L. gasseri NY0509 did not affect the adhesion of L. casei NY1301. A heat-stable cell component of L. casei NY1301 was involved in this increase of adhesion. These results suggest that a combination of these strains may have synergistic effects of adhesion to human intestinal mucosa.
TI  - Lactobacilli in human dental caries and saliva.
AB  - Samples (98 plaque and 72 saliva) from 93 patients with dental caries were investigated for Lactobacillus species which comprised 65 (62.5%) of 104 isolates. Yeasts (20.1%), Streptococcus spp. (8.7%), Staphylococcus spp. (2.9%) and a few unidentified species (5.8%), were also found. The Lactobacillus isolates were L. brevis (24.6%) L. fermentum (18.5%) L. casei (16.9%), L. delbrueckii (15.4%), L. plantarum (9.23%), L. acidophilus (7.69%), L. jensenii (4.62%), L. salivarius (1.54%) and L. gasseri (1.54%). The most common species was L. brevis (24.6%). The strains tested for beta-lactamase production showed 75.4% positive. All the Lactobacillus strains were tested for bacteriocin production against Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella dysenteriae, S. sonnei, Klebsiella spp. and Campylobacter sp. All the lactobacilli except L. jensenii produced bacteriocin against at least one of the indicator organisms. The involvement of Lactobacillus in dental caries was established, although its role and mechanism is not well understood. The ability of Lactobacillus spp. to protect their host against certain diseases by inhibiting the growth of potential pathogens was evident.
TI  - Characterization of the Lactobacillus casei group and the Lactobacillus acidophilus group by automated ribotyping.
AB  - A total of 91 type and reference strains of the Lactobacillus casei group and the L acidophilus group were characterized by the automated ribotyping device Riboprinter microbial characterization system. The L. casei group was divided into five (C1-C5) genotypes by ribotyping. Among them, the strain of L. casei ATCC 334 was clustered to the same genotype group as most of L. paracasei strains and L casei JCM 1134T generated a riboprint pattern that was different from the type strain of L. zeae. These results supported the designation of L. casei ATCC 334 as the neotype strain, but were not consistent with the reclassification of L. casei JCM 1134T as L. zeae. The L. acidophilus group was also divided into 14 (A1-A11, B1-B3) genotypes by ribotyping. L. acidophilus, L. amylovorus, L. crispatus and L. gallinarum generated ribotype patterns that were distinct from the patterns produced by L. gasseri and L. johnsonii. This result confirmed previous data that the L. acidophilus group divided to two major clusters. Five strains of L. acidophilus and two strains of L. gasseri were correctly reidentified by ribotyping. Most strains belonging to the L. casei group and the L. acidophilus group were discriminated at the species level by automated ribotyping. Thus this RiboPrinter system yields rapid, accurate and reproducible genetic information for the identification of many strains.
TI  - Proinflammatory cytokine and nitric oxide induction in murine macrophages by cell wall and cytoplasmic extracts of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Cells from a number of bacterial genera have been shown to possess mitogenic and  polyclonal activating properties when cultured with cells of the immune system. Based on previously reported health immune-enhancing effects of fermented dairy products, we tested the potentiating effects of representative lactic acid bacteria and their extracts on leukocyte function. Specifically, the effects of in vitro exposure to heat-killed cells of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, L. casei, L. gasseri, L. helveticus, L. reuteri, and Streptococcus thermophilus, their cell walls, and their cytoplasmic extracts on proliferation as well as cytokine and nitric oxide (NO) production were examined in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line. A similar strategy was applied to murine cultures composed of peritoneal, spleen, and Peyer's patch cells. Both the cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions of lactic acid bacteria were able to stimulate cloned macrophages to produce significant amounts of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, (interleukin) IL-6, and NO. Pronounced enhancement of IL-6 production by peritoneal cells was observed when cultured with those extracts, whereas, effects were not noted in spleen and Peyer's patch cell cultures from mice. Based on the results, it appears that, as a group, the lactic acid bacteria were capable of stimulating macrophages and possibly other immune cells to produce cytokines and NO, and both their cell walls and cytoplasm contributed to these capacities.
TI  - The effect of orally administered viable probiotic and dairy lactobacilli on mouse lymphocyte proliferation.
AB  - Four common Lactobacillus strains were screened for their effects on proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes. Mice received perorally 10(9) viable bacteria kg(-1) body weight for 7 days. Lactobacillus acidophilus treatment enhanced ex vivo basal proliferation (by 43%) and B-cell response at suboptimal and optimal concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (by 27-28%). Conversely, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus rhamnosus inhibited both basal proliferation (by 14-51%) and mitogen-stimulated lymphoproliferation, particularly at supra-optimal concentrations of concanavalin A (by 43-68%) and LPS (by 23-62%). Therefore, these Lactobacillus strains demonstrate strain-specific effects on B- and T-cells and may also alter the splenocyte sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of mitogens.
TI  - Ex vivo effects of lactobacilli, streptococci, and bifidobacteria ingestion on cytokine and nitric oxide production in a murine model.
AB  - Increasing numbers of functional foods and pharmaceutical preparations are being  promoted with health claims based on the potential probiotic characteristics of lactic acid bacteria and on their capacity for stimulating the host immune system. However, the specific immune effects of oral administration of these microbes still remains undefined. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that production of immunologic mediators by leukocytes in mice is affected by orally administered lactic acid bacteria. The specific objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of exposure to eight different lactic acid bacteria in mice on ex vivo cytokine and nitric oxide production in leukocyte cultures. Mice were gavaged with 1 X 10(9) viable bacteria and peritoneal, Peyer's patch and splenic leukocytes were isolated 8 h later. These were cultured for 2 or 5 days in the presence or absence of mitogens and then interleukin (IL)-6, IL-12, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and nitric oxide production was measured. The results revealed that Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. casei potentiated IL-6 and IL-12 production by peritoneal cells whereas L. acidophilus upregulated IFN-gamma and nitric oxide. In contrast, L. helveticus, L. gasseri, L. reuteri, and Bifidobacterium attenuated the production of IL-6, IFN-gamma, and nitric oxide by peritoneal cells. TNF-alpha was not detectable in peritoneal cultures. None of the bacteria altered ex vivo production of cytokines or nitric oxide by Peyer's patch or spleen cell cultures. Taken together, the results suggest that prior oral exposure to lactic acid bacteria could differentially potentiate or attenuate subsequent cytokine and nitric oxide production by peritoneal cells.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Lactobacillus species against Vibrio species.
AB  - Forty-one Lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of Vibrio. L. plantarum and L. casei were the most effective, and L. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of Vibrio species. L. gasseri and L. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while L. reuteri and L. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against Vibrio species. L. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against Vibrio species. However, none of the Lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of Salmonella enteritidis, S. typhimurium, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. Inhibition of the Vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the Lactobacillus species.
TI  - Taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus. The physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. In total, 176 strains, including the type strains, have been included. Phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic proteins. Genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and DNA-DNA hybridization for bifidobacteria. In the genus Lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: L. acidophilus group, L. casei group and L. reuteri/L. fermentum group. Most strains referred to as L. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as L. gasseri or as L. johnsonii, both members of the L. acidophilus group. A similar situation could be shown in the L. casei group, where most of the strains named L. casei belonged to L. paracasei subspp. A recent proposal to reject the species L. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species L. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. Bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. According to phenotypic features and confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to B. animalis, although they were often declared as B. longum by the manufacturer. From the genus Enterococcus, probiotic Ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the vanA-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. These unwanted resistances could be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kDa resistance protein. In conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
TI  - High level heterologous protein production in Lactococcus and Lactobacillus using a new secretion system based on the Lactobacillus brevis S-layer signals.
AB  - A secretion cassette, based on the expression and secretion signals of a S-layer  protein (SlpA) from Lactobacillus brevis, was constructed. E. coli beta-lactamase (Bla) was used as the reporter protein to determine the functionality of the S-layer signals for heterologous expression and secretion in Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus casei using a low-copy-number plasmid derived from pGK12. In all hosts tested, the bla gene was expressed under the slpA signals and all Bla activity was secreted to the culture medium. The Lb. brevis S-layer promoters were very efficiently recognized in L. lactis, Lb. brevis and Lb. plantarum, whereas in Lb. gasseri the slpA promoter region appeared to be recognized at a lower level and in Lb. casei the level of transcripts was below the detection limit. The production of Bla was mainly restricted to the exponential phase of growth. The highest yield of Bla was obtained with L. lactis and Lb. brevis. Without pH control, substantial degradation of Bla occurred during prolonged cultivations with all lactic acid bacteria (LAB) tested. When growing L. lactis and Lb. brevis under pH control, the Bla activity could be stabilized also at the stationary phase. L. lactis produced up to 80 mg/l of Bla which to our knowledge represents the highest amount of a heterologous protein secreted by LAB so far. The short production phase implied a very high rate of secretion with a calculated value of 5 x 10(5) Bla molecules/cell per h. Such a high rate was also observed with Lb. plantarum, whereas in Lb. brevis the competition between the wild type slpA gene and the secretion construct probably lowered the rate of Bla production. The results obtained indicate wide applicability of the Lb. brevis slpA signals for efficient protein production and secretion in LAB.
TI  - Absence of cholic acid 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity in the strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium.
AB  - To investigate the presence of 7 alpha-dehydroxylase activity on bile acids in the bacterial strains of fermented milk products, 46 strains of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus gasseri, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium longum, Lactococcus lactis spp. lactis, and Streptococcus salivarius spp. thermophilus were tested for their ability to produce deoxycholic acid from cholic acid. The production of deoxycholic acid was quantitatively measured by radiochromatographic analysis in anaerobically prepared washed whole resting cells and by HPLC analysis in growing cultures. Resting whole cells from a positive control strain, Eubacterium lentum-like strain c-25, converted 81.7% of .2 mM cholic acid to deoxycholic acid and 3.7% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid, when the cell suspension was incubated anaerobically at a concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml for 4 h at pH 7.3. However, none of the test strains investigated in this study was able to transform cholic acid under the same conditions. In growing cultures, 91.5% of 150 micrograms/ml of cholic acid was transformed to deoxycholic acid and 1.1% to 7-keto-deoxycholic acid by E. lentum-like c-25 after a 7-d anaerobic incubation. None of the test strains showed production of either deoxycholic acid or 7-keto-deoxycholic acid as growing cultures.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Lactobacillus spp. associated with healthy and diseased mucosa of the human intestines.
AB  - Two-hundred and fifty Lactobacillus strains isolated from healthy and diseased mucosa of human intestines of 75 individuals and 49 reference strains were phenotypically classified using 49 unit characters. Data were processed by the Jaccard (SJ) and Simple Matching (SSM) coefficients, and unweighted pair group algorithm with arithmetic averages. Seventeen major clusters were defined at the 76% SJ-similarity level which approximately correspond to the SSM-level of 91%. Seven clusters could be identified: Lactobacillus plantarum (isolates recovered from 5% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. rhamnosus (17% of the patients), Lact. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (5% of the patients), Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides (3% of the patients), Lact. buchneri (4% of patients), Lact. reuteri (4% of the patients) and Lact. salivarius subsp. salivarius (9% of the patients). Unassigned clusters 1 and 3 both contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains. Cluster 1 included the type strains of Lact. crispatus, Lact. acidophilus, Lact. jensenii and Lact. gasseri, and cluster 3, the type strains of Lact. delbrueckii subsp. lactis, Lact. agilis and Lact. casei subsp. tolerans. Clusters 1 and 3 were found in 15% and 25% of the patients, respectively. Unassigned clusters 2, 6, 7, 8 and 10 contained homofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Clusters 11, 12, 15 and 17 were made up of heterofermentative Lactobacillus strains but no reference strains. Phenotypical characteristics of the clusters are given. No obvious trends in species (cluster) composition between different intestinal locations could be noted. Most clusters contained isolates from both diseased and healthy mucosa. Exceptions were cluster 15 and cluster 17 which only included isolates from healthy mucosa, and cluster 11 which only included isolates from diseased mucosa. Cluster 15 was isolated in 12% of the patients, and cluster 11 in 8%.
