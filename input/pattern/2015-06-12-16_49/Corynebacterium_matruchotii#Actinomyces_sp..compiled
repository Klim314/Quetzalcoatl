TI  - Carbohydrate depletion of immunoglobulin A1 by oral species of gram-positive rods.
AB  - Bacterial deglycosylation of immunoglobulin Al (IgA1), the dominant isotype of antibody in the oral cavity, probably provides both nutrition as well as protection to the oral bacterial community. Representative strains of oral gram-positive rods were tested for their ability to remove carbohydrates from IgA1. Detection of sialic acids was performed by means of high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation (Aminex HPX-87H) and ultraviolet light absorption at 190 nm, and neutral carbohydrates were measured by HPLC separation (Capcell Pak C-18 SG 120) and ultraviolet light absorption at 245 nm after derivatization. Four strains of Actinomyces naeslundii, two strains of Corynebacterium matruchotii and one of two strains of Actinomyces odontolyticus partially or totally removed sialic acid, while two strains of Propionibacterium propionicus and the other strain of A. odontolyticus did not. Complete correlation was observed between sialic acid removal, neuraminidase activity measured with fluorogenic substrate and with one exception, altered immunoelectrophoretic mobility of IgA1. Only limited removal of other carbohydrates was observed with poor correlation to exoglycosidase activities measured with chromogenic substrates. Desialylation increases the susceptibility of glycoproteins, including IgA1, to proteolysis. Therefore, the desialylation of IgA1 by oral gram-positive rods may facilitate the proteolytic activities of other oral bacteria, and the concerted action may positively influence the survival of the bacteria in the oral community.
TI  - Cellular fatty acid composition as an adjunct to the identification of asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods.
AB  - Cellular fatty acid (CFA) compositions of 561 asporogenous, aerobic gram-positive rods were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography as an adjunct to their identification when grown on blood agar at 35 degrees C. The organisms could be divided into two groups. In the first group (branched-chain type), which included coryneform CDC groups A-3, A-4, and A-5; some strains of B-1 and B-3; "Corynebacterium aquaticum"; Brevibacterium liquefaciens; Rothia dentocariosa; and Listeria spp., the rods had sizable quantities of antiesopentadecanoic (Ca15:0) and anteisoheptadecanoic (Ca17:0) acids. Other species with these types of CFA included B. acetylicum, which contained large amounts of isotridecanoic (Ci13:0) and anteisotridecanoic (Ca13:0) acids. CFAs useful for distinguishing among Jonesia denitrificans, Oerskovia spp., some strains of CDC groups B-1 and B-3, Kurthia spp., and Propionibacterium avidum were hexadecanoic (C 16:0) acid, isopentadecanoic (Ci15:0) acid, and Ca15:0). The second group (straight-chained type), which included Actinomyces pyogenes; Arcanobacterium haemolyticum; C. bovis; C. cystitidis; C. diphtheriae; C. flavescens, "C. gentalium"; C. jeikeium; C. kutscheri; C. matruchotii; C .minutissimum; C. mycetoides; C. pilosum; C. pseudodiphtheriticum; "C. pseudogenitalium"; C. pseudotuberculosis; C. renale; CDC groups 1, 2, ANF-1, D-2, E, F-1, F-2, G-1, G-2, and I-2; C. striatum; "C. tuberculostearicum"; C. ulcerans; C. vitarumen; C. xerosis; and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, was typified by significant quantities of hexadecanoic (C16:0) and oleic acids (C18:cis9), with differences in the amounts of linoleic acid (C18:2), stearic acid (C18:0), an unnamed peak (equivalent chain length, 14.966), and small quantities of other known saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. CFA composition of these organisms was sufficiently discriminatory to assist in classification but could not be used as the sole means of identification.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
TI  - A numerical taxonomic study of members of the Actinomycetaceae and related taxa.
AB  - Two hundred and twenty-two representatives of the Actinomycetaceae and related taxa, including reference cultures, received strains and fresh isolates, were tested using 124 unit characters. The data were examined using numerical taxonomic techniques with various coefficients and average linkage clustering; the variation in composition of the clusters obtained from the different coefficients was slight. Most species included in the study formed discrete phena, which exhibited good differential characters. Actinomyces israelii was particularly well-defined and A. naeslundii and A. viscosus, although grouping together, did show divergence in several test results. Actinomyces bovis was initially linked with representatives of genera other than Actinomyces, these being Bifidobacterium, Corynebacterium pyogenes and Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae. The strains of Bacterionema matruchotii and Rothia dentocariosa formed tight distinct clusters associated only at low similarity levels with other members of the family Actinomycetaceae. The Arachnia propionica phenon, although well-defined, appeared to consist of two subclusters which could be assigned to serotypes 1 and 2. Tests which may be useful in identification are tabulated and the relationships between the various taxa are discussed.
TI  - Aerobic gram-positive pleomorphic rods isolated from dental plaque and gingival crevice.
AB  - A typical gram-positive pleomorphic aerobe is Rothia dentocariosa. However, there exist many organisms having similar characteristics (Rothia-like organisms). The purpose of this study is to isolate Rothia dentocariosa and Rothia-like organisms from the healthy and diseased sites of the oral cavity and to clarify the characteristics of those organisms. A total of 342 strains were isolated in this study, and 188 strains were identified as gram-positive pleomorphic rods. Seventy-seven typical strains of 188 isolates were examined physiologically and biochemically, and they were classified as follows: 1) 20 strains of A. viscosus; 2) 3 strains of A. naeslundii; 3) 26 strains of Rothia dentocariosa; 4) 2 strains of Bacterionema matruchotii; 5) 15 strains of Corynebacterium; 6) 7 strains of Nocardia; and 4 unknown strains. The strains of Rothia dentocariosa were mainly isolated from the dental plaque (24 of 26 isolates), and they had the ability to adhere on to the glass surface, and 5 of 26 strains of Rothia dentocariosa showed the ability of gelatin liquefaction.

AB  - Schmidt, Jean M. (State University of Iowa, Iowa City) and Robert L. Richardson.  Serology of Bacterionema matruchotii. J. Bacteriol. 83:584-589. 1962.-Serological relationships of Bacterionema matruchotii were studied by means of the complement-fixation reaction. A common complement-fixing antigen was demonstrated in 37 strains of this organism. Serological relationships to species in the genera Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Actinomyces, and Corynebacterium were shown by means of reciprocal complement-fixation adsorption studies. The close serological relationships among strains of Bacterionema matruchotii, and the broad serological cross-reactions with several other genera, support the establishment of this new genus.
