TI  - Antibacterial epipolythiodioxopiperazine and unprecedented sesquiterpene from Pseudallescheria boydii, a beetle (coleoptera)-associated fungus.
AB  - Pseudallescheria boydii residing in the gut of coleopteran (Holotrichia parallela) larva produces four new epipolythiodioxopiperazine (ETP) boydines A-D (3-6) and two novel sesquiterpene boydenes A (7) and B (10), in addition to bisdethiobis(methylthio)-deacetylaranotin (1), bisdethiodi(methylthio)-deacetylapoaranotin (2), AM6898 A (8) and ovalicin (9). The structure elucidation was accomplished by a combination of spectral methods with quantum chemical calculations of optical rotations and electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra. Boydine B (4) was shown to be active against the clinical strains Bifidobacterium sp., Veillonella parvula, Anaerostreptococcus sp., Bacteroides vulgatus and Peptostreptococcus sp. with an MIC range of 0.2-0.8 muM, and the pharmacophore 3-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethyl-5-oxooct-6-enoyl chain of 4 was shown to have (2R,3S,4S)-configurations. Boydene A (7) possessed an unprecedented carbon skeleton, suggesting an unusual biochemistry that allows an intramolecular Aldol addition in the fungus. Collectively, the finding may inspire the discovery of new antibacterial agents and the understanding on biosyntheses of polythiodioxopiperazine and sesquiterpene metabolites.
TI  - Analysis of interaction property of calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside with human gut microbiota.
AB  - Calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside as the major isoflavonoids in Astragali Radix has  been investigated intensively and has been reported to possess a wide range of pharmacological properties. However, the route and metabolites of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside by human intestinal bacteria are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, the objective of this study was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, five strains including Bacteroides sp.13, and sp.58, Clostridium sp.21-2, Veillonella sp.43-1, and Bacillus sp.46 were isolated from human intestinal bacteria and were studied their abilities to convert calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. A total of six metabolites were identified in human incubated solution by ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The results indicated that hydrolysis, demethylation, dehydroxylation and acetylation were the major metabolism of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. On the other hand, different strains of intestinal bacteria have varying degrees of growth sensitivity to calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides was significantly repressed by calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside, while commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium were less severely affected. This indicates that calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside exert significant effects on the intestinal environment by modulation of the intestinal bacterial population. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, absorption and potential activity of calycosin-7-O-beta-d-glucoside in human health and diseases.
TI  - Effect of liquiritin on human intestinal bacteria growth: metabolism and modulation.
AB  - Licorice is one of the oldest and most frequently used prescribed traditional Chimese medicines. However, the route and metabolites of liquiritin by human intestinal microflora are not well understood and its metabolites may accumulate to exert physiological effects. Therefore, our objective was to screen the ability of the bacteria to metabolize liquiritin and assess the effect of this compound on the intestinal bacteria. Finally, six strains, comprising Bacteroides sp. 22 and sp.57, Veillonella sp. 31 and sp.48, Bacillus sp. 46 and Clostridium sp. 51, were isolated and their abilities to convert liquiritin studied. A total of five metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry in human incubated solution. The results indicated that hydrolysis, hydrogenation, methylation, deoxygenation and acetylation were the major routes of metabolism of liquiritin. On the other hand, effect of liquiritin on different strains of intestinal bacteria growth was detected using an Emax precision microplate reader. Growth of certain pathogenic bacteria, such as Enterobacter, Enterococcus, Clostridium and Bacteroides, was significantly repressed by liquiritin, while growth of commensal probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium was less severely affected. Our observation provided further evidence for the importance of intestinal bacteria in the metabolism, and the potential activity of liquiritin in human health and disease.
TI  - An antibacterial metabolite from Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae F2.
AB  - In searching for symbionts derived from bioactive natural products, six sulfureous diketopiperazines designated as lasiodiplines A-F (1-6) were characterized from the culture of Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae F2, previously residing in the apparently normal flower of Illigera rhodantha (Hernandiaceae). Identification of structures was accomplished by a combination of spectroscopic and computational approaches, in conjunction with the low-temperature (100K) single-crystal X-ray diffraction with Cu Kalpha radiation. Lasiodipline E (5) was demonstrated to be antibacterial against the clinical strains Streptococcus sp., Bacteroides vulgates, Peptostreptococcus sp. and Veillonella parvula, respectively, with an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.12-0.25 mug/mL. In addition, compounds 4 and 6 exemplify two unusual architectures of natural cyclodipeptides, signifying the unique biochemical characteristics of the producing fungus.
TI  - Identification of isoquercitrin metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.
AB  - In this paper, ultraperformance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) and the MetaboLynx software combined with mass defect filtering were applied to identity the metabolites of isoquercitrin using an intestinal mixture of bacteria and 96 isolated strains from human feces. The human incubated samples collected for 72 h in the anaerobic incubator and extracted with ethyl acetate were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS within 10 min. The parent compound and five metabolites were identified by eight isolated strains, including Bacillus sp. 17, Veillonella sp. 23 and 32 and Bacteroides sp. 40, 41, 56, 75 and 88 in vitro. The results indicate that quercetin, acetylated isoquercitrin, dehydroxylated isoquercitrin, hydroxylated quercetin and hydroxymethylated quercetin are the major metabolites of isoquercitrin. Furthermore, a possible metabolic pathway for the biotransformation of isoquercitrin was established in intestinal flora. This study will be helpful for understanding the metabolic route of isoquercitrin and the role of different intestinal bacteria in the metabolism of natural compounds.
TI  - Identification of rutin deglycosylated metabolites produced by human intestinal bacteria using UPLC-Q-TOF/MS.
AB  - In this paper, rutin was metabolized by human intestinal bacteria and five isolated strains including Bacillus sp. 52, Bacteroides sp. 45, 42, 22 and Veillonella sp. 32, the metabolites were identified using ultra performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS). As a result, Bacillus sp. 52 and Bacteroides sp. 45 could metabolize rutin to quercetin 3-O-glucoside and leucocyanidin. Bacteroides sp. 42 and Veillonella sp. 32 could convert rutin to leucocyanidin. Bacteroides sp. 22 could hydrolyze rutin to quercetin-3-O-glucoside. In order to further explain the metabolism pathway of rutin, the beta-D-glucosidase and alpha-L-rhamnosidase activities of five strains were determined. Bacteroides sp. 22 could produce alpha-L-rhamnosidase but did not produce beta-D-glucosidase or beta-D-glucosidase activity was too low to be detected. The other four strains all demonstrated alpha-L-rhamnosidase and beta-D-glucosidase activities. Furthermore, alpha-L-rhamnosidase and beta-D-glucosidase activities of Veillonella sp. 32 and Bacteroides sp. 42 were higher than those of Bacteroides sp. 45 and Bacillus sp. 52. Based on these results, we can propose the deglycosylated rout of rutin: rutin was metabolized to be quercetin-3-O-glucoside by alpha-L-rhamnosidase produced from these bacteria, thereafter, quercetin-3-O-glucoside was further metabolized by beta-D-glucosidase to form leucocyanidin. Because of the higher enzyme activity in Veillonella sp. 32 and Bacteroides sp. 42, quercetin-3-O-glucoside was completely metabolized to leucocyanidin by these two bacteria. Due to the lack of beta-D-glucosidase activity, Bacteroides sp. 22 could not further metabolize quercetin-3-O-glucoside to leucocyanidin. This study will be helpful for understanding the deglycosylated rout of rutin and the role of different intestinal bacteria on the metabolism of natural compounds.
TI  - [Analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy Chinese women by using DNA-fingerprinting].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to Chinese females. METHODS: Women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in Peking University First Hospital from October 2009 to January 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. Vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the V3 region of 16S rDNA gene. PCR products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Featured bands on DGGE were recovered, cloned and sequenced. Alignment with known sequence was made by using Blast on GenBank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in different physiological states. RESULTS: (1) Vaginal flora in healthy Chinese women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, Lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. While L. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) Vaginal bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Veillonella sp., Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus, Prevotella sp., Anaerococcus lactolyticus and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSION: Based on the DGGE analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in Chinese healthy women at reproductive age are Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.,Bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing Veillonella sp. and Anaerococcus lactolyticus. Meanwhile Lactobacillus iners was firstly found by DGGE to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.
TI  - Subgingival microbial profiles of smokers with periodontitis.
AB  - The subgingival microbiome is largely uncultivated, and therefore, cultivation-based and targeted molecular approaches have limited value in examining the effect of smoking on this community. We tested the hypothesis that the subgingival biofilm is compositionally different in current and never-smokers by using an open-ended molecular approach for bacterial identification. Subgingival plaque from deep sites of current and never-smokers matched for disease was analyzed by 16S sequencing. Smokers demonstrated greater abundance of Parvimonas, Fusobacterium, Campylobacter, Bacteroides, and Treponema and lower levels of Veillonella, Neisseria, and Streptococcus. Several uncultivated Peptostreptococci, Parvimonas micra, Campylobacter gracilis, Treponema socranskii, Dialister pneumosintes, and Tannerella forsythia were elevated in this group, while Veillonella sp. oral clone B2, Neisseria sp. oral clone 2.24, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Capnocytophaga sp. clone AH015 were at lower levels. The microbial profile of smoking-associated periodontitis is distinct from that of non-smokers, with significant differences in the prevalence and abundance of disease-associated and health-compatible organisms.
TI  - Mechanical non-surgical treatment of peri-implantitis: a single-blinded randomized longitudinal clinical study. II. Microbiological results.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Peri-implantitis is common in patients with dental implants. We performed a single-blinded longitudinal randomized study to assess the effects of mechanical debridement on the peri-implant microbiota in peri-implantitis lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An expanded checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization assay encompassing 79 different microorganisms was used to study bacterial counts before and during 6 months following mechanical treatment of peri-implantitis in 17 cases treated with curettes and 14 cases treated with an ultrasonic device. Statistics included non-parametric tests and GLM multivariate analysis with p<0001 indicating significance and 80% power. RESULTS: At selected implant test sites, the most prevalent bacteria were: Fusobacterium nucleatum sp., Staphylococci sp., Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Helicobacter pylori, and Tannerella forsythia. 30 min. after treatment with curettes, A. actinomycetemcomitans (serotype a), Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus anginosus, and Veillonella parvula were found at lower counts (p<0.001). No such differences were found for implants treated with the ultrasonic device. Inconsistent changes occurred following the first week. No microbiological differences between baseline and 6-month samples were found for any species or between treatment study methods in peri-implantitis. CONCLUSIONS: Both methods failed to eliminate or reduce bacterial counts in peri-implantitis. No group differences were found in the ability to reduce the microbiota in peri-implantitis.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Commensal intestinal bacterial strains trigger ankylosing enthesopathy of the ankle in inbred B10.BR (H-2(k)) male mice.
AB  - Joint disease ankylosing enthesopathy (ANKENT) naturally occurs in inbred mice with C57Bl/10 genetic background. ANKENT has many parallels to human ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and represents an animal model for AS. Environmental conditions (i.e., microbial load of the organism) are among the risk factors for ANKENT, similar to AS. The role of microflora in the development of ANKENT was investigated. ANKENT was tested in four experimental groups of germ-free mice associated with different numbers of various intestinal microbes and three control groups: germ-free, specific pathogen-free, and conventional (CV) mice. Mice were colonized either with anaerobic bacteria isolated from the intestine of a CV mouse or with bacterial strains obtained from the collection of microorganisms. Microbes were characterized and checked by microbiological cultivation methods and with the use of polymerase chain reaction amplification and rDNA sequence analysis. Joint disease developed in GF mice colonized with a mixture containing Bacteroides spp. and Enterococcus sp., and/or Veillonella sp. and Staphylococcus sp. No ANKENT appeared in males colonized with probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus sp. In control groups ANKENT occurred in SPF and CV animals; the GF animals remained healthy. The results confirmed that the germ-free conditions protect from joint inflammation, and thus microbes are necessary for ANKENT development. In colonized mice the ANKENT was triggered by luminal anaerobic bacteria, which are common components of intestinal microflora.
TI  - Influence of local tetracycline on the microbiota of alveolar osteitis in rats.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of local tetracycline on the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in rats, and on the microbiota associated to this infection. Forty Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=10): I - the rats had the maxillary right incisor extracted and the alveolar wound did not receive any treatment; II - adrenaline and Ringer-PRAS were introduced into the alveolar wound; III - the alveolar wound was irrigated with sterile saline; and IV - the alveolar wound was irrigated with an aqueous solution of tetracycline. Microbial samples from the alveolar wounds were collected 2 days after surgery and inoculated on blood agar (with and without 8 microg/mL of tetracycline) and other selective media, and were incubated in either aerobiosis or anaerobiosis at 37 degrees C, for 2 to 14 days. It was verified that tetracycline reduced the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in the rats and caused significant changes in the microbiota of the surgical sites, decreasing the number of anaerobes and increasing the participation of tetracycline-resistant and multi-resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Intestinal mucosa-associated microflora in ulcerative colitis patients before and after restorative proctocolectomy with an ileoanal pouch.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was designed to identify the mucosa-associated microflora in  patients with severe ulcerative colitis before and after restorative proctocolectomy with ileoanal pouch construction in comparison with historic controls. METHODS: Ten patients with a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis were evaluated. Mucus was collected during colonoscopy from all segments of the colon and terminal ileum before surgery, and from the ileal pouch two and eight months after ileostomy closure. The prevalence and mean concentration of the mucosa-associated microflora were compared over time and with historic controls. RESULTS: Veillonella sp was the most prevalent bacterium in patients and controls. Klebsiella sp was significantly more prevalent in the ileum of controls, was not found in patients with ulcerative colitis, and after proctocolectomy returned to values found in controls. Some bacteria such as Enterobacter sp, Staphylococcus sp (coag-), Bacteroides sp (npg), Lactobacillus sp, and Veillonella sp had higher mean concentrations in the ileal pouch of patients after surgery than in controls. CONCLUSION: No bacterium was identified that could be exclusively responsible for the maintenance of the inflammatory process. The mucosa-associated microflora of patients with ulcerative colitis underwent significant changes after proctocolectomy with ileal pouch construction and returned to almost normal values for some bacteria.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without sinus tract.
AB  - AIM: To examine the microbiological status of primary endodontic infections in teeth with and without a sinus tract. METHODOLOGY: Samples were collected by means of a size 15 H-type file and two sterile paper points from 30 cases of primary endodontic infections with (n = 15) or without (n = 15) a sinus tract. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. RESULTS: The species found at the highest levels and prevalence were Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. vincentii, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Veillonella parvula, Enterococcus faecalis, Campylobacter gracilis and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts were similar between teeth with (44 x 10(5)) and without (50 x 10(5)) a sinus tract (t-test: P > 0.05). E. faecalis, Streptococcus anginosus, Capnocytophaga sputigena and Capnocytophaga gingivalis had significantly higher counts in the absence of sinus tract (Mann-Whitney test, P < 0.05). Higher levels of P. gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum sp. nucleatum were observed in cases with a sinus tract. Leptotrichia buccalis (OR = 1.83; CI 95%) and Porphyromonas endodontalis (OR = 2.15; CI 95%) were associated with an increased chance of subjects having a sinus tract. CONCLUSIONS: Primary endodontic infections were associated with a large variety of bacterial species. Specific differences between the composition of the microbiota of primary root canal infections were observed in cases with or without a sinus tract.
TI  - A novel sampling method for the investigation of gut mirobiota.
AB  - AIM: In order to characterize the qualitative and quantitative microorganisms in  different sites of the lower digestive tract (LDT) in healthy volunteers, a specific technique was developed for collecting mucous of the distal ileum, colon and rectum. METHODS: A polyethylene tube was designed to go through the colonoscope channel with a No.8 French tube. In order to avoid internal contamination, the distal extremity was protected with a membrane of microfilm after being sterilized in ethilene oxid. To facilitate the aspiration of a precise volume, its interior was coated with silicone. One hundred microlliter (0.1 mL) sample of mucous was collected and transferred into an Eppenddorff tube containing nine hundred microlliter (0.9 mL) of VMGA-3 (viable medium of Goteborg). This procedure was repeated at each site of the LDT with a new sterilized catheter. RESULTS: All sites revealed the "non pathogenic" anaerobic bacteria Veillonella sp (average 10(5) colony forming units/mL-CFU/mL), allowing to conclude an environment of low oxidation-reduction potential (redox) in the LDT. It was also characterized the presence of Klebisiella sp with significant statistical predominance (SSP) in the ileum. Enterobacter sp was found with SSP in the sigmoid colon, Bacteroides sp non-pigmented (npg) and E.coli with SSP in the sigmoid colon and rectum, Enterococcus sp and Lactobacillus sp with SSP in the rectum, all in a mean concentration of 10(5) CFU/mL. CONCLUSION: This procedure is feasible and efficient and can point out a similar distribution of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria with the presence of biological markers of normal microbiota in the LDT.
TI  - Digestive tract microbiota in healthy volunteers.
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to standardize the methods of sample collection of mucus from the digestive tract and to determine the microbiota in healthy volunteers from Brazil, collecting samples from the mouth, esophagus, stomach, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum. METHODS: Microbiota of selected healthy volunteers from the oral cavity (n=10), the esophagus (n=10), the upper digestive tract (n=20), and the lower digestive tract (n=24) were evaluated through distinct collection methods. Collection methods took into account the different sites, using basic scraping and swabbing techniques, stimulated saliva from the oral cavity, irrigation-aspiration with sterile catheters especially designed for the esophagus, a probe especially designed for upper digestive tract, and a special catheter for the lower digestive tract. RESULTS: (i) Mixed microbiota were identified in the oral cavity, predominantly Gram-positive aerobic and anaerobic cocci; (ii) transitional flora mainly in the esophagus; (iii) Veillonella sp, Lactobacillus sp, and Clostridium sp in the stomach and duodenum; (iv) in the jejunum and upper ileum, we observed Bacteroides sp, Proteus sp, and Staphylococcus sp, in addition to Veillonella sp; (v) in the colon, the presence of "nonpathogenic" anaerobic bacteria Veillonella sp (average 10(5) UFC) indicates the existence of a low oxidation-reduction potential environment, which suggests the possibility of adoption of these bacteria as biological markers of total digestive tract health. CONCLUSIONS: The collection methods were efficient in obtaining adequate samples from each segment of the total digestive tract to reveal the normal microbiota. These procedures are safe and easily reproducible for microbiological studies.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16S rRNA gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. Samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16S rRNA genes from DNA isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. Clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), Peptostreptococcus micros/Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone AJ062/BS044/FG014, Prevotella species, Dialister species, Mogibacterium species, Lachnospiraceae oral clone 55A-34, Filifactor alocis, Megasphaera sp. oral clone CS025/BS073, and Veillonella sp. oral clone BP1-85/Veillonella dispar/V. parvula. Bacteroides-like sp. oral clone X083/Bacteroidales oral clone MCE7_20 and Dialister sp. oral clone BS016/MCE7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. On the other hand, F. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, Prevotella intermedia, Dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. Bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. Overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. Molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the in-vitro activity of seven antimicrobial agents, including ertapenem, against recently isolated Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in Greece.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of penicillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, imipenem, ertapenem, metronidazole and clindamycin were evaluated against 138 Gram-negative anaerobic isolates (82 Bacteroides fragilis group, 17 non-fragilis Bacteroides spp., 31 Prevotella spp., four Fusobacterium spp., two Veillonella spp., one Porphyromonas sp. and one Tissierella praeacuta) collected from six general hospitals in Athens, Greece. Overall rates of non-susceptibility (both resistant and intermediately-resistant) to penicillin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid were 81.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The rates of non-susceptibility to cefoxitin and clindamycin were 30.3% and 31.1%, respectively, and that for metronidazole was 4.3% (four Prevotella spp. isolates, one Porphyromonas sp. isolate and one B. fragilis isolate). Only the single B. fragilis isolate was nim-positive by PCR. Only one B. fragilis isolate was resistant to both carbapenems tested, while six more Bacteroides spp. isolates were imipenem-susceptible and ertapenem-non-susceptible. The MIC range, MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were comparable for imipenem and ertapenem, although ertapenem MIC(90)s were one or two two-fold dilutions higher.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of faropenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against 405 aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections from animal and human bites.
AB  - Faropenem, a new oral beta-lactam agent with a penem structure, was very active against 405 aerobic and anaerobic bite isolates. It inhibited 232 of 236 (98%) aerobic isolates, including all Pasteurella spp. and Eikenella corrodens at < or = 0.25 mg/L, and 164/169 (97%) anaerobic isolates, at < or = 1 mg/L. The 10 isolates that required > or = 2 mg/L for inhibition were one strain each of Acinetobacter lwoffi, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Bacteroides ovatus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii and Peptostreptococcus tetradius, plus Corynebacterium 'aquaticum' (two strains) and Veillonella sp. (three strains).
TI  - The effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previously, we reported that SRP resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of Bacteroidesforsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Treponema denticola at 3 and 6 months post-SRP in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects were monitored at 9 and 12 months. Thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of SRP in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. METHOD: Clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to SRP and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. Subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. Each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. Differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the Wilcoxon signed ranks test. The Quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. RESULTS: Mean pocket depth (mm+/-SEM) decreased from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). Mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. Bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively). P. gingivalis, B. forsythus and T. denticola decreased in prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels at 9 and 12 months. Significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at 12 months for Actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, Streptococcus mitis, Capnocytophaga sp, and Veillonella parvula. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.
TI  - Analysis of intestinal flora of a patient with congenital absence of the portal vein.
AB  - A 14-year-old female patient, admitted for a closer examination of liver tumour (hepatocellular adenoma), was diagnosed as having a congenital absence of the portal vein. The blood ammonia level (approximately 120 micrograms dl-1) in the superior mesenteric vein was markedly low compared to the normal value of 300-350 micrograms dl-1 in the portal vein. The decreased ammonia concentration and urease activity of the patient's faeces were demonstrated. The dominant intestinal flora in the faeces of the patient, before operation, was Bifidobacterium sp., Bifidobacterium breve, Bifidobacterium lonqum, Lactobacillus plantarum, and after the operation Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Peptococcus magnus Bifidobacterium longum. In contrast, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides distasonis, B. ovatus, Bifidobacterium adolescentis were dominant flora in the faeces of two healthy volunteers, respectively. Among microorganisms isolated from the patient, Morganella morganii, Candida sp., Eubacterium aerofacience and Eubacterium rectale were strongly positive in urease activity in vitro; Streptococcus mitior, Staphylococcus intermedius, Micrococcus kristinae, Selenomonas ruminantum, Bacteroides ureolyticus and Lactobacillus casei ss. pseudoplantarum from the healthy volunteers. These results imply the homeostatic regulation system of faecal ammonia concentration by urease-producing microorganisms in the patient.
TI  - [Roxithromycin in dental infections].
AB  - Roxithromicin is a semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, with similar antibacterial activity to erythromycin. It is characterized by an excellent pharmacokinetic profile and a good tissue penetration. Particularly at the dose of 300 mg per day the dental tissue diffusion is extremely good, and this is important to oppose the oral cavity infections. Oral cavity infections can be either odontogenic or non odontogenic. Odontogenic infections are typically primary and are caused by commensal bacteria (oral Streptococci, Bacteroides sp., Veillonella sp. and Fusobacterium sp.). The antibacterial spectrum of roxithromycin is very large and includes many of the most frequent strains responsible for oral cavity infections. A very interesting characteristic of roxithromycin is its penetration in macrophages (uptake) that allow a more rapid inhibition of bacterial activity. To evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of roxithromycin in the treatment of odontogenic infections, an open study was performed. This study evaluated both the microbiological and clinical aspects. Thirty patients (21 females and 9 males) who had not been previously treated with antibiotic or antibacterial drugs, affected by infective dysodontiasis, gingivitis and periodontal diseases, received 300 mg per day (once a day) of roxithromycin for an average period of 6 days. The symptomatology considered was: intumescence, redness, pain, lymphangitis and presence of trismus. Clinical symptomatology was assessed at the start and at the end of the treatment. The symptomatological improvement due to roxithromycin was rapid and very effective. After 6 days of therapy, the improvement was statistically significant (p < 0.01) compared to basal conditions. No adverse reactions or side-effects were complained during the study. No changement were detected in laboratory parameters.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Subgingival temperature (III). Relation to microbial counts.
AB  - The present investigation examined the relationship of selected bacterial species and subgingival temperature. 35 subjects were measured at 6 sites per tooth for clinical parameters and subgingival temperature. Measurements were repeated for 21 subjects at 2 month intervals providing a total of 66 subjects visits. At each visit, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and anaerobically dispersed, diluted and plated on non-selective media. After anaerobic incubation, colonies were lifted to nylon filters and specific species detected using digoxigenin-labeled whole chromosomal DNA probes. Species enumerated were; A. actinomycetemcomitans serotypes a and b, B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, B. intermedius I and II, C. ochracea, F. nucleatum ss. vincentii, P. micros, S. intermedius, S. sanguis I and II, V. parvula and W. recta. Total viable counts and counts of Capnocytophaga sp. were determined directly from the primary isolation plates. A total of 1581 samples were evaluated. Subject visits with higher mean subgingival temperatures had significantly higher mean %s of B. intermedius I and P. micros, and lower mean %s of Capnocytophaga sp. Sites with higher subgingival temperatures had elevated proportions of B. intermedius I and II, A. actinomycetemcomitans serotype a and B. gingivalis more frequently than sites with lower temperatures, while Capnocytophaga sp. were elevated more often at cooler sites. 43 of the subject visits had follow up attachment level measurements at 2 months. The 1026 microbial samples and the subgingival temperature measurements from these visits were related to longitudinal attachment change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  - The results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. In the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Veillonella and Actinomyces. Significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. There was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). Antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine used locally showed satisfactory results. The above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: Bacillus coagulans, B. licheniformis, Pseudomonas sp., Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Staphylococcus sp. and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  - Two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. Of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (Peptostreptococcus (1); Eubacterium (9); Clostridium (6); Veillonella (6); Megasphera (1); Bacteroides (28); Fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (P. anaerobius (1); E. fossor (9); C. villosum (1); B. fragilis (1); B. tectum (2); B. heparinolyticus (2)). Three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (LRT) or paraoral (PO) bacterial infections. Of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. Phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. Among the obligately anaerobic species, Gram-positive cocci including P. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, E. fossor 11% and other Gram-positive rods (excluding Clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. The Gram-negative rods comprised B. fragilis 5%, B. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented Bacteroides 3% and other Bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of Fusobacterium (7%), and Gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. Among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by Pasteurella spp. 19%, Escherichia coli 17%, Actinomyces spp. 9%, Streptococcus spp. 9%. Incidental facultative isolates were Enterococcus spp. 2%, Enterobacter cloaceae 2%, Actinobacillus spp. 2% and Gram-negative corroding rods 5%. On the basis of the similarities (as determined by DNA hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. E. fossor and B. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and LRT and PO diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.
TI  - Changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. A 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  - It was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. Between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. During this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. High values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. The frequency of detection of Actinomyces odontolyticus and of Capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. The frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting Bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. However, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting B. intermedius and B. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). A significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of A. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). In girls, a similar increase was obtained for A. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the Tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). The changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.
TI  - Microbial patterns in pooled subgingival plaque samples from young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis.
AB  - Different bacterial profiles of subgingival plaque have been described for different clinical categories of marginal periodontitis. In the present investigation the subgingival microflora was studied in young adults with advanced marginal periodontitis. From 12 patients pooled subgingival plaque samples from 5 advanced stages of diseased sites were examined by direct differential phase-contrast microscopy and by cultivation on enriched and selective media. The proportions of the following genera and species were calculated: black-pigmented Bacteroides sp., B. gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Veillonella sp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Capnocytophaga sp., Eikenella corrodens, Campylobacter sp., and Candida sp. Spirochete identification was carried out ultrastructurally. Calculated percent minimum similarity levels between the individuals revealed that each patient harbored its characteristic cultivable subgingival microflora different from the other individuals. The spirochetes seemed to constitute the subgingival bacterial group with the smallest variation as certain morphotypes were dominating in almost all individuals.
TI  - Relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  - Bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. We obtained semen samples from 37 men attending a Special Infertility Clinic and assessed the relationship between seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. Aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. One hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. The microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), Peptostreptococcus sp (62%), Bacteroides sp (27%), Gardnerella vaginalis (19%), Lactobacillus sp (16%), Actinomyces sp (16%), Enterococcus (11%), and Veillonella (11%). Other microorganisms including group B streptococcus, Hemophilus, Escherichia coli, Mobiluncus, and Clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. When the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), Bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or Peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (P greater than .05 for each comparison). The proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Microbial flora of surface versus core tonsillar cultures in recurrent tonsillitis in children.
AB  - Surface and 'core' tonsillar specimens were collected from 60 children, between 2 and 14 years of age, suffering from recurrent tonsillitis, in order to establish the reliability of surface tonsillar swabbing technique and to define the most frequently involved aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. From the qualitative point of view, the same mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained in both samples thus demonstrating the reliability of the surface swabbing technique. From the quantitative point of view, 187 microorganisms, 129 (69.2%) aerobes and 58 (30.8%) anaerobes were isolated from surface cultures while 184, 109 (59.2%) aerobes and 75 (40.8%) anaerobes from the core cultures, thus demonstrating a greater number of anaerobes in the core of the tonsil. The most common isolated aerobic microorganisms were the alpha- and beta-hemolytic Streptococci, the Neisseriae and the Staphylococcus aureus; the predominant anaerobic ones were the Fusobacterium nucleatum, the Bacteroides sp. and the Veillonella parvula. The isolated staphylococcus aureus and the bacteroides sp. were all beta-lactamase producers.
TI  - The predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  - Subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. Active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". The predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. Among the 33 subjects, W. recta, B. intermedius, F. nucleatum, B. gingivalis and B. forsythus were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, S. mitis, C. ochracea, S. sanguis II, V. parvula and an unnamed Actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. The likelihood of a site being active was increased if B. forsythus, B. gingivalis, P. micros, A. actinomycetemcomitans, W. recta, or B. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if S. sanguis II, the Actinomyces sp., or C. ochracea were detected.
TI  - [Sensitivity to an amoxicillin-clavulanic acid combination, of deep tonsillar flora isolated in chronic tonsillitis].
AB  - Deep tonsillar flora were identified in tonsils removed from 48 patients, children and adults, with chronic tonsillitis and recurrent sore throats or obstructive hypertrophy. Most specimens (38/48) cultured multiple germs (2 to 5 different species) with aerobic and anaerobic Gram+ and Gram-forms, some being beta-lactamase producers. Of the total of 135 strains isolated, 104 were aerobic and 31 anaerobic. The species of aerobic germs most frequently isolated were: Apart from alpha-hemolytic streptococci of undertermined group (38 strains), Haemophilus sp. : 14 (including 3 beta-lactamase + strains), Staphylococcus aureus: 15 (including 11 beta-lactamase + strains), Streptococcus A : 10, Enterobacteriaceae : 6, Neisseria sp. : 8 (including 1 beta-lactamase + strain). And among the anaerobic germs: Peptococcus : 3, Veillonella alc : 10, Fusobacterium nucleatum : 9, Bacteroides melaninogenicus : 6, Other Bacteroides : 2. Of the 127 strains tested, 102 were sensitive to amoxicillin and 121 to amoxicillin and clavulanic acid combination. The presence of a beta-lactamase producing bacterium in 1 of 3 specimens suggests the risk of failure of treatment with penicillin, prescribed classically for this type of affection.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  - Bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 Danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. Thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml]. In 25% of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) CFU/ml. The microorganisms isolated most frequently were: Streptococcus, sp. ("Viridans group"), Veillonella parvula, Hemophilus parainfluenzae, Lactobacillus, sp., Corynebacterium, sp., Actinomyces, sp., Bacteroides, sp., and Hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. The upper range for the number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) CFU/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. Enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and Enterobacteriaceae were not found.
TI  - Human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  - In clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. This study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. Dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (BE) in buffer and pooled human serum (PHS) from pure cultures of Streptococcus sanguis. Actinomyces viscosus, A naeslundii, Bacteroides intermedius, Fusobacterium sp and Veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. In addition, fractions of S sanguis culture fluids (CFs) from Sephadex G-10 chromatography were evaluated. All BE solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees C and heat-inactivated prior to testing. All BEs in buffer attracted neutrophils, with the greatest responses seen to S sanguis and B intermedius followed by A viscosus. Migration to all BEs in PHS was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all BEs are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. A viscosus BE activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. CFs of S sanguis, A viscosus, and to a lesser degree, Fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. Evidence from [3H]FMLP competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that S sanguis CFs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. Of the bacteria associated with health, S sanguis and A viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. This observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased neutrophil transmigration in early disease.
TI  - Transtracheal aspiration in pulmonary infection in children with cystic fibrosis.
AB  - Six transtracheal aspirations (TTA) and expectorated sputum specimens were collected from four children suffering from cystic fibrosis who had pulmonary infection. Specimens obtained from both sites were cultured for aerobic bacteria and TTA aspirates were also cultured for anaerobes. Differences in bacteria isolated in TTA and sputum aspirates were present in all instances. Six isolates were recovered in both sites (three Pseudomonas aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus aureus and one Aspergillus flavus). Five aerobic isolates were recovered only in the expectorated sputum and not in TTA aspirations (two Klebsiella pneumoniae and one each of P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli and Proteus mirabilis). Nine organisms were isolated only from the TTA (two each of Veillonella parvula and Alpha hemolytic streptococci, and one each of Bacteroides fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, Lactobacillus sp., Haemophilus influenzae and Gamma hemolytic streptococci). The recovery of anaerobic organisms from four of the six TTA specimens suggests a possible role for these organisms in the etiology of pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis. We found TTA to be helpful in the bacterial diagnosis and management of pulmonary infections in cystic fibrosis.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in tonsils of children with recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Tonsils were obtained from 50 children suffering from recurrent tonsillitis. Patients' ages ranged from 2.5 to 17 years (mean 6 years); 29 were males and 21 females. The tonsils were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora was obtained in all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.1 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes) per specimen. There were 207 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates were 101 Bacteroides sp (including 10 B fragilis group, and 47 B melaninogenicus group), 29 Fusobacterium sp, 34 Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (25 Peptococcus sp and 9 Peptostreptococcus sp) and 16 Veillonella sp. There were 185 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates were 41 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 24 Staphylococcus aureus, 19 beta-hemolytic streptococci (11 group A, 4 group B, and 2 each group C and F), 14 Haemophilus sp (including 12 H influenzae type B) and 5 H parainfluenzae. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 56 isolates recovered from 37 tonsils. These were all isolates of S aureus (24) and B fragilis (10), 15 of 47 B melaninogenicus (32%), 5 of the 12 B oralis (42%), and 2 of 12 H influenzae type B (17%). Our findings indicate the polymicrobial aerobic and anaerobic nature of deep tonsillar flora in children with recurrent tonsillitis, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in 74% of the patients.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of adenoids in children: a comparison between  patients with chronic adenotonsillitis and adenoid hypertrophy.
AB  - Adenoids were obtained from 18 children with chronic adenotonsillitis (Group A) and from 12 others with adenoid hypertrophy (Group B). Patients' ages ranged from 20 months to 15 years (mean 6 years); 18 were males and 12 females. The adenoids were sectioned in half after heat searing of the surface, and the core material was cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients, yielding an average of 7.8 isolates (4.6 anaerobes and 3.2 aerobes) per specimen. There were 97 anaerobes isolated. The predominant isolates in both groups were: Bacteroides sp. (including B. melaninogenicus and B. oralis), Fusobacterium sp., gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and Veillonella sp. There were 138 aerobic isolates. The predominant isolates in both groups were: alpha and gamma hemolytic streptococci, beta hemolytic streptococci (Group A, B, C, and F), S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, and Hemophilus sp. Hemophilus influenzae type B, and S. aureus were more frequently isolated in Group A. B. fragilis was only recovered in Group A. Beta lactamase production was noted in 27 isolates obtained from 18 patients. Fifteen of these patients belonged to Group A (83% of Group A), while 3 were members of Group B (25% of Group B). These bacteria were all isolates of S. aureus (11) and B. fragilis (2), 8 of 22 B. melaninogenicus group, 4 of 11 B. oralis, and two of 8 H. influenza type B. Our findings indicate the polymicrobial nature of deep adenoid flora and demonstrate the presence of many beta lactamase-producing organisms in children with recurrent adenotonsillitis.
TI  - Rapid method that aids in distinguishing Gram-positive from Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Several species of anaerobic bacteria display variable Gram stain reactions which often make identification difficult. A simple, rapid method utilizing a 3% solution of potassium hydroxide to distinguish between gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial was tested on 213 strains of anaerobic bacteria representing 19 genera. The Gram stain reaction and KOH test results were compared with the antibiotic disk susceptibilities (vancomycin and colistin) the preliminary grouping of anaerobic bacteria. All three procedures were in agreement for the majority of strains examined. Some strains of clostridia, eubacteria, and bifidobacteria stained gram negative or gram variable; the KOH and antibiotic disk susceptibility tests correctly classified these strains as gram-positive. The KOH test incorrectly grouped some strains of Bacteroides sp., Fusobacterium sp., Leptotrichia buccalis, and Veillonella parvula, but all Gram stain results for these strains were consistent for gram-negative bacteria. The KOH test is a useful supplement to the Gram stain and antibiotic disk susceptibility testing for the initial classification of anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Surface vs core-tonsillar aerobic and anaerobic flora in recurrent tonsillitis.
AB  - Specimens from both the surface and the core of tonsils from 23 children with recurrent tonsillitis were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms. Mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were obtained from all patients. The predominant anaerobic isolates were Bacteroides sp, Fusobacterium nucleatum, anaerobic Gram-positive cocci, and Eubacterium sp. The predominant aerobic isolates were alpha-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Haemophilus sp. beta-Lactamase production was noted in 49 isolates from 19 patients (83%). Seventy percent of the aerobic isolates were recovered in both core and surface specimens, compared with 57% of the anaerobic isolates. Ten percent of aerobes were recovered only in the core, compared with 33% of the anaerobes, and 20% of the aerobes in the surface only, compared wtih 10% of the anaerobes. These data demonstrate the discrepancies between surface and core cultures in the isolation of anaerobic bacteria, and raise the question whether surface cultures can accurately predict the presence of beta-lactamase-producing organisms or other pathogens in the recurrently infected tonsil.
TI  - Complications of sinusitis in children.
AB  - Eight patients (6 to 15 years of age) who had periorbital cellulitis and other complications of sinusitis were studied. Both ethmoid and maxillary sinusitis were present in four patients, frontal sinusitis in two, and ethmoid sinusitis and pansinusitis in one patient each. Subdural empyema occurred in four patients, in one case accompanied by cerebritis and brain abscess and in another by meningitis. Periorbital abscess was present in two children who had ethmoiditis. Alveolar abscess in the upper incisors was present in two children whose infection had spread to the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from the infected sinuses in all the patients. These were seven isolates of Bacteroides sp, four Fusobacterium sp, three microaerophilic streptococci, three Gram-positive anaerobic cocci, and two Veillonella sp. There was only one aerobic isolate recovered, a group F beta-hemolytic. Streptococcus. Surgical drainage and appropriate antimicrobial therapy resulted in complete eradication of the infection in all patients. The role of anaerobic bacteria in sinus infection and its subsequent complication is discussed. Given the possible serious complications of this disease, the early recognition of sinusitis in children and the institution of appropriate antimicrobial and surgical therapy are of great clinical importance.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from pediatric patients. A one-year experience.
AB  - During 1975, 115 speciments from the soft tissues, body fluids, and purulent sites in 105 pediatric ward and nursery patients were submitted to the clinical laboratory for anaerobic study, and 75% of the cultures were positive. In most instance specimens were collected in anaerobic transport tubes containing peptone yeast extract and glucose. In the laboratory, samples were processed by the anaerobic holding jar method. Nineteen different anaerobic organisms were isolated; the average number of species per specimen was 1.8 Bacteroides sp were the most common isolates (45 strains). Other isolates included 44 anaerobic cocci (15 of which were Peptostreptococcus sp), 22 Propionibacterium sp, ten Fusobacterium sp, nine Clostridium sp, eight Veillonella sp, six Bifidobacterium sp, and four Eubacterium sp. The main sources of anaerobic isolates included 52 gastric aspirates, 46 soft tissue sites, 14 blood specimens, 12 CSF samples, and 12 samples from the external ear canals. Forty-one (43%) of the 86 specimens that contained anaerobic bacteria also had aerobic organisms present.
TI  - Comparison of three methods of susceptibility testing of bacteroidaceae, peptococcaceae and other anaerobes to doxycycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of doxycycline against 147 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative anaerobes was determined by broth dilution, agar dilution and agar diffusion tests. The strains were isolated from clinical specimens in 1977. Saccharolytic Bacteroides strains (39 B. fragilis, 6 B. thetaiotaomicron, 4 B. vulgatus) showed broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 0.0625-4.0 microgram/ml after 5 h incubation and MICs of less than or equal to 16 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation at 37 degrees C. With strains of B. oralis, B. melaninogenicus ss. intermedius, B. corrodens, Veillonella sp. and Megasphaera elsdenii the broth dilution MICs were less than or equal to 0.0625-32 microgram/ml after 15 h incubation. Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium acnes, Eubacterium sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Clostridium sp. had broth dilution MICs of less than or equal to 2 microgram/ml, whereas Peptococcus spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.0625 to greater than 32 microgram/ml. With the great majority of strains tested, MICs were 2 to 256 times higher in agar than in broth dilution tests. Clinical and experimental studies seem to be needed to determine which of the in vitro data are correlated to the outcome of doxycycline therapy. Several groups and species were separately considered for statistical analysis of the relationship between zone size and MIC. With gram-positive anaerobes, correlation was poor between broth dilution MIC and zone size (correlation coefficients r = - 0.168 for Peptococcaceae, and r = - 0.108 for P. acnes). When calculating the regression lines for agar dilution MICs and zone diameters, a higher correlation was found (r = - 0.9 for Peptococcaceae; r = - 0.397 for P. acnes). With B. fragilis and other Bacteroides species correlation coefficients were r = - 0.807 to r = - 0.891 for broth and agar dilution MICs and zone size but stochastic linearity was lacking.
TI  - In vitro sensitivity of anaerobic bacteria to fosfomycin.
AB  - The minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined in 98 strains of anaerobic  bacteria that came from clinical samples against fosfomycin, penicillin, cephalothin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, clindamycin and lincomycin. The results obtained indicate that fosfomycin is usually inactive against Bacteroides sp. and is active up to 32 mug/ml or less against 85% of Peptococcus and 95% of Peptostreptococcus, being consequently comparatively less active than the rest of the antibiotics that were tested against Bacteroides, sp., while against Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus it is less active than penicillin, cephalothin, clindamycin and lincomycin, and somewhat more active than chloramphenicol and tetracycline.
TI  - Susceptibility to erythromycin of anaerobes of the genera Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Sphaerophorus, Veillonella, Clostridium, Corynebacterium, Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus.
AB  - The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of erythromycin were determined by broth dilution tests for 313 anaerobic strains, most of which were clinical isolates. All the gram-positive anaerobes tested (84 Peptococcaceae, including 21 Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 15 Peptococcus variabilis; 65 Corynebacterium acnes and 29 Clostridium strains, including 13 C. perfringens) were sensitive (MIC values 0.012 through 3.12 microgram erythromycin/ml); so were 111 cultures of gram-negative anaerobes (52 Bacteroides fragilis, 12 B. thetaiotaomicron, 7 B. vulgatus, 13 B. oralis, 4 B. melaninogenicus, 10 Sphaerophorus necrophorus, 2 Veillonella sp., 11 members of other species). Erythromycin at concentrations of 6.25 through 200.0 microgram/ml was active against 24 strains (1 B. fragilis, 4 Fusobacterium fusiforme, 9 Sph. freundi, 10 Sph. varius). The present results are compared to the limited number of reports existing with regard to the susceptibility of anaerobes to erythromycin.
TI  - [Antibacterial and bactericidal activity of tinidazole against anaerobic bacteria comparing with metronidazole (author's transl)].
AB  - Antibacterial activity of tinidazole (1-2-(ethylsulfonyl)-2-methyl-5-nitroimidazole) against anaerobic bacteria including Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium, Propionibacterium, Bacteroides and Fusobacterium was studied by agar dilution method comparing with metronidazole. In addition to this work, bactericidal effect of tinidazole and metronidazole against P. prevotii, B. fragilis ss. fragilis and F. varium was examined by quantitative culture method after incubation in GAM broth containing of 4 MIC, 2 MIC, 1 MIC and 1/2 MIC of both drugs against each of three strains for 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. All the strains of Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus including P. anaerobius, P. saccharolyticus, P. prevotii and Ps. anaerobius and others were susceptible to a concentration of 6.25 mcg/ml of this drug. A concentration of 3.13 mcg/ml inhibited all strains of Bacteroides including B. fragilis ss. fragilis (12 strains), ss. vulgatus (5 strains), ss. thetaiotaomicron (4 strains) and ss. distasonis (2 strains). To this concentration all strains of Fusobacterium including F. varium (20 strains), F. mortiferum (2 strains) and other Fusobacterium sp. (5 strains) were susceptible. On the contrary, Propionibacterium acnes (6 strains) was resistant to 100 mcg/ml or more of tinidazole and metronidazole. The antibacterial activity of tinidazole was stronger against Bacteroides than that of metronidazole, while almost equal against Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Eubacterium and Fusobacterium. Tinidazole was bactericidal against F. varium in a concentration of 2 MIC till 24 hours of incubation but did not show such an activity on B. fragilis ss. fragilis in same concentration even after 12 hours of incubation. On the other hand, metronidazole was bactericidal against B. fragilis ss. fragilis while was not against F. varium. Against P. prevotii bactericidal activity of both drugs was similar. Tinidazole as well as metronidazole is an excellent chemotherapeutic agent against anaerobic bacteria excluding Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium adolescentis.
