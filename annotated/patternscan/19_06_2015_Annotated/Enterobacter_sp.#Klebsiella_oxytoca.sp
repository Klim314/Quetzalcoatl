TI  == new report of additional enterobacterial species causing wilt in west bengal, india.
AB  == ralstonia solanacearum is known to be the most prominent causal agent of bacterial wilt worldwide. it has a wide host range comprising solanaceous and nonsolanaceous plants. typical symptoms of the disease are leaf wilt, browning of vascular tissues, and collapsing of the plant. with the objective of studying the diversity of pathogens causing bacterial wilt in west bengal, we collected samples of diseased symptomatic crops and adjacent symptomatic and asymptomatic weeds from widespread locations in west bengal. by means of a routine molecular identification test specific to "r. solanacearum species complex", the majority of these strains (68 out of 71) were found to not be r. solanacearum. presumptive identification of these isolates with conventional biochemicals, extensive testing of pathogenicity of a subset involving greenhouse trials fulfilling koch's postulate test, and scanning electron microscopic analysis for the presence of pathogen in diseased plants were done. 16s rdna sequencing of a subset of these strains (genbank accession nos. jx880249-jx880251) and analysis of sequences with the nblast programme showed a high similarity (97%-99%) to sequences of the enterobacteriaceae group available in genbank. molecular phylogeny further established the taxonomic position of the strains. the 3 bacterial strain cultures have been submitted to mtcc, institute of microbial technology, chandigarh, india, and were identified as klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cowanii, and klebsiella oxytoca, respectively. although enterobacter sp. has previously been reported to cause wilt in many plants, susceptibility of  most of the dedicated hosts of r. solanacearum to wilt caused by enterobacter and other bacteria from enterobacteriaceae is being reported for the first time in this work.

TI  == characterization of beta-lactamases in faecal enterobacteriaceae recovered from healthy humans in spain: focusing on ampc polymorphisms.
AB  == the intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampc genes in species of citrobacter, enterobacter or escherichia genera. in this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampc beta-lactamase  genes. fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 escherichia coli, 4 citrobacter braakii, 9 citrobacter freundii, 8 enterobacter cloacae, 1 proteus mirabilis, 1 proteus vulgaris, 1 klebsiella oxytoca, 1 serratia sp. and 1 cronobacter sp. a high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the ampc phenotype in 22  isolates (31 %) and the esbl phenotype in 3 isolates. ampc molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla cmy and bla act genes from citrobacter and enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. the prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampc genes obtained in this study was 2 %. the unique plasmid-mediated bla ampc identified in this study was the bla cmy-2 gene, detected in an e. coli isolate ascribed to  the sequence type st405 which belonged to phylogenetic group d. the hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the isecp1-bla cmy-2-blc structure  was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable inck plasmid. this study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. extensive ampc-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.

TI  == chemical composition of essential oil from ripe fruit of schinus terebinthifolius raddi and evaluation of its activity against wild strains of hospital origin.
AB  == the essential oil (eo) composition of ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi was analyzed by gc-ms. the oil extraction yielded 6.54 +/- 1.06% (w/w). seventeen compounds were identified, accounting for 91.15% of the total oil, where monoterpenes constituted the main chemical class (85.81%), followed by sesquiterpenes (5.34%). the major monoterpene identified was delta-3-carene (30.37%), followed by limonene (17.44%), alpha-phellandrene (12.60%) and alpha-pinene (12.59%). trans-caryophyllene (1.77%) was the major sesquiterpene identified. the antibacterial activity of the essential oil was evaluated against wild strains of hospital origin (escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp., klebsiella oxytoca, corynebacterium sp., staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter sp., enterobacter agglomerans, bacillus sp., nocardia sp. and streptococcus group d).  the essential oil of the ripe fruit of s. terebinthifolius raddi has shown to be  active against all tested wild strains, with minimum inhibitory concentration ranging from 3.55 mug/ml to 56.86 mug/ml. however, it has revealed some differences in susceptibility: the general, gram-positive species showed greater  sensitivity to the action of eo, which is probably due to the lower structural complexity of their cell walls.

TI  == cultivable endophytic bacteria from leaf bases of agave tequilana and their role  as plant growth promoters.
AB  == agave tequilana weber var. 'azul' is grown for the production of tequila, inulin  and syrup. diverse bacteria inhabit plant tissues and play a crucial role for plant health and growth. in this study culturable endophytic bacteria were extracted from leaf bases of 100 healthy agave tequilana plants. in plant tissue  bacteria occurred at mean population densities of 3 million cfu/g of fresh plant  tissue. three hundred endophytic strains were isolated and 16s rdna sequences grouped the bacteria into eight different taxa that shared high homology with other known sequences. bacterial endophytes were identified as acinectobacter sp., a. baumanii, a. bereziniae, cronobacter sakazakii, enterobacter hormaechei,  bacillus sp. klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas sp., enterococcus casseliflavus, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and gluconobacter oxydans. isolates were confirmed to be plant growth promoting bacteria (pgpb) by their capacities for nitrogen fixation, auxin production, phosphate solubilization, or  antagonism against fusarium oxysporum ac132. e. casseliflavus jm47 and k. oxytoca jm26 secreted the highest concentrations of iaa. the endophyte acinectobacter sp. jm58 exhibited the maximum values for nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization index (psi). inhibition of fungi was found in pseudomonas sp. jm9p and k. oxytoca jm26. bacterial endophytes show promise for use as bio-inoculants  for agave cultivation. use of endophytes to enhance cultivation of agave may be particularly important for plants produced by micropropagation techniques, where  native endophytes may have been lost.

TI  == surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in indian.
AB  == objective: to record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. methods: urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (uti)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by kirby-bauer's disc  diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. results: from wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during april 2011 to september 2012. two gram-positive, staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus) and enterococcus faecalis (e. faecalis), and nine gram-negative bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter sp., escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. both s. aureus and e. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. particularly, all gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for uti. conclusions: antibiograms of 11 uti-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and s. aureus. moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of s. aureus and e. faecalis is a matter of concern.

TI  == klebsiella michiganensis sp. nov., a new bacterium isolated from a tooth brush holder.
AB  == isolate w14(t) recovered from a household tooth brush holder was found to be gram-negative, a facultative anaerobic, non-motile, capsulated, and a non-endospore-forming straight rod. based on phylogenetic analysis with 16s rrna  gene sequence, isolate w14(t) was affiliated to the genus klebsiella. the closest phylogenetic relative was k. oxytoca with 99 % similarity in the 16s rrna gene sequence. the major whole-cell fatty acids were c(16:0) (31.23 %), c(18:1omega6c)/c(18:1omega7c) (21.10 %), and c(16:1omega7c)/c(16:1omega6c) (19.05 %). the sequence similarities of isolate w14(t) based on rpob, gyra, and gyrb were 97, 98, and 98 % with k. oxytoca, and 97, 93, and 90 % with k. mobilis (=enterobacter aerogenes), respectively. the ribotyping pattern showed a 0.46 similarity with k. oxytoca atcc 13182(t) and 0.24 with k. mobilis atcc 13048(t).  the dna g+c content of isolate w14(t) was 54.6 mol%. the dna-dna relatedness was  55.7 % with k. oxytoca atcc 13182(t). using the identification technology of maldi-tof mass spectrometry, the top matches for this isolate were k. oxytoca atcc 13182(t) (match factor score 1.998) and k. mobilis (score 1.797). on the basis of phenotypic, biochemical, chemotaxonomic, and molecular studies, isolate  w14(t) could be differentiated from other members of the genus klebsiella including k. mobilis. therefore, it is proposed that isolate w14(t) (=atcc baa-2403(t)=dsm 25444(t)) should be classified as the type strain of a novel species of the genus klebsiella, k. michiganensis sp. nov.

TI  == influence of consumption of probiotics on presence of enterobacteria in the oral  cavity.
AB  == clinical benefits of probiotics have been clearly reported in different gastrointestinal disorders, many of them caused by enterobacteria. the oral cavity is a port of entry and can be an important reservoir of these microorganisms. this work evaluated whether consumption of probiotics was able to influence the presence of enterobacteria in the oral cavity and the specific secretory response against these microorganisms. saliva samples of healthy individuals were collected and plated in macconkey agar. carriers of gram-negative, rod-shaped microorganisms in the oral cavity were selected and instructed to use the probiotic yakult lb for 20 days. saliva was then collected  and enterobacteria species were identified using the api 20 e system and by elisa using anti-enterobacteria iga. the results showed reduction in the prevalence of  enterobacteria, but no significant changes in enterobacterial counts (log cfu/ml; p = 0.3457). the species most frequently isolated were enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella oxytoca, both before and after probiotic consumption. no significant changes were observed in anti-enterobacteria iga levels. in conclusion, probiotic consumption had some influence on enterobacterial presence in the oral cavity, but did not affect enterobacterial counts or the specific immune secretory response against them.

TI  == bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes from a greek vineyard.
AB  == grape bacterial microbiota plays central roles in the quality of grapes and wine, yet its diversity remains poorly described. in the present study, bacterial species associated with sound and botrytis-infected grapes of two cultivars originating from the same vineyard were assessed. isolates were identified by pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and sequence analysis of partial 16s rrna gene. comparable counts were recorded between botrytis-infected  and sound grape samples. in all cases, the majority of isolates belonged to different species of enterobacteriaceae. the dominant species in the vineyard was klebsiella oxytoca that was found in different combinations with citrobacter freundii, enterobacter spp., erwinia sp., pantoea dispersa, tatumella ptyseos or  other species. in fermenting musts, those populations declined while other species evolved, like lactobacillus plantarum and enterobacter ludwigii. populations in botrytised samples persisted longer during spontaneous fermentations. present study suggests that bacterial diversity on grapes may be wider than previously described.

TI  == comparison of the efficacy of rose bengal and erythrosin in photodynamic therapy  against enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the photosensitizers rose bengal and erythrosin combined with a light-emitting diode (led) on enterobacteriaceae. twelve enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from the oral cavities of patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic therapy, including three escherichia coli, three enterobacter cloacae, three klebsiella oxytoca and three  klebsiella pneumoniae, were studied. an enterobacteriaceae suspension (10(6) cells/ml) was prepared from each clinical strain isolated from the human oral cavity and subjected to the following treatments: led and rose bengal, led and erythrosin, led and physiological solution, and physiological solution only as control. a blue led unit (460 nm), and rose bengal and erythrosin at a concentration of 50 micromol/l were used. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 h, the number of colony-forming units (cfu) was calculated and subjected to analysis of variance (anova). the enterobacterial strains were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with rose bengal. there was a reduction of approximately 7.14 log10 for enterobacter cloacae, 7.73 log10 for escherichia coli, 6.76 log10  for klebsiella pneumoniae and 7.21 log10 for klebsiella oxytoca. however, photodynamic therapy using erythrosin did not reduce the numbers of cfus per milliliter compared to the control group. the use of the led alone had no toxic effect on the strain tested. the enterobacteriaceae strains studied were sensitive to photodynamic therapy with rose bengal.

TI  == occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from ria de aveiro. ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using rep-pcr. representatives from each rep pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16s rrna gene: aeromonas caviae, a. hydrophila, a. media, a. molluscorum, a. veronii, a. salmonicida, aeromonas sp., pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas sp., escherichia coli, escherichia sp., shigella sonnei, shigella sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, r. planticola, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii and enterobacter sp. isolates affiliated with genera escherichia or shigella were identified as escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. pcr was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(tem), bla(shv), bla(carb), bla(ctx-m), bla(imp), bla(vim), bla(cpha/imis), bla(oxa-a), bla(oxa-b), bla(oxa-c)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. sequence analysis of pcr products was performed. beta-lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the aeromonas. the most frequently detected gene was bla(tem), followed by bla(shv,)bla(oxa-b),  bla(cpha/imis) and bla(carb). retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. the inti1 gene was present in 29.6% of the  enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the aeromonas isolates. the inti2 gene was present in 4 isolates. a total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette  arrays were identified. the most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were  aada variants. previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. this fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery  of their molecular variants.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == study of the micro-organisms associated with the fermented bread (khamir) produced from sorghum in gizan region, saudi arabia.
AB  == traditional bread (khamir) was made from sorghum flour of two local varieties, bayadh and hamra. the bread was prepared by mixing the sorghum flour with water and spices (onion, garlic, lemon juice and fenugreek) in a 1:0.8 (w/w) ratio and  fermented for 24 h at 30 degrees c. two other fermentations were carried out using an inoculum from the previous fermentation. the micro-organisms were isolated from different plates and identified using different characterization systems. both total bacterial populations and lactic acid bacteria increased with fermentation time and reached the highest number at 16 h (first fermentation) and at 8 h (second and third fermentation). the content of lactic acid was increased  with time to reach 1.2%, but the increase was higher for the second and third fermentations (1.6% each). the ph dropped with time from 6.77 to 4.35 in the first fermentation and from 6.65 to 4.18, and 6.57-3.93, in the second and third  fermentations, respectively. the microorganisms, which were isolated and characterized during the 24 h fermentation, included: bacteria (pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillus brevis, lact. lactis subsp. lactis, lact. cellobiosus, klebsiella oxytoca, kl. pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, ent. sakazakii, serratia marcescens and ser. odourifera), moulds (penicillium sp., rhizopus sp.,  aspergillus niger, alternaria sp., fusarium sp. and mucor sp.) and yeasts (candida parapsilosis, c. orvegnsis and rhodotorula glutinis).

TI  == adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia clinical isolates involved in nosocomial infections.
AB  == intestinal colonization by klebsiella, enterobacter, and serratia (kes) strains is a crucial step in the development of nosocomial infections. we studied the adhesive properties, antibiotic resistance, and involvement in colonization or infection of 103 kes clinical isolates: 30 klebsiella pneumoniae (29%), 16 klebsiella oxytoca (15%), 30 enterobacter aerogenes (29%), 14 enterobacter cloacae (14%), and 13 serratia sp. (13%) isolates. half of them were resistant to several antimicrobial agents, including aminoglycosides and beta-lactam antibiotics. a total of 27 of 30 k. pneumoniae isolates (90%) adhered to the human cell line intestine-407 (int-407), while none of the k. oxytoca or e. aerogenes isolates and only 2 of the e. cloacae isolates adhered. three adhesive  patterns were observed for k. pneumoniae: an aggregative adhesion in 57% of the isolates, a diffuse adhesion in only one isolate, and a new pattern, localized adhesion, in 30% of the isolates. while most of the sensitive strains adhered with the aggregative phenotype, the localized pattern was associated with resistant k. pneumoniae isolates producing the caz-5 beta-lactamase. furthermore, 45% of such localized-adhesion isolates were involved in severe infections. the distributions of type 1 and type 3 fimbriae, enteroaggregative e. coli, and cf29, pap, and afa/dr adhesin-encoding genes were determined by using specific dna probes. no relationship was found between the adhesive pattern and the production of specific fimbriae, suggesting that several unrecognized adhesive factors are involved. our study indicates that special adhesive properties associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents could account for the pathogenicity of certain nosocomial strains.

TI  == a comparative study of the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux api20e and api20ne identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  == the bbl crystal enteric/nonfermenter (crystal, becton dickinson microbiology systems) is a new multi-test identification system for gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. one hundred and three selected  gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate api20e or api20ne (biomerieux) reading after overnight incubation. the isolates included in the study, and the number tested,  were as follows: acinetobacter sp, 8; aeromonas hydrophila, 1; citrobacter diversus, 1; citrobacter freundii, 1; escherichia coli, 13; enterobacter aerogenes, 10; enterobacter agglomerans, 2; enterobacter cloacae, 6; klebsiella oxytoca, 6; klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; morganella morganii, 2; proteus mirabilis, 6; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; salmonella sp, 2; salmonella typhi, 1; serratia marcescens, 1; shigella sonnei, 2; shigella sp, 2; vibrio metschnikovii, 1; xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, yersinia enterocolitica, 2. the api20e and api20ne systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the api systems compared to 3 with the crystal. crystal is more convenient than api for routine clinical use because it  requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.

TI  == the danger of infections of the hospitalized patients with the microorganisms present in preparations and in the hospital environment.
AB  == two strains-s. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus, resistant to antibiotics, were isolated from previously non-opened preparations made by the hospital pharmacy and industrially produced. after application in the surgery ward, two enterobacter agglomerans strains, resistant to antibiotics were detected in oral mixtures. the resistant bacteria, b. cereus and 4 strains of ps. aeruginosa, were also found in the purified water. in hospital environment 9 strains of staphylococci, resistant to the tested antibiotics were found. only one of them was s. aureus (detected on the wall), the others being coagulase-negative staphylococci. most of them were isolated from the floor, but  also from the wall, table and from the air in surgical and ophthalmological wards and in the hospital pharmacy. the most dangerous were three gram-negative strains resistant to all tested antibiotics. they were isolated from the floor (enterobacter cloacae), from the wall (proteus mirabilis) and from the container  with oral mixture in infant ward (ps. malthophilia). many strains resistant to many antibiotics were detected on the floor of surgical, nephrological and infantile wards as well as from the pharmacies: enterobacter cloacae (7 strains), citrobacter freundi, ps. aeruginosa, ps. cepacia (2 strains), ps. maltophilia (2  strains) and moraxella. many resistant strains were also present on the walls (e. coli, ps. mirabilis, ps. cepacia, alcaligens, acinetobacter). the resistant strains were rarely observed on the table, medical equipment and on personnel hands. klebsiella oxytoca and ps. paucimobilis were found on the table, ps. maltophilia on the dropper and on the rim of the container with oral mixture. acinetobacter and pseudomonas sp. were isolated from the medicine glass, enterobacter cloacae and pseudomonas sp. from the personnel hands in the pharmacies.

TI  == analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, plesiomonas and acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  == fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (fab-ms) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. the following micro-organisms were tested: acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), escherichia coli (3 strains), hafnia alvei, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, plesiomonas shigelloides, proteus mirabilis (3 strains), serratia liquefaciens and serratia marcescens. negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate  anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17  and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to pe(32:1), pe(33:1), pe(34:1), pe(34:2), pg(30:2), pg(31:2), pg(32:2), pg(34:1) and ps(33:0). however, quantitative differences were observed. for example, acinetobacter lacked pe (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, ps(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. in some cases, unknown peaks appeared to  constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). for chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. using the pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains  analysed. typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: ent. cloacae vs ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (ent. cloacae vs ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). thus fab-ms represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.

AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == clinical safety and efficacy of ofloxacin.
AB  == in this study we report about the efficacy and tolerability of ofloxacin in the treatment of 15 patients with severe and moderately severe infections including osteomyelitis (5), soft tissue infections (5), salmonellosis in aids patients (2), acute or chronic pulmonary infections (2) and mediastinitis (1). the following organisms were isolated in culture specimens: staphylococcus aureus (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4), staphylococcus epidermidis (3), serratia marcescens (1), escherichia coli (1), aeromonas hydrophila (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (1), salmonella cholerae-suis (1), salmonella  sp. (1), enterobacter cloacae (1). all isolates were sensitive to the drug. of 5  cases with osteomyelitis, 2 were cured and 3 improved clinically (with bacteriological eradication of the pathogens). the best results were obtained in  patients with soft tissue infections: 4 patients were cured and 1 improved. two patients with salmonella bacteremia and aids experienced a recurrence 1 month and 2 months respectively after stopping therapy. the patient with mediastinitis was  successfully treated. improvement was recorded for 2 patients with bronchiectasis and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. the drug was well tolerated, only one episode of mild nausea and vomiting was reported and did not require discontinuation of the therapy. the study indicates that ofloxacin is a safe and  effective agent in the treatment of various infections.

TI  == gram-negative septicemia in american alligators (alligator mississippiensis).
AB  == six species of bacteria (family enterobacteriaceae) not commonly reported as associated with disease in american alligators (alligator mississippiensis) were  documented, suggesting that aeromonas is not the only bacterium responsible for septicemia in crocodilians. these included citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, proteus sp., morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, and klebsiella oxytoca. clinical signs of disease included intensive basking, anorexia, lethargy, flaccid limb paralysis, stomatitis, and dermatitis. our data  indicated that early treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics was preferable to  waiting for sensitivity results.

TI  == in vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  == a total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. the strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of escherichia coli (314), enterobacter aerogenes (30), e. agglomerans (7), e. cloacae, (39), citrobacter diversus (9), c. freundii (13), hafnia alvei (3), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), klebsiella oxytoca (6), k. ozaenae (5), k. pneumoniae (107), morganella morganii (3), moraxella sp. (10), pasteurella multocida (1), proteus mirabilis (66), p. vulgaris (4), providencia rettgeri (12), p. stuartii (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), p. fluorescens (2),  p. maltophila (7), salmonella sp. (1) and serratia marcescens (17). in vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. over 99% of e. coli and enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. all the 118 strains of klebsiella, 87 strains of proteus-providencia and 17 strains of s. marcescens were also susceptible. aztreonam also showed good activity against p.  aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.

TI  == assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  == blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (cfu) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. at intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (hs-glc). forty-six isolates including all those examined of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, s. faecalis, s. milleri, s. mitior, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, serratia sp., enterobacter cloacae, bacterioides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, candida albicans, c. krusei and torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by hs-glc. hs-glc failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter calcoaceticus. haemophilus influenzae, corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of s. epidermidis. the growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. no significant difference was found between hs-glc analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. all the yeast isolates were detected by hs-glc after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by hs-glc analysis than by other methods.

TI  == [multicenter study of the antibacterial activity of a new cephalosporin: cm 40874].
AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) of cm were evaluated on 2 548 bacterial strains isolated in 8 hospitals. cm demonstrated high activity on enterobacteriaceae, the mic being less than or equal to 0.125 micrograms/ml for 71% of the 1 362 strains tested, less than or equal to 1 for 99.6%, and less than or equal to 4 for 99.9%. mode mic varies little among the different groups of enterobacteriaceae (from 0.06 to 0.12 micrograms/ml), with the exception of serratia sp. (mode mic : 0.25) and klebsiella oxytoca (mode mic : 0.03). most of  enterobacter, serratia, and citrobacter sp. strains not inhibited by cefotaxime are readily inhibited by cm at the same concentrations than susceptible strains.  cm has less activity on p. aeruginosa (mic 2-32 micrograms/ml) and acinetobacter  sp. (mic 8-128). staphylococci (mic 32) and enterococci are not susceptible. variable activity is found against other streptococci. cm inhibits haemophilus sp. at mics of 0.12 to 0.5 micrograms/ml and gonococci at mics of 0.03 to 0.5 (whether the strains produce beta-lactamase or not). meningococci have a mode mic of 0.03 micrograms/ml (range 0.008 to 0.25). thus, cm 40874 is a new third generation cephalosporin with high activity on enterobacteriaceae, including those strains not susceptible to cefotaxime and good activity on haemophilus sp.  and neisseria sp. this additional activity is probably supported by enhanced resistance to enzymatic inactivation by beta-lactamases.

TI  == superinfections in herpes simplex keratitis.
AB  == we reviewed 15 cases of culture-proven corneal superinfections in 15 patients (eight men and seven women ranging in age from 41 to 86 years) with recurrent herpes simplex keratitis. the factors that appeared to increase the risk of superinfection were the presence of an epithelial defect (found in all 15 cases), a history of recurrent herpetic keratouveitis (found in ten cases), and the use of topical corticosteroids (found in 13 cases). eight of the 15 patients were taking antibiotics at the time the superinfections were diagnosed, indicating that topical antibiotics do not provide sufficient protection. gram-negative rods were found in six cases (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, and achromobacter sp.). gram-positive organisms, often in association with another infecting agent, were  found in six cases (staphylococcus epidermidis, three cases; s. aureus, two cases; and streptococcus sp., two cases). fungal superinfections were found in three cases (cephalosporium acremonium, candida albicans, and aspergillus fumigatus, one case each). mycobacterium cheloni was found in two cases.

TI  == reliability of early identifications obtained with enterobacteriaceae-plus biochemical cards in the automicrobic system.
AB  == the automicrobic system (ams) is capable of identifying most enterobacteriaceae within 8 h and many glucose-nonfermenting, gram-negative bacilli after 13 h of incubation. early preliminary results can be readily obtained from the computer as the tests incubate. data with 1,023 bacterial isolates were reviewed to determine the relative accuracy of 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 13-h identifications. all automicrobic system identifications with probability (p) values of less than 0.80 were considered equivocal responses which needed supplementary tests before a final report could be issued. analysis of our data suggests that early identifications of morganella morganii, acinetobacter sp., yersinia spp., salmonella spp. (other than salmonella typhi), shigella spp. (other than shigella sonnei), enterobacter agglomerans, pseudomonas spp. (other than pseudomonas aeruginosa or pseudomonas maltophilia), klebsiella spp. (other than klebsiella pneumoniae or klebsiella oxytoca), citrobacter amalonauticus, serratia liquefaciens, or vibrio spp. should be considered nonspecific responses, even when p greater than or equal to 0.80. other identifications reported after 4 h were 96% accurate. at least half of our isolates (60% of our enterobacteriaceae)  could be identified reliably within 4 h, the remaining isolates required longer incubation.

TI  == chemical structure and inhalation toxicity of lipopolysaccharides from bacteria on cotton.
AB  == lipopolysaccharides from different bacteria isolated from cotton were purified and chemically analyzed. their pulmonary toxicity to animals was tested in inhalation tests. lipopolysaccharides from agrobacterium and xanthomonas were shown to differ from the others in that they contained no heptose and no non-hydroxylated fatty acids with a chain length of 12, 14, or 16 carbon atoms. lipopolysaccharides from pseudomonas putida, enterobacter agglomerans, and klebsiella oxytoca were found to cause an influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes  into the airways. lipopolysaccharides from agrobacterium sp. and xanthomonas sinensis caused no significant invasion. the data point to substances in both the lipid a part and the core part of the lipopolysaccharides being responsible for the capacity to induce leukocyte invasion into the airways.
