TI  - Locus of enterocyte effacement: a pathogenicity island involved in the virulence  of enteropathogenic and enterohemorragic Escherichia coli subjected to a complex network of gene regulation.
AB  - The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) is a 35.6 kb pathogenicity island inserted in the genome of some bacteria such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E.coli, Citrobacter rodentium, and Escherichia albertii. LEE comprises the genes responsible for causing attaching and effacing lesions, a characteristic lesion that involves intimate adherence of bacteria to enterocytes, a signaling cascade leading to brush border and microvilli destruction, and loss of ions, causing severe diarrhea. It is composed of 41 open reading frames and five major operons encoding a type three system apparatus, secreted proteins, an adhesin, called intimin, and its receptor called translocated intimin receptor (Tir). LEE is subjected to various levels of regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators located both inside and outside of the pathogenicity island. Several molecules were described being related to feedback inhibition, transcriptional activation, and transcriptional repression. These molecules are involved in a complex network of regulation, including mechanisms such as quorum sensing and temporal control of LEE genes transcription and translation. In this mini review we have detailed the complex network that regulates transcription and expression of genes involved in this kind of lesion.
TI  - Immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing a beta-intimin fragment  reduces intestinal colonization by Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries. Intimate adhesion of the bacteria to intestinal cells occurs via binding of the adhesin intimin to the TIR receptor exposed on cell surfaces. Here, Lactobacillus casei expressing a fragment of beta-intimin (L. casei-Int(cv)) was tested as mucosal vaccines in mice against intestinal colonization with the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Oral or sublingual immunization of C57BL/6 mice with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) IgA in feces but no IgG in sera. Conversely, anti-Int(cv) IgG was induced in the sera of mice after sublingual immunization with purified Int(cv). All vaccines were able to decrease C. rodentium recovery from feces. However, this reduction was more evident and sustained over time in mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv) by the sublingual route. These mice also displayed an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion by spleen cells 10 days after infection. Additionally, oral or sublingual immunization of C3H/HePas mice, which are highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection, with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) antibodies and significantly increased survival after challenge. Immunohistological analysis of colon sections revealed that C. rodentium was located in deep fractions of the tissue from C3H/HePas mice immunized with L. casei whereas superficial staining was observed in colon sections from mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv.) The results indicate that vaccines composed of L. casei expressing intimin may represent a promising approach and that the C3H/HePas infection model with C. rodentium can be used to evaluate potential vaccines against EPEC.
TI  - A small-molecule inhibitor of the bacterial type III secretion system protects against in vivo infection with Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The type III secretion system (T3SS) is highly conserved in many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and functions as an injector of bacterial proteins (effectors) into host cells. T3SSs are involved in establishing disease processes, but this machinery is not essential for bacterial growth or homeostasis. Thus, T3SS is expected to be a candidate therapeutic target, and inhibitors of T3SSs could potentially reduce virulence without causing bacterial death, thereby avoiding any subsequent development of resistance. We identified a linear polyketide compound, aurodox, as a specific T3SS inhibitor from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. using a screening system for the T3SS-mediated hemolysis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) established by our group. Aurodox strongly inhibited T3SS-mediated hemolysis with an IC(50) value of 1.5 mug ml(-1) without affecting bacterial growth in liquid media. We also demonstrated that aurodox specifically inhibits the secretion of type III-secreted proteins such as EspB, EspF and Map, without affecting the expression of the housekeeping protein GroEL. Furthermore, an in vivo infection study using mice clearly indicated that the administration of aurodox allowed the mice to survive a lethal dose of Citrobactor rodentium, a model bacterium for human pathogens such as EPEC. Thus, our in vivo study directly demonstrated for the first time that this putative T3SS inhibitor can be applied as a novel class of anti-infective agents.
TI  - Diminished reproduction, failure to thrive, and altered immunologic function in a colony of T-cell receptor transgenic mice: possible role of Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Citrobacter rodentium from an undetermined source was detected in a breeding colony of T-cell receptor transgenic mice housed in a conventional mouse facility in which murine hepatitis virus had been endemic and Helicobacter spp. had been detected. Citrobacter rodentium, isolated from blood, spleen, and colon, correlated with a significant increase in mortality and morbidity in this breeding colony. Transgenic mice of all ages were affected by chronic debilitation, loss in reproductive efficiency, rectal prolapse, and acute death, resulting in the near loss of these noncommercially available strains. Several alterations in immunologic parameters were observed, including outgrowth of an unusual population of cells in the spleen and blood, reduction in ascites production, loss of the capacity of peritoneal exudate cells to serve as feeders for the cloning of long-term T-cell lines, and inhibition of antigen-specific cytotoxic T-cell activity. These altered immune functions also were apparent in commercially-derived nontransgenic mice cohoused with the infected colony and in overtly healthy transgenic and nontransgenic littermates. Citrobacter rodentium and murine hepatitis virus were eliminated ultimately on rederivation of the affected strains by embryo transfer. However, the rapid decrease in the health of the colony necessitated more immediate action. To reduce mortality and allow breeding to continue during rederivation of the transgenic lines, animals were treated with enrofloxacin and moved to a barrier facility. Antibiotic therapy significantly reduced morbidity and mortality, markedly increased litter size and frequency, and resulted in the normalization of many of the immunologic assays. The involvement of C. rodentium in altering viability of the colony and perturbing immunologic assays is suggested by correlation of the onset of the syndrome with the appearance of Citrobacter sp. and its resolution with the elimination of Citrobacter sp. from the colony. Whether infection with Citrobacter alone is causative or whether superinfection of murine hepatitis virus- and Helicobacter-infected mice is required remains to be determined.
TI  - Genetic and biochemical characterization of Citrobacter rodentium sp. nov.
AB  - An unusual bacterial pathogen of laboratory mice has been previously classified as an atypical biotype of Citrobacter freundii. Designated C. freundii biotype 4280, this bacterium is the etiologic agent of transmissible murine clonic hyperplasia. An eaeA gene has been shown to be present in this organism and to be necessary for virulence in laboratory mice. However, other biotypes of C. freundii lack DNA homology with the eaeA gene. Because of the recent reclassification in which five named species and three unnamed species, all previously considered C. freundii, were described, we determined the taxonomic status of C. freundii biotype 4280. With a battery of biochemical tests and DNA relatedness studies, three isolates of C. freundii biotype 4280 were shown to be members of an unnamed Citrobacter species, designated species 9. In total, six isolates of Citrobacter species 9, but none of the type strains of the other eight named species or of the two remaining unnamed species of Citrobacter, were shown to possess DNA homology with both the eaeA and the eaeB genes. Species 9 was named Citrobacter rodentium sp. nov.
