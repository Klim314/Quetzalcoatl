TI  == microbial communities in the tonsils of healthy pigs.
AB  == the tonsils of mammals such as humans and pigs are colonized with an extensive microbiota and are frequently the site for asymptomatic carriage of bacterial pathogens. the goal of this study was to determine the composition of the microbial community of the tonsils in healthy pigs. tonsils were collected from eight pigs from two different healthy herds. samples of the tonsils from each pig were used for culture dependent and culture independent identification of the microbial community. aerobic cultivation identified pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus spp., staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, and escherichia coli from >/= 50% of the pigs in both herds. for culture independent studies, microbial community members were identified by 16s rrna sequences using the ribosomal database project pipeline programs developed at michigan state university. dominant genera identified by 16s rrna analysis in pigs from both herds included actinobacillus,  haemophilus, pasteurella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and prevotella. these genera were detected in nearly every pig regardless of herd. in contrast, there was an asymmetric distribution of minor genera between the two herds, suggesting herd-specific differences in the microbial communities. in addition, we demonstrated primer bias between two frequently used forward primers when targeting the tonsillar community. our results suggest that the major bacterial community members found in porcine tonsils are the same regardless of herd, while the minor species are unique to each herd. this is the first analysis using 16s rrna sequence libraries of the composition of microbial communities in  the porcine upper respiratory tract.

TI  == pectin-like acidic polysaccharide from panax ginseng with selective antiadhesive  activity against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == previous studies have revealed the inhibitory effects of an acidic polysaccharide purified from the root of panax ginseng against the adhesion of helicobacter pylori to gastric epithelial cells and the ability of porphyromonas gingivalis to agglutinate erythrocytes. in this study, this acidic polysaccharide from p. ginseng, pg-f2, was investigated further, in order to characterize its antiadhesive effects against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, propionibacterium acnes, and staphylococcus aureus. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were found to be in a range of 0.25-0.5mg/ml. however, results showed no inhibitory effects of pg-f2 against lactobacillus acidophilus,  escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. pg-f2 is a pectin-type polysaccharide with a mean mw of 1.2 x 10(4) da, and consists primarily of galacturonic and glucuronic acids along with rhamnose, arabinose, and galactose as minor components. the complete hydrolysis of pg-f2 via chemical or carbohydrolase enzyme treatment resulted in the abrogation of its antiadhesive activity, but limited hydrolysis via treatment with pectinase (ec. 3.2.1.15) yielded an oligosaccharide fraction, with activity comparable to the precursor pg-f2 (the mic of ca. 0.01 mg/ml against h. pylori and p. gingivalis). our results suggest that pg-f2 may exert a selective antiadhesive effect against pathogenic bacteria, while having no effects on beneficial and commensal bacteria.

TI  == differentiation of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae strains by sequence analysis of 16s rdna and ribosomal intergenic regions, and development of a species specific oligonucleotide for in situ detection.
AB  == the aims of this study were to characterize and determine intraspecies and interspecies relatedness of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae to actinobacillus lignieresii and actinobacillus suis by sequence analysis of the ribosomal operon  and to find a species-specific area for in situ detection of a. pleuropneumoniae. amplification and sequence analysis of the 16s-23s rdna ribosomal intergenic sequence (ris) from the three species showed the existence of two ris's, differing by about 100 bp. both sequences contained a region resembling the ribonuclease iii cleavage site found in escherichia coli. the smaller ris contained a glu-trna gene, and the larger one contained genes encoding ile-trna and ala-trna. these trna's showed a high sequence homology to the respective trna genes found in e. coli. sequence analysis of the ris's showed a high degree of genetic similarity of 24 strains of a. pleuropneumoniae. the larger ris's were different between the 3 species tested. the sequence of the 16s ribosomal gene was determined for 8 serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae. these sequences showed only minor base differences, indicating a close genetic relatedness of these serotypes within the species. an oligonucleotide dna probe designed from the 16s  rrna gene sequence of a. pleuropneumoniae was specific for all strains of the target species and did not cross react with a. lignieresii, the closest known relative of a. pleuropneumoniae. this species-specific dna probe labeled with fluorescein was used for in situ hybridization experiments to detect a. pleuropneumoniae in biopsies of diseased porcine lungs.

TI  == the molecular basis for the differential regulation of the hlye-encoded haemolysin of escherichia coli by fnr and hlyx lies in the improved activating region 1 contact of hlyx.
AB  == the regulator of fumarate and nitrate reduction (fnr) protein of escherichia coli is an oxygen-responsive transcription regulator that acts mainly to activate the  transcription of genes associated with anaerobic energy generation during periods of oxygen starvation. the hlyx gene of the swine pathogen actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae encodes an fnr homologue, hlyx, which can complement the anaerobic respiratory deficiencies of an fnr mutant. however, fnr and hlyx have distinct but overlapping regulons because during anaerobic incubation, hlyx-expressing e. coli k-12 strains produce an otherwise latent haemolysin. the  gene encoding the 'latent' haemolysin has been designated hlye and analysis of the promoter region by dnase i footprinting reveals the presence of an fnr- (hlyx-) binding site. anaerobic expression of an hlye::lacz reporter was 6.5-fold higher in hlyx compared to fnr-expressing cells. both fnr and hlyx recruited rna  polymerase to the hlye promoter but formed different ternary complexes. one major transcript (tsp1) initiating at 78.5 bp downstream of the fnr-binding site and four minor transcripts initiating at 73.5 (tsp2), 71.5 (tsp3), 63.5 (tsp4) and 62.5 (tsp5) bp from the fnr site were detected. from the position of the fnr box  relative to the transcript starts, hlye is expressed from a class i fnr-regulated promoter. substitution of selected fnr amino acids with the residues found in the equivalent positions in hlyx indicated that activating region 1 (ar1) of fnr forms a surface encompassing beta to beta 11 and that the ar1 contact at class i  promoters is different to that at class ii promoters, although the same surface is involved. the fnr variant, fnr-a225t, combined the properties of fnr (good activation from class ii promoters) and hlyx (good activation of class i promoters) and conferred the haemolytic phenotype.

TI  == environmental and physiological factors affecting the succinate product ratio during carbohydrate fermentation by actinobacillus sp. 130z.
AB  == actinobacillus sp. 130z fermented glucose to the major products succinate, acetate, and formate. ethanol was formed as a minor fermentation product. under co2-limiting conditions, less succinate and more ethanol were formed. the fermentation product ratio remained constant at ph values from 6.0 to 7.4. more succinate was produced when hydrogen was present in the gas phase. actinobacillus sp. 130z grew at the expense of fumarate and l-malate reduction, with hydrogen as an electron donor. other substrates such as more-reduced carbohydrates (e.g., d-sorbitol) resulted in higher succinate and/or ethanol production. actinobacillus sp. 130z contained the key enzymes involved in the embden-meyerhof-parnas and the pentose-phosphate pathways and contained high levels of phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, fumarase, fumarate reductase, pyruvate kinase, pyruvate formate-lyase, phosphotransacetylase, acetate kinase, malic enzyme, and oxaloacetate decarboxylase. the levels of pep carboxykinase, malate dehydrogenase, and fumarase were significantly higher in actinobacillus sp. 130z than in escherichia coli k-12 and accounted for the differences in succinate production. key enzymes  in end product formation in actinobacillus sp. 130z were regulated by the energy  substrates.

TI  == interpretive criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ceftiofur against bacteria associated with swine respiratory disease.
AB  == ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is active against a variety of animal pathogens, including organisms associated with swine respiratory disease.  however, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoint and disk diffusion interpretive criteria have not been established for swine pathogens. susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution mic and disk diffusion methods on 246 bacterial species that cause swine respiratory disease. ceftiofur  was active against salmonella sp., pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, and escherichia coli but was not active against bordetella bronchiseptica measured by mic. based on pharmacokinetic studies of ceftiofur in swine after a single intramuscular injection of 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight of ceftiofur and on the mic and disk diffusion data, we recommend mic breakpoints and disk diffusion distances, respectively, of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and > or = 21 mm for susceptible, 4 micrograms/ml and 18-20 mm for  intermediate, and > or = 8 micrograms/ml and > or = 17 mm for resistant classification for swine pathogens. when these breakpoints were applied to data from a previous study using bovine pathogens, only 1 minor interpretive error occurred.

TI  == evaluation of a pcr for detection of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae in mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils.
AB  == a pcr for the detection of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was evaluated. all of  102 field, isolates of a, pleuropneumoniae reacted in the pcr by amplification of a 985 bp product. no pcr amplification product was observed when examining strains of a. ureae, a. capsulatus, a. hominis, a. equuli, a, rossii, a. suis, escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica. streptococcus suis, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, haemophilus parasuis, haemophilus taxon minor group, haemophilus taxon d/e and haemophilus taxon f. amplification of a 985 bp product was, however, observed when testing strains of a. lignieresii. the lower  detection limit of the pcr test was 10(3) a. pleuropneumoniae cfu/pcr test tube and was not affected by addition of 10(6) e. coli cfu/pcr test tube. mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils of 101 pigs from 9 different herds were tested by culture and by pcr using four different bacteriological media. while 65% reacted  positive in the pcr only 23% were positive by culture, thereby suggesting a superior sensitivity of the pcr test to that of culture. the use of selective media, large inoculum and incubation for 48 h gave the highest number of positive pcr reactions from mixed bacterial cultures. tonsil cultures from 50 pigs from an a. pleuropneumoniae-negative herd did not react in the pcr. the results show that pcr on mixed bacterial cultures from tonsils may be a highly sensitive method for the detection of a. pleuropneumoniae in pig herds.

TI  == functional analysis of the ca(2+)-regulated hemolysin i operon of actinobacillus  pleuropneumoniae serotype 1.
AB  == the genetic determinant encoding the synthesis and secretion of hemolysin i (hlyi; gene designation, hlyi) by actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 4074t was cloned in the lambda vector embl4. a 10.2-kb fragment that encoded hemolytic activity in the phage lysate was aligned by southern blot hybridization to genes hlyc, hlya, hlyb, and hlyd of the escherichia coli hemolysin operon, and expression of the a. pleuropneumoniae genes in e. coli revealed that they have the same functions as their e. coli analogs: hlyic encodes a protein that activates inactive 105-kda prohemolysin i (encoded by hlyia) to active hemolysin  i, while hlyib and hlyid are necessary for hlyia secretion. northern (rna) hybridization of a. pleuropneumoniae rna revealed that the gene cluster is transcribed as two rna species, a major one of 3.5 kb, corresponding to hlyica, and a second, minor one of 7.5 kb, corresponding to the whole operon, hlyicabd. the level of hlyi mrna was substantially higher in a. pleuropneumoniae 4074t cells grown in the presence of ca2+, supporting the view that the expression of the hlyi determinant is ca2+ regulated. parallel rna hybridization with random gene probes suggested that this ca2+ regulation is specific for the hlyi determinant.

TI  == immunoserological comparison of 104-kilodalton proteins associated with hemolysis and cytolysis in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinobacillus suis, pasteurella haemolytica, and escherichia coli.
AB  == a homologous polyclonal antibody was produced in a rabbit to the 104-kilodalton (kda) protein hemolysin of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 1 strain cm-5. in immunoblots, this antibody recognized a similar 104-kda protein produced in culture supernatants by a. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1 to 12 and taxon "minor group" in addition to pasteurella haemolytica, actinobacillus suis, and alpha-hemolysin-producing escherichia coli (but only weakly in the latter two organisms). these results were reproduced by using a mouse monoclonal antibody to the cm-5 104-kda protein hemolysin, except that the monoclonal antibody bound more strongly to the alpha-hemolysin produced by e. coli, only weakly to the 104-kda protein produced by "minor group," and not at all to any extracellular antigens produced by a. suis. pigs experimentally infected with a. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1 to 10 and a. suis produced an antibody that recognized the 104-kda hemolysin produced by cm-5. a pig challenged with a "minor group" strain did not have such antibodies. rabbit antiserum produced against the leukotoxin of p. haemolytica and alpha-hemolysin-producing e. coli also recognized the cm-5 hemolysin, but the latter only weakly. the hemolytic activity produced by cm-5 in culture supernatant was neutralized strongly by the pig serum to serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, and 10 and a. suis, only partially by serotype 8 antiserum and the rabbit antiserum to p. haemolytica leukotoxin, and not all by the antiserum to serotypes 3, 4, and 7 and "minor group" and the e. coli alpha-hemolysin. these results indicate that a similar but not identical 104-kda  protein is produced in vitro and in vivo by all serotypes of a. pleuropneumoniae  and may be related to cytolysins produced by other gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == analysis of major antigens of haemophilus (actinobacillus) pleuropneumoniae and related organisms.
AB  == outer membrane protein (omp)-enriched extracts and whole-cell protein preparations of haemophilus (actinobacillus) pleuropneumoniae and related organisms were examined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. both the omp-enriched and whole-cell protein profiles of actinobacillus suis, a.  pleuropneumoniae (nad-independent biovar), a. lignieresii, and pasteurella haemolytica were very similar to those of h. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1 to 8. antisera prepared against h. pleuropneumoniae typically recognized three major omp antigens with approximate molecular weights of 17,000 (17k), 32k, and 42k in  immunoblots of h. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1 to 8, actinobacillus spp., and p.  haemolytica. antisera prepared against actinobacillus spp. and haemophilus sp. "minor group" also recognized these 17k, 32k, and 42k antigens. using absorbed sera, we demonstrated that the 17k antigen had an epitope (or epitopes) common to all the gram-negative organisms examined, including escherichia coli. the 32k and 42k antigens had epitopes common to members of the family pasteurellaceae but, in the case of the 32k antigen, also contained unique epitopes. these results provide a basis for understanding the lack of specificity of serodiagnostic tests for h. pleuropneumoniae infection and provide another line of evidence for the association of h. pleuropneumoniae with the genus actinobacillus.
