surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates of pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis from ontario swine.
susceptibility results for pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis isolated  from swine clinical samples were obtained from january 1998 to october 2010 from the animal health laboratory at the university of guelph, guelph, ontario, and used to describe variation in antimicrobial resistance (amr) to 4 drugs of importance in the ontario swine industry: ampicillin, tetracycline, tiamulin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. four temporal data-analysis options were used: visualization of trends in 12-month rolling averages, logistic-regression modeling, temporal-scan statistics, and a scan with the "what's strange about recent events?" (wsare) algorithm. the amr trends varied among the antimicrobial drugs for a single pathogen and between pathogens for a single antimicrobial, suggesting that pathogen-specific amr surveillance may be preferable to indicator data. the 4 methods provided complementary and, at times, redundant results. the most appropriate combination of analysis methods for surveillance using these data included temporal-scan statistics with a visualization method (rolling-average or predicted-probability plots following logistic-regression models). the wsare algorithm provided interesting results for quality control and has the potential to detect new resistance patterns; however, missing data created problems for displaying the results in a way that would be meaningful to all surveillance stakeholders.
growth of mannheimia haemolytica: inhibitory agents and putative mechanism of inhibition.
leukotoxin-producing mannheimia haemolytica consistently causes fatal pneumonia in bighorn sheep (bhs) under experimental conditions. surprisingly, by culture methods, it has been isolated from pneumonic bhs lungs less frequently than other bacteria. however, in one study pcr assays detected m. haemolytica from over 70% of the pneumonic lung samples that were negative for this organism by culture, suggesting that the growth of m. haemolytica is inhibited by other bacteria. previously, we have shown that bibersteinia trehalosi inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. herein we report that 100% of a diverse panel of b. trehalosi isolates (n=55) tested in a bacterial competition assay inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica, suggesting that the inhibitory phenotype is conserved. further, no plasmids were isolated from any of the 30 b. trehalosi isolates tested, suggesting that the effectors are chromosomally encoded. an earlier study by us showed that pasteurella multocida also inhibits the growth of m. haemolytica. however, m. haemolytica has not been isolated even from pneumonic bhs lungs that did not carry b. trehalosi or p. multocida. consequently, we tested staphylococcus spp., streptococcus spp., and escherichia coli, the bacteria that have been detected frequently in pneumonic bhs lungs, for possible inhibition of m. haemolytica. neither the staphylococcus spp. nor the streptococcus sp. strains inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica. e. coli inhibited the growth of m. haemolytica by a proximity-dependent mechanism. growth inhibition of m. haemolytica by several bacterial species is likely to contribute to the infrequent detection of this bacterium from pneumonic bhs lungs by culture.
antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida, and streptococcus suis isolates from a diagnostic veterinary laboratory and recommendations for a surveillance system.
antimicrobial susceptibility data on escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida,  and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario swine (january 1998 to october 2010) were acquired from a comprehensive diagnostic veterinary laboratory in ontario, canada. in relation to the possible development of a surveillance system for antimicrobial resistance, data were assessed for ease of management, completeness, consistency, and applicability for temporal and spatial statistical analyses. limited farm location data precluded spatial analyses and missing demographic data limited their use as predictors within multivariable statistical models. changes in the standard panel of antimicrobials used for susceptibility testing reduced the number of antimicrobials available for temporal analyses. data consistency and quality could improve over time in this and similar diagnostic laboratory settings by encouraging complete reporting with sample submission and by modifying database systems to limit free-text data entry. these changes could make more statistical methods available for disease surveillance and cluster detection.
multiple-class antimicrobial resistance surveillance in swine escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis isolates from ontario and the impact of the 2004-2006 porcine circovirus type-2 associated disease outbreak.
the objective of this work was to describe trends in multiple-class antimicrobial resistance present in clinical isolates of escherichia coli f4, pasteurella multocida and streptococcus suis from ontario swine 1998-2010. temporal changes in multiple-class resistance varied by the pathogens examined; significant yearly changes were apparent for the e. coli and p. multocida data. although not present in the e. coli data, significant increases in multiple-class resistance within p. multocida isolates occurred from 2003 to 2005, coinciding with the expected increase in antimicrobials used to treat clinical signs of porcine circovirus associated disease (pcvad) before it was confirmed. prospective temporal scan statistics for multiple-class resistance suggest that significant clusters of increased resistance may have been found in the spring of 2004; months before the identification of the pcvad outbreak in the fall of 2004.
prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens isolated from cattle in different european countries: 2002-2004.
background: the project "antibiotic resistance in bacteria of animal origin - ii" (arbao-ii) was funded by the european union (fair5-qlk2-2002-01146) for the period 2003-2005, with the aim to establish a continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility among veterinary laboratories in european countries based on validated and harmonised methodologies. available summary data of the susceptibility testing of the bacterial pathogens from the different laboratories were collected. method: antimicrobial susceptibility data for several bovine pathogens were obtained over a three year period (2002-2004). each year the participating laboratories were requested to fill in excel-file templates with national summary data on the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance from different bacterial species.a proficiency test (eqas - external quality assurance system) for antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted each year to test the accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the participating laboratories. the data from this testing demonstrated that for the species included in the eqas the results are comparable between countries. results: data from 25,241 isolates were collected from 13 european countries. for staphylococcus aureus from bovine mastitis major differences were apparent in the occurrence of resistance between countries and between the different antimicrobial agents tested. the highest frequency of resistance was observed for penicillin. for mannheimia haemolytica resistance to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulphonamide were observed in france, the netherlands and portugal. all isolates of pasteurella multocida isolated in finland and most of those from denmark, england (and wales), italy and sweden were susceptible to the majority of the antimicrobials. streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus uberis isolates from sweden were fully susceptible. for the other countries some resistance was observed to tetracycline, gentamicin and erythromycin. more resistance and variation of the resistance levels between countries were observed for escherichia coli compared to the other bacterial species investigated. conclusion: in general, isolates from denmark, england (and wales), the netherlands, norway, sweden and switzerland showed low frequencies of resistance, whereas many isolates from belgium, france, italy, latvia and spain were resistant to most antimicrobials tested. in the future, data on the prevalence of resistance should be used to develop guidelines for appropriate antimicrobial use in veterinary medicine.
gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase: domain structure and identification of residues important in substrate and glutathione binding.
in most organisms, glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by the sequential action of distinct enzymes, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and gsh synthetase (gs). in streptococcus agalactiae, gsh synthesis is catalyzed by a single enzyme, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase (gamma-gcs-gs). the n-terminal sequence of gamma-gcs-gs is similar to escherichia coli gamma-gcs, but the c-terminal sequence is an atp-grasp domain more similar to d-ala, d-ala ligase than to any known gs. in the present studies, c-terminally and n-terminally truncated constructs were characterized in order to define the limits of the gamma-gcs and gs domains, respectively. although wt gamma-gcs-gs is nearly uninhibited by gsh (k(i) approximately 140 mm), shorter gamma-gcs domain constructs were unexpectedly found to be strongly inhibited (k(i) approximately 15 mm), reproducing a physiologically important regulation seen in monofunctional gamma-gcs enzymes. because studies with e. coli gamma-gcs implicate a flexible loop region in gsh binding, chimeras of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs were made containing gamma-gcs domain flexible loop sequences from enterococcus faecalis and pasteurella multocida gamma-gcs-gs, isoforms that are inhibited by gsh. inhibition remained s. agalactiae-like (i.e., very weak). c-terminal constructs of gamma-gcs-gs have gs activity (0.01-0.04% of wt), but proper folding and significant gs activity required a covalently linked gamma-gcs domain. in addition, site-directed mutants in the middle region of the gamma-gcs-gs sequence established that gs activity depends on residues in a region that is also part of the gamma-gcs domain. our results provide new insights into the structure of gamma-gcs-gs and suggest gamma-gcs-gs evolved from a monomeric gamma-gcs that became c-terminally fused to a multimeric atp-grasp protein.
results of the antimicrobial agent susceptibility study raised in a representative, cross-sectional monitoring study on a national basis.
the use of antimicrobial substances in human and veterinary medicine inevitably results in a selection pressure for drug resistance in exposed bacteria. preventive measures, apt to avoid the consequent development of new resistances and selection for existing ones, respectively, have to be elaborated. moreover, it has to be ensured that neither resistant bacteria nor resistance genes are spread to and consequently via the food chain. respiratory diseases as well as mastitis in dairy cattle belong to the most frequently occurring diseases in food-producing animals. for the first time in germany, a comprehensive, cross-sectional study into the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacteria associated with these disease patterns in food-producing animals was conducted by the federal office of consumer protection and food safety (bvl) in 2001. the selection of examined bacterial species comprised pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica associated with respiratory disease in pigs, and escherichia coli, streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. causing mastitis in dairy cattle. bacterial strains were collected following a representative sampling scheme, taking into account the total number of animals in the individual german federal lander. in an analogous study conducted in 2002/2003, this selection was extended by the indication respiratory disease in juvenile cattle, caused by p. multocida and m. haemolytica, respectively. in comparison with data from 2001, mic values determined in 2002/2003 suggested significantly lower or higher degrees of drug susceptibility only for a few antimicrobial agents. comparison was carried out on the basis of bacterial species and individual federal lander, respectively. overall, the data raised in both studies revealed substantially lower resistance rates than published for germany so far. this is particularly true for results from those lander, whose animal health services had implemented preventive strategies to control infectious diseases. no correlation could be established between differing animal population densities and differences in the prevalence of resistance in corresponding lander. however, the geographical distribution of occurrence of resistance against beta-lactam antimicrobial agents suggests different therapeutic strategies employed in different sized animal flocks. in federal lander marked by large-scale livestock farming, significantly higher resistance values could be measured for cephalosporins than for penicillins, whereas in lander with rather traditional farming structures, resistance to penicillins was predominant. assuming otherwise similar factors of influence on the emergence of resistance, this pattern suggests that cephalosporins are preferably used in large enterprises and penicillins in smaller farms, respectively. currently, mechanisms effecting changes in antimicrobial resistance are being further investigated in a successive study.
in vitro activities of florfenicol against bovine and porcine respiratory tract pathogens.
florfenicol in vitro activities for a total of 756 bacterial isolates from respiratory tract infections of cattle and swine were comparatively investigated by the agar diffusion method and the microdilution broth method. florfenicol showed high in vitro activity against pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and streptococcus suis, with all of the isolates inhibited by </=2 micro g of florfenicol per ml.
comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem and 11 other antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue animal and human bite wound infections.
we studied the comparative in vitro activity of ertapenem, a new carbapenem, against 240 aerobic and 180 anaerobic recent clinical bite isolates using an agar dilution method and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu/spot for aerobes and 10(5) cfu/spot for anaerobes. ertapenem inhibited 410/420 (98%) of the isolates tested at < or = 4 mg/l with only 4/5 campylobacter gracilis and 1/3 campylobacter rectus strains requiring . or = 16 mg/l for inhibition. ertapenem was only moderately active (mic 8 mg/l) against 4/6 enterococcus faecalis and 1/11 staphylococcus epidermidis strains. all pasteurella multocida, pasteurella septica, pasteurella canis, pasteurella dagmatis, moraxella spp. and ef-4 isolates were inhibited at < or = 0.015 mg/l. mic(90)s for other aerobic genera and species were as follows: corynebacterium spp., 4 mg/l; staphylococcus aureus, 0.25 mg/l; staphylococcus epidermidis, 4 mg/l; other coagulasenegative staphylococci, 0.25 mg/l; streptococcus milleri group, 0.5 mg/l; eikenella corrodens, 0.03 mg/l; and bergeyella zoohelcum, 0.5 mg/l. for anaerobes the range of mics and mic(90)s were: prevotella ssp., < or = 0.015-0.5, 0.125 mg/l; porphyromonas spp., < or = 0.015-0.03, 0.015 mg/l; fusobacterium spp., 0.015-0.125, 0.03 mg/l; bacteroides tectum, 0.03-0.125, 0.125 mg/l; and peptostreptococcus spp., 0.01-2, 1 mg/l. ertapenem showed excellent potency against the full range of animal and human bite wound pathogens.
species selectivity of new siderophore-drug conjugates that use specific iron uptake for entry into bacteria.
siderophores selectively bind ferric iron and are involved in receptor-specific iron transport into bacteria. several types of siderophores were synthesized, and growth-promoting or inhibitory activities when they were conjugated to carbacephalosporin, erythromycylamine, or nalidixic acid were investigated. overall, 11 types of siderophores and 21 drug conjugates were tested against seven different bacterial species: escherichia coli, bordetella bronchiseptica, pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, streptococcus suis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. in some species, the inhibitory activities of the drug conjugates were associated with the ability of the bacteria to use the siderophore portion of the molecules for growth promotion in disc diffusion tests (0.04 mumol of conjugate or siderophore per disc). e. coli used catechol-based siderophore portions as well as hydroxamate-based tri-delta-oh-n-oh-delta-n-acetyl-l-ornithine ferric iron ligands for growth under iron-restricted conditions achieved by supplemental ethylenediamine di (o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid) (100 micrograms/ml) and was sensitive to carbacephalosporin conjugated to these siderophore types (up to a 34-mm-diameter inhibition zone). b. bronchiseptica used desferrioxamine b and an isocyanurate-based or trihydroxamate in addition to catechol-based siderophore portions for promotion but was not inhibited by beta-lactam conjugates partly because of the presence of beta-lactamase. p. multocida and p. haemolytica did not use any of the synthetic siderophores for growth promotion, and the inhibitory activities of some conjugates seemed partly linked to their ability to withhold iron from these bacteria, since individual siderophore portions showed some antibacterial effects. individual siderophores did not promote s. suis growth in restrictive conditions, but the type of ferric iron ligands attached to beta-lactams affected inhibitory activities. the antibacterial activities of the intracellular-acting agents erythromycylamine and nalidixic acid were reduced or lost, even against s. aureus and s. epidermidis, when the agents were conjugated to siderophores. conjugate-resistant e. coli mutants showed the absence of some iron-regulated outer membrane proteins in gel electrophoresis profiles and in specific phage or colicin sensitivity tests, implying that the drugs used outer membrane receptors of ferric complexes to get into cells.
interpretive criteria for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of ceftiofur against bacteria associated with swine respiratory disease.
ceftiofur, an extended-spectrum cephalosporin, is active against a variety of animal pathogens, including organisms associated with swine respiratory disease. however, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) breakpoint and disk diffusion interpretive criteria have not been established for swine pathogens. susceptibility tests were performed by broth microdilution mic and disk diffusion methods on 246 bacterial species that cause swine respiratory disease. ceftiofur was active against salmonella sp., pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, and escherichia coli but was not active against bordetella bronchiseptica measured by mic. based on pharmacokinetic studies of ceftiofur in swine after a single intramuscular injection of 3 or 5 mg/kg body weight of ceftiofur and on the mic and disk diffusion data, we recommend mic breakpoints and disk diffusion distances, respectively, of < or = 2 micrograms/ml and > or = 21 mm for susceptible, 4 micrograms/ml and 18-20 mm for intermediate, and > or = 8 micrograms/ml and > or = 17 mm for resistant classification for swine pathogens. when these breakpoints were applied to data from a previous study using bovine pathogens, only 1 minor interpretive error occurred.
comparison of mics of ceftiofur and other antimicrobial agents against bacterial  pathogens of swine from the united states, canada, and denmark.
the mics of ceftiofur and other antimicrobial agents, tested for comparison, for  515 bacterial isolates of pigs from the united states, canada, and denmark with various diseases were compared. the organisms tested included actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, salmonella choleraesuis, salmonella typhimurium, streptococcus suis, streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, streptococcus equi subsp. equi, and streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. in addition to ceftiofur, the following antimicrobial agents or combinations were tested: enrofloxacin, ampicillin, sulfamethazine, trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (1:19), erythromycin, lincomycin, spectinomycin, lincomycin-spectinomycin (1:8), tilmicosin, and tetracycline. tilmicosin was only tested against the u.s. isolates. overall, ceftiofur and enrofloxacin were the most active antimicrobial agents tested against all isolates, with mics inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (mic90s) of < or = 2.0 and < or = 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively. erythromycin, sulfamethazine, spectinomycin, and lincomycin demonstrated limited activity against all of the organisms tested, with mic90s of > or = 8.0, > or = 256.0, > or = 32.0, and > or = 16.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. trimethoprim-sulfadiazine was active against isolates of a. pleuropneumoniae, s. choleraesuis, s. typhimurium, p. multocida, s. equi, and s. suis (mic90s, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) but was less active against the e. coli strains tested (mic90, > 16.0 micrograms/ml). ampicillin was active against the p. multocida, s. suis, and s. equi isolates tested (mic90s, 0.5, 0.06, and 0.06 micrograms/ml, respectively) and was moderately active against s. typhimurium (mic90s, 2.0 micrograms/ml). however, this antimicrobial agent was much less active when it was tested against a. pleuropneumoniae, s. cholerae-suis, and e. coli (mic90s, 16.0, > 32.0, and 32.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). against the u.s. isolates of a. pleuropneumoniae and p. multocida, tilmicosin was moderately active (mic90s, 4.0 and 8.0 micrograms/ml, respectively). however, this compound was not active against the remaining u.s. isolates (mic90s, > 64.0 micrograms/ml). differences in the mics from one country to another were not detected with enrofloxacin, ceftiofur, or lincomycin for the strains tested, but variations in the mics of the remaining antimicrobial agents were observed.
erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin: use of frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance.
mics of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. clarithromycin was the most active drug against bacteroides spp. but the least active against haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was most active against h. influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pasteurella multocida, and fusobacterium spp. but the least active against streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. all three drugs had equivalent activities against staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. none of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (particularly escherichia coli and citrobacter diversus) and acinetobacter baumannii. although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.
the development of macrolides: clarithromycin in perspective.
macrolide antibiotics have been available and used clinically since 1952. the class of drugs originated from a soil sample obtained from the city of ilo-ilo on the island of paray in the philippines. erythromycin has been the most widely used agent of this class called 'macrolides' because they possess the macrocyclic lactone nucleus. many esters of erythromycin are well established as agents to treat a variety of respiratory and cutaneous infections, particularly in children. there has been a resurgence of interest in macrolides as a result of the recognition of pathogens such as legionella, chlamydia and campylobacter spp. a number of new 14-membered macrolides have been synthesised in recent years with the goal of overcoming some of the problems of the older erythromycin agents. there has been variable activity of erythromycin against haemophilus influenzae; there has been gastrointestinal irritation, particularly in adults; and the older agents are administered four times a day. clarithromycin has increased activity against legionella, and branhamella spp., and pasteurella multocida, and, with its 14-oh metabolite, inhibits haemophilus spp. it is also more active against chlamydia and against anaerobic species while retaining excellent activity against streptococci including streptococcus pneumoniae. it has increased plasma peak levels and a sufficiently long half-life for twice daily administration. furthermore, it is well tolerated. thus clarithromycin offers potential for use in those areas in which a safe, well tolerated macrolide will be used, namely respiratory, skin structure and selected diarrhoeal and genital infections.
comparative in-vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031), a new macrolide antibiotic.
the comparative in-vitro activity of a-56268 (te-031), a new semisynthetic macrolide antibiotic, was assessed against approximately 400 bacterial isolates. the new drug demonstrated excellent activity against penicillin-susceptible streptococci (mic90s less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l) and methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic90 = 0.25 mg/l). among other gram-positive organisms tested, a significant number were resistant to a-56268 as well as to erythromycin and clindamycin. a-56268 was at least as active as erythromycin against pasteurella multocida and campylobacter jejuni, but was more active than erythromycin against legionella spp. (mic90 less than or equal to 0.06 mg/l), bacteroides fragilis (mic90 = 4 mg/l) and bact. melaninogenicus (mic90 less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l). activity of a-56268 was ph dependent (more active at ph 7 than at ph 6) and was moderately affected by inoculum size. the drug was bactericidal against two strains of streptococcus pyogenes tested, but exerted a bacteriostatic effect against staphylococcus aureus and str. faecalis.
in vitro antibacterial properties of el-870, a new semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic.
a new macrolide antibiotic, el-870, 20-deoxo-20-(3,5-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl)desmycosin, has been prepared by chemical modification of desmycosin. in vitro, against selected animal bacterial pathogens, it inhibited growth of pasteurella multocida, pasteurella haemolytica, mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, streptococcus suis, actinomyces pyogenes and certain other bacteria at levels of 6.25 micrograms/ml or less. in general, the mics for gram-negative enteric bacteria have been greater than 50 micrograms/ml. concentrations equivalent to 4 x the mic value were bactericidal for pasteurella sp. el-870 had other antibacterial properties which were characteristic of macrolide antibiotics.
a direct fluorescent antibody test for identification of group e streptococci.
a rapid and specific direct fluorescent antibody test was developed for the identification of group e streptococci (ges). tests for specificity included an inhibition test and application of the conjugate to smears of staphylococcus aureus, pasteurella multocida, and streptococci of lancefield's groups, a, b, c, d, e (types i, iv and untypeable), f and g. with the inhibition test, a specific blocking reaction occurred and the conjugate cross-reacted only with group c streptococci (gcs). adsorption with gcs eliminated the cross-reaction and rendered the conjugate specific for ges.
