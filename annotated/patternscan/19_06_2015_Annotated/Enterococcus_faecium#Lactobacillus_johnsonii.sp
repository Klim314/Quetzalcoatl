TI  == effects of the probiotic enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 on selected lactic acid bacteria and enterobacteria in co-culture.
AB  == enterococcus faecium ncimb 10415 is used as a probiotic for piglets and has been  shown to modify the porcine intestinal microbiota. however, the mode of action of this probiotic modification is still unclear. one possible explanation is the direct growth inhibiting or stimulating effect of the probiotic on other indigenous bacteria. therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine the growth interactions of the probiotic with different indigenous porcine bacteria in vitro. reference strains were cultivated with the probiotic e. faecium strain  ncimb10415 (sf68) in a checkerboard assay with 102 to 105 cells/ml inoculum per strain. growth kinetics were recorded for 8 h and used to determine specific growth of the co-cultures. additionally, total dna was extracted from the co-cultures at the end of the incubation to verify which strain in the co-culture was affected. co-cultivation with eight enterococcus spp. tester strains showed strain-specific growth differences. three of four e. faecium strains were not influenced by the probiotic strain. pcr results showed reduced growth of the probiotic strain in co-culture with e. faecium dsm 6177. three of four enterococcus faecalis strains showed reduced specific growth in co-culture with the probiotic strain. however, e. faecalis dsm 20478 impaired growth of the probiotic e. faecium strain. the growth of lactobacillus johnsonii dsm 10533 and  lactobacillus reuteri dsm 20016 was enhanced in co-culture with the probiotic strain, but co-cultivations with lactobacillus mucosae dsm13345 or lactobacillus  amylovorus dsm10533 showed no differences. co-cultures with the probiotic e. faecium showed no impact on the growth rate of four different enterobacterial reference strains (2 strains of salmonella enterica and 2 strains of escherichia  coli), but pcr results showed reduced cell numbers for a pathogenic e. coli isolate at higher concentration of the probiotic strain. as the in vitro effect of the probiotic e. faecium on enterococci was strain specific and the growth of  certain lactobacillus spp. was enhanced by the probiotic, these results indicate  a direct effect of the probiotic on certain members of the porcine gastro intestinal microbiota.

TI  == inhibition of bacillus cereus strains by antimicrobial metabolites from lactobacillus johnsonii crl1647 and enterococcus faecium sm21.
AB  == bacillus cereus is an endospore-forming, gram-positive bacterium able to cause foodborne diseases. lactic acid bacteria (lab) are known for their ability to synthesize organic acids and bacteriocins, but the potential of these compounds against b. cereus has been scarcely documented in food models. the present study  has examined the effect of the metabolites produced by lactobacillus johnsonii crl1647 and enterococcus faecium sm21 on the viability of select b. cereus strains. furthermore, the effect of e. faecium sm21 metabolites against b. cereus strains has also been investigated on a rice food model. l. johnsonii crl1647 produced 128 mmol/l of lactic acid, 38 mmol/l of acetic acid and 0.3 mmol/l of phenyl-lactic acid. these organic acids reduced the number of vegetative cells and spores of the b. cereus strains tested. however, the antagonistic effect disappeared at ph 6.5. on the other hand, e. faecium sm21 produced only lactic and acetic acid (24.5 and 12.2 mmol/l, respectively) and was able to inhibit both vegetative cells and spores of the b. cereus strains, at a final fermentation ph  of 5.0 and at ph 6.5. this would indicate the action of other metabolites, different from organic acids, present in the cell-free supernatant. on cooked rice grains, the e. faecium sm21 bacteriocin(s) were tested against two b. cereus strains. both of them were significantly affected within the first 4 h of contact; whereas b. cereus bac1 cells recovered after 24 h, the effect on b. cereus 1 remained up to the end of the assay. the lab studied may thus be considered to define future strategies for biological control of b. cereus.

TI  == microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of may bryndza cheese.
AB  == diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of may bryndza cheese, a traditional slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, e. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16s rdna and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. the culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese,  lactobacilli, lactococci and geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) cfu/g, 10(9) cfu/g and 10(5) cfu/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. the diversity of bacteria encompassed acinetobacter calcoaceticus, acinetobacter guillouiae, acinetobacter sp., acinetobacter johnsonii, citrobacter braakii, clostridium bartlettii, corynebacterium callunae, corynebacterium maris, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter asburiae, enterobacter hormaechei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus pallens, escherichia  coli, haemophilus haemolyticus, hafnia alvei, kluyvera cryocrescens, lactobacillus helveticus, lactococcus garvieae, lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "leuconostoc garlicum", mannheimia glucosida, mannheimia haemolytica, pseudomonas sp., ps. fluorescens, "ps. reactans", raoultella ornithinolytica, r. terrigena, "rothia arfidiae", staphylococcus aureus, staph. epidermidis, staph. felis, staph. pasteuri, staph. sciuri, staph. xylosus, streptococcus parauberis, str. thermophilus and variovorax paradoxus. the diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed alternaria alternata, "ascomycete sp.", aspergillus fumigatus, beauveria brongniartii, candida xylopsoci, c. inconspicua, cladosporium cladosporioides, debaromyces hansenii, fomes fomentarius, galactomyces candidus, gymnoascus reesii, chaetomium globosum, kluyveromyces marxianus, metarhizium anisopliae, penicillium aurantiogriseum, p. camemberti, p. freii, p. polonicum, p. viridicatum, pichia kudriavzevii, sordaria alcina, trichosporon lactis and yarrowia lipolytica.

TI  == indication for co-evolution of lactobacillus johnsonii with its hosts.
AB  == background: the intestinal microbiota, composed of complex bacterial populations, is host-specific and affected by environmental factors as well as host genetics.  one important bacterial group is the lactic acid bacteria (lab), which include many health-promoting strains. here, we studied the genetic variation within a potentially probiotic lab species, lactobacillus johnsonii, isolated from various hosts. results: a wide survey of 104 fecal samples was carried out for the isolation of l. johnsonii. as part of the isolation procedure, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (trflp) was performed to identify l. johnsonii within a selected narrow spectrum of fecal lab. the trflp results showed host specificity of two bacterial species, the enterococcus faecium species cluster and lactobacillus intestinalis, to different host taxonomic groups while the appearance of l. johnsonii and e. faecalis was not correlated with any taxonomic group. the survey ultimately resulted in the isolation of l. johnsonii from few host species. the genetic variation among the 47 l. johnsonii  strains isolated from the various hosts was analyzed based on variation at simple sequence repeats (ssr) loci and multi-locus sequence typing (mlst) of conserved hypothetical genes. the genetic relationships among the strains inferred by each  of the methods were similar, revealing three different clusters of l. johnsonii strains, each cluster consisting of strains from a different host, i.e. chickens, humans or mice. conclusions: our typing results support phylogenetic separation of l. johnsonii strains isolated from different animal hosts, suggesting specificity of l. johnsonii strains to their hosts. taken together with the trflp results, that indicated the association of specific lab species with the host taxonomy, our study supports co-evolution of the host and its intestinal lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == genetic modification of iron metabolism in mice affects the gut microbiota.
AB  == the composition of the gut microbiota is affected by environmental factors as well as host genetics. iron is one of the important elements essential for bacterial growth, thus we hypothesized that changes in host iron homeostasis, may affect the luminal iron content of the gut and thereby the composition of intestinal bacteria. the iron regulatory protein 2 (irp2) and one of the genes mutated in hereditary hemochromatosis hfe , are both proteins involved in the regulation of systemic iron homeostasis. to test our hypothesis, fecal metal content and a selected spectrum of the fecal microbiota were analyzed from hfe-/-, irp2-/- and their wild type control mice. elevated levels of iron as well as other minerals in feces of irp2-/- mice compared to wild type and hfe-/- mice  were observed. interestingly significant variation in the general fecal-bacterial population-patterns was observed between irp2-/- and hfe-/- mice. furthermore the relative abundance of five species, mainly lactic acid bacteria, was significantly different among the mouse lines. lactobacillus (l.) murinus and l.  intestinalis were highly abundant in irp2-/- mice, enterococcus faecium species cluster and a species most similar to olsenella were highly abundant in hfe-/- mice and l. johnsonii was highly abundant in the wild type mice. these results suggest that deletion of iron metabolism genes in the mouse host affects the composition of its intestinal bacteria. further studying the relationship between gut microbiota and genetic mutations affecting systemic iron metabolism in human  should lead to clinical implications.

TI  == properties of different lactic acid bacteria isolated from apis mellifera l. bee-gut.
AB  == eight strains belonging to lactobacillus spp. and five to enterococcus spp. were  isolated from the gut of worker apis mellifera l. bees. studies based on 16s rrna sequencing revealed that aj5, ig9, a15 and crl1647 strains had a 99% identity with lactobacillus johnsonii, while sm21 showed a 99% similarity with enterococcus faecium. l. johnsonii crl1647, aj5 and ig9 were high lactic acid producers (values were between 177 and 275 mm), and in vitro they inhibited different human food-borne pathogens and paenibacillus larvae, the american foulbrood agent. this bacterium was the most sensitive to the lactic acid effect  being inhibited by 44 mm of this metabolite. l. johnsonii crl1647, aj5 and ig9 also presented important surface properties. these cells showed between 77% and 93% of auto-aggregation. the preliminary study of the chemical nature of the aggregating factors revealed that the molecules involved in the surface of each l. johnsonii strain were quite complex; and something of a peptidic nature was mainly involved. e. faecium sm21 produced bacteriocin-like compounds with anti-listeria effects. furthermore, a band close to 6.0-7.5 kda was detected by sds-page studies, and the enta, b and p structural genes were amplified by pcr reactions. for the first time, bee-gut associated l. johnsonii and e. faecium strains have been isolated, identified, cultivated and some of their functional properties reported.

TI  == identification and characterization of the novel lysm domain-containing surface protein sep from lactobacillus fermentum br11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in lactobacillus and lactococcus.
AB  == examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of lactobacillus fermentum br11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kda  protein termed sep. the amino-terminal sequence of sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of lactobacillus reuteri, enterococcus faecium, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, and lactobacillus plantarum. the carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (apf) surface proteins of lactobacillus gasseri and  lactobacillus johnsonii. the mature amino terminus of sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding lysm domain, thereby making it distinct from apf proteins.  we have identified a common motif within lysm domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding yg motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in l. fermentum, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lactococcus lactis mg1363. modified sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, and l. lactis hosts. sep as well as the previously described surface protein bspa were used to express and secrete in l.  fermentum or l. rhamnosus a fragment of human e-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for listeria monocytogenes. this study demonstrates that sep has  potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.

TI  == binding of extracellular matrix molecules by probiotic bacteria.
AB  == aims: the aim of this study was to investigate extracellular matrix (ecm) and mucin binding of selected bacterial isolates with probiotic features in comparison with commercially used probiotic bacteria. methods and results: ecm molecules were immobilized in microtitre plates (mucin and fetuin) or on the surface of latex beads. porcine mucin was bound by all 13 probiotic strains tested with important inter-strain differences; however, fetuin binding was similar (weak) for all 14 strains tested. strongly positive (three) binding of bovine fibrinogen was expressed by strains from fermented food (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, l. casei shirota and l. johnsonii la1) as well as by l. casei l.c., lactobacillus sp. 2i3 and by l. plantarum lp. the other strains expressed moderate (2) or weakly positive (1) binding of bovine fibrinogen. strongly positive (3) binding of porcine fibronectin was observed only with two strains; however, all other strains also bound this molecule. bovine lactoferrin was bound to a higher extent than transferrins. significance and impact of the study: some  animal strains (at least l. casei l.c. and lactobacillus sp. 2i3) are comparable  with the commercially used strains with respect to their ecm binding ability. as  this feature is important for probiotic bacteria to be able to colonize intestine, these strains should be considered for their wider use in fermented feed (or probiotic preparations) for animals.

TI  == characterization of the properties of human- and dairy-derived probiotics for prevention of infectious diseases in fish.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the potential probiotic properties of six  lactic acid bacteria (lab) intended for human use, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, lactobacillus casei shirota, lactobacillus bulgaricus, l. rhamnosus lc 705, bifidobacterium lactis bb12, and lactobacillus johnsonii la1, and one for animal use, enterococcus faecium tehobak, for use as a fish probiotic. the strains for human use were specifically chosen since they are known to be safe for human use, which is of major importance because the fish are meant for human  consumption. the selection was carried out by five different methods: mucosal adhesion, mucosal penetration, inhibition of pathogen growth and adhesion, and resistance to fish bile. the adhesion abilities of the seven lab and three fish pathogens, vibrio anguillarum, aeromonas salmonicida, and flavobacterium psychrophilum, were determined to mucus from five different sites on the surface  or in the gut of rainbow trout. five of the tested lab strains showed considerable adhesion to different fish mucus types (14 to 26% of the added bacteria). despite their adhesive character, the lab strains were not able to inhibit the mucus binding of a. salmonicida. coculture experiments showed significant inhibition of growth of a. salmonicida, which was mediated by competition for nutrients rather than secretion of inhibitory substances by the probiotic bacteria as measured in spent culture liquid. all lab except l. casei shirota showed tolerance against fish bile. l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus were found to penetrate fish mucus better than other probiotic bacteria. based on bile resistance, mucus adhesion, mucus penetration, and suppression of fish pathogen growth, l. rhamnosus atcc 53103 and l. bulgaricus can be considered for future in vivo challenge studies in fish as a novel and safe treatment in aquaculture.

TI  == taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera lactobacillus, bifidobacterium and enterococcus. the physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. in total, 176 strains, including  the type strains, have been included. phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic  proteins. genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr (rapd-pcr) and dna-dna hybridization for bifidobacteria. in the genus lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: l. acidophilus group, l. casei group and l. reuteri/l. fermentum group. most strains referred to as l. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as l. gasseri or as l. johnsonii, both members of the l. acidophilus group. a similar situation could be shown in the l. casei group, where most of the strains named l. casei belonged to l. paracasei subspp. a recent proposal to reject the species l. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species l. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. according to phenotypic features and confirmed by dna-dna hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to b. animalis, although they were often declared as b. longum by the manufacturer. from the genus enterococcus, probiotic ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the  vana-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. these unwanted resistances could  be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kda resistance protein. in conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood  by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
