TI  == interactions between lactobacillus crispatus and bacterial vaginosis (bv)-associated bacterial species in initial attachment and biofilm formation.
AB  == certain anaerobic bacterial species tend to predominate the vaginal flora during  bacterial vaginosis (bv), with gardnerella vaginalis being the most common. however, the exact role of g. vaginalis in bv has not yet been determined. the main goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that g. vaginalis is an early  colonizer, paving the way for intermediate (e.g., fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (e.g., prevotella bivia). theoretically, in order to function as  an early colonizer, species would need to be able to adhere to vaginal epithelium, even in the presence of vaginal lactobacilli. therefore, we quantified adherence of g. vaginalis and other bv-associated bacteria to an inert surface pre-coated with lactobacillus crispatus using a new peptide nucleic acid  (pna) fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) methodology. we found that g. vaginalis had the greatest capacity to adhere in the presence of l. crispatus. theoretically, an early colonizer would contribute to the adherence and/or growth of additional species, so we next quantified the effect of g. vaginalis biofilms  on the adherence and growth of other bv-associated species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) technique. interestingly, g. vaginalis derived a growth benefit from the addition of a second species, regardless of the species.  conversely, g. vaginalis biofilms enhanced the growth of p. bivia, and to a minor extent of f. nucleatum. these results contribute to our understanding of bv biofilm formation and the progression of the disorder.

TI  == the role of acidification in the inhibition of neisseria gonorrhoeae by vaginal lactobacilli during anaerobic growth.
AB  == background: vaginal lactobacilli protect the female genital tract by producing lactic acid, bacteriocins, hydrogen peroxide or a local immune response. in bacterial vaginosis, normal lactobacilli are replaced by an anaerobic flora and this may increase susceptibility to neisseria gonorrhoeae, a facultative anaerobe. bacterial interference between vaginal lactobacilli and n. gonorrhoeae  has not been studied in liquid medium under anaerobic conditions. by co-cultivating n. gonorrhoeae in the presence of lactobacilli we sought to identify the relative contributions of acidification and hydrogen peroxide production to any growth inhibition of n. gonorrhoeae. methods: three strains of  n. gonorrhoeae distinguishable by auxotyping were grown in the presence of high concentrations (107-108 cfu/ml) of three vaginal lactobacilli (l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii) in an anerobic liquid medium with and without 2-(n-morpholino)-ethanesulfonic (mes) buffer. fusobacterium nucleatum was used as an indicator of anaerobiosis. bacterial counts were performed at 15, 20 and 25 h; at 25 h ph and hydrogen peroxide concentrations were measured. results: growth of f. nucleatum to >108 cfu/ml at 25 h confirmed anaerobiosis. all bacteria grew in  the anaerobic liquid medium and the addition of mes buffer had negligible effect  on growth. l. crispatus and l. gasseri produced significant acidification and a corresponding reduction in growth of n. gonorrhoeae. this inhibition was abrogated by the addition of mes. l. jensenii produced less acidification and did not inhibit n. gonorrhoeae. hydrogen peroxide was not detected in any experiment. conclusions: during anaerobic growth, inhibition of n. gonorrhoeae by the vaginal lactobacilli tested was primarily due to acidification and abrogated by the presence of a buffer. there was no evidence of a specific mechanism of inhibition other than acid production under these conditions and, in particular, hydrogen peroxide was not produced. the acidification potential of vaginal lactobacilli under anaerobic conditions may be their most important characteristic conferring  protection against n. gonorrhoeae infection.
