thiols as classical and slow-binding inhibitors of imp-1 and other binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases.
the inhibitory effect of a variety of thiol compounds on the function of binuclear metallo-beta-lactamases, with a particular focus on imp-1 from pseudomonas aeruginosa, has been investigated. thiol inhibitors, depending on their structural features, fall into two categories, one in which inhibition at neutral ph was instantaneous and the other in which inhibition was time-dependent. while mercaptans with anionic substituents in the vicinity of their sh groups exhibited the former type of inhibition, neutral thiols appear to induce a slow, time-dependent isomerization of the initially formed ei complex to a tighter ei complex. kinetic parameters describing the latter process were obtained by fitting progress curves of substrate hydrolysis using standard and numerical procedures. the failure of charged thiols to exhibit slow binding is suggested to be due to a rapid isomerization of the initial ei complex. slow binding in the case of neutral thiols was observed only below ph 8. studies on the ph dependence of catalysis by imp-1 revealed that (i) enzyme inactivation at low ph is a slow process with presumably two groups with a pk(a) of approximately 5.2 in the protein being responsible for the loss of activity, (ii) inhibition by thiols is independent of ph between ph 5 and 9, and (iii) an apparent enhancement of the catalytic activity of imp-1 by thiols occurs at ph <5. the last mentioned phenomenon is explained by a model in which mercaptans retard the proton-dependent isomerization of the enzyme. studies on the thiol-mediated inhibition of the binuclear forms of bacteroides fragilis (ccra) and bacillus cereus (bcii strain 5/b/6) metallo-beta-lactamase have revealed that while ccra was instantaneously albeit moderately inhibited by mercaptans, bcii mimicked imp-1 in its interaction with thiols. these differences are proposed to be due partly to the structural divergence of these proteins in the vicinity of zn2.
identification of a series of tricyclic natural products as potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases.
this work describes the discovery and characterization of a novel series of tricyclic natural product-derived metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. natural product screening of the bacillus cereus ii enzyme identified an extract from a strain of chaetomium funicola with inhibitory activity against metallo-beta-lactamases. sb236050, sb238569, and sb236049 were successfully extracted and purified from this extract. the most active of these compounds was sb238569, which possessed k(i) values of 79, 17, and 3.4 microm for the bacillus cereus ii, pseudomonas aeruginosa imp-1, and bacteroides fragilis cfia metallo-beta-lactamases, respectively, yet none of the compounds exhibited any inhibitory activity against the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l-1 metallo-beta-lactamase (50% inhibitory concentration > 1,000 microm). the lack of activity against angiotensin-converting enzyme and serine beta-lactamases demonstrated the selective nature of these compounds. the crystal structure of sb236050 complexed in the active site of cfia has been obtained to a resolution of 2.5 a. sb236050 exhibits key polar interactions with lys184, asn193, and his162 and a stacking interaction with the indole ring of trp49 in the flap, which is in the closed conformation over the active site groove. sb236050 and sb238569 also demonstrate good antibacterial synergy with meropenem. eight micrograms of sb236050 per ml gave rise to an eightfold drop in the mic of meropenem for two clinical isolates of b. fragilis producing cfia, making these strains sensitive to meropenem (mic < or = 4 microg/ml). consequently, this series of metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors exhibit the most promising antibacterial synergy activity so far observed against organisms producing metallo-beta-lactamases.
inhibition of metallo-beta-lactamases by a series of thiol ester derivatives of mercaptophenylacetic acid.
a series of mercaptophenylacetic acid thiol esters bearing a phenyl substituent adjacent to the carboxylic acid function has been shown to be inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases. the inhibition of the bacteroides fragilis cfia and bacillus cereus ii metallo-beta-lactamases was zn2- dependent, greater inhibition being observed at 1 microm znso4 than at 100 microm znso4. despite this zn2+ dependency, isothermal titration calorimetry studies illustrated that representative compounds had no detectable affinity for zn2+ (k > 1 mm). this indicates that their mode of inhibition was not by chelation of the active site zn2+. greatest potency was observed against the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l1 metallo-beta-lactamase with i50 values of between < 1.95 microm and 6 microm and sb-217843 exhibited a similar level of inhibition of this enzyme at 1 and 100 microm zn2+ (i50 values 5 and 6 microm, respectively). inhibition of b. cereus ii metallo-beta-lactamase by sb-218018 and sb-217782 was competitive with ki values of 185 microm and 1500 microm, respectively. therefore, these compounds are specific inhibitors of metallo-beta-lactamases and provide further probes of the active sites of these enzymes.
inhibition of metallo-beta-lactamases by a series of mercaptoacetic acid thiol ester derivatives.
a series of mercaptoacetic acid thiol esters have been identified as metallo-beta-lactamase inhibitors. electrospray mass spectrometry (esms) has shown that irreversible inhibition of the bacillus cereus ii metallo-beta-lactamase by sb214751, sb214752, and sb213079 was concomitant with a 90-da increase in mass of the enzyme. tryptic digestion of the b. cereus ii inhibited with sb214751 illustrated that the peptide fragment, containing the only cysteine of the enzyme, had undergone a mass increment of 90 da. it was further demonstrated that b. cereus ii hydrolyzed this type of compound across the thiol ester bond to yield mercaptoacetic acid. mercaptoacetic acid is the only molecular fragment common to sb214751, sb214752, and sb213079, and free mercaptoacetic acid does not bind covalently to b. cereus ii. therefore, it is concluded that these compounds inhibit b. cereus ii by the mechanism-based delivery of mercaptoacetic acid, forming a disulfide linkage with the active sites cysteine (predicted mass shift = +90 da) under the aerobic conditions of the assay. the different thiol esters examined had a broad range of potencies against the metallo-beta-lactamases tested. for example sb214751, sb214752, and sb213079 all had 50% inhibitory concentrations of < 10 and > 1,000 microm for the stenotrophomonas maltophilia l-1 and bacteroides fragilis cfia enzymes, respectively. sb216968 was particularly active against the aeromonas hydrophila cpha metallo-beta-lactamase and was found to be an uncompetitive inhibitor of this enzyme (ki = 3.9 microm), whereas it exhibited irreversible inhibition of the l-1 enzyme. these observations with this series of compounds have revealed subtle differences between the active sites of different metallo-beta-lactamases. finally, a novel application for isothermal titration calorimetry for assessing the zinc chelating activity of candidate inhibitors is also presented.
effect of some bacterial products on platelet electrophoretic mobility (pem).
bacterial lps, used in our experiments, are able to decrease pem at concentration of 100 microgram/ml after incubation with 1 x 10(7) platelets/ml for 30 min at 37 degrees c. such effect is statistically significant for bacteroides fragilis lps, s. enteritidis and s. typhi. e. coli lps 026:b6 w and e. coli 055:b5 w are not effective at all, s. minnesota (incomplete) lps 595 and 345 free of 0-polysaccharide and partially lacking core in their molecule did not influence pem, while s. minnesota lps (s form) (a complete lps) strongly decreased pem. this fact could suggest that 0-polysaccharide is involved in this inhibitory effect on pem. klebsiella enterotoxin and b. cereus enterotoxin are able to decrease pem at concentration of 100 microgram/ml, after incubation with 1 x 10(7) platelets for 30 min at 37 degrees c, while no inhibition of pem was seen when shighella enterotoxin and v. parahaemoliticus enterotoxin was used in similar way. the aa. conclude that endotoxin and enterotoxin are able to change the electrokinetic charge (negative) of platelets, thereby, causing a decrease of pem.
