TI  == probiotic table olives: microbial populations adhering on olive surface in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in an industrial plant.
AB  == this study reports the dynamics of microbial populations adhering on the surface  of debittered green olives cv. bella di cerignola in fermentation sets inoculated with the probiotic strain lactobacillus paracasei impc2.1 in different brining conditions (4% and 8% (w/v) nacl) at room temperature and 4 degrees c. the probiotic strain successfully colonized the olive surface dominating the natural  lab population and decreasing the ph of brines to <or=5.0 after 30 days until the end of fermentation. the dynamics of microbial populations associated with olive  surface and belonging to the different groups indicated that inoculated olives held at room temperature did not host enterobacteriaceae at the end of fermentation. yeast populations were present in a low number (<or=log(10) 5.7 cfu/g) throughout the process. a considerable genetic diversity of lab species colonizing the olive surface was found mainly in inoculated set brined in 8% nacl, as indicated by the shannon diversity index calculated for each set. generally, strains of lactobacillus coryniformis, l. paracasei, l. plantarum, l.  pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. brevis, l. mali, l. vaccinostercus, l.casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuc. pseudomesenteroides, lactococcus lactis, weissella paramesenteroides, w. cibaria, enterococcus casseliflavus group and e.  italicus were identified during the whole process. in particular, l. pentosus was the most frequently isolated species and it showed a high strain diversity throughout fermentation in all processes except for the one held at 4 degrees c.  also a notable incidence of leuc. mesenteroides on olives was highlighted in this study during all fermentation. results indicated that the human strain l. paracasei impc2.1 can be considered an example of a strain used in the dual role  of starter and probiotic culture which allowed the control of fermentation processes and the realization of a final probiotic product with functional appeal.

TI  == production of l-lactic acid from a mixture of xylose and glucose by co-cultivation of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the production of optically pure lactic acid in a high yield from xylose or a mixture of xylose and glucose, which is a model hydrolysate of lignocellulose, is described. in a single cultivation, enterococcus casseliflavus produced 38 g/l of lactic acid with an optical purity of 96% enantiomeric excess (ee) and 6.4 g/l of acetic acid from 50 g/l of xylose when mrs medium was used. when a mixture of 50  g/l of xylose and 100 g/l of glucose was used as the carbon source in a cultivation of e. casseliflavus alone, glucose was converted to lactic acid in the early phase of the cultivation but xylose was hardly consumed. in a co-cultivation where e. casseliflavus and lactobacillus casei specific for glucose were simultaneously inoculated, little or no lactic acid was produced after the glucose was almost consumed. a co-cultivation with two-stage inoculation (in which e. casseliflavus was added at a cultivation time of 40 h after l. casei cells were inoculated) resulted in complete consumption of 50 g/l  of xylose and 100 g/l of glucose. in the co-cultivation, 95 g/l of lactic acid with a high optical purity of 96% ee was obtained at 192 h. such a co-cultivation using two microorganisms specific for each sugar is considered to be one promising cultivation technique for the efficient production of lactic acid from  a sugar mixture derived from lignocellulose.

TI  == study of the ecology of fresh sausages and characterization of populations of lactic acid bacteria by molecular methods.
AB  == in this study, a polyphasic approach was used to study the ecology of fresh sausages and to characterize populations of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the microbial profile of fresh sausages was monitored from the production day to the  10th day of storage at 4 degrees c. samples were collected on days 0, 3, 6, and 10, and culture-dependent and -independent methods of detection and identification were applied. traditional plating and isolation of lab strains, which were subsequently identified by molecular methods, and the application of pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to dna and rna extracted directly from the fresh sausage samples allowed the study in detail of the changes in the bacterial and yeast populations during storage. brochothrix thermosphacta and lactobacillus sakei were the main populations present. in particular, b. thermosphacta was present throughout the process, as determined by both dna and rna analysis. other bacterial species, mainly staphylococcus xylosus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and l. curvatus, were detected by dgge. moreover, an uncultured bacterium and an uncultured staphylococcus sp. were present, too. lab strains isolated at day 0 were identified as lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, l. casei, and enterococcus casseliflavus, and on day 3 a strain of leuconostoc mesenteroides was identified. the remaining strains isolated belonged to l. sakei. concerning the yeast ecology, only debaryomyces hansenii was established in the fresh sausages. capronia mansonii was initially present, but it was not detected after the first 3 days. at last, l. sakei isolates were characterized by randomly amplified polymorphic dna pcr and repetitive dna element pcr. the results obtained underlined how different populations took over  at different steps of the process. this is believed to be the result of the selection of the particular population, possibly due to the low storage temperature employed.

TI  == identification and characterization of enterococcus species isolated from forage  crops and their influence on silage fermentation.
AB  == forty-eight strains of lactic acid bacteria were isolated from forage crops, and  their identification, characterization and influence on silage fermentation were  studied. all isolates were gram-positive, short-chain-forming, catalase-negative, and facultatively anaerobic cocci that did not produce gas from glucose, only formed l-lactic acid, and were able to grow at ph 9.6%, in 6.5% nacl, or with 40% bile, but not below ph 4.5. these isolates were commonly isolated from forage crops, and they were divided into four groups (a, b, c, and d) according to sugar fermentation characteristics. selected strains of fa 5, fa 27, fa 45, and fa 57 were identified as enterococcus hirae, e. faecalis, e. casseliflavus, and e. mundtii, respectively, on the basis of dna-dna homology, strains fa 5, fa 27, fa  45, and fa 57 and two strains from commercial inoculants, lc 10 (lactobacillus casei) and lp 15 (l. plantarum), were used as additives to alfalfa and guinea grass silages. alphalfa and guinea grass silages inoculated with lc 10, lp 15, fa 5 + lc 10, and fa 5 + lp 15-treatments in alfalfa and guinea grass silages had significantly lower ph values, contents of butyric acid and ammonia nitrogen, gas production, and dry matter losses compared with the control silage after 60 d of  fermentation. however, the e. hirae fa 5, e. faecalis fa 27, e. casseliflavus fa  45, and e. mundtii fa 57-inoculated silages gave similar values to the control in both types of silage. the fa 27 + lc 10 and fa 27 + lp 15-inoculated silages did  not differ in fermentation quality from lc 10 and lp 15-inoculated silages alone. the results confirmed that enterococcus species were not able to improve silage quality.
