TI  == phenotypic characterization of human pathogenic bacteria in fish from the coastal waters of south west cameroon: public health implications.
AB  == increasing economic and recreational opportunities, attractive scenery and a perception of a better quality of life are luring people to the coast. unfortunately, these activities together with the commensurate increase in population in the area inevitably result in pollution of coastal waters with excessive microorganisms and other pollutants. microbial pollutants not only contaminate the coastal water but also aquatic food sources, thus posing a health risk to consumers. fish is a major source of protein in cameroon, especially in the coastal areas. in this study, we investigated the microbiological quality of  fish from the limbe and tiko beaches in south west cameroon from may to october 2007. we isolated human pathogenic bacteria from three anatomic sites (skin, gills, intestine) of 50 fish (150 specimens) and investigated their susceptibility patterns to a battery of antibiotics. data were analyzed statistically using chi2 with significance set at p < .05. eleven bacterial species were identified, including escherichia coli type 1 (20.8%), citrobacter fruendii (16.4%), proteus vulgaris (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.1%), klebsiella ozaenae (7.7%), enterobacter cloacae (7.2%), klebsiella oxytoca (5.8%), serratia marcescens (4.8%), serratia odorifera (4.8%), hafnia alvei (4.4%) and proteus penneri (2.9%). more contaminated fish were found at limbe beach than at tiko beach (61.4% versus 38.6%, respectively (p < .05)). when ranking contamination with respect to anatomic site, skin was the most contaminated (40.6%) specimen and gills the least (28.5%). ciprofloxacillin, ofloxacillin, and cotrimoxazole were the most effective antibiotics against all isolates, exhibiting 100% sensitivity. almost half of the isolates (45.7%) were resistant to ampicillin. the results of our study demonstrate that fish from the  coastal waters of south west cameroon are a source of human pathogenic and opportunistic bacteria; hence this finding has public health implications.

TI  == [urinary tract infections in children--etiologic agents and susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  == urinary tract infections (utis) are common clinical problem in pediatric hospitals. the aim of this study was to compare the incidence of utis during two  different time periods (from february 1999 to march 2000, and from april 2000 to  september 2001) in pediatric patients treated in ambulatory or hospitalized in new children hospital. the frequency of occurrence of esbl--producing gram-negative rods increased during second period study. the isolated esbl--producing strains were resistant also to aminoglicosides and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazol gram-negative rods were predominant microorganisms.  isolated organisms from urine samples included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, proteus penneri, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, citrobacter freundi, serratia spp., enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, cns, enterococcus spp. streptococcus spp, and candida spp. enterococcus spp. were isolated from urine samples in 20% of cases. only 9.4% of isolated enterococcus spp. were high-level  aminoglicoside resistant (hlar) strains. no vancomycin-resistant enterococcus spp. were isolated. among coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns) methicillin resistant strains (mrcns) were isolated in 43.3%.

TI  == identification of a chromosome-borne expanded-spectrum class a beta-lactamase from erwinia persicina.
AB  == from whole-cell dna of an enterobacterial erwinia persicina reference strain that displayed a penicillinase-related antibiotic-resistant phenotype, a beta-lactamase gene was cloned and expressed in escherichia coli. it encoded a clavulanic-acid-inhibited ambler class a beta-lactamase, erp-1, with a pi value of 8.1 and a relative molecular mass of ca. 28 kda. erp-1 shared 45 to 50% amino  acid identity with the most closely related enzymes, the chromosomally encoded enzymes from citrobacter koseri, kluyvera ascorbata, kluyvera cryocrescens, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus vulgaris, proteus penneri, rahnella aquatilis, serratia fonticola, yersinia enterocolitica, and the plasmid-mediated enzymes ctx-m-8 and ctx-m-9. the substrate profile of the noninducible erp-1 was similar  to that of these beta-lactamases. erp-1 is the first extended-spectrum beta-lactamase from an enterobacterial species that is plant associated and plant pathogenic.
