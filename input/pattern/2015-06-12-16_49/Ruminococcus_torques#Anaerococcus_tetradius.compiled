TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus Ruminococcus, does not support the reclassification of Streptococcus hansenii and Peptostreptococcus productus as ruminococci.
AB  - The 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, the type species of the genus Ruminococcus, was determined by PCR direct sequencing. A comparative sequence analysis showed that R. flavefaciens is phylogenetically related to a small cluster (cluster IV of Collins et al. [M. D. Collins, P. A. Lawson, A. Willems, J. J. Cordoba, J. Fernandez-Garayzabal, P. Garcia, J. Cai, H. Hippe, and J. A. E. Farrow, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:812-826, 1994]) of organisms which includes several Clostridium and Eubacterium species. R. flavefaciens was found to be phylogenetically only remotely related to Ruminococcus gnavus, Ruminococcus torques, Peptostreptococcus productus, and Streptococcus hansenii. These findings demonstrate that the genus Ruminococcus is not a monophyletic group, and the proposed transfer of P. productus and S. hansenii to this genus (T. Ezaki, N. Li, Y. Hashimoto, H. Miura, and H. Yamamoto, Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 44:130-136, 1994) is not supported.
TI  - Fermentation of mucins and plant polysaccharides by anaerobic bacteria from the human colon.
AB  - A total of 154 strains from 22 species of Bifidobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Coprococcus, Eubacterium, and Fusobacterium, which are present in high concentrations in the human colon, were surveyed for their ability to ferment 21 different complex carbohydrates. Plant polysaccharides, including amylose, amylopectin, pectin, polygalacturonate, xylan, laminarin, guar gum, locust bean gum, gum ghatti, gum arabic, and gum tragacanth, were fermented by some strains from Bifidobacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Ruminococcus, and Eubacterium species. Porcine gastric mucin, which was fermented by some strains of Ruminococcus torques and Bifidobacterium bifidum, was the only mucin utilized by any of the strains tested.
