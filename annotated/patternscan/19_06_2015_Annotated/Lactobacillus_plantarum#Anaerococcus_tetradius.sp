TI  == in vitro activities of the new semisynthetic glycopeptide telavancin (td-6424), vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, and four comparator agents against anaerobic gram-positive species and corynebacterium spp.
AB  == telavancin is a new semisynthetic glycopeptide anti-infective with multiple mechanisms of action, including inhibition of bacterial membrane phospholipid synthesis and inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. we determined the in vitro activities of telavancin, vancomycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ampicillin against 268 clinical isolates of anaerobic gram-positive organisms and 31 corynebacterium strains using agar dilution methods according to national committee for clinical laboratory standards procedures. plates with daptomycin were supplemented with ca(2+) to 50 mg/liter. the mics at which 90% of isolates tested were inhibited (mic(90)s) for telavancin and vancomycin were as follows: actinomyces spp. (n = 45), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium difficile (n = 14), 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium ramosum (n =  16), 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium innocuum (n = 15), 4 and 16 microg/ml, respectively; clostridium clostridioforme (n = 15), 8 and 1 microg/ml, respectively; eubacterium group (n = 33), 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively; lactobacillus spp. (n = 26), 0.5 and 4 microg/ml, respectively; propionibacterium spp. (n = 34), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; peptostreptococcus spp. (n  = 52), 0.125 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively; and corynebacterium spp. (n = 31),  0.03 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. the activity of td-6424 was similar to that of quinupristin-dalfopristin for most strains except c. clostridioforme and lactobacillus casei, where quinupristin-dalfopristin was three- to fivefold more  active. daptomycin had decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against 14 strains  of actinomyces spp. and all c. ramosum, eubacterium lentum, and lactobacillus plantarum strains. linezolid showed decreased activity (mic > 4 microg/ml) against c. ramosum, two strains of c. difficile, and 15 strains of lactobacillus  spp. imipenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were active against >98% of strains. the mics of ampicillin for eight clostridium spp. and three strains of l. casei were >1 microg/ml. the mic(90) of td-6424 for all strains tested was </=2 microg/ml. td-6424 has potential for use against infections with gram-positive anaerobes and deserves further clinical evaluation.

TI  == [the range of antagonistic effects of lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  == bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia, bacteroides spp., peptostreptococcus spp., mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. on the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus lactobacillus, most frequently l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the  same environment. the diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties  bacteria of the genus lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this  ecosystem. the aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. it was found that nearly all of the tested  lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: gardnerella vaginalis, prevotella bivia and peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit gram-positive aerobic cocci as enterococcus faecalis or staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.

TI  == deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  == the purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. the small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("fukushima type 1"). bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. the results: 1) among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were staphylococcus (s.) epidermidis and lactobacillus  (l.) bifidus. species of which none of the strains split were escherichia (e.) coli, e. communior, e. freundii, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. buchneri, l. cellobiosus, l. bulgaricus, s. aureus, aerobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was  intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all  of the strains split were bacteroides (b.) vulgatus, b. thetaiotaomicron, b. uniformis, corynebacterium (c.) granulosum, c. avidum, peptostreptococcus (peptostrept.) putridus, eubacterium (eubact.) lentum, peptococcus (pept.) grigoroffii, pept. anaerobius, veillonella (v.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were coryne. diphtheroides, eubact. parvum, peptostrept. intermedius. species of which none of the strains split were coryne, parvum, peptostrept. micros, v. alcalescens, v. parvula, catenabacterium (catena.) catenaforme, and catena. filamentosum. 3) all or none, or almost all or none, of  the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.

TI  == the reduction of n-hydroxy-4-acetylaminobiphenyl by the intestinal microflora of  the rat.
AB  == the role of the intestinal flora in the conversion of n-hydroxy-4-acetyl-aminobiphenyl (n-oh-aabp) to 4-acetylaminobiphenyl has been examined. this reaction, which reverses the metabolic activation of the parent carcinogen, can be demonstrated in cultures of some bacteria indigenous to the intestinal microflora. these include cultures of clostridium sp., clostridium perfringens, peptostreptococcus productus i, and bacteroides fragilis ss. thetaiotaomicron and ss. vulgatus. in contrast, cultures of lactobacillus plantarum and escherichia coli show little or no capacity for this reaction. the  reduction of n-oh-aabp is also carried out by homogenates of liver, kidney, and brain. on a weight basis, the cecal flora is considerably more active in reducing n-oh-aabp than are homogenates of tissues of the gastrointestinal tract. the cecal flora also has a greater activity for reducing n-oh-aabp than the stomach flora, an observation which may relate to the induction of tumors in the forestomach but not in the cecum of rats fed this compound. the products of the metabolism of n-oh-aabp have been compared in germ-free and conventional animals. glucuronide conjugates of n-oh-aabp are found in the cecal contents and feces only of the germ-free rats, while 4-acetylaminobiphenyl is found in the feces only of conventional rats. these results suggest that the flora, by hydrolyzing glucuronides and reducing n-oh-aabp, may influence the level of metabolities of 4-acetylaminobiphenyl which are critical for carcinogenesis.
