TI  - Effects of Lactobacillus salivarius Ren on cancer prevention and intestinal microbiota in 1, 2-dimethylhydrazine-induced rat model.
AB  - Probiotics have been suggested as a prophylactic measure in colon cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of Lactobacillus salivarius Ren (Ren) in modulating colonic microbiota structure and colon cancer incidence in a rat model after injection with 1,2-dimethyl hydrazine (DMH). The results indicated that oral administration of Ren could effectively suppress DMH-induced colonic carcinogenesis. A significant decrease in cancer incidence (87.5% to 25%) was detected in rats fed with a dose of 5 x 1010 CFU/kg bodyweight per day. Using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and Real-time PCR combined with multivariate statistical methods, we demonstrated that injection with DMH significantly altered the rat gut microbiota, while Ren counteracted these DMH-induced adverse effects and promoted reversion of the gut microbiota close to the healthy state. Tvalue biplots followed by band sequencing identified 21 bacterial strains as critical variables affected by DMH and Ren. Injection of DMH significantly increased the amount of Ruminococcus species (sp.) and Clostridiales bacteria, as well as decreasing the Prevotella sp. Administration of Ren reduced the amount of Ruminococcus sp., Clostridiales bacteria, and Bacteroides dorei, and increased the amount of Prevotella. Real-time PCR results were consistent with the results derived by t-value biplots. These findings suggested that Ren is a potential agent for colon cancer prevention. In conclusion, the results in the present study suggest a potential therapeutic approach based on the modulation of intestinal microflora by probiotics may be beneficial in the prevention of colorectal carcinogenesis.
TI  - Causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and severity in a contemporary series of Fournier's gangrene.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the causative pathogens and evaluate the antibiotic sensitivity, resistance patterns, and virulence in a contemporary series of patients with Fournier's gangrene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 41 consecutive cases of Fournier's gangrene were evaluated. The patient demographics, causative pathogens, antibiotic sensitivity, and resistance patterns were assessed. The Fournier's gangrene severity index and length of stay were analyzed statistically to determine any differences by causative pathogen. RESULTS: A total of 122 pathogens were cultured. The wound cultures were polymicrobial for 34 patients (83%). Most common pathogens cultured were Bacteroides sp (43.9%), Escherichia coli (36.6%), and Prevotella sp (34.1%). E coli was resistant to fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in 13.3%, and 40% of isolates respectively. The wound cultures were monomicrobial for 7 patients (17.0%). A monomicrobial isolate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured that was susceptible to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance to ampicillin-sulbactam was seen in Providencia sp, Klebsiella sp, E coli, and methicillin-resistant S aureus. Resistance to ceftriaxone and gentamicin was seen in methicillin-resistant S aureus and E coli, respectively. No resistance to clindamycin was demonstrated. No statistically significant difference was detected between the Fournier's gangrene severity index or length of stay and the causative pathogens. CONCLUSION: Fournier's gangrene remains a community-acquired polymicrobial infection, with anaerobic bacteria as the most common causative pathogens. Candida and methicillin-resistant S aureus are emerging causative pathogens, but methicillin-resistant S aureus remains sensitive to clindamycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Although resistance was demonstrated by some causative pathogens, together, the currently recommended broad-spectrum antibiotics adequately covered all pathogens. Coverage with agents such as fluconazole, vancomycin, or piperacillin-tazobactam is indicated in patients at risk of fungal or hospital-acquired organisms.
TI  - [Bacterial vaginosis. Treatment of the relapse].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is a common vaginal infection in women of reproductive age. Bacterial vaginosis is an ecological disorder that ensues when normal lactobacilli are replaced by large numbers of Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., Mobiluncus sp. and M. hominis. Numerous studies have consistently shown that BV at 12-24 weeks are associated with increased risks of preterm birth (PTB), preterm rupture of the membranes, chorioamnionitis, fetal infection and cerebral palsy. Deficiencies in local immunity may predispose women to BV.
TI  - Frequency of periodontal pathogens in equivalent peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypotheses that there is: (1) higher bacterial  frequency in peri-implantitis/periodontitis, followed by mucositis/gingivitis and peri-implant/periodontal health; (2) similar bacterial frequency between comparable peri-implant and periodontal clinical statuses. DESIGN OF STUDY: The presence of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella intermedia, Treponema denticola and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was evaluated in peri-implant (n=53) and periodontal (n=53) health; mucositis (n=50), gingivitis (n=50), peri-implantitis (n=50) and periodontitis (n=50). RESULTS: The pattern of peri-implant bacterial frequency was not as expected (peri-implantitis>mucositis>health). Except for P. intermedia (p>0.05), bacterial frequency was higher in peri-implantitis than health (p<0.05). The frequency of P.gingivalis and red complex species were higher in peri-implantitis than mucositis (p<0.05). In periodontal samples, T. forsythia and T. denticola showed the expected pattern of frequency (periodontitis>gingivitis>health). The frequencies of C. rectus and T. forsythia were higher in healthy teeth/gingivitis than healthy implants/mucositis, respectively (p<0.05). The frequency of P. gingivalis and A. actinomycetemcomitans were similar between periodontitis and peri-implantitis (p>0.05) while all other species occurrences were higher in periodontitis than peri-implantitis (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial frequency increased from peri-implant/periodontal health to peri-implantitis/periodontitis but not from mucositis/gingivitis to peri-implantitis/periodontitis. There was a trend towards higher bacterial frequency in teeth than implants.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of commercial alpha-gluco-oligosaccharide by faecal microbiota from lean and obese human subjects.
AB  - The fermentation selectivity of a commercial source of a-gluco-oligosaccharides (BioEcolians; Solabia) was investigated in vitro. Fermentation by faecal bacteria from four lean and four obese healthy adults was determined in anaerobic, pH-controlled faecal batch cultures. Inulin was used as a positive prebiotic control. Samples were obtained at 0, 10, 24 and 36 h for bacterial enumeration by fluorescent in situ hybridisation and SCFA analyses. Gas production during fermentation was investigated in non-pH-controlled batch cultures. a-Gluco-oligosaccharides significantly increased the Bifidobacterium sp. population compared with the control. Other bacterial groups enumerated were unaffected with the exception of an increase in the Bacteroides-Prevotella group and a decrease in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii on both a-gluco-oligosaccharides and inulin compared with baseline. An increase in acetate and propionate was seen on both substrates. The fermentation of a-gluco-oligosaccharides produced less total gas at a more gradual rate of production than inulin. Generally, substrates fermented with the obese microbiota produced similar results to the lean fermentation regarding bacteriology and metabolic activity. No significant difference at baseline (0 h) was detected between the lean and obese individuals in any of the faecal bacterial groups studied.
TI  - Reduction of salivary arginine catabolic activity through periodontal therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Salivary enzymes may be used to diagnose periodontal conditions. Salivary arginase activity (SAA) is related to susceptibility to bacterial infection. Therefore, the aim of this controlled interventional study was to determine the SAA before and after non-surgical periodontal therapy. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Eighty-nine subjects were selected: 31 periodontally healthy patients (controls), 27 gingivitis patients, and 31 chronic periodontitis patients. Plaque and Gingival Indices, probing depth, and clinical attachment level were monitored. The presence of Campylobacter rectus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola, and Prevotella intermedia was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction. Salivary total protein level and SAA were also established by spectrophotometry. Clinical and arginase data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon, Mann-Withney, and Kruskal-Wallis tests (P < .05). For microbial data, the chi-square test was used. The Pearson correlation test was also used between each parameter evaluated. RESULTS: After therapy, due to a significant reduction in SAA, the values observed for the gingivitis and periodontitis groups were similar to those found in the healthy group. Interestingly, after therapy, SAA followed the same positive pattern showed by the overall improvement of clinical parameters (gingivitis and periodontitis groups mean values, pre- > posttherapy) and by the reduction of target pathogens (gingivitis group T forsythia, pre- > posttherapy; periodontitis group P. gingivalis, T. denticola, P. intermedia, and T. forsythia, pre- > posttherapy). CONCLUSION: Based on the reduction of SAA after therapy, in accordance with the expected reduction in clinical and microbiologic parameters, it was concluded that SAA has the potential to serve as a reliable method to access to the therapeutic response of chronic periodontitis subjects treated with nonsurgical periodontal therapy.
TI  - The short-term treatment effects on the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue in intra-oral halitosis patients--a randomized clinical trial.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to assess the effects of rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse with or without adjunct tongue scraping on volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs) in breath air, and the microbiota at the dorsum of the tongue. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A randomized single-masked controlled clinical trial with a cross-over study design over 14 days including 21 subjects was performed. Bacterial samples from the dorsum of the tongue were assayed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: No halitosis (identified by VSC assessments) at day 14 was identified in 12/21 subjects with active rinse alone, in 10/21 with adjunct use of tongue scraper, in 1/21 for negative control rinse alone, and in 3/21 in the control and tongue scraping sequence. At day 14, significantly lower counts were identified only in the active rinse sequence (p < 0.001) for 15/78 species including, Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Tannerella forsythia. A decrease in bacteria from baseline to day 14 was found in successfully treated subjects for 9/74 species including: P. gingivalis, Prevotella melaninogenica, S. aureus, and Treponema denticola. Baseline VSC scores were correlated with several bacterial species. The use of a tongue scraper combined with active rinse did not change the levels of VSC compared to rinsing alone. CONCLUSIONS: VSC scores were not associated with bacterial counts in samples taken from the dorsum of the tongue. The active rinse alone containing zinc and chlorhexidine had effects on intra-oral halitosis and reduced bacterial counts of species associated with malodor. Tongue scraping provided no beneficial effects on the microbiota studied. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Periodontally healthy subjects with intra-oral halitosis benefit from daily rinsing with zinc- and chlorhexidine-containing mouth rinse.
TI  - [Analysis of diversity of vaginal microbiota in healthy Chinese women by using DNA-fingerprinting].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in  different physiological states with PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), to establish the basis for the future study of lower genital tract infections, and to provide a theoretical basis for the development of vaginal probiotics adapted to Chinese females. METHODS: Women who underwent routine gynecologic examinations in Peking University First Hospital from October 2009 to January 2010 were enrolled, including 30 at reproductive age and 30 at post menopause age. Vaginal samples were collected and then total bacterial DNA was extracted. Universal bacterial primers were used to amplify the V3 region of 16S rDNA gene. PCR products were analyzed by denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Featured bands on DGGE were recovered, cloned and sequenced. Alignment with known sequence was made by using Blast on GenBank to identify bacterial strains so as to analyze the diversity of healthy women's vaginal dominant flora in different physiological states. RESULTS: (1) Vaginal flora in healthy Chinese women at their reproductive age were relatively simple, Lactobacillus were the dominant bacteria. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. While L. iners were the dominant vaginal bacteria that could not be recognized by traditional method. (2) Vaginal bacteria in the women at post menopause age were more complex than in those at reproductive age. Common bacteria included: Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Veillonella sp., Streptococcus intermedius, Streptococcus anginosus, Prevotella sp., Anaerococcus lactolyticus and Bacteroides fragilis. CONCLUSION: Based on the DGGE analysis, the most common vaginal bacteria in Chinese healthy women at reproductive age are Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners,and Lactobacillus gasseri. the most common vaginal bacteria in healthy post-menopausal women are Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus crispatus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus sp., Prevotella sp.,Bacteroides fragilis and lactic acid producing Veillonella sp. and Anaerococcus lactolyticus. Meanwhile Lactobacillus iners was firstly found by DGGE to be the dominant vaginal bacteria in different physiological states.
TI  - [Participation of gram-negative anaerobes in infections in hospitalized patients].
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility profiles of strictly anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria isolated from clinical samples taken from hospitalized patients from 01.01.2007 to 31.12.2008. The specimens were cultured using media, incubated at 37 degrees C under anaerobic conditions. Biochemical identification and antibiotic susceptibility were done in an automated system ATB Expression (bioMerieux S.A, France). For selected strains of Bacteroides sp. sensitivity was determined using E-test (AB BIODISK, Sweden). Overall 1274 strains of obligate anaerobes were isolated. Gram-negative bacteria were cultured in number of 333 strains. Most frequently isolated was Bacteroides sp. (46,9%) and Prevotella sp. (29,7%). Isolated bacteria are still susceptible to imipenem (100%), metronidazole (100%) and beta-lactam antibiotics with beta-lactamase inhibitors: amoxicillin/clavulanate (97,8%) piperacillin/tazobactam (99,1%), ticarcillin/clavulanate (99,1%).
TI  - Correlation network analysis applied to complex biofilm communities.
AB  - The complexity of the human microbiome makes it difficult to reveal organizational principles of the community and even more challenging to generate testable hypotheses. It has been suggested that in the gut microbiome species such as Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron are keystone in maintaining the stability and functional adaptability of the microbial community. In this study, we investigate the interspecies associations in a complex microbial biofilm applying systems biology principles. Using correlation network analysis we identified bacterial modules that represent important microbial associations within the oral community. We used dental plaque as a model community because of its high diversity and the well known species-species interactions that are common in the oral biofilm. We analyzed samples from healthy individuals as well as from patients with periodontitis, a polymicrobial disease. Using results obtained by checkerboard hybridization on cultivable bacteria we identified modules that correlated well with microbial complexes previously described. Furthermore, we extended our analysis using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM), which includes a large number of bacterial species, among them uncultivated organisms present in the mouth. Two distinct microbial communities appeared in healthy individuals while there was one major type in disease. Bacterial modules in all communities did not overlap, indicating that bacteria were able to effectively re-associate with new partners depending on the environmental conditions. We then identified hubs that could act as keystone species in the bacterial modules. Based on those results we then cultured a not-yet-cultivated microorganism, Tannerella sp. OT286 (clone BU063). After two rounds of enrichment by a selected helper (Prevotella oris OT311) we obtained colonies of Tannerella sp. OT286 growing on blood agar plates. This system-level approach would open the possibility of manipulating microbial communities in a targeted fashion as well as associating certain bacterial modules to clinical traits (e.g.: obesity, Crohn's disease, periodontal disease, etc).
TI  - [Repression of bacterial biofilms in suppurative necrotic complications of diabetic foot syndrome by ultrasound cavitation].
AB  - AIM: Study of wound microbial landscape in suppurative necrotic complications in  patients with diabetic foot syndrome (DFS), and a possibility of suppression of bacterial biofilm development in these wounds by ultrasound cavitation (USC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: 2 randomized groups of patients were included in the study: main group of 145 individuals with suppurative necrotic complications of DFS, who received ultrasound cavitation therapy, and comparison group of 86 patients who received basic therapy. In the main group Sonoca-180 (Siring, Germany) unit, that allows to combine the process of mechanical wound treatment with antibacterial action of low frequency ultrasound, was used for wound treatment. Quantitative and qualitative composition of wound microflora was studied by using bacteriological method with parallel utilization of transmission and scanning electron microscopy in the dynamic of USC treatment. RESULTS: In patients with DFS bacterial biofilms containing congestions in the polysaccharide matrix and fixed at the surface of dense structure of periostenum wound were detected. In the microbial landscape in DFS patients in 21% of cases aerobic-anaerobic microflora was detected, while associations included mostly from 2 to 5 bacteria species--members of the Peptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Prevotella, Bacteroides genera. Bacteria of Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Escherichia and Klebsiella sp. genera were detected less frequently. Application of USC in the main group resulted in a decrease of microbial contamination of wounds in the short-term. CONCLUSION: USC method, when compared with classical therapy approach in DFS complications, in patients with suppurative necrotic complications allows not only to remove mechanically the necrotic tissues but also to effectively suppress the bacterial biofilms that have formed in the wounds, this promotes the acceleration of recovery process and preparation of the patients for further plastic surgery intervention.
TI  - Burden of emerging anaerobes in the MALDI-TOF and 16S rRNA gene sequencing era.
AB  - The isolation of anaerobes from patients has declined in recent years, whereas their detection by molecular techniques has increased. In the present work, we analyzed the application of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and 16S rRNA gene sequencing to routine identification of anaerobes in clinical microbiology laboratory. We identified 544 isolates of 79 species by routine culture from deep samples in our hospital. MALDI-TOF MS allowed identification of 332 isolates (61%). The remaining 212 (39%) were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, allowing identification of 202 at the species level. The most common anaerobes were Propionibacterium spp. (12%), Finegoldia magna (4%), Fusobacterium spp. (6%) and Bacteroides spp. (6%). However, among the 79 identified species, seven were new species or genera, including two Prevotella conceptionensis, a species previously detected by our team by amplification and sequencing, five Anaerococcus sp. and one Prevotella sp. Beyond the identification of these new species, we also identified several uncommon or previously not described associations between species and specific pathologic conditions. MALDI-TOF MS-based identification, which will become more effective with future spectra database improvement, will be likely responsible of a burden of emerging anaerobes in clinical microbiology.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from Viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  - Six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from Viguiera arenaria Baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. The microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) against Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides fragilis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Actinomyces viscosus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying MIC values ranging from 1 to 10 mug mL-1. The results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.
TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
TI  - Comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (RP) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (GRs = good responders) or periodontal health (PH) using the Human Oral Microbe Identification Microarray (HOMIM). METHODS: At baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with PH and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by HOMIM. The subjects with periodontitis were classified as having RP (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (AL) and/or more than three sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or as GRs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with AL >or=2.5 mm after treatment. Significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: More species were detected in patients with disease (GR or RP) than in those without disease (PH). Subjects with RP were distinguished from GRs or those with PH by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros), Campylobacter gracilis, Eubacterium nodatum, Selenomonas noxia, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella spp., Treponema spp., and Eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, TM7 spp. oral taxon [OT] 346/356, Bacteroidetes sp. OT 272/274, Solobacterium moorei, Desulfobulbus sp. OT 041, Brevundimonas diminuta, Sphaerocytophaga sp. OT 337, Shuttleworthia satelles, Filifactor alocis, Dialister invisus/pneumosintes, Granulicatella adiacens, Mogibacterium timidum, Veillonella atypica, Mycoplasma salivarium, Synergistes sp. cluster II, and Acidaminococcaceae [G-1] sp. OT 132/150/155/148/135) (P <0.05). Species that were more prevalent in subjects with PH than in patients with periodontitis included Actinomyces sp. OT 170, Actinomyces spp. cluster I, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Cardiobacterium hominis, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Lautropia mirabilis, Propionibacterium propionicum, Rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and Streptococcus sanguinis (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: As determined by HOMIM, patients with RP presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the GR and PH groups.
TI  - Phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic bacterium isolated from a human brain abscess sample.
AB  - A strictly anaerobic bacterial strain, 7401987T, was isolated from a human brain  abscess sample. Cells were Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, coccoid to rod-shaped and motile by flagella in a lophotrichous arrangement. The isolate was asaccharolytic and the major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 (28.2%), C16:0 (18.0%), iso-C15:0 (12.3%) and iso-C17:0 3-OH (11.7%). 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons showed that the isolate was distantly related to members of the genera Bacteroides (<83.6% similarity), Parabacteroides (<79.9% similarity), Tannerella (<79.8% similarity), Dysgonomonas (<79.6% similarity), Porphyromonas (<79.3% similarity) and Prevotella (<78.9% similarity). The low 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity values and physiological and biochemical characteristics differentiated strain 7401987T from all known species and indicate that our isolate represents a novel species in a new genus within the phylum Bacteroidetes. The name Phocaeicola abscessus gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed; the type strain of Phocaeicola abscessus is 7401987T (=CCUG 55929T=CSUR P22T=DSM 21584T).
TI  - Microbiological findings in subjects with asymptomatic oral lichen planus: a cross-sectional comparative study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The bacterial colonization of the oral mucosa was evaluated in patients with asymptomatic oral lichen planus (OLP) and compared to the microbiologic status in mucosally healthy subjects. METHODS: Bacteria from patients with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed OLP from the Stomatology Service, Department of Oral Surgery and Stomatology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Bern, were collected with a non-invasive swab system. Samples were taken from OLP lesions on the gingiva and from non-affected sites on the contralateral side of the mouth. The control population did not have OLP and was recruited from the student clinic. All samples were processed with the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method using well-defined bacterial species for the analysis. RESULTS: Significantly higher bacterial counts of Bacteroides ureolyticus (P = 0.001), Dialister species (sp.) (P = 0.006), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (P = 0.007), and Streptococcus agalactiae (P = 0.006) were found in samples taken from OLP lesions compared to sites with no clinical evidence of OLP. Significantly higher bacterial counts were found for Capnocytophaga sputigena, Eikenella corrodens, Lactobacillus crispatus, Mobiluncus curtisii, Neisseria mucosa, Prevotella bivia, Prevotella intermedia, and S. agalactiae at sites with lesions in subjects with OLP compared to sites in control subjects (P <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Microbiologic differences were found between sites with OLP and sites in subjects without a diagnosis of OLP. Specifically, higher counts of staphylococci and S. agalactiae were found in OLP lesions.
TI  - Detection of herpesviruses and periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque of patients with chronic periodontitis, generalized aggressive periodontitis, or gingivitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpesviruses may be related to the etiology of aggressive periodontitis (AgP) and chronic periodontitis (CP) by triggering periodontal destruction or by increasing the risk for bacterial infection. This case-control study evaluated the presence of herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1), Epstein-Barr virus type I (EBV-1), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) in patients with generalized AgP (AgP group), CP (CP group), or gingivitis (G group) and in healthy individuals (C group). METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples were collected with paper points from 30 patients in each group. The nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was used to detect HSV-1, EBV-1, and HCMV. Bacteria were identified by 16S rRNA-based PCR. RESULTS: HSV-1, HCMV, and EBV-1 were detected in 86.7%, 46.7%, and 33.3% of the AgP group, respectively; in 40.0%, 50.0%, and 46.7% of the CP group, respectively; in 53.3%, 40.0%, and 20.0% of the G group, respectively; and in 20.0%, 56.7%, and 0.0% of the C group, respectively. A. actinomycetemcomitans was detected significantly more often in the AgP group compared to the other groups (P <0.005). P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were identified more frequently in AgP and CP groups, and AgP, CP, and G groups had higher frequencies of P. intermedia compared to the C group. CONCLUSION: In Brazilian patients, HSV-1 and EBV-1, rather than HCMV, were more frequently associated with CP and AgP.
TI  - Detection of periodontal pathogens in oral mucous membranes of edentulous individuals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the colonization of Campylobacter rectus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (previously Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans), Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) in the tongue and cheek of newborns and elderly individuals with no teeth. METHODS: Seventy-four edentulous subjects were included in this cross-sectional study. Microbiologic samples were taken from the dorsum of the tongue and cheek mucosa of all individuals and analyzed using a bacterial DNA-specific polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: C. rectus was the most prevalent species in both groups (20.9% in the cheek of newborns, and 77.4% in the tongue of elderly subjects). P. gingivalis and P. intermedia were not detected in any of the 43 newborns; however, P. gingivalis was recovered from the tongue and cheek (3.2%) of elderly individuals, whereas P. intermedia was detected in the tongue (9.6%) and cheek (3.2%) of elderly individuals. T. forsythia was detected in newborns as well as elderly individuals, although the highest prevalence was observed in the tongue of newborns (6.9%) and elderly (9.6%) individuals. A. actinomycetemcomitans was not found in the tongue of newborns, but we observed A. actinomycetemcomitans in the cheek (2.3%) of newborns and in the tongue (12.9%) and cheek (6.4%) of elderly patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although we did not detect P. gingivalis and P. intermedia in newborns, periodontal pathogens could be detected from the oral mucous membranes of edentulous individuals. Our results suggest that major attention should be paid to edentulous individuals as an important measure in the prevention of the initial colonization of natural teeth and dental implants by periodontal pathogens.
TI  - Correlates of periodontal decline and biologic markers in older adults.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information on infectious and host responses distinguishing older people with or without active periodontitis. This study measured bacterial and serum cytokine and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels in older persons. METHODS: Elders (mean age: 67 years), whose periodontal status had declined most or least (20% worst or 20% best) over 5 years, were enrolled. Two years later, they were classified as periodontally declining (active periodontitis [AP]), if they had at least five teeth with probing depth (PD) > or =5 mm, or stable (stable periodontally [SP]), if they did not. Groups were compared with respect to demographics, PD, clinical loss of attachment, subgingival bacteria, serum hsCRP, interleukin (IL)-1beta and -6, and chronic diseases. RESULTS: Ten AP and 24 SP subjects were identified; 13% of women and 44% of men from the original sample were in the AP group (P <0.05). Most Asians were SP; most whites and all African Americans were classified as having AP (P <0.01). More AP elders had osteoporosis (P <0.01), but the AP and SP groups did not differ with respect to IL-1beta and -6 or hsCRP. Bacterial counts were higher in the AP group for Parvimonas micra (previously Peptostreptococcus micros or Micromonas micros) (7.7 x 10(5) cells versus 3.8 x 10(5) cells; P <0.05), Prevotella intermedia (25.7 x 10(5) cells versus 9.8 x 10(5) cells; P <0.01), Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis) (16.2 x 10(5) cells versus 8.0 x 10(5) cells; P <0.05), and Streptococcus mutans (6.2 x 10(5) cells versus 2.0 x 10(5) cells; P <0.01). Three risk factors were most predictive of periodontal decline: PD, osteoporosis, and being white or African American. CONCLUSION: Periodontal decline was associated with osteoporosis, ethnicity, PD, gender, serum hsCRP, and levels of four bacterial species.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria isolated from pus specimens from orofacial infections.
AB  - Most suppurative orofacial infections are polymicrobial. Information regarding the antimicrobial susceptibility of the microorganisms involved can be useful in the choice of an effective antibiotic therapy. In this study we determined the antimicrobial susceptibility of a total 235 anaerobic and aerobic bacteria recently isolated from pus specimens of orofacial infections. All the viridans streptococci were susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime, cefoxitin, imipenem and levofloxacin. Imipenem and levofloxacin were active against 100% of the anaerobic Gram-positive organisms isolated. Among the anaerobic Gram-negative rods beta-lactamase production was detected in all species except Campylobacter rectus. Amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, imipenem and metronidazole were active against all the isolates of anaerobic Gram-negative species. Isolates resistant to erythromycin were found in all the species tested, however, resistance to clindamycin was only detected in Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides ureolyticus. Isolates resistant to levofloxacin were detected in P. gingivalis and Prevotella sp.
TI  - Implant surface analysis and microbiologic evaluation of failed implants retrieved from smokers.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota and surface of failed titanium dental implants from 4 manufacturers. Twelve mobile dental implants were retrieved from 10 smokers after 3 to 10 years of functional loading. Before implant removal, microbial samples were taken and evaluated using polymerase chain reaction. After implant removal, analyses of the failed implant surfaces were performed using scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectrometer x-ray. Periodontal pathogens such as Aggregactibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Tannerella forsythia, and Treponema denticola were detected in all implants in different proportions. Surface analysis showed varying degrees of surface roughness between the samples and the presence of proteinaceous material, appearing mainly as dark stains. Foreign carbon, oxygen, sodium, calcium, aluminum, and silicon elements were also found. Although no material-related causes of implant failure were detected, several periodontal pathogens were identified independently of the surface topography or manufacturer.
TI  - Antibiotic susceptibility of clinically relevant anaerobes in Estonia from 1999 to 2001.
AB  - At present little or no data is available regarding the resistance profiles of anaerobic bacteria in relation to the general usage of antibiotics. The objective of this study was to assess whether any potential relationship exists between the dynamics of antibiotic resistance of anaerobic bacteria and the consumption of antibiotics during the last 3 years within the Estonian population. In total, 416 anaerobic isolates were investigated from various clinical samples. The anaerobes were isolated on Wilkins-Chalgren Agar, incubated in an anaerobic glove box and identified by standard methods. beta-lactamase negative strains were tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, benzylpenicillin and the positive strains were further tested against metronidazole, clindamycin, and ampicillin/sulbactam by E-tests. The results of the susceptibility tests were interpreted according to the current criteria of NCCLS. Data from the Estonian State Agency of Medicines was used to assess the antibiotic consumption rate in the population (Defined Daily Doses per 1000 inhabitants annually). The following species of anaerobes were isolated: B. fragilis group, Bacteroides sp., Fusobacterium sp., Porphyromonas sp., Prevotella sp., Peptostreptococcus sp., in addition to various unidentified Gram-positive rods. Metronidazole resistance was not found among Gram-negative bacteria despite a relatively high consumption of this antimicrobial agent in Estonia. Only ampicillin/sulbactam demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against all anaerobes. Unexpectedly despite a relatively low rate of consumption of clindamycin a high rate of resistance to this agent occurred; a similar situation was noted for penicillin. In the present study we did not observe a relationship between the changes in antibiotic consumption (DDD/1000) rate and the resistance pattern of anaerobic bacteria to metronidazole, clindamycin, penicillin and ampicillin/sulbactam during a 3-year follow-up period. High resistance to penicillin among some species and also to clindamycin is similar to the global trend and argues for limited use of these antibiotics in empirical treatment. We would suggest that monitoring of local susceptibility pattern is necessary for the selection of initial empirical therapy.
TI  - Molecular analysis of bacteria in asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections.
AB  - The purpose of the present study was to use terminal restriction fragment length  polymorphism analysis and the 16S rRNA gene clone library to investigate the diversity of the microbiota associated with asymptomatic and symptomatic endodontic infections and to compare the bacterial community structure in these two clinical conditions. Samples were taken from asymptomatic endodontic infections associated with chronic periradicular lesions and from symptomatic infections clinically diagnosed as acute abscesses. 16S rRNA genes from DNA isolated from clinical samples were used to construct clone libraries or were subjected to terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Sequence analysis of 186 clones revealed 42 taxa; 23 (55%) were uncultivated phylotypes, of which seven were unique to endodontic infections. Clone sequencing and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis revealed that the most commonly detected taxa were Fusobacterium nucleatum (including terminal restriction fragment types 1 and 2), Peptostreptococcus micros/Peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone AJ062/BS044/FG014, Prevotella species, Dialister species, Mogibacterium species, Lachnospiraceae oral clone 55A-34, Filifactor alocis, Megasphaera sp. oral clone CS025/BS073, and Veillonella sp. oral clone BP1-85/Veillonella dispar/V. parvula. Bacteroides-like sp. oral clone X083/Bacteroidales oral clone MCE7_20 and Dialister sp. oral clone BS016/MCE7_134 were detected only in asymptomatic teeth. On the other hand, F. nucleatum terminal restriction fragment type 2, Prevotella intermedia, Dialister pneumosintes, and some phylotypes were exclusively detected in symptomatic samples. Bacterial profiles of symptomatic endodontic infections generated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis were clearly different from those of asymptomatic infections. Overall, the average number of terminal restriction fragments in symptomatic samples was significantly larger than in asymptomatic samples. Molecular analysis of the microbiota associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic endodontic infections indicates that the endodontic bacterial diversity is greater than previously described by culture methods and that the structure of the microbiota differ significantly between asymptomatic and symptomatic infections.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the in-vitro activity of seven antimicrobial agents, including ertapenem, against recently isolated Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria in Greece.
AB  - The in-vitro activities of penicillin, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, cefoxitin, imipenem, ertapenem, metronidazole and clindamycin were evaluated against 138 Gram-negative anaerobic isolates (82 Bacteroides fragilis group, 17 non-fragilis Bacteroides spp., 31 Prevotella spp., four Fusobacterium spp., two Veillonella spp., one Porphyromonas sp. and one Tissierella praeacuta) collected from six general hospitals in Athens, Greece. Overall rates of non-susceptibility (both resistant and intermediately-resistant) to penicillin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid were 81.8% and 2.3%, respectively. The rates of non-susceptibility to cefoxitin and clindamycin were 30.3% and 31.1%, respectively, and that for metronidazole was 4.3% (four Prevotella spp. isolates, one Porphyromonas sp. isolate and one B. fragilis isolate). Only the single B. fragilis isolate was nim-positive by PCR. Only one B. fragilis isolate was resistant to both carbapenems tested, while six more Bacteroides spp. isolates were imipenem-susceptible and ertapenem-non-susceptible. The MIC range, MIC(50) and MIC(90) values were comparable for imipenem and ertapenem, although ertapenem MIC(90)s were one or two two-fold dilutions higher.
TI  - Urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  This review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. The types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. The anaerobes recovered in these studies were Gram-negative bacilli (including Bacteroides fragilis and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp.), Clostridium sp., anaerobic Gram-positive cocci and Actinomyces sp. In many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. The recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. These antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. Percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.
TI  - Assessment of equine fecal contamination: the search for alternative bacterial source-tracking targets.
AB  - 16S rDNA clone libraries were evaluated for detection of fecal source-identifying bacteria from a collapsed equine manure pile. Libraries were constructed using universal eubacterial primers and Bacteroides-Prevotella group-specific primers. Eubacterial sequences indicated that upstream and downstream water samples were predominantly beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria (35 and 19%, respectively), while the manure library consisted predominantly of Firmicutes (31%) and previously unidentified sequences (60%). Manure-specific eubacterial sequences were not detectable beyond 5 m downstream of the pile, suggesting either poor survival or high dilution rates. In contrast, Bacteroides and Prevotella sp. sequences were detected both in manure and downstream using group-specific primers. Novel sequences from Bacteroides and Prevotella analysis produced an equine-specific phylogenetic cluster as compared to previous data sets obtained for human and bovine samples. While these results suggest that some anaerobic fecal bacteria might be potential identifiers for use in source-tracking applications, a comprehensive examination of environmental sequences within these species should be performed before methods targeting these bacterial groups are applied to watersheds for development of microbial source-tracking protocols.
TI  - Distribution of periodontal pathogens in Korean aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbial associations in aggressive periodontitis versus different ethnic origins are substantially unknown. We undertook this study to determine the prevalence of seven putative periodontopathogens in Korean patients and to evaluate microbial differences in localized and generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. METHODS: Thirty-nine aggressive periodontitis patients between 20 and 35 years old (24 males and 15 females; mean age 29.6 years) were selected according to clinical criteria. The patients were subclassified into 17 localized and 22 generalized aggressive periodontitis patients. In each of the 39 individuals, subgingival plaque samples were collected from four diseased teeth (> or = 6 mm probing depth, 156 sites) and one healthy site (< or = 3 mm probing depth, 39 sites). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene fragments (about 530 bp) of plaque bacteria and their subsequent detection by dot-blot hybridization using specific oligonucleotide probes were performed to determine the presence of seven periodontopathogens. RESULTS: The prevalences were 75% for Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 94.2% for Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus), 99.4% for Fusobacterium sp., 85.9% for Micromonas micros (formerly Peptostreptococcus micros), 96.8% for Porphyromonas gingivalis, 78.8% for Prevotella intermedia, and 96.8% for Treponema sp. The prevalences of these bacteria were significantly higher in diseased sites than in healthy sites. Logistic regression analysis showed that P. intermedia was more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis than the localized form, with an odds ratio of 3.28 (95% confidence interval 1.26-8.56, P = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the seven periodontal pathogens analyzed are strongly associated with Korean aggressive periodontitis. In particular, P. intermedia are more significantly associated with generalized aggressive periodontitis, a more severe and progressive form, than with localized aggressive periodontitis.
TI  - Localized aggressive periodontitis in primary dentition: a case report.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 5-year-old Japanese boy presented with persistent gingival inflammation and severe mobility of the right lower primary incisors. Due to severe alveolar bone loss and a deep periodontal pocket (5 mm), the incisors were extracted at the second visit. METHODS: Clinical, radiographic, histological, and microbiological examinations were carried out. Then, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was employed to detect specific periodontal pathogens. The chemotactic activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophils was also measured. RESULTS: Tannerella, Capnocytophaga, Fusobacterium, and Eikenella sp. were recovered from the subgingival microflora around the right lower incisors, while A. actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythensis (formerly Bacteroides forsythus), Prevotella nigrescens, Campylobacter rectus, and Capnocytophaga gingivalis were detected using the PCR method. Further chemotaxis assay revealed that neutrophil function was depressed compared with that of healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: Although inflammation remained around the right primary second molars, the bone loss was controlled by periodic professional mechanical teeth cleaning (PMTC), subgingival irrigation, and local antibiotic application. The probing depths of all teeth, including permanent incisors and molars, were within 2.5 mm.
TI  - Characteristics of brain abscess with isolation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - In view of its localization, brain abscess (BA) usually requires medical and surgical care. A broad spectrum of bacteria is involved. Recent reports stress the increasing frequency of anaerobes, but their impact has not been well evaluated. A retrospective review was conducted of all episodes of documented BA admitted in a tertiary-care hospital over a 10 y period. BA due to anaerobic bacteria (group A) were compared with other cases (group B) to determine the frequency and eventual characteristics of BA with isolated anaerobic bacteria. Between 1991 and 2000, BA were diagnosed in 42 patients (28M, 14F, mean age 54.6 y). No differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were found between patients with BA caused by anaerobic (n = 22) and only aerobic (n = 20) bacteria. Using appropriate microbiological techniques, 41 anaerobic bacteria strains were isolated in 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) with BA. Anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 5 patients (12%), whereas in 17 patients (40.5%) only anaerobic strains were isolated in cerebral puncture cultures. The most frequently isolated species were Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 14), Prevotella sp. (n = 8), Actinomyces sp. (n = 6) and Bacteroides sp. (n = 4). Compared with group B, group A had more cases of a single abscess (p = 0.03) and ear, nose and throat (ENT) as a source of infection (p = 0.04), and seemed to have a better outcome (p = 0.07). These results emphasize the important role that anaerobic bacteria play in BA. The presence of such pathogens must be evoked when faced with a single abscess, an ENT infection, or both. Therapy should take into account this high frequency.
TI  - Etiology of persistent tubo-ovarian abscess in Nairobi, Kenya.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the microbial etiology of tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). METHODS: We recruited 11 women in Nairobi, Kenya who failed antibiotic therapy alone and required surgical drainage of a presumptive TOA. Pus from the nine abscesses and two pyosalpinges were collected and cultured for aerobic, facultative and anaerobic microorganisms. RESULTS: Eleven women suspected of having a TOA were hospitalized and treated for a median of 6 days (range 3-14 days) prior to surgical drainage of the abscess. Nine (82%) specimens were culture positive. Aerobes were present in all nine specimens. Seven of the nine positive cultures (78%) were polymicrobial and five of the polymicrobial cultures contained both anaerobes and aerobes. Anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli (Prevotella sp., Porphyromonas sp. and Bacteroides sp., Escherichia coli) and Streptococcus sp. (S. viridans and S. agalactiae) were the most common microorganisms isolated. Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis were not isolated by culture or detected by polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSIONS: In Kenya, persistent TOAs are associated with endogenous flora similar to that normally found in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Prevalence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli in routine clinical specimens.
AB  - A total of 206 gram negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated from 2591 routine clinical specimens. Majority of them (78.2%) were part of a mixed flora. A high incidence of gram negative anaerobic bacilli was found in post-operative wound infections and diabetic foot infections (30.1%), followed by necrotizing fasciitis and crush injuries (18%), pus of empyema and lung abscesses (14.5%) and aspirates from other deep abscesses (10.7%). Bacteroides fragilis was the most frequently recognized species (42.2%), followed by Fusobacterium sp. (17.4%), Prevotella sp. (15.1%) and Porphyromonas sp. (11.2%). Neomycin blood agar plate yielded the maximum number (72.8%) of strains in pure culture. Gram negative anaerobic bacilli in infective processes are significantly on the rise and so suspected cultures should be processed for both aerobic and anaerobic organisms.
TI  - High prevalence of cfxA beta-lactamase in aminopenicillin-resistant Prevotella strains isolated from periodontal pockets.
AB  - This prospective study was designed to investigate amoxicillin-resistant oral anaerobes, and to identify their beta-lactamase-encoding genes. Three subgingival bacterial samples were collected from 12 patients suffering from periodontitis. One to seven beta-lactamase-producing strains were obtained from each patient, mostly belonging to the Prevotella genus (Bacteroides eggerthii, 2/35 strains; Prevotella sp., 33/35 strains). PCR assays were used to detect cfxA and cepA/cblA, the genes encoding class A/group2e beta-lactamases previously described in the Bacteroides fragilis group. The present investigation confirmed the role of Prevotella species as beta-lactamase producers in periodontal pockets. Additionally, this PCR screening showed (1): the high prevalence of CfxA beta-lactamase production by aminopenicillin-resistant Prevotella (32/33: 97.0% positive strains) vs. cepA/cblA (1/33: 3.0% positive strains), and (2) the presence of cfxA in the periodontal reservoir in the absence of antimicrobial therapy during the previous 6 months.
TI  - Treatment of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline. Clinical, microbiological and radiological results.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical, microbiological and radiological effects of peri-implantitis therapy by local delivery of tetracycline. In 25 partially edentulous patients, 30 implants with radiographic evidence of circumferential bone loss, and peri-implant probing depths > or =5 mm were treated with polymeric tetracycline HCl-containing fibers. Clinical and microbial parameters were recorded at baseline, and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months (M) after treatment. Standardized radiographs were obtained at baseline, M3, and one year after treatment. Two patients were discontinued from the study after 180 days because of persisting active peri-implantitis with pus formation. The remaining subjects showed a significant decrease of mean peri-implant probing depth from 6.0 to 4.1 mm (M1, P<0.001), which was maintained over 12 months. In comparison to baseline, the bleeding tendency was significantly reduced after one month, and thereafter (P<0.001). No significant recession of the mucosal margin was noted. The radiologically determined distance from the shoulder of the implant to the bottom of the bony defect decreased slightly, but not significantly, from 5.2 to 4.9 mm. At M1, M3 and M6, mean total anaerobic cultivable bacterial counts were significantly lower than at baseline (P<0.001). A significant decrease in frequency of detection was noted for Prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, Fusobacterium sp., Bacteroides forsythus, and Campylobacter rectus (P<0.01). Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Eikenella corrodens had very low baseline frequencies that could not be significantly suppressed further. In conclusion, therapy of peri-implantitis by local delivery of tetracycline had a positive effect on clinical and microbiological parameters.
TI  - Dysgonomonas gen. nov. to accommodate Dysgonomonas gadei sp. nov., an organism isolated from a human gall bladder, and Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides (formerly CDC group DF-3).
AB  - Results of a polyphasic taxonomic study on an unknown Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, coccobacillus-shaped organism isolated from an infected human gall bladder are presented. Phenotypic and molecular taxonomic studies revealed the organism to be close to, but distinct from, organisms designated CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) group DF-3. The unknown bacterium was readily distinguished from reference strains of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas and related taxa by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, biochemical tests, analysis of cellular long-chain fatty acids and electrophoretic analysis of whole-cell proteins. Based on the results of the present study, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium be classified in a new genus, Dysgonomonas, as Dysgonomonas gadei sp. nov. (type strain CCUG 42882T = CIP 106420T). In addition, a new species, Dysgonomonas capnocytophagoides sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate strains previously belonging to CDC group DF-3. The type species of the genus Dysgonomonas is Dysgonomonas gadei.
TI  - Detection of major putative periodontopathogens in Korean advanced adult periodontitis patients using a nucleic acid-based approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although extensive microbial analyses have been performed from subgingival plaque samples of periodontitis patients, systematic analysis of subgingival microbiota has not been carried out in a Korean population so far. The purpose of this study was to describe the prevalence of major putative periodontopathogens in Korean patients by culture-independent methods. METHODS: A total of 244 subgingival plaque samples (5 sites in each participant) were taken from 29 advanced adult periodontitis (AP) patients and 20 periodontally healthy subjects. AP samples were obtained from the 4 deepest periodontal pockets (> or =6 mm probing depth [PD]) and 1 healthy site (< or =3 mm PD) in each patient. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) of subgingival plaque bacteria was performed with eubacterial primers. Aliquots of PCR products were then applied on nylon membranes and hybridized with specific oligonucleotide probes labeled with digoxigenin. RESULTS: All diseased sites harbored Fusobacterium sp., while Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema sp., and Bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 96% of 116 diseased sites. Peptostreptococcus micros, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Prevotella intermedia were present in 82%, 74%, and 71% of diseased sites, respectively. In sites of periodontally healthy subjects, Fusobacterium sp. was present in the highest proportion (58%). Treponema sp., P. gingivalis, and B. forsythus were detected in 22%, 18%, and 18% of healthy sites, respectively. P. micros, P. intermedia, and A. actinomycetemcomitans were found in 8%, 2%, and 1% of healthy sites, respectively. The prevalence of the periodontopathogens, with the exceptions of Fusobacterium sp. and B. forsythus, was significantly higher in the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Using highly sensitive methods relying on 16S ribosomal RNA-based oligonucleotide probes, we confirmed the strong association of 7 putative periodontopathogens with AP patients in a Korean population. With the exceptions of Fusobacterium sp. and B. forsythus, all the periodontopathogens were significantly more associated with the healthy sites of periodontitis subjects than in the healthy sites of periodontally healthy subjects.
TI  - The microbial spectrum of brain abscess with special reference to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The bacteriological and clinical findings of 18 cases of brain abscess are presented. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility of anaerobic strains was performed both by conventional methods and the newer RapID ANA II panel and E-test methods, respectively. Characterization of the anaerobic isolates was done by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Anaerobic or aerobic organisms alone were recovered in three (16.6%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic in another three (16.6%) patients. There were nine anaerobic isolates. The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella melaninogenicus (four isolates), Bacteroides preacutus (three isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus sp. (one isolate each). A total of six aerobic isolates, all of which were Gram-positive cocci were recovered. All the anaerobic isolates were susceptible to metronidazole, but two isolates of P. melaninogenicus were resistant to penicillin. There was complete agreement between the identification based on biochemical profiles and RFLP patterns. These findings indicate the microbial complexity of brain abscess and the need to target antimicrobial therapy against both the aerobic and anaerobic components of infection.
TI  - [The range of antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus bacterial strains on etiologic agents of bacterial vaginosis].
AB  - Bacterial vaginosis is caused by uncontrolled sequential overgrowth of some anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., Mobiluncus sp. usually occurring in stable numbers in the bacterial flora of healthy women. On the other hand, different species of bacteria belonging to the genus Lactobacillus, most frequently L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus and L. acidophilus, form a group of aerobic bacteria dominating in the same environment. The diversity and density of their populations depend on the age and health conditions. Thanks to their antagonistic and adherence properties bacteria of the genus Lactobacillus can maintain a positive balance role in this ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the antagonistic properties of Lactobacillus strains isolated from the vagina of healthy women against most common agents of bacterial vaginosis. It was found that nearly all of the tested Lactobacillus strains exerted distinct antagonistic activity against anaerobic bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and quite a number also against Gram-negative rods, while only some of them were able to inhibit Gram-positive aerobic cocci as Enterococcus faecalis or Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  - Forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. The subgingival plaque samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine Porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. The results showed Porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with Bacteroides forsythus. Peptostreptococcus sp., Actinomyces sp. and Prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus and Eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in the healthy subjects.
TI  - Oropharynx microbiota among alcoholics and non-alcoholics.
AB  - CONTEXT: The oropharynx microbiota plays an important role in the origin of infections, especially among alcoholics whose airway defenses are impaired. OBJECTIVE: To compare the normal oropharingeal flora in heavy alcohol drinker and non-alcoholics. PATIENTS: 117 persons, 58 heavy alcohol drinkers and 59 non-alcoholics. SETTING: Santa Casa de Sao Paulo Emergency Service. DESIGN: A blind prospective study. MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURES: Prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. RESULTS: The study of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy alcohol drinkers demonstrated the presence of anaerobic microorganisms in 84.5% of them, including: Bacteroides sp, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium sp, Veilonella sp, Peptostreptococcus sp, Propionibacterium sp, Bifidobacterium sp and Clostridium sp, versus 30.5% (p < 0.005) of non-alcoholics. Candida sp was present in 34.5% of heavy alcohol drinkers and 5.1% of non-alcoholics (p < 0.005). Enterobacteria predominated among heavy alcohol drinkers (25%) compared with non-alcoholics (5.5%) only in the age group 14 to 34 years (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based upon these results, it was possible to conclude that the knowledge of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy drinkers and non-alcoholics has an important predictive value concerning probable etiologic agents of lower airway infections. Infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms and fungi should be taken into consideration during the choice of empirical therapy for heavy alcohol drinkers.
TI  - Sinusitis in neurologically impaired children.
AB  - The microbiologic features of infected sinus aspirates in nine children with neurologic impairment were studied. Anaerobic bacteria, always mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria, were isolated in 6 (67%) aspirates and aerobic bacteria only in 3 (33%). There were 24 bacterial isolates, 12 aerobic or facultative and 12 anaerobic. The predominant aerobic isolates were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (2 each) and Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 each). The predominant anaerobes were Prevotella sp. (5), Peptostreptococcus sp. (4), Fusobacterium nucleatum (2), and Bacteroides fragilis (1). Beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were isolated from 8 (89%) patients. Organisms similar to those recovered from the sinuses were also isolated from tracheostomy site and gastrostomy wound aspirates in five of seven instances. This study demonstrates the uniqueness of the microbiologic features of sinusitis in neurologically impaired children, in which, in addition to the organisms known to cause infection in children without neurologic impairment, facultative and anaerobic gram-negative organisms that can colonize other body sites are predominant.
TI  - Serum antibodies reacting with subgingival species in refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to compare the levels of serum IgG antibody to 85 subgingival species in 32 refractory periodontitis, 56 successfully treated, and 33 periodontally healthy subjects. Refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or >3 sites showing attachment loss >2.5 mm within 1 year after 2 treatment modalities, scaling and root planing and surgery plus systemically administered tetracycline. Successfully-treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss >2.5 mm, 1 year post-therapy. Periodontally healthy subjects exhibited no pocket or attachment level >3 mm, and no evidence of progressing attachment loss during 1 year of monitoring. Baseline serum was obtained from each subject and tested against 85 subgingival species, including reference strains and strains isolated from refractory subjects, using checkerboard immunoblotting. Significance of differences in levels of serum antibody among groups were sought using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their serum antibody response to subgingival species. Some individuals had antibody reactions to many subgingival species, while other subjects showed fewer or low numbers of responses. On average, refractory subjects exhibited higher numbers and levels of serum antibody reactions to a wide range of subgingival species than successfully treated or periodontally healthy subjects. Differences in serum antibody among clinical groups were more striking at higher threshold levels of antibody (>50 microg/ml and > 100 microg/ml). The data showed that a subject was 10.1 x more likely to be refractory if the subject exhibited antibody reactions with >9 subgingival species at >50 microg/ml (p<0.001, after adjusting for multiple comparisons). Serum antibody to a subset of the test species differed among the clinical groups. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroidesforsythus, and some strains isolated from refractory subjects (a novel Neisseria sp., Enterococcus faecalis, Prevotella loescheii and Prevotella oulora) elicited high serum antibody in the successfully treated and refractory subjects. High levels of serum antibody to a Microbacterium lacticum-like organism, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus constellatus, Actinobacillus actinonmycetemcomitans serotype c and Haemophilus aphrophilus significantly increased the likelihood of a subject being refractory to conventional periodontal therapy.
TI  - Activities of HMR 3004 (RU 64004) and HMR 3647 (RU 66647) compared to those of erythromycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, roxithromycin, and eight other antimicrobial agents against unusual aerobic and anaerobic human and animal bite pathogens isolated from skin and soft tissue infections in humans.
AB  - The activities of HMR 3004 and HMR 3647 and comparator agents, especially macrolides, were determined by the agar dilution method against 262 aerobic and 120 anaerobic strains isolated from skin and soft tissue infections associated with human and animal bite wounds. HMR 3004 and HMR 3647 were active against almost all aerobic and fastidious facultative isolates (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively) and against all anaerobes [Bacteroides tectum, Porphyromonas macacae (salivosa), Prevotella heparinolytica, Porphyromonas sp., Prevotella sp., and peptostreptococci] at < or = 0.25 and < or = 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, except Fusobacterium nucleatum (HMR 3004, MIC90 = 16 microg/ml; HMR 3647, MIC90 = 8 microg/ml) and other Fusobacterium species (MIC90, 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively). In general, HMR 3004 and HMR 3647 were more active than any of the macrolides tested. Azithromycin was more active than clarithromycin against all Pasteurella species, including Pasteurella multocida subsp. multocida, Eikenella corrodens, and Fusobacterium species, while clarithromycin was more active than azithromycin against Corynebacterium species, Weeksella zoohelcum, B. tectum, and P. heparinolytica.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of otorrhea associated with tympanostomy tubes in children.
AB  - The microbiology of in 55 ear aspirates obtained from 34 children with chronic otorrhea was studied. Aspiration of the middle ear exudate was done immediately following removal of tympanostomy tube (TT). The middle ear aspirates and swab specimens of the external auditory canals were cultured for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Sixty-five isolates were recovered only from the middle ears, 73 only from the external ear canals, and 73 were present at both sites. Analysis of the 138 middle ear isolates demonstrated the recovery of aerobic bacteria only in 28 patients (50%), anaerobes only in seven (13%), and both aerobes and anaerobes in 20 (36%). There were 77 aerobic and 61 anaerobic isolates. Commonly recovered aerobes were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 isolates), Staphylococcus aureus (11), Proteus sp. (7), Moraxella catarrhalis (6), Klebsiella pneumoniae (5) and non-typable Haemophilus influenzae (5). Commonly isolated anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (25 isolates), Prevotella sp. (10), Bacteroides sp. (8) and Fusobacterium sp. (6). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and S. aureus were more often isolated in children older then 6 years. These findings demonstrate the polymicrobial bacteriology of TT-related otorrhea in children. Specimens collected from the external auditory canals can be misleading. Reliable information can be obtained from the ear exudes when collected through the TT or through the open perforation after their removal.
TI  - Distribution and mobility of the tetracycline resistance determinant tetQ.
AB  - We tested 34 American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and 168 clinical bacterial isolates, from the human urogenital and oral tracts and streptococci isolated from cows with mastitis, for the presence of the tetQ gene using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay and DNA-DNA hybridization. The identities of PCR products were confirmed by Southern blot hybridization of whole-cell DNA. Eleven of the ATCC strains were positive for tetQ, including five Bacteroides spp., five Prevotella spp. and a single isolate of Mitsuokella multiacidus. Twenty-eight (29%) of the 95 clinical Gram-negative isolates carried the tetQ gene, while eight (11%) of the 73 clinical Gram-positive isolates carried the tetQ gene. This is the first description of tetQ in Gram-positive species. All isolates except one Peptostreptococcus sp. carried tetQ integrated into the chromosome. The tetQ gene could be transferred from Prevotella bivia, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides vulgatus and Bacteroides distasonis into an Enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-7)-10(-9) per recipient. In contrast, tetQ failed to transfer from two isolates of Prevotella intermedia, two isolates of Porphyromonas gingivalis, one isolate of Mobiluncus curtisii and one isolate of Peptostreptococcus sp. The latter two are Gram-positive species. The PCR assay was used to screen 198 proteinase K-treated biopsies of prostate, periprostate and bladder from 84 men with prostatitis. Thirty-four (40%) of the patients had one or more positive samples, suggesting that the PCR assay could be of value in screening patient material directly for the presence of bacteria.
TI  - In-vitro activity of spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination against clinical isolates from odontogenic abscesses.
AB  - One hundred and forty-eight isolates of bacteria from 20 intraoral odontogenic abscesses were tested for their susceptibility to spiramycin and metronidazole alone or in combination. All isolates, except Rothia spp. (one), Enterococcus avium (three), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (one) and Staphylococcus aureus (one) were sensitive to spiramycin and/or metronidazole. Among the anaerobes, spiramycin as well as metronidazole showed good antimicrobial activity against species of Prevotella, Eubacterium, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides and Porphyromonas. All the aerobes were resistant to metronidazole. A potential synergic effect was found in 17% of the clinical isolates tested, as the MICs of spiramycin and metronidazole for 25 isolates (21 isolates of Eubacterium, two of lactobacilli, one strain of Peptostreptococcus sp. and one Clostridium clostridiiforme) were significantly reduced by the addition of the other antibiotic.
TI  - Phenotypic diversity among ruminal isolates of Prevotella ruminicola: proposal of Prevotella brevis sp. nov., Prevotella bryantii sp. nov., and Prevotella albensis sp. nov. and redefinition of Prevotella ruminicola.
AB  - Selected phenotypic characteristics of isolates of Prevotella ruminicola (formerly Bacteroides ruminicola) were studied in order to establish whether the characteristics of genotypic strain groups established previously on the basis of 16S ribosomal DNA sequences differed systematically. Among strains formerly considered P. ruminicola subsp. brevis, strains related to strain GA33T (T = type strain) typically failed to produce carboxymethyl cellulase (CMCase) activity detectable by plate assays and failed to ferment xylose, while strains related to strain B14T produced abundant CMCase and fermented xylose. We propose that strains related to GA33T, which have DNA G + C contents between 45 and 51 mol%, should be assigned to a new species, Prevotella brevis, and that strains related to B14T, which have DNA G + C contents between 39 and 43 mol%, should be assigned to another new species, Prevotella bryantii. Most of the isolates formerly classified as P. ruminicola subsp. ruminicola strains produced CMCase and had DNA G + C contents between 45 and 51 mol%, and we propose that these organisms should be placed in the redefined species P. ruminicola. A small group of isolates that have lower G + C contents are assigned to another new species, Prevotella albensis. Most P. brevis and P. bryantii strains produced abundatn extracellular DNase activity. Proteinase activities (as determined by [14C]casein hydrolysis) varied widely between strains, and P. brevis strains exhibited the highest mean activity. All strains produced dipeptidyl peptidase activity, but the relative activities against different peptide substrates exhibited by P. bryantii, P. albensis, and P. brevis differed systematically. The phenotypic differences among the newly defined species suggest that they may occupy distinct niches within the rumen ecosystem.
TI  - Microbiology of infected atopic dermatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections occur frequently in lesions of atopic dermatitis (AD). The objectives of the study were to establish the aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of secondarily infected AD. METHODS: A retrospective review was carried out of clinical and microbiology laboratory records and of data obtained from patients with secondarily infected AD lesions, whose specimens of infected sites were processed for the presence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 41 specimens. Aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria only were present in 15 patients (36%), anaerobic bacteria only in eight (20%), and mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 18 (44%). Seventy-two isolates were recovered (1.8 per specimen), 34 aerobic or facultative bacteria, 35 strict anaerobes, and three Candida sp. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (12 isolates), Group A beta hemolytic streptococcus in five isolates, and Escherichia coli in four. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus spp. (13 isolates), pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. in eight, and Fusobacterium spp. in four isolates. Single bacterial isolates were recovered in 14 patients (34%), seven of which were S. aureus. Twenty-one of the organisms isolated from 16 patients (39%) produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to the lesions predominated in these infections. Enteric gram-negative rods and Bacteroides fragilis group predominated in lesions on legs and buttocks. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, pigmented Prevotella, and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were most frequently recovered in lesions of the finger, scalp, face, and neck. CONCLUSIONS: The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected AD lesions and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomic site of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Pyomyositis in children, caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The author describes the microbiology and clinical features of six pyomyositis infections in children, which yielded anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone were recovered in four instances, and they are mixed with facultative bacteria in two. There were 15 bacterial isolates (13 anaerobic, 2 facultative). The bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (5 isolates), Bacteroides fragilis (3), Clostridium sp (2), Fuso-bacterium nucleatum (1), Prevotella sp (1), Bateroides sp (1), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), and Escherichia coli (1). Recent trauma or injury had occurred in five cases; three such injuries were from penetrating objects. This study highlights the potential importance of anaerobic bacteria in children with pyomyositis.
TI  - Comparison of randomly cloned and whole genomic DNA probes for the detection of Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus.
AB  - Whole genomic and randomly-cloned DNA probes for two fastidious periodontal pathogens, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Bacteroides forsythus were labeled with digoxigenin and detected by a colorimetric method. The specificity and sensitivity of the whole genomic and cloned probes were compared. The cloned probes were highly specific compared to the whole genomic probes. A significant degree of cross-reactivity with Bacteroides species, Capnocytophaga sp. and Prevotella sp. was observed with the whole genomic probes. The cloned probes were less sensitive than the whole genomic probes and required at least 10(6) target cells or a minimum of 10 ng of target DNA to be detected during hybridization. Although a ten-fold increase in sensitivity was obtained with the whole genomic probes, cross-hybridization to closely related species limits their reliability in identifying target bacteria in subgingival plaque samples.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of tonsils removed from children with tonsillitis hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis with and without hypertrophy.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species and their numbers were studied in tonsillar specimens from children who had undergone elective tonsillectomy: 6 patients with recurrent tonsillitis (RT), 9 with recurrent tonsillitis with hypertrophy (RTH), and 8 with obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy (OTH). Mixed flora were present in all tonsils, yielding an average of 6.7 isolates (5.6 aerobic or facultative and 1.1 anaerobic bacteria). The highest recovery rate of organisms per tonsil was in patients with OTH (7.7 per tonsil), compared to 6.3 per tonsil in RT and 5.9 per tonsil in RTH. The predominant aerobic and facultative organisms were Haemophilus influenzae (22 isolates), Neisseria sp (16), Staphylococcus aureus (14), and Eikenella corrodens (14), and the predominant anaerobic bacteria were Fusobacterium sp (8), Bacteroides sp (7), and Prevotella melaninogenica (5). The number of bacteria per gram of tonsillar tissue varied between 10(4) and 10(8). A higher concentration of S aureus and H influenzae was found in hypertrophic tonsils (RTH and OTH) as compared to RT. These findings suggest the presence of an increased bacterial load and supports an etiologic role for H influenzae and S aureus in hypertrophic tonsils with and without inflammation (RTH and OTH). Further studies to elucidate the effect of selective antimicrobial therapy directed at these organisms may offer an alternative management of hypertrophic tonsils.
TI  - Microbiology of secondary bacterial infection in scabies lesions.
AB  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were grown from specimens obtained from 30 children with secondarily infected scabies lesions. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 14 (47%) patients, anaerobic bacteria only were present in 6 (20%) patients, and a mixed anaerobic-aerobic flora was present in 10 (33%) patients. Fifty isolates were recovered (1.7 per specimen); 27 were aerobic or facultative bacteria and 23 were strict anaerobes. The predominant aerobic and facultative bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (nine isolates), group A streptococci (five isolates), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (three isolates). The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp. (nine isolates) and pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas spp. (four isolates). Single bacterial isolates were recovered from nine (30%) patients; five of these were S. aureus. Sixteen organisms isolated from 12 (40%) patients produced the enzyme beta-lactamase. Organisms that resided in the mucous membranes close to or in contact with the lesions predominated in those infections. Enteric gram-negative rods were recovered in leg and trunk lesions. Group A streptococci and S. aureus predominated in finger and hand lesions. Bacteroides fragilis group and Clostridium sp. were isolated from leg lesions, and pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas and Fusobacterium spp. were recovered from finger lesions. The polymicrobial etiology of secondarily infected scabies lesions in children and the association of bacterial flora with the anatomical sites of the lesions are demonstrated.
TI  - Clinical features and aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the aerobic and anaerobic microbiological characteristics of cellulitis and correlate them with the infection site. DESIGN: Of 342 specimens, 64 obtained using needle aspiration and 278 using swabs were studied over 10 years. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was noted in 15 (23%) of the 64 needle aspirates and 259 (93%) of the 278 swab aspirates. The microbial results of the 15 specimens obtained through needle aspiration are separately presented. Aerobic or facultative bacteria only were present in 138 (53%) of swab samples, anaerobic bacteria only in 69 (27%), and mixed aerobic-anaerobic flora in 52 (20%). In total, there were 582 isolates, 247 aerobic or facultative and 335 anaerobic bacteria, with an average of 2.2 isolates per specimen. The predominance of certain isolates in different anatomical sites correlated with their distribution in the normal flora adjacent to the infected site. The highest recovery rates of anaerobes was from the neck, trunk, groin, external genitalia, and leg areas. Aerobes outnumbered anaerobes in the arm and hand. The predominant aerobes were Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococci, and Escherichia coli. The predominant anaerobes were Peptostreptococcus sp, Bacteroides fragilis group, Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, and Clostridium sp. Certain clinical findings correlated with the following organisms: swelling and tenderness with Clostridium sp, Prevotella sp, S aureus, and group A streptococci; regional adenopathy with B fragilis group; bulbous lesions with Enterobacteriaceae; gangrene and necrosis with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group, Clostridium sp, and Enterobacteriaceae; foul odor with Bacteroides sp; and gas in tissues with Peptostreptococcus sp, B fragilis group and Clostridium sp. Certain predisposing conditions correlated with the following organisms: trauma with Clostridium sp; diabetes with Bacteroides sp, Enterobacteriaceae, and S aureus; and burn with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the polymicrobial nature of cellulitis.
TI  - Microbiology of chronic suppurative otitis media in children in Surabaya, Indonesia.
AB  - The aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of 38 children from Surabaya, Indonesia, who suffered from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) was studied using strict microbiological methodology. A total of 106 isolates (49 anaerobic and 57 aerobic) were recovered. Aerobic organisms alone were isolated from 11 (29%), anaerobic bacteria only in 4 (11%) and mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora were present in 23 (60%). The predominant organisms were Peptostreptococcus sp., Prevotella sp., Bacteroides sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Fusobacterium sp. Thirty-nine beta-lactamase-producing bacteria were recovered from 22 (58%) patients. These findings demonstrate the role of penicillin resistant aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in the polymicrobial etiology of CSOM in children from Indonesia. Judicious use of antimicrobial therapy may prevent the development of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Otitis media: microbiology and management.
AB  - Otitis media (OM) is a common childhood disease and one that can cause significant morbidity. A knowledge of the pathogens responsible for OM can assist in the selection of the most appropriate treatment regimen and can minimize complications that may require surgery. The microbiology of acute, serous, and chronic OM is reviewed. The major organisms recovered from about three quarters of acute OM and half of serous OM cultures are Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, and viruses can each be isolated in less than 5% of the patients with acute OM. The predominant organisms isolated from chronic OM are Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and anaerobic bacteria. The predominant anaerobes are gram-positive cocci, pigmented Prevotella and Porphyromonas sp, Bacteroides sp, and Fusobacterium sp. Many of the aerobic and anaerobic organisms causing OM can produce beta-lactamase, rendering them resistant to many of the penicillins. The appropriate surgical and medical therapies for acute, serous, and chronic otitis media are discussed.
TI  - Fusobacterial infections in children.
AB  - A total of 243 strains of Fusobacteria species was recovered from 226 of 1399 (16%) specimens obtained from 213 children. The strains included 65 (27%) Fusobacterium sp., 144 (59%) Fusobacterium nucleatum, 25 (10%) Fusobacterium necrophorum, five (2%) Fusobacterium varium, three (1%) Fusobacterium mortiferum, and one (0.4%) Fusobacterium gonidiaformans. Most Fusobacteria species were recovered from patients with abscesses (100), aspiration pneumonia (24), paronychia (15), bites (14), chronic sinusitis (ten), chronic otitis media (nine), and osteomyelitis (eight). Predisposing conditions were noted in 32 (15%) of the cases. These included immunodeficiency in nine (4%), steroid therapy in eight (4%), previous surgery in six (3%), diabetes in six (3%) and malignant neoplasms in five (2%). Fusobacteria sp. was the only isolate in 16 (8%) instances while mixed infections were encountered in 197 (92%) patients. The organisms most commonly isolated with Fusobacteria sp. were anaerobic cocci (155), pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. (95), Bacteroides fragilis group (80), Escherichia coli (43) and Bacteroides sp. (39). Most strains of B. fragilis group and E. coli were recovered from intra-abdominal infections and skin and soft tissue infections proximal to the rectal area. Most pigmented Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp. were recovered from oropharyngeal and pulmonary sites and from sites around the head and neck. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients; surgical drainage was performed in 85 (40%). All patients, except two who died, recovered. These findings illustrate the prevalence of Fusobacteria sp. associated with infections in children.
TI  - Piperacillin and tazobactam versus clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with pelvic infection. The Piperacillin/tazobactam Study Group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a combination of piperacillin and tazobactam with that of clindamycin and gentamicin in the treatment of hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. METHODS: This was a randomized open-label trial in hospitalized women with infections of the upper genital tract. Patients were recruited at 12 hospitals in the United States and two hospitals in Canada and were randomly assigned to one of two regimens in a 2:1 ratio. One group received piperacillin, 3 g every 6 hours, and tazobactam, 375 mg every 6 hours; the other group received clindamycin, 900 mg every 8 hours, and gentamicin, 2.5-5.0 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. Therapy with the assigned regimen was to be administered for a minimum of 3 days. Cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were obtained from the site of infection before initiation of therapy. Cultures for Chlamydia trachomatis were also obtained from patients with endometritis or pelvic inflammatory disease. Subjects were evaluated for clinical and bacteriologic response at 24-72 hours and 2-4 weeks after completing therapy. RESULTS: Two hundred ninety-nine patients were enrolled; 196 were in the piperacillin-tazobactam group and 103 were in the clindamycin-gentamicin group. The most common diagnoses were endometritis (146) and pelvic inflammatory disease (115). The most common microorganisms recovered included: Peptostreptococcus sp (99), Prevotella sp (87), black pigmented Bacteroides (29), B fragilis (11), enterococci (64), group B streptococcus (26), Escherichia coli (31), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (49), and C trachomatis (19). A favorable clinical response occurred in 84.7% (166 of 196) of piperacillin-tazobactam patients and 87.3% (90 of 103) of clindamycin-gentamicin patients. Among those evaluable for bacteriologic response, 78% (67 of 86) and 82% (23 of 28), respectively, had a favorable response. Diarrhea occurred significantly more frequently in the piperacillin-tazobactam group (9.7 versus 2.9%; P = .04), but the majority of episodes were mild to moderate. None of the adverse experiences in either treatment group were considered life-threatening and drug-related. CONCLUSION: The combination of piperacillin and tazobactam is an effective and well-tolerated antibiotic regimen for the treatment of infections of the upper genital tract in women.
TI  - The role of encapsulated anaerobic bacteria in synergistic infections.
AB  - The effect of encapsulation on the virulence, survival, and protection of anaerobic bacteria from phagocytosis is reviewed. Support for the importance of encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods (Bacteroides sp., Prevotella sp. and Porphyromonas sp.), anaerobic and facultative Gram-positive cocci (AFGPC) was provided by their higher recovery rate in oropharyngeal infections, abscesses and blood, compared to their number in the normal flora. The pathogenicity of Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, and AFGPC was studied by inoculating them into mice and observing their ability to induce subcutaneous abscesses. Encapsulated Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, and AFGPC generally induced abscesses, whereas non-encapsulated organisms did not. However, many of the strains that had only a minimal number of encapsulated organisms (< 1%) survived in the abscesses, and they became heavily encapsulated when inoculated with other viable or non-viable encapsulated bacteria. Thereafter, these strains were able to induce abscesses when injected alone. Encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods and AFGPC-induced bacteraemia and translocation, and increased the mortality of the infected animals more often than did the non-encapsulated form of the same strains. As determined by using selective antimicrobial therapy and quantitative cultures of abscesses induced in mice, possession of a capsule generally made Gram-negative anaerobic rods more important than their aerobic counterparts. Synergistic potentials were seen between encapsulated Gram-negative anaerobic rods and all tested aerobic bacteria and most AFGPC, and also between most AFGPC and Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. These studies demonstrated the importance of encapsulated anaerobes in mixed infections.
TI  - Peptostreptococcal infection in children.
AB  - 680 Peptostreptococcus sp. (Ps) were recovered from 598 (34%) of 1,750 specimens  obtained from 554 patients. They included 103 Ps asaccharolyticus, 74 Ps magnus, 56 Ps prevotii, 51 Ps micros, 46 Ps anaerobius, 11 Ps morbilorum, and 10 Ps saccharolyticus. Most infections were polymicrobial (in 553 instances or 92%) but in 45 (8%), Ps were recovered in pure culture. Most Ps were isolated from abscesses (237), ears (104), peritoneal fluid (95), lung infections (66), bone (30) and sinuses (24). Predisposing conditions were present in 224 (40%) children. These were previous surgery (54), immunodeficiency (43), malignancy (35), trauma (34), diabetes (23), prematurity (22), steroid therapy (19), foreign body (10) and sickle-cell anemia (7). The organisms most commonly isolated with Ps were Bacteroides sp. (276, including 190 B. fragilis group), Prevotella sp. (159), Fusobacterium sp. (122), Escherichia coli (114), and Staphylococcus aureus (97). Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all but 14 patients. Surgical drainage or correction of pathology was performed in 307 (56%) patients. 10 patients (2%) died of their infection. These data illustrate the importance of Ps and suggests their enhancing potentials in infection in children.
TI  - Antimicrobial action of AXOL on periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial action of AXOL was tested against a panel of periodontopathic bacteria, which included Treponema denticola, Treponema vincentii, Treponema sp., Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. The AXOL commercial solution (undiluted) was effective in inhibiting some of the bacteria but not all. The rational for the use of antimicrobials is discussed.
TI  - The management of acute, serous and chronic otitis media: the role of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Otitis media (OM) is a common childhood disease and one which can cause significant morbidity. A knowledge of the pathogens responsible for OM enables the most appropriate treatment regimen to be selected and thus minimizes further complications which may require hospital admission and surgery. The microbiology of acute, serous and chronic OM is reviewed, with particular regard to the role of anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobes, mainly Gram-positive cocci, have been recovered from 25% of the ear aspirates of patients with acute otitis media. In a study of serous OM, anaerobic bacteria were recovered in 12% of the culture-positive aspirates. The predominant anaerobes were Gram-positive cocci and pigmented Prevotella. Several studies have reported the recovery of anaerobes from about 50% of patients with chronic OM and those with cholesteatoma. The predominant anaerobes were Gram-positive cocci, pigmented Prevotella, Porphyromonas sp., Bacteroides spp. and Fusobacterium spp. Many of these organisms produce beta-lactamase which might have contributed to the failure of the patients to respond to penicillins. The appropriate antimicrobial therapy for acute, serous and chronic otitis media is discussed.
TI  - Biochemical and chemical studies on strains designated Prevotella intermedia and  proposal of a new pigmented species, Prevotella nigrescens sp. nov.
AB  - A total of 31 strains of Prevotella intermedia were subjected to DNA-DNA hybridization and were characterized by performing physiological tests and by performing a multilocus enzyme analysis, using malate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase. All of the strains assigned to P. intermedia fermented glucose and sucrose, hydrolyzed starch but not esculin, and produced indole, acetic, isobutyric, isovaleric, and succinic acids as metabolic end products. The results of DNA reassociation experiments performed with the reference probe permitted separation of the strains into two well-defined homology groups. In addition, strains with DNAs that hybridized with DNA from strain ATCC 25611T (T = type strain) had high levels of peptidase activity and cleaved lipid substrates (4-methylumbelliferyl laurate and 4-methylumbellifelyl elaidate). Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis revealed two electromorphic profiles, one characteristic of strain ATCC 25611T and the other characteristic of strain ATCC 33563T. We propose that a new species, Prevotella nigrescens, should be created for the genetically distinct group of strains that hybridized with strain ATCC 33563T. Strain ATCC 33563 is designated the type strain of P. nigrescens.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of intracranial abscesses.
AB  - The bacteriologic and clinical findings of 39 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. Twenty-three children presented with brain abscess and 16 with subdural empyema. Predisposing conditions were present in all instances. Sinusitis was present in 25 children and 4 patients each had chronic otitis media, dental abscess, and congenital heart disease. The abscess was located in the frontal area in 14 patients, parietal in 13, and temporal in 12. Anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 22 patients (56%), aerobic bacteria alone in 7 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 10 (26%) patients. There were 79 anaerobic isolates (2 per specimen). The predominant anaerobes were anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (29 isolates); Bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 Bacteroides fragilis group), Fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and Prevotella sp. and Actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). A total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 Gram-positive cocci and 6 Haemophilus sp., were recovered. Antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. Nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. These findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.
TI  - Pathogenicity of capsulate and non-capsulate members of Bacteroides fragilis and  B. melaninogenicus groups in mixed infection with Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  - The relationships between capsulate and non-capsulate Bacteroides fragilis strains and Escherichia coli, and between capsulate and non-capsulate strains of the B. melaninogenicus group and Streptococcus pyogenes, were studied in a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. Selective antimicrobial agents directed against either aerobic or anaerobic bacteria were used alone or in combination to explore the effect of eradication of one component of the mixed infection. Single agent therapy effective against both aerobic and anaerobic flora was also employed. Single therapy of mixed infection directed at the elimination of only one organism (S. pyogenes, E. coli or Bacteroides sp.) caused significant reductions in the numbers of sensitive organisms and also smaller yet significant decreases in the numbers of insensitive organisms. However, the abscesses were not eliminated after such therapy. Combination therapy or use of a single agent (cefoxitin) directed against the aerobic and anaerobic components of the infection was more effective. Non-capsulate Bacteroides spp. became capsulate after passage in mice mixed with either S. pyogenes or E. coli. Therapy directed at the elimination of S. pyogenes and E. coli did not prevent the emergence of capsulate Bacteroides spp. These data demonstrate the synergy between all members of the B. fragilis group and E. coli and between the B. melaninogenicus group and S. pyogenes, and reiterate the need to direct antimicrobial therapy at the eradication of the aerobic and anaerobic components of mixed infections.
TI  - Experimentally induced subcutaneous infection by black pigmented Bacteroides species in rats.
AB  - In a rat model of anaerobic subcutaneous abscess developed to study the pathogenicity of pure cultures of black pigmented Bacteroides sp. (Bacteroides melaninogenicus and Bacteroides intermedius) maximum lesions were seen between 7 and 15 days after inoculation. Abscesses were produced by one type strain each of B. melaninogenicus and B. intermedius and by 20 of 25 clinical isolates of black pigmented Bacteroides species.
TI  - Pathogenicity of encapsulated Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis in abscesses in mice.
AB  - The pathogenicity of 27 clinical isolates of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus (BM) group and four clinical isolates of B. oralis and B. ruminicola subsp. brevis were investigated by inoculating them into mice and subsequently determining their ability to cause subcutaneous (SC) or intraperitoneal abscesses. Only 11 isolates of BM group and one B. ruminicola induced abscesses in mice, and all were found to be heavily encapsulated on recovery from the abscesses (more than 50 per cent of the organisms were encapsulated). When the other 23 isolates, however, were injected SC in combination with either Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, abscesses were formed in 16 of the 23 combinations. The Bacteroides spp. recovered from the mixed infection were heavily encapsulated. Capsules also formed in Bacteroides if the organisms were injected together with capsular material or formalin killed cells of K. pneumoniae or encapsulated Bacteroides sp. Once non-encapsulated or only slightly encapsulated strains acquired a capsule, they could induce abscesses on reinoculation into mice.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of peritonsillar abscess in children.
AB  - Aspiration of peritonsillar abscess (quinsy) was aseptically performed in 16 children. Patients' median age was 10 years (range 6 to 17 years), and 12 were males. Unilateral abscess was present in all but one child. All aspirates were cultured for aerobes and anaerobes and yielded bacterial growth in all patients. Anaerobes were isolated in all patients; in 3 patients (19%), they were the only organism isolated, and in 13 (81%), they were mixed with aerobes. There were 91 anaerobic isolates (5.7 per specimen): 42 Bacteroides sp. (including 23 B. melaninogenicus, 5 B. oralis and 4 B. ruminicola ss. brevis); 18 anaerobic Gram-positive cocci (including 10 Peptostreptococcus sp., 4 Peptococcus sp. and 4 microaerophilic streptococci); 15 Fusobacterium sp.; and 3 Clostridium sp. There were 32 aerobic isolates (2.0 per specimen): 11 gamma-hemolytic streptococci, 8 alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci, 4 Haemophilus sp. and 3 S. aureus. Beta-lactamase production was noted in 13 isolates recovered from 11 patients (68%). These were all isolates of S. aureus (3), 8 of 23 B. melaninogenicus (35%), and 2 of 5 B. oralis (40%). Our findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of peritonsillar abscesses in children, and demonstrate the presence of many beta-lactamase-producing organisms in two thirds of the patients.
TI  - Production of phenylacetic acid by strains of Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Bacteroides gingivalis (sp. nov.).
AB  - Strains of Bacteroides asaccharolyticus and Bacteroides melaninogenicus subspecies isolated from human and animal sources were examined for the production of phenylacetic acid. B. asaccharolyticus strains isolated from sites in humans and monkeys always produced phenylacetic acid. B. asaccharolyticus strains isolated from human nonoral sites consistently failed to produce this product. This metabolic difference correlates with the genetic dichotomy recently found to exist between oral and nonoral B. asaccharolyticus strains.
TI  - [Phlegmon of the fore arm succeeding to a dog-bite : respective role of the miscellaneous bacteria involved in this mixed infection (author's transl)].
AB  - The authors report a case of a severe mixed infection (phlegmon of the fore arm)  succeeding to a dog bite. A complex flora has been isolated from this phlegmom : Pasteurella multocida, Pasteurella pneumotropica, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces sp., Bacteroides melaninogenicus, and a Gram- bacteria related to group II j. The pathogeny of such diseases is discussed, dwelling in one hand on the part of synergistic development of these various germs and in the other hand on the part played by saliva in the severity of animal or human bites. This kind of wound requires careful disinfection and radical debridment without omitting a preventive broad-spectrum antibiotherapy.
TI  - Anaerobic isolates in chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. Treatment with  carbenicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin.
AB  - Tympanocentesis was performed in 32 pediatric patients with chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media. The aspirate was cultured aerobically and anaerobically. Aerobes were isolated from ten patients (31.2%); anaerobes from one patient; and both aerobes and anaerobes from 21 patients (65.6%). There were 46 aerobic isolates. The aerobes commonly recovered were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 isolates) Proteus sp. (5) and Staphylococcus aureus (3). There were 32 anaerobes isolated including anaerobic gram-positive cocci (19 isolates) and Bacteroides sp., the latter of which included Bacteroides fragilis group and Bacteroides melaninogenicus (9). The patients were treated by parenteral carbenicillin 300 to 400 mg per kg per day given in four dosages administered for a period of 12 to 21 days (average 17 days). An aminoglycoside (gentamicin) was added in 15 patients. The clinical response was good in 17 patients and poor in 15. There were no side effects or adverse reactions noted during therapy. The above findings demonstrate the polymicrobial etiology of chronic recurrent suppurative otitis media and suggest that treatment directed against the aerobic and anaerobic isolates is efficacious in more than half of the cases.
