TI  == validation of sterility testing of cord blood: challenges and results.
AB  == background: sterility testing for cord blood (cb) products is mandatory to prevent transplantation-transmitted microbial infections. here, the automated bact/alert (biomerieux) culture system was validated to detect microbial contamination in cb units processed at the canadian national public cord blood bank. study design and methods: a three-phase validation was developed. cb units  were prepared with pentastarch (phases 1 and 2) or hetastarch (phase 3). in phase 1, cb was spiked with approximately 100 colony-forming units/ml of pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacteroides fragilis, and candida albicans. plasma (8 ml) and buffy  coat (bc; 0.5 and 8 ml) were inoculated into culture bottles. in phases 2 and 3,  a mix of red blood cells (rbcs) and plasma (4 ml each) was used as the inoculant. in phase 3, aspergillus brasiliensis was added as a test organism and microbial concentrations in the by-product rbcs and plasma were determined. the bc fractions were cryopreserved and tested 3 months later. results: in phase 1, bacteria failed to grow in cb units containing antibiotics. thus, antibiotic-free units were used for the other phases. c. albicans was not always captured in plasma, but using a mix of rbcs and plasma, all organisms were detected. the use  of pentastarch or hetastarch did not affect microbial recovery. c. albicans and a. brasiliensis were preferentially recovered in rbcs and bc. cryopreservation did not affect microbial survival during cb processing. conclusions: a mix of plasma and rbcs is appropriate for cb sterility testing. interestingly, fungi preferentially segregate to cellular fractions. the clinical significance of the  bactericidal /or bacteriostatic effect of antibiotics in cb merits further investigation.

TI  == microbiology of pelvic lymphocyst infection after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors.
AB  == background: pelvic lymphocyst infection is a rare complication after lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors. although medical therapy is a useful addition to surgical drainage, the appropriate antibiotic regimen is unknown because few studies have examined the causative organisms. the purpose of this case series was to identify the micro-organisms infecting pelvic lymphocysts. methods: this was a single-center, retrospective, case-series review conducted at a tertiary-care cancer center between october 2002 and march 2013. the participants included all patients who experienced their first pelvic lymphocyst infection after undergoing pelvic lymphadenectomy for cervical, endometrial, or ovarian cancer and exhibited positive lymphocyst fluid culture. computed tomography- or sonography-guided percutaneous aspiration procedures were performed to obtain lymphocyst fluid for culture. results: during the study period, 878 patients underwent lymphadenectomy for gynecologic malignant tumors,  and 13 developed a pelvic lymphocyst infection documented microbiologically. cultures identified staphylococcus aureus (three patients), s. epidermidis (one patient), streptococcus agalactiae (three patients), enterococcus (two patients), escherichia coli (one patient), and anaerobic bacteria (three patients). they were all monomicrobial infections. conclusions: our study and other smaller ones  suggest that lymphocyst infections following pelvic lymphadenectomy for malignant gynecologic tumors usually are monomicrobial and caused by gram-positive cocci, including staphylococcus, streptococcus, and enterococcus, and anaerobes such as  bacteroides fragilis. these bacteria should be considered when selecting empiric  antibiotic therapy.

TI  == microbes in the neonatal intensive care unit resemble those found in the gut of premature infants.
AB  == background: the source inoculum of gastrointestinal tract (git) microbes is largely influenced by delivery mode in full-term infants, but these influences may be decoupled in very low birth weight (vlbw, <1,500 g) neonates via conventional broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. we hypothesize the built environment (be), specifically room surfaces frequently touched by humans, is a predominant source of colonizing microbes in the gut of premature vlbw infants. here, we present the first matched fecal-be time series analysis of two preterm vlbw neonates housed in a neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) over the first month of life. results: fresh fecal samples were collected every 3 days and metagenomes sequenced on an illumina hiseq2000 device. for each fecal sample, approximately 33 swabs were collected from each nicu room from 6 specified areas: sink, feeding and intubation tubing, hands of healthcare providers and parents, general surfaces, and nurse station electronics (keyboard, mouse, and cell phone). swabs were processed using a recently developed 'expectation maximization iterative reconstruction of genes from the environment' (emirge) amplicon pipeline in which full-length 16s rrna amplicons were sheared and sequenced using an illumina platform, and short reads reassembled into full-length genes. over 24,000 full-length 16s rrna sequences were produced, generating an average of approximately 12,000 operational taxonomic units (otus) (clustered at 97% nucleotide identity) per room-infant pair. dominant gut taxa, including staphylococcus epidermidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli, were widely distributed throughout the room environment with many gut colonizers detected in more than half of samples. reconstructed genomes  from infant gut colonizers revealed a suite of genes that confer resistance to antibiotics (for example, tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycoside) and  sterilizing agents, which likely offer a competitive advantage in the nicu environment. conclusions: we have developed a high-throughput culture-independent approach that integrates room surveys based on full-length 16s rrna gene sequences with metagenomic analysis of fecal samples collected from infants in the room. the approach enabled identification of discrete icu reservoirs of microbes that also colonized the infant gut and provided evidence for the presence of certain organisms in the room prior to their detection in the gut.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from ankober district, north shewa zone, amhara region, ethiopia.
AB  == context: traditional medicinal plants have long been used in ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still  poorly known. objective: to investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in ankober district. methods: about 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against bacillus cereus, bacteroides fragilis, candida albicans, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus pyogenes. results: plant extracts from embelia schimperi vatke (myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a  minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) value of 64 microg/ml against b. cereus, l. monocytogenes, and s. pyogenes. growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of ocimum lamiifolium hochst. (lamiaceae) against s. pyogenes, and those of rubus steudneri schweinf. (rosaceae) against s. epidermidis at an mic value of 128 microg/ml. generally, 74% of ethanol extracts  (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial  strains tested at an mic value of 512 microg/ml or below. discussion and conclusions: results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed  strong antimicrobial activities.

TI  == sterility testing of apheresis hematopoietic progenitor cell products using an automated blood culture system.
AB  == background: aabb standards require monitoring of hematopoietic progenitor cell (hpc) products for microbial contamination. to date, there is no automated blood  culture system cleared by the food and drug administration for this application.  our objective was to validate the versatrek system (trek diagnostic systems) for  sterility testing of apheresis hpc products. study design and methods: four aerobic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mitis, and bacillus cereus), five anaerobic bacteria (fusobacterium necrophorum, clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella loescheii, and propionibacterium acnes), and one fungus (candida albicans) were spiked into  apheresis hpc products at concentrations of 10, 10(2) , 10(3) , and 10(4) colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. aerobic and anaerobic bottles were incubated until positive or for up to 5 days. dna was simultaneously extracted for polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. results: all aerobic bacteria grew in both bottles at all concentrations tested within 24 hours, and the time to positivity (ttp) was significantly shorter with  aerobic bottles. c. albicans grew in the aerobic media at all concentrations within 30 hours. anaerobes grew in the anaerobic bottle at all concentrations within 5 days. no bacteria were detected by using 16s rrna gene amplification at  10(4) cfus/ml. conclusion: compared to culture, 16s rrna gene amplification of hpcs does not improve sensitivity or turnaround time for hpc sterility testing. the versatrek system is a reliable tool for detecting microbial contamination of  apheresis hpc products with a limit of detection of less than or equal to 10 cfus/ml. inclusion of both the aerobic and the anaerobic culture bottles achieves the shortest ttp for all species tested.

TI  == microbiology of explanted suture segments from infected and noninfected surgical  patients.
AB  == sutures under selective host/environmental factors can potentiate postoperative surgical site infection (ssi). the present investigation characterized microbial  recovery and biofilm formation from explanted absorbable (ab) and nonabsorbable (nab) sutures from infected and noninfected sites. ab and nab sutures were harvested from noninfected (70.9%) and infected (29.1%) sites in 158 patients. at explantation, devices were sonicated and processed for qualitative/quantitative bacteriology; selective sutures were processed for scanning electron microscopy (sem). bacteria were recovered from 85 (53.8%) explanted sites; 39 sites were noninfected, and 46 were infected. suture recovery ranged from 11.1 to 574.6 days postinsertion. a significant difference in mean microbial recovery between noninfected (1.2 isolates) and infected (2.7 isolates) devices (p < 0.05) was noted. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis, escherichia coli, enterococcus spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia spp. were recovered from infected devices, while commensal skin flora was recovered from noninfected  devices. no significant difference in quantitative microbial recovery between infected monofilament and multifilament sutures was noted. biofilm was present in 100% and 66.6% of infected and noninfected devices, respectively (p < 0.042). we  conclude that both monofilament and braided sutures provide a hospitable surface  for microbial adherence: (i) a significant difference in microbial recovery from  infected and noninfected sutures was noted, (ii) infected sutures harbored a mixed flora, including multidrug-resistant health care-associated pathogens, and  (iii) a significant difference in the presence or absence of a biofilm in infected versus noninfected explanted devices was noted. further studies to document the benefit of focused risk reduction strategies to minimize suture contamination and biofilm formation postimplantation are warranted.

TI  == proteolytic activity by multiple bacterial species isolated from chronic venous leg ulcers degrades matrix substrates.
AB  == background: a major feature of chronic wounds is the loss of tissue, with the exposure of dermal components preventing primary closure and leading to bacterial colonization. bacterial colonization has been proposed as one of the common underlying pathologies present in chronic wounds. the objective of this exploratory study was to identify bacteria cultured from chronic venous leg ulcers and test for proteolytic activity that degrades matrix substrates. method: bacteria were isolated, cultured, and identified from six subjects (average age = 62.8 years) over 2-10 months under an approved protocol using swabs and microbiological culture media. proteolytic activity against (a) gelatin, (b) an elastin substrate, and (c) a serine/trypsin-sensitive substrate was determined using a colorimetric plate assay with an elisa plate reader and zymography. results: we identified 13 bacteria that expressed proteolytic activity against one or more of the tested substrates. of these, six were gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium, and streptococcus bovis) and seven were gram-negative (pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis,  morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacteroides fragilis, and serratia marcescens) organisms. two of these, s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, are recognized  wound pathogens. conclusions: multiple bacteria species isolated from colonized venous leg ulcers have the capacity to secrete proteases capable of degrading components of the extracellular matrix important for wound healing. matrix degradation by bacteria may contribute to delays in tissue deposition and repair, suggesting that treatment of chronic wounds should include appropriate management of colonizing bacteria.

TI  == [antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  == the activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187  strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. the  ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. vancomycin (vcm), linezolid (lzd) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (qpr/dpr) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, with mic90s of < or = 2 microg/ml. the ratio of penicillin (pc) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of pc-binding proteins among streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. cefpirome, carbapenems, vcm, teicoplanin (teic), lzd and qpr/dpr had mic90s of <  or = 1 microg/ml against pc-intermediate and resistant s. pneumoniae strains. against all strains of enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium, the mics of vcm and teic were under 2 microg/ml, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of e. faecalis strains and 1.2% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate to lzd. 17.1% of e. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to qpr/dpr.  against all strains of clostridium difficile, the mic of vcm was under 1 microg/ml, suggesting that vcm had excellent activity. carbapenems showed good activity against clostridiales, bacteroides spp., and prevotella spp., but one strain of bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. and so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting  continuously.

TI  == evaluation of the sterility testing process of hematopoietic stem cells at canadian blood services.
AB  == background: sterility testing of hematopoietic stem cells (hscs) at the canadian  blood services stem cell laboratory is performed using bact/alert aerobic (sa) culture bottles. this study was conducted to verify the efficacy of this method and to assess the use of the bact/alert aerobic (bpa) and anaerobic (bpn) culture bottles for microbial testing of hscs. study design and methods: hsc products, including cryopreserved apheresis peripheral blood, marrow, and cord blood and fresh cord blood, were spiked with four aerobic organisms including staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida  albicans, and the anaerobe bacteroides fragilis at a target concentration of 100  colony-forming units (cfus)/ml. one to 2 ml of pre- and postspiked samples was inoculated into sa, bpa, and bpn bottles in duplicate and incubated for 5 to 10 days. the presence of the testing organisms in positive culture bottles was confirmed by plating on blood agar. results: the bact/alert system detected the aerobic organisms in all hscs in sa and bpa bottles within 34.1 hours while b. fragilis was detected only in bpn bottles within 68.6 hours. the mean recovered concentration of microorganisms in the hsc products ranged from 55 to 352 cfus/ml with the exception of b. cereus, which was greater than 10(3) cfus/ml. conclusion: this study shows that the current sterility testing process at the canadian blood services stem cell laboratory detected the tested aerobic but not  the anaerobic microbial contaminants in hscs. the ability of the bact/alert system using bpa and bpn bottles to detect bacterial contamination in hscs was also demonstrated.

TI  == ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (csssi), including those caused by meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), and community-acquired pneumonia (cap). ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (pbp)2a, an mrsa-specific pbp that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. the high binding affinity of  ceftaroline to pbp2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/ml) correlates  well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for mrsa. ceftaroline is active in vitro against gram-positive cocci, including mrsa, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (not e. faecium). the broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or ampc-derepressed enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli. ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug)  is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. for multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/ml and 21.0 microg/ml for first and  last dose, respectively. ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 l/kg (28.3 l), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. no drug  accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through  renal excretion (49.6%). based on monte carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 ml/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. a phase ii study randomized 100 patients with csssi to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. in a phase iii trial, 702 patients with csssi were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating csssi caused by both gram-positive and -negative pathogens. adverse event rates were similar between groups. ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is  consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. in summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for csssi and cap, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == infection after elective colorectal surgery: bacteriological analysis of failures in a randomized trial of cefotetan vs. ertapenem prophylaxis.
AB  == background: a randomized study comparing single-dose cefotetan and ertapenem prophylaxis for elective colorectal surgery in 1,002 patients found ertapenem to  be significantly more effective (p < 0.001). failures of prophylaxis were thought to involve organisms resistant to both antimicrobial agents, isolated most often  from deep or superficial incision sites. methods: further testing and analysis of the microbial data was performed. susceptibility results were correlated with the clinical outcomes reported previously. results: of the 216 aerobes tested, 62.6%  were resistant to cefotetan and 44% to ertapenem. enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were the aerobes recovered most  frequently, and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, clostridium innocuum, and eubacterium lentum were the most frequent anaerobes. enterococcus faecalis usually was associated in mixed culture with bacteroides fragilis group species.  approximately one-half of the 158 anaerobes (50.7%), including all the species above, were resistant to cefotetan; most of these (61.4%) came from superficial incision sites. only one anaerobe (desulfovibrio fairfieldensis), found in a superficial incisional infection, was resistant to ertapenem, and no ertapenem-resistant enteric bacteria were recovered. in vitro resistance was associated with therapeutic failure. conclusions: the in vitro activity of ertapenem was superior to that of cefotetan against all anaerobic and many aerobic bacteria isolated from postoperative cultures of patients who failed prophylaxis with these agents. our findings help to elucidate the results of the  clinical trial.

TI  == ceftobiprole: a review of a broad-spectrum and anti-mrsa cephalosporin.
AB  == ceftobiprole, an investigational cephalosporin, is currently in phase iii clinical development. ceftobiprole is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with demonstrated in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci, including meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and meticillin-resistant s. epidermidis, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, gram-negative bacilli including ampc-producing escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but excluding extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. like cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime, ceftobiprole demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as bacteroides fragilis and  non-fragilis bacteroides spp. in single-step and serial passage in vitro resistance development studies, ceftobiprole demonstrated a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is a weak inducer and a poor substrate for ampc beta-lactamases.ceftobiprole medocaril, the prodrug of ceftobiprole, is converted by plasma esterases to ceftobiprole in <30  minutes. peak serum concentrations of ceftobiprole observed at the end of a single 30-minute infusion were 35.5 mug/ml for a 500-mg dose and 59.6 mug/ml for  a 750-mg dose. the volume of distribution of ceftobiprole is 0.26 l/kg ( approximately 18 l), protein binding is 16%, and its serum half-life is approximately 3.5 hours. ceftobiprole is renally excreted ( approximately 70% in  the active form) and systemic clearance correlates with creatinine clearance, meaning that dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal dysfunction. ceftobiprole has a modest post-antibiotic effect (pae) of approximately 0.5 hours for mrsa and a longer pae of approximately 2 hours for penicillin-resistant pneumococci. ceftobiprole, when administered intravenously at 500 mg once every 8 hours (2-hour infusion), has a >90% probability of achieving f t(>mic) (free drug concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic]) for 40% and 60%, respectively, of the dosing interval for isolates with ceftobiprole mic < or =4 and < or =2 mg/l, respectively.currently, only limited clinical trial data are published for ceftobiprole. in a phase iii trial, 784 patients with gram-positive skin infections were randomized to treatment with either ceftobiprole 500 mg or vancomycin 1 g, each administered twice daily for 7-14 days; 93.3% of patients were clinically cured with ceftobiprole compared with 93.5% receiving vancomycin, and the eradication rate for mrsa infections was 91.8% for ceftobiprole compared  with 90% for vancomycin. a phase iii, randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial compared ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours with vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours plus ceftazidime 1 g every 8 hours in patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections. of the 828 patients enrolled, 31% had diabetic foot infections, 30% had abscesses, and 22% had wounds. no difference in clinical cure was reported in the clinically evaluable, intent-to-treat and microbiologically evaluable populations with cure rates of 90.5%, 81.9%, and 90.8%, respectively, in the ceftobiprole-treated patients and 90.2%, 80.8%, and 90.5%, respectively, in the vancomycin plus ceftazidime-treated group. microbiologic eradication of gram-positive cocci meticillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) [ceftobiprole 91% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%] and mrsa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 80%), as well as gram-negative bacilli, e. coli (ceftobiprole 89% vs  vancomycin plus ceftazidime 92%), and p. aeruginosa (ceftobiprole 87% vs vancomycin plus ceftazidime 100%), was not significantly different between groups. similar cures rates in the microbiologically evaluable population occurred in both groups for panton-valentine leukocidin (pvl)-positive mssa and pvl-positive mrsa.currently, ceftobiprole has completed phase iii trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections due to mrsa and nosocomial pneumonia due to suspected or proven mrsa; phase iii trials are also ongoing in community-acquired pneumonia. ceftobiprole has so far demonstrated a good safety  profile in preliminary studies with similar tolerability to comparators. the broad-spectrum activity of ceftobiprole may allow it to be used as monotherapy in situations where a combination of antibacterials might be required. further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftobiprole  and to define its role in patient care.

TI  == bacteriology of moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections and in vitro activity of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == as part of a united states-based multicenter clinical trial, conducted from 2001  to 2004, that compared ertapenem to piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of  moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections (dfis), we obtained 454 pretreatment  specimens from 433 patients. after debridement, the investigators collected wound specimens, mostly by curettage or biopsy, and sent them to the r. m. alden research laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture. among the 427 positive cultures, 83.8% were polymicrobial, 48% grew only aerobes, 43.7% had both aerobes and anaerobes, and 1.3% had only anaerobes. cultures yielded a total of 1,145 aerobic strains and 462 anaerobic strains, with an average of 2.7 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 8) for aerobes and 2.3 organisms per culture (range, 1 to 9) for anaerobes. the predominant aerobic organisms were oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (14.3%), oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (4.4%),  coagulase-negative staphylococcus species (15.3%), streptococcus species (15.5%), enterococcus species (13.5%), corynebacterium species (10.1%), members of the family enterobacteriaceae (12.8%), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (3.5%). the predominant anaerobes were gram-positive cocci (45.2%), prevotella species (13.6%), porphyromonas species (11.3%), and the bacteroides fragilis group (10.2%). pure cultures were noted for 20% of oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus cultures, 9.2% of staphylococcus epidermidis cultures, and 2.5% of p. aeruginosa cultures. two or more species of staphylococcus were present in 13.1%  of the patients. ertapenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were each active against >98% of the enteric gram-negative rods, methicillin-sensitive s. aureus, and anaerobes. among the fluoroquinolones, 24% of anaerobes, especially the gram-positive cocci, were resistant to moxifloxacin; 27% of the gram-positive aerobes but only 6% of the members of the family enterobacteriaceae were resistant to levofloxacin. moderate-to-severe dfis are typically polymicrobial, and almost half include anaerobes. our antibiotic susceptibility results can help to inform therapeutic choices.

TI  == infections related to coils used for embolization of arteries: review of the published evidence.
AB  == the embolization of arteries with the use of coils has been an advance in the management of patients such as those at risk for aneurysm rupture. however, this  procedure is not without complications. a systematic review was undertaken to evaluate the available evidence regarding infectious complications directly related to endovascular coil embolization. seven case reports of patients who experienced infection related to coils used for embolization of arteries were discovered. arteries embolized with coils in these patients were intracranial, intraabdominal, and intrathoracic, respectively, in four, two, and one case. abscess formation in the area of coil placement (n = 6; 85.7%) was the most common infectious complication directly related to endovascular coil embolization. staphylococcus aureus was the predominant isolated pathogen (n = 3; 42.9%). other isolated pathogens included salmonella species type d (n = 1; 14.3%), s. epidermidis (n = 1; 14.3%), escherichia coli (n = 1; 14.3%), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 1; 14.3%). surgical procedures were performed in four of the seven patients described (57.1%), and three patients were treated with only the administration of antimicrobial agents. all reviewed patients were cured. even though it may partially be a result of reporting bias, the scarcity of reports describing infections directly related to endovascular coils despite the increasing number of patients who received this treatment in various parts of the world suggests that infectious complications associated with this foreign endovascular material are very rare. however, the existence of the identified case reports suggests that clinicians should include coil-related infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever after this procedure.

TI  == multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16s rrna gene pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  == an in vitro study of antimicrobial activity and efficacy of iodine-generating hydrogel dressings.
AB  == objective: to determine the antimicrobial activity and efficacy of different formulations of novel bioxygenating hydrogel dressings (which deliver both iodine and oxygen into the wound) against various target organisms by means of an in vitro test system that more effectively mimics the conditions encountered when dressings are in contact with wounds. method: three bioxygenating hydrogels were  tested: oxyzyme, which releases low levels of iodine into the wound, and iodozyme 402 and iodozyme 401, which release higher levels of iodine, with iodozyme 402 releasing twice the amount of 401. cellulose filter disks (n = 32) were inoculated with indicator species and placed equidistant from each other as a matrix onto agar test beds. cut squares of control or test dressings were placed  on top of each disk. kill curves were constructed from determinations of the numbers of survivors (log cfu per disk) over time by removing disk samples at various time points. results: significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the controls and test samples. the order of sensitivity for oxyzyme was fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the order of efficacy of the three hydrogel dressings (iodozyme 402, followed by iodozyme 401 and then oxyzyme) was  the same regardless of the target species. conclusion: the novel hydrogel skin surface wound dressings are broad-spectrum in activity, encompassing antibiotic-resistant organisms, anaerobes and yeasts; their antimicrobial function appears to be rapidly effective.

TI  == metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-af), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ab), and benzidine (bz). the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, klebsiella pneumoniae,  and intestinal anaerobes, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain salmonella typhimurium ta98 in the ames salmonella mutagenicity assay. in addition, the cell-free extracts of pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome p450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (co) difference spectrum. this was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-af, 4-ab, and bz into mutagens. the metabolic activation by pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis, and eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome p450 enzyme. for those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a p450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2003].
AB  == for the post-marketing surveillance of cefmetazole (cmz, cefmetazon), mics of injectable beta-lactam antibacterials including cmz against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan are measured yearly and the incidence rates of resistance in various species are also evaluated. in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 574 isolates of 13 species were tested, 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002, and 654 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the third surveillance from april 2002 to march 2003. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in these surveillances spanning three years. the activity of cmz in this study was comparable to that in the studies conducted before cefmetazon was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 microg/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mssa, 0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 72.9% --> 87.2% --> 88.7%), staphylococcus epidermidis (18.5% --> 31.6% --> 14.3%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (cns, 13.3% --> 18.2% --> 21.4%), escherichia coli (3.6% -->  0.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3.4% --> 3.8% --> 2.1%), klebsiella oxytoca (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), proteus mirabilis (2.3% --> 2.1% --> 0.0%), proteus vulgaris (13.6% --> 6.7% --> 0.0%), morganella morganii (7.3% --> 0.0% --> 14.0%), providencia spp. (12.5% --> 0.0% --> 18.2%), peptostreptococcus spp.  (0.0% --> 0.0% --> 0.0%), bacteroides fragilis (10.3% --> 10.8% --> 17.1%), bacteroides spp. (78.6% --> 87.5% --> 62.5%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, other cns, and b. flagiris tended to increase. it is necessary to pay much  attention to trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and  superior to that sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that of fmox. against b. flagiris and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of sbt/cpz and fmox.

TI  == inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == aims: to examine the in vitro influence of various bacteria species on helicobacter pylori (hp) growth. methods and results: the effects of 29 micro-organisms on 31 hp strains were determined using two modified 'cross streak' methods. staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, morganella morganii, serratia marcescens, bacteroides fragilis, fusobacterium nucleatum and clostridium difficile showed the strongest inhibition. the inhibitory effects varied, depending on the bacteria spp. and hp strains, and were method dependent. the caga status of hp strains did not correlate with the extent of inhibition. conclusions: helicobacter pylori is inhibited by a significant number of commensal bacteria species as well as opportunistic human pathogens. the success  and progress of hp infection may be influenced by the bacterial flora present, while the difficulty in cultivating hp from the oral mucosa and faeces may be the result of antagonistic bacterial interaction. significance and impact of the study: this study provides valuable data on the sensitivity of hp to a variety of intestinal and oral commensals as well as opportunistic human pathogens. hp's varying pathogenicity and the specific localization of infection may be the result of these sensitivities. these results can also serve as a basis for further studies to identify the inhibitory substances and make them available for therapeutic use.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of neonatal sepsis by 16srrna genes pcr amplification and genechip hybridization].
AB  == objective: to explore a method for rapid diagnosis of sepsis in newborn infants.  methods: (1) the primers and oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized based on the sequences of bacterial 16srrna gene. the gene chip was prepared through the probes printed onto special glass slides. the gene chip included 18 special probes: universal probe 1, universal probe 2, gram positive bacterial probe, gram negative bacterial probe 1, gram negative bacterial probe 2, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) 1, cons 2, escherichia coli, hemophilus influenzae, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus agalactiae, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus, meningococcus, corynebacterium, propionibacterium; (2) blood specimens from 285 cases of suspected septicemia were cultured and bacterial 16s rrna gene was detected separately; dna isolated from blood specimens and cerebrospinal fluid was amplified by pcr, and pcr products were hybridized with the probes on the gene chips. hybridization results were scanned and read by laser-scanner. results: (1) of the 285 cases, 17 were positive by pcr and the positive rate (5.96%) was significantly higher than that of blood culture (2.81%) (p < 0.01). when blood culture was taken as control, the sensitivity of pcr was 100% and specificity was 96.75%, the index of accurate diagnosis was 0.968. (2) the 17 specimens which showed positive results by pcr were further hybridized on the gene chip. all were positive by universal probes. among all of them, 5 were positive by e. coli probe; 4 were positive by staphylococcus epidermidis; two were positive by bacillus and propionibacterium probes, separately; 4 were positive by cons. the 8 specimens which showed positive results by both pcr and blood culture, the result of gene chip hybridization coincided with the result of blood culture. conclusion: detection of the bacterial 16srrna genes in clinical specimens by gene chip hybridization technology can diagnose neonatal septicemia  rapidly. this method has higher sensitivity and specificity than blood culture or other methods and can provide a rapid way for the etiological diagnosis of neonatal septicemia. therefore the genechip method may be valuable and practical  in early diagnosis of neonatal septicemia.

TI  == [surveillance of susceptibility of clinical isolates to cefmetazole between 2000  and 2002].
AB  == the antibacterial activity of cefmetazole (cmz) against clinical isolates from 15 medical institutions all over japan was evaluated yearly for two years from june  2000 to march 2002 and compared with that of other parenteral beta-lactams, cefazolin (cez), cefotiam (ctm), sulbactam/cefoperazone (sbt/cpz), and flomoxef (fmox). in the first surveillance from june 2000 to march 2001, 575 isolates of 13 species were tested, and 548 isolates of the same 13 species were tested in the second surveillance from april 2001 to march 2002. in these surveillances spanning two years, the mic90s of cmz against the bacterial species tested hardly differed. changes in percent resistance of each species to cmz (mic of cmz > or = 32 micrograms/ml) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus  (mssa, 0%-->0%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa, 73%-->87%), staphylococcus epidermidis (19%-->32%), other coagulase-negative staphylococcus spp. (other cns, 13%-->18%), escherichia coli (4%-->1%), klebsiella pneumoniae (3%-->4%), klebsiella oxytoca (0%-->0%), proteus mirabilis (2%-->2%), proteus vulgaris (14%-->7%), morganella morganii (7%-->0%), providencia spp. (17%-->0%),  peptostreptococcus spp. (0%-->0%), bacteroides fragilis (10%-->11%), and other bacteroides spp. (79%-->88%). the change in percent resistance of mrsa, s. epidermidis, other cns, and other bacteroides spp. tended to increase. in addition, the percent resistance of b. fragilis was 10%. it is necessary to pay much attention to the trends observed in these species. compared to other drugs tested, against mssa, the activity of cmz was inferior to that of cez, ctm, and fmox and superior to that of sbt/cpz. against mrsa, s. epidermidis, and cns, the  tested drugs exhibited little activity. against gram-negative bacteria, the activity of cmz was almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and inferior to that  of fmox. against b. fragilis and other bacteroides spp., the activity of cmz was  almost superior to that of cez and ctm, and comparable to or inferior to that of  sbt/cpz and fmox. no remarkable changes in the activity of cmz were observed in this study compared with studies conducted before cmz was launched. this result suggests that cmz still maintains potent activity.

TI  == role of commensal bacteria in development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues and  preimmune antibody repertoire.
AB  == intestinal bacteria are required for development of gut-associated lymphoid tissues (galt), which mediate a variety of host immune functions, such as mucosal immunity and oral tolerance. in rabbits, the intestinal microflora are also required for developing the preimmune ab repertoire by promoting somatic diversification of ig genes in b cells that have migrated to galt. we studied the mechanism of bacteria-induced galt development. bacteria were introduced into rabbits in which the appendix had been rendered germfree by microsurgery (we refer to these rabbits as germfree-appendix rabbits). we then identified specific members of the intestinal flora that promote galt development. the combination of bacteroides fragilis and bacillus subtilis consistently promoted galt development and led to development of the preimmune ab repertoire, as shown by an increase in somatic diversification of vdj-c micro genes in appendix b cells. neither species alone consistently induced galt development, nor did clostridium subterminale, escherichia coli, or staphylococcus epidermidis. b. fragilis, which by itself is  immunogenic, did not promote galt development; hence, galt development in rabbits does not appear to be the result of an ag-specific immune response. to identify bacterial pathways required for galt development, we introduced b. fragilis along with stress-response mutants of b. subtilis into germfree-appendix rabbits. we identified two spo0a-controlled stress responses, sporulation and secretion of the protein yqxm, which are required for galt development. we conclude that specific members of the commensal, intestinal flora drive galt development through a specific subset of stress responses.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the c-2 side chain. in agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse) with a mic(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. furthermore, sm-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against mrsa, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the mic. sm-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of mrsa in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. the mics of sm-197436, sm-232721, and sm-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and  penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. these drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against enterococcus faecium, and the mic(90) s for ampicillin-resistant e. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. however, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity  of sm-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an e. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in cfu at four times the mic after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. in addition, sm-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the e. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the mics (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), moraxella catarrhalis, and bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for escherichia  coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus spp. thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.

AB  == we investigated activity of piperacillin (pipc) in comparison with 8 antibacterial reference drugs against several fresh clinical strains isolated from patients with infectious diseases in the respiratory tract and after surgical interventions in 1999. the following results were obtained: 1. pipc had  its mic90 of 0.12-6 micrograms/ml in gram-positive bacteria (methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis) and showed its mic of 1 microgram/ml or higher in 9 possible prsp strains out of 38 isolates of s. pneumoniae but there were no possible isolates with evident resistance in other species of bacteria. 2. pipc showed favorable antibacterial activities as its mic90 were 2-8 micrograms/ml in gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae), except for p. mirabilis in which its mic90  was as high as 64 micrograms/ml. 11 out of 39 isolates of p. mirabilis were resistant to other drugs such as pipc, abpc, ctm and czop. 3. pipc had its mic90  of > 128 micrograms/ml in bacteroides fragilis. from these results, pipc was considered highly effective in several infections in view of maintaining its favorable antibacterial activities in several causative bacteria even today when  20 years had passed since its first application to clinical practice.

TI  == antimicrobial chemotherapy in the control of surgical infectious complications.
AB  == in spite of the progress in surgical technique and antibiotic prophylaxis, postoperative infection still accounts for both the commonest surgical complication and one of the most frequent nosocomial infections, also causing an  increase in duration and costs of hospital stay. the choice of treatment for post-surgical infections requires an understanding of the usual infecting flora,  available antimicrobial agents, and susceptibility patterns. the most common organisms in simple wound infection are gram-positive cocci and mainly staphylococcus aureus. staphylococcus epidermidis and s. aureus (quite often methicillin-resistant strains) are the organisms which predominate in the infectious complications following clean surgical procedures with implantation of vascular grafts or prosthetic devices. mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora are mainly responsible for cases of intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections: the most common aerobes are enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, proteus spp., and others) and enterococci, and among anaerobes bacteroides fragilis group prevails. adequate drainage and surgical control of the source of  infection, when needed, and adjunctive effective antimicrobial therapy are important factors in successful treatment of postoperative infections. semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillins and glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are the drugs of choice for the treatment of infections caused by penicillin-resistant methicillin-sensitive, and methicillin-resistant, respectively, s. aureus and s. epidermidis. for the treatment of intra-abdominal  and intra-pelvic infections, animal and human studies support the recommendation  that treatment should be directed against both gram-negative enteric and anaerobic bacteria. combinations of aminoglycosides with clindamycin or metronidazole have been widely used with great success; however adverse reactions such as nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity have been a problem in some patients. in recent years monotherapy with either a carbapenem (imipenem/cilastatin or meropenem) or a penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination has been proposed. among these combination antimicrobials, piperacillin combined with tazobactam is a very well designed formulation. indeed, piperacillin is active against a broad range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, and tazobactam is a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor which acts on a variety of clinically important plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases. this combination seems particularly attractive for the treatment of mixed polymicrobial anaerobic-aerobic infections such as intra-abdominal and intra-pelvic postoperative infections.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents: special references to bacteria isolated between july 1996 and june 1997].
AB  == the annual multicenter studies on isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery and their antimicrobial susceptibility have been conducted in 20 facilities in japan since july 1982. this paper describes the results obtained during period from july 1996 to june 1997. the number of cases investigated as objectives was 217 for one year. a total of 406 strains were isolated from 177 cases (81.6% of total cases). from primary infections 162 strains were isolated,  and from postoperative infections 244 strains were isolated, respectively. from primary infections, anaerobic bacteria were predominant, while from postoperative infections, aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was the highest.  in postoperative infections, the majority of them were enterococcus faecalis, while in primary infections, many of them were enterococcus avium. the isolation  rate of staphylococcus spp., especially from postoperative infections, followed that of enterococcus spp. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, peptostreptococcus spp. and streptococcus spp. were commonly isolated from both types of infections. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from postoperative infections, p. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by e. coli and enterobacter cloacae. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, bacteroides fragilis group was the majority of isolates from both types of infections. the isolation rate of aerobic gram-negative bacillus has decreased with time, while those of anaerobes like b. fragilis group and of aerobic gram-positive bacteria have gradually increased in both types of infections. we found vancomycin-resistant strains of neither staphylacoccus aureus nor enterococcus spp.; however, the mic of arbekacin for one of strains of s. aureus  was 100 micrograms/ml. both the mic90's of meropenem and imipenem/cilastatin against p. aeruginosa isolated in this term were 25 micrograms/ml, which were higher than those against the strains isolated in the previous years. compared with the isolated strains in the year 1995, progress of resistance against carbapenem antibiotics was confirmed.

TI  == microbiological examinations and in-vitro testing of different antibiotics in therapeutic endoscopy of the biliary system.
AB  == background and study aims: prior to endoscopic therapeutic procedures, no antibiotic prophylaxis is administered routinely. because of the reported incidence of infectious complications, which may reach up to 10%, a prospective study was undertaken to investigate the effects of a prophylactic dose of cefuroxime on the incidence of bacteremia and clinical signs of infection, but no significant effects could be demonstrated. in addition to this published work, blood and bile cultures obtained in this trial were also investigated, and the in-vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics was tested in order to recommend the appropriate substances. patients and methods: ninety-nine consecutive patients (51 men, 48 women; mean age 61.4 +/- 17 years) with biliary obstruction  who underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ercp) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography with drainage (ptcd) were included. sequential blood cultures were taken before and up to 60 minutes after the endoscopic intervention. bile cultures were obtained in 56 patients with biliary  drainage. aerobic and anaerobic cultures were prepared from all obtained specimens and the isolated organisms were identified. in the case of positive cultures, an in-vitro resistance test for 15 different antibiotics was performed. results: the incidence of bacteremia was 11.1% (n = 11), and 16 bacteria were isolated. twelve different microorganisms were detected, with escherichia coli found in four cases. from 41 positive out of 56 prepared bile cultures (73.2%), 91 isolates were found with 25 different species. a single agent was detected in  eight cases (19.5%), while a mixed growth, with pathogens ranging from two to six species, was found in 33 cases (80.5%). the seven most frequently isolated germs  were e. coli and enterococcus (each n = 19), klebsiella (n = 10), streptococcus viridans (n = 9), staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 5), morganella morganii (n = 4), and bacteroides fragilis (n = 3), representing 76% of all agents. examination for fungal infection revealed positive cultures of candida albicans in 16.1% of bile cultures (nine of 56). interestingly, the use of proton-pump inhibitors (ppis), with a consequent rise in the gastric ph value, led to an increase in the rate of bacteremia to 26.2% (five of 19) compared to the other patients not on ppis (n = 80), who developed bacteremia in only six cases (7.5%; p = 0.02). in-vitro testing of different antibiotics was carried out in 73 isolates. imipenem showed the best antimicrobial activity (98.4%), followed by trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (90%), amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid (87.3%), vancomycin  (82.4%), and ofloxacin (76.9%). conclusions: escherichia coli was found to be the pathogen most frequently detected in blood and bile following endoscopic interventions in the biliary tract. enterococci, klebsiella and streptococcus viridans were found in bile cultures with an incidence exceeding 10%. in view of  the in-vitro test results, possible side effects, and contraindications, amoxicillin plus beta-lactamase inhibitors or quinolones are considered to be suitable antibiotics for the prophylaxis of biliary infections.

AB  == background/aims: the aim of the present study is to assess the usefulness of biochemical and bacteriological analysis of the pancreatic fluid obtained at percutaneous drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts and abscesses guided by ultrasound. methodology: the study population was comprised of 65 patients, aged  21-79 years: 18 with abscesses and 47 with pseudocysts. in all cases the etiological factor of pancreatic fluid collections was acute pancreatitis. microbiological (both of aerobic and anaerobic flora), biochemical (including alpha 2-macroglobulin) and cytological analysis of aspirated fluid was performed. duration of percutaneous drainage in pseudocysts was 10-40 days (mean 18 +/- 12)  and in abscesses 21-56 days (mean 32 +/- 19). results: complete resolution of pancreatic fluid collections was obtained in 54 (83%) patients, among them in 40  (85.1%) with pseudocysts and in 14 (77.7%) with abscesses, which was confirmed in follow-up ultrasound and/or computed tomography one year after the catheter was removed. mild complications of this procedure observed in 17 (26.1%) patients were managed without catheter removal. a variety of organisms were cultured from  pancreatic fluid, e. coli being the most prevalent. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus saccharolyticus, propionibacterium acnes and bacteroides fragilis were also isolated. cytologic analysis of the aspirate revealed no atypical cells. the level of alpha 2-macroglobulin in the pancreatic fluid was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in patients with successful pancreatic drainage as compared to the remaining group.  conclusion: percutaneous drainage represents a safe therapeutic method that also  provides additional criteria for the management of patients with pancreatic cystic lesions.

TI  == antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  == quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to rp 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. in studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and rp 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference mic and mbc tests. no significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/rp 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and streptococcus ssp.  enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but e. faecalis, pasteurella multocida, pediococcus ssp., haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (mic90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). the log phase inoculum was preferred for mbc and kill-curve tests with this combination. the 30:70 ratio in  vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to  predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant e. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.

TI  == in vitro activity of bay 12-8039, a new 8-methoxyquinolone.
AB  == bay 12-8039 is a new 8-methoxyquinolone with antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria which is significantly better than those of sparfloxacin or ciprofloxacin. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) for 90% of methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis were 0.062 and 2 mg/l, respectively. the mic90s for ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant s. aureus were 8 mg/l. against  the staphylococcal strains tested sparfloxacin was 2-fold and ciprofloxacin > or  = 10-fold less active. mic90s for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae were 0.125-0.5 mg/l, irrespective of whether strains with diminished ciprofloxacin susceptibility or ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains were tested. against the streptococci sparfloxacin was 2- to 4-fold less active. against gram-negative bacteria bay 12-8039 is almost as active as ciprofloxacin, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa.  against bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides spp. and clostridium spp. bay 12-8039 was as active as metronidazole. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. pneumoniae was in contrast to that of the other quinolones tested, penicillin  g, amoxicillin+/-clavulanate, cefuroxime and clarithromycin, concentration-dependent. as compared to ciprofloxacin, development of resistance  was less pronounced. the spontaneous mutation frequency towards bay 12-8039 resistance was 2.8 x 10(-8) in escherichia coli, 7.06 x 10(-8) in s. aureus and < 1.4 x 10(-9) in s. pneumoniae.

TI  == in vivo activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  == the upjohn oxazolidinones, u-100592 and u-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. in several mouse models of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infection, u-100592 and u-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ed50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ed50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. similarly, both compounds were active versus a staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. u-100592 and u-100766 effectively cured an enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ed50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, with ed50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. in soft tissue infection models with s. aureus and e. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. u-100766 was also very active versus the bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ed50 = 46.3 mg/kg).  in combination-therapy studies, both u-100592 and u-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic s. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic s. aureus-escherichia coli infection. u-100592 and u-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.

TI  == in vitro activities of u-100592 and u-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  == oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. u-100592 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and u-100766 (s)-n-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. mics were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective mics of u-100592 and u-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. aureus, 4  and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2  micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. most strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (vana, vanb, and vanc resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and m. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. the  presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. the spontaneous mutation frequencies of s. aureus atcc 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for u-100592 and u-100766, respectively. serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.

TI  == [in vitro and in vivo activities of sulopenem compared with those of imipenem and cephalosporins].
AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of sulopenem (cp-70,429),a new  parenteral penem antibiotic, were compared with those of imipenem (ipm), flomoxef, cefuzonam (czon) and cefotaxime. sulopenem possessed broad-spectrum activities against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. antibacterial activities of sulopenem against methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae were equivalent to or somewhat superior to those of ipm. against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, sulopenem was 4- to 260-fold more active than reference antibiotics with broad-spectra. in a killing kinetics study for haemophilus influenzae, sulopenem showed a 99.9% decrease of viable cells after 8 hours at a  concentration of 0.20 micrograms/ml. this effect was obtained at a concentration  8-fold lower than that of ipm. the protective effects of sulopenem in murine experimental systemic infections were superior to those of imipenem/cilastatin. in murine experimental mixed infection with escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis, sulopenem had lower ed50, in other words stronger antimicrobial activities than ipm. the therapeutic effect of sulopenem are related well with its mic value. in guinea pigs experimental lung infection with klebsiella pneumoniae, sulopenem was more effective than czon or cefotiam.

TI  == bacterial adherence and biofilm formation on latex and silicone t-tubes in relation to bacterial contamination of bile.
AB  == background: t-tube-related bacteriobilia causes infectious complications and obstruction. to prevent these, the choice of t-tube material may be of importance. methods: transected common bile ducts (cbds) of 17 piglets were sutured over latex or silicone t-tubes, or without a t-tube. results: after 6 weeks bacteriobilia was found in all of 12 cbds with and in 1 of 5 cbds without a t-tube (p < 0.05). by scanning electron microscopy (sem) four of five latex and none of five silicone t-tubes had bacterial biofilms (p < 0.05). all tubes remained patent. segments of t-tubes were incubated with five different bacterial strains. sonication and sem showed that 0.1-1.1% of 10(7) colony-forming units of inoculum adhered to t-tubes. two to six times more bacteria adhered to latex than to silicone (p < 0.05). conclusions: silicone offers better long-term patency than latex. less infectious complications occur if t-tubes are omitted.

TI  == antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. rationale for clinical use.
AB  == most gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (rp 59500; synercid). minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (mic90) were < or = 1 mg/l for staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, s. haemolyticus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. pyogenes and listeria  monocytogenes. importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of s. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin g)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant enterococcus faecium. e. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. among the gram-negative respiratory pathogens moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. are resistant.  the drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including clostridium perfringens, lactobacillus spp., bacteroides fragilis and peptostreptococcus. synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant e. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus with the combination  of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant s. aureus infection in rabbits, s. aureus and s. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. the drug is rapidly bactericidal against gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the mic, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.

TI  == a study of the anaerobic bacterial flora of the female genital tract in health and disease.
AB  == semi-quantitative and qualitative bacterial assessment of the vaginal and cervical flora of a total of 202 women was carried out over a period of six months to determine the bacterial flora in three groups of women and changes caused by prior use of antibiotics. the number was made up of 32 healthy volunteers, 80 women with gynaecological problems and 90 women with gynaecological infections who had had antibiotic treatment prior to this study. standard methods were used for the investigations. five main genera of anaerobic  bacteria were isolated from all patients. they included, the bacteroides spp., prevotella spp., porphyromonas spp., peptostreptococcus spp. and clostridium spp. five non-sporing gram negative anaerobic bacteria constituted the bulk of the flora including prevotella bivia, p. disiens, p. melanogenica, p. asaccharolytica and b. fragilis. the predominant flora was p. bivia occurring in 61 pc of cervical swab specimens of the 80 women with proven gynaecological infections who had not used antibiotics and accounting for 27 pc of the total number of gram-negative anaerobic bacteria isolated. escherichia coli and staphylococcus epidermidis were the most frequently encountered aerobic bacteria. the semi-quantitative counts of the different bacterial species in the patient group  were significantly higher than in the control group of healthy individuals (p < 0,025). similarly, prior antibiotic administration significantly reduced the population and quantitative count of the anaerobic bacteria.

TI  == nosocomial bacteremia-induced increases in abscess formation correlate with in vitro upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the hypothesis that sublethal exposure to common nosocomial pathogens can alter the host response to a later, distant infectious insult (peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation), and that these changes are related to the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. design: a multiexperiment, randomized, controlled trial. setting: animal research laboratory of a university medical center. subjects: one hundred sixty-five balb/c mice, weighing 20 to 25 g, were used for in vivo experiments and as the source of peritoneal macrophages for in vitro experiments. interventions: nine groups of mice (n = 10 to 18 per group) were twice systemically preexposed to sublethal amounts of live escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus faecalis, or candida albicans, or to 2.5 or 5.0 micrograms e. coli lipopolysaccharide o26:b6. one week later, mice underwent the induction of mixed e. coli/bacteroides fragilis peritonitis, leading to abscess formation. in parallel experiments in vitro, 10(6) mouse peritoneal macrophages were incubated with similar amounts of nosocomial pathogens or lipopolysaccharide to determine the induction of macrophage procoagulant activity. measurements and main results: the three gram-negative bacilli tested significantly upregulated both abscess formation and macrophage procoagulant activity, with a strong linear correlation between abscess formation and procoagulant activity. these effects were not seen with the gram-positive cocci or with c. albicans. pre-exposure of mice to endotoxin alone  did not alter later abscess formation, but did increase macrophage procoagulant activity. conclusions: sublethal exposure to some gram-negative nosocomial pathogens can significantly alter a host's response to a later, distant, infection, even when caused by different bacteria. in the case of peritonitis and intraperitoneal abscess formation, these changes may be mediated by the upregulation of macrophage procoagulant activity. the presence of endotoxin alone does not completely explain these phenomena.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == postmortem drug metabolism by bacteria.
AB  == studies were undertaken to determine the possible role of enteric bacteria in the postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam. flunitrazepam, clonazepam, and nitrazepam were completely metabolized in blood in the presence of eight species of enteric bacteria to their respective 7-amino-metabolites. the rates of metabolism, at 37 degrees c, ranged from 0.1 ng/ml/min for streptococcus faecalis to 8.8 ng/ml/min for clostridium perfringens. the rate of conversion was reduced to 87% by a combination of 0.7% (w/v) sodium fluoride and potassium oxalate, and almost completely inhibited (96%) by 1% (w/v) sodium fluoride. ph had variable effects on the rate of metabolic bioconversion of nitrobenzodiazepines, while increasing  temperatures were found to generally increase the rate of nitrobenzodiazepine bioconversion. these data support the proposal that bacteria may mediate postmortem bioconversion of the nitrobenzodiazepines.

TI  == synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. to investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (ctx), desacetylcefotaxime (des), and ofloxacin (ofl), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between ctx, des and ofl was demonstrable for 89 (81%). included in the study were 70 members of the enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of xanthomonas maltophilia. additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. organisms tested included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible s. epidermidis (10), enterococcus faecalis (10), and streptococcus pneumoniae (20). synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the bacteroides fragilis group. of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). isolates representative of each major group  of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == susceptibility survey of piperacillin alone and in the presence of tazobactam.
AB  == among 325 fresh isolates of bacteria from 153 hospital patients with serious infections, 142 were susceptible to piperacillin, 129 were resistant and a further 54 exhibited a marked inoculum effect. tazobactam restored the susceptibility of resistant isolates of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus  epidermidis (except methicillin-resistant isolates), haemophilus influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, acinetobacter spp. and bacteroides fragilis. among 87 enterobacteriaceae that were resistant to piperacillin, or showed an inoculum effect, 78 (89%) were restored to susceptibility by tazobactam. pseudomonas spp.  resistant to piperacillin were mostly resistant to the combination.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == the viability of microorganisms in preservation solutions.
AB  == in 1988 the university of wisconsin solution was introduced into clinical transplantation. this solution is unique in that it contains no glucose but rather raffinose, lactobionate, and hydroxyethyl starch. in addition, it contains two antibiotics, penicillin and bactrim. prior studies have shown that other preservation solutions allow the transmission of bacterial contamination from organ donor to recipient. however, there are no data on whether uw solution, with its unique composition and extended preservation times, allows bacterial transmission. we undertook the present study to establish if bacteria remain viable in uw solution at extended preservation times. cultures of both aerobic (escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa) and anaerobic (bacteroides fragilis) bacteria were suspended at 10(5), 10(4), 10(2), and 10(1) org./ml (calibrated from a .5 macfarland turbidity standard) in both eurocollins and uw preservation solutions. samples were then stored in an ice bath to stimulate organ preservation. the organisms were removed and plated on blood and chocolate agar at 0, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 hr postsuspension. the samples were then incubated at 37 degrees c and read for growth at 24-48 hr after plating. our results showed growth of all organisms except s epi in both preservation solutions, at all dilutions and preservation times. s epi grew in the eurocollins solution at all dilutions and preservation times but did not grow in the uw solution. when the experiment was repeated omitting penicillin from the uw solution, s epi grew at all dilutions and preservation times. these results demonstrate that in spite of the inclusion of two different antibiotics, the majority of the common bacterial contaminants of the organ donor remain viable in uw solution with extended preservation times. it may be possible therefore to omit these antibiotics from the uw solution and obtain similar results. it is also important to note that routine culturing remains an expensive but necessary part of organ procurement and preservation.

AB  == the in vitro activity of daptomycin-metronidazole combinations against mixed cultures of gram-positive facultative cocci and strains of the bacteroides fragilis group was investigated. metronidazole did not influence the high activity of daptomycin against strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus faecalis in the absence or presence of the co-cultured bacteroides strains. in contrast, the enterococcus faecalis isolates  protected the co-cultured bacteroides strains against the killing effect of metronidazole, even at a concentration four- or eightfold the mic of metronidazole. killing curve experiments confirmed this protective effect of different isolates of enterococcus faecalis.

TI  == immune response in patients with intraabdominal infections treated with imipenem. swedish study group.
AB  == in the present investigation the humoral immune response against isolated microorganisms in patients treated with imipenem was studied. sixty-six patients  (34 men and 32 women, 18-86 years of age) with suspicion of intraabdominal infections entered the study. five patients were excluded for various reasons and the remaining 61 patients were treated with imipenem/cilastatin 0.5-1.0 g t.i.d.  for 5-29 days (median nine days). three serum samples were taken from each patient, the first sample at admission, the second between three and seven days after the first dose of imipenem/cilastatin and the third between 14 and 31 days  after the first dose. one third of the patients had a malignant disease and the verified intraabdominal infections were judged to be severe in 23 and moderately  severe in 33 of the patients. fifty-six patients (92%) were cured and five patients (8%) were considered improved after the treatment. the immune response against isolated microorganisms was measured in the three serum samples by indirect immunofluorescence tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. among the aerobic microorganisms isolated escherichia coli (46 strains) staphylococcus  epidermidis (22 strains), streptococcus milleri (15 strains) and enterococcus faecalis (11 strains) dominated and among the anaerobic bacteria bacteroides fragilis (39 strains). thirty-two patients had significant immune responses against one or more of the isolated microorganisms. e. coli and b. fragilis gave  rises in antibody titers in 13 and 20 cases respectively, while significant titers against s. epidermidis were noticed in only three cases, against s. milleri in two cases and against e. faecalis in three cases.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == trospectomycin enhances surface phagocytosis of bacteroides and staphylococcus by altering the bacterial glycocalyx.
AB  == the influence of trospectomycin on phagocytosis of bacteriodes thetaiotaomicron,  bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus epidermidis was studied in the presence or absence of glycocalyx isolated from these microorganisms. bacteria were grown  with or without 0.25 or 0.5 of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of trospectomycin, a new chemically synthesized analog of spectinomycin. surface phagocytosis by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmnl) was determined using a  modified fluorochrome assay. subinhibitory concentrations of trospectomycin significantly enhanced surface phagocytosis of bacteroides and staphylococcus. when homologous or heterologous isolated glycocalyx was added to trospectomycin treated bacteria prior to incubation with pmnl, phagocytosis was reduced to levels observed in the untreated bacteria. addition of glycocalyx to untreated strains produced no significant reduction of phagocytosis. the glycocalyx preparations were free of lipopolysaccharide and did not affect pmnl viability.

TI  == comparison of the in vitro activities of fenticonazole, other imidazoles, metronidazole, and tetracycline against organisms associated with bacterial vaginosis and skin infections.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activity of the antifungal compound fenticonazole was  compared with those of clotrimazole, miconazole, tetracycline, and metronidazole  against 177 strains of bacterial species associated with either bacterial vaginosis (bv) or skin infections by agar dilution mic determinations. bv-associated bacteroides isolates of the bacteroides melaninogenicus-b. oralis group, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus spp., and anaerobic, gram-positive cocci were highly susceptible to fenticonazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole; but bacteroides spp. not associated with bv, bacteroides ureolyticus and the bacteroides fragilis group, were resistant. all bacteroides strains were susceptible to metronidazole, but the susceptibility of g. vaginalis and mobiluncus spp. varied. among the skin bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, coryneforms, and streptococci were highly susceptible to the imidazoles; but staphylococcus epidermidis strains were generally resistant. this antibacterial activity may give fenticonazole a useful role in the topical treatment of vaginal discharge and in mycotic skin infections that are superinfected with bacteria.

TI  == in vivo ph of induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice.
AB  == infections in the diabetic host have been shown to persist longer than those in the nondiabetic host. to investigate whether intra-abscess milieu might be a contributing factor to this persistence, the in vivo intra-abscess ph was measured in induced soft-tissue abscesses in diabetic and nondiabetic mice. two models (female genetically obese insulin-resistant and male streptozocin-induced  diabetic mice) were used with appropriate controls. the bacteria injected to produce the soft-tissue abscesses were bacteroides fragilis and enterococcus (b + e), staphylococcus epidermidis and enterococcus (s + e), and s. aureus (sa). intra-abscess ph measured on day 3 was consistently and significantly lower in all diabetic mice compared with their controls. in the diabetic mice, the ph of an abscess induced with b + e, s + e, and sa was 6.28 (n = 17), 6.79 (n = 10), and 6.52 (n = 10), respectively; the ph in the controls was 7.21 (n = 20), 7.30 (n = 10), and 7.17 (n = 10), respectively. differences in all groups between diabetic and nondiabetic mice were significant. the blood glucose values of the diabetic mice averaged 722 mg/dl, and in the nondiabetic mice were 210 mg/dl. no  animals were ketotic. there were no significant differences in total colony counts between any groups. in conclusion, there is a significantly lower ph in the abscess of the diabetic host compared with the nondiabetic host that is not related to the numbers or types of causative bacteria.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == the role of glycocalyx in surface phagocytosis of bacteroides spp., in the presence and absence of clindamycin.
AB  == the influence of isolated glycocalyx from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and b. fragilis on surface phagocytosis of clindamycin-treated and -untreated homologous and heterologous species was studied. when homologous or heterologous isolated glycocalyx was added to clindamycin-treated b. thetaiotaomicron or b. fragilis before incubation with pmnl, phagocytosis was reduced to levels observed in the untreated control bacteria, but addition of glycocalyx to untreated control strains showed no reduction of phagocytosis. when isolated bacteroides-glycocalyx was added to staphylococcus aureus or s. epidermidis, phagocytosis of both clindamycin-treated and -untreated bacteria was significantly reduced. the isolated glycocalyx preparations were analysed by thin layer and gas-liquid chromatography; these preparations were free of lipopolysaccharides. the isolated glycocalyx did not affect pmnl viability. our findings suggest that the glycocalyx is an important virulence factor because it impairs phagocytosis of bacteroides spp. by pmnl. clindamycin may enhance opsonophagocytosis of bacteroides by altering the glycocalyx.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial activity of fk482, a new orally active cephalosporin.
AB  == fk482 is a new orally active cephem antibiotic which offers some advantages over  the commercially available oral beta-lactam antibiotics. it displayed a broad spectrum of activity in vitro against stock strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobes and anaerobes. fk482 was more active in vitro than cefixime (cfix), cefaclor (ccl) or cephalexin (cex) against clinical isolates of gram-positive organisms such as methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci including staphylococcus epidermidis and strains of the streptococcus group. moderate activity was found against methicillin-resistant s. aureus and enterococcus faecalis. against clinical isolates of many gram-negative species, including opportunistic pathogens, fk482  had good in vitro activity similar or slightly inferior to that of cfix but superior to that of ccl or cex. however, it was clearly inferior to cfix in activity against serratia marcescens, and was inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa. strains of s. aureus resistant to methicillin were moderately susceptible to fk482. all tested strains of klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ccl and cex were susceptible to fk482, as were all the strains of escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae and branhamella catarrhalis resistant to amoxicillin (ampc). fk482, like cfix, was relatively stable to all type of beta-lactamases except bacteroides fragilis and its stability was superior to that of ccl or cex. the antibacterial activity of fk482 against csh2  strains containing ampicillin-resistance plasmids was not affected by the presence of the ampicillin resistance determinants. fk482 showed higher affinity  for the penicillin-binding proteins (pbps) (3, 2 and 1) of s. aureus than did cfix, ccl and cex. fk482 also showed very high affinity for the pbps (2 and 3) of e. faecalis and pbps (3, 1a, 4, 2 and 1 bs) of e. coli. the bactericidal activity of fk482 against s. aureus was almost as strong as that of ampc and superior to that of ccl or cex. against gram-negative bacteria such as e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis, fk482 was similar to cfix and superior to ccl and cex in bactericidal activity.

TI  == comparison of translocation rates of various indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to the mesenteric lymph node.
AB  == bacterial translocation is defined as the passage of indigenous bacteria from the gastrointestinal (gi) tract through the lamina propria to the mesenteric lymph nodes (mln) and other organs. we compared the relative abilities of various aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and obligately anaerobic bacteria to translocate from the gi tract to the mln in gnotobiotic mice colonized with single strains of bacteria. indigenous gram-negative enteric bacilli translocated in large numbers to the mln, whereas gram-positive bacteria translocated at intermediate levels and obligately anaerobic bacteria at only very low levels. our results suggest that enteric bacilli such as escherichia coli, proteus, and enterobacter are associated with a higher incidence of bacteremia in debilitated  patients, because these bacteria translocate more efficiently from the gi tract than do other bacteria, especially obligate anaerobes.

AB  == the in vitro activity of cgp 31608, a new penem, against aerobic and anaerobic organisms was evaluated and compared with those of other beta-lactams. cgp 31608  inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, citrobacter diversus, and salmonella, shigella, aeromonas, and yersinia spp. with mics for 50% of the strains (mic50s) of 2 to 4 micrograms/ml and mic90s of 4 micrograms/ml, compared with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, and imipenem mics of less than 0.25 microgram/ml. mic90s were 8 micrograms/ml for enterobacter species and c. freundii, for which other agents had mics of 32 micrograms/ml, except imipenem, which had equal activity. the mic90 for proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, and providencia rettgeri was 8 micrograms/ml, compared with less than 2 micrograms/ml shown by the other agents. acinetobacter species resistant to other agents except imipenem were inhibited by 4 micrograms/ml, as were pseudomonas aeruginosa, including piperacillin-, ceftazidime-, and gentamicin-resistant isolates. the mic for p. cepacia, p. fluorescens, and p. acidovorans was less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml, but that for p. maltophilia was greater than or equal to 128 micrograms/ml. hemolytic streptococci a, b, c, g, and f were inhibited by less than 1 micrograms/ml, but the mic for streptococcus faecalis was greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml. mics for staphylococcus aureus methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains were less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, as were those for methicillin-susceptible and -resistant s. epidermidis. bacteroides fragilis and clostridium species and fusobacterium spp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml. cgp 31608 was not hydrolyzed by plasmid beta-lactamases tem-1, tem-2, shv-1, pse-1, oxa-2, pse-4, or by s. aureus. chromosomal beta-lactamases of type ia in enterobacter cloacae p99 and morganella morganii, ic in p. vulgaris, k-1 in k. oxytoca, and id in p. aeruginosa also did not hydrolyze cgp 31608. it inhibited tem-1, but the 50% inhibitory concentration was 14.2 micrograms/ml compared with 0.15 micrograms/ml for the p99 enzyme. cgp 31608 induced beta-lactamases in p. aeruginosa, e. cloacae, c. freundii and providencia rettgeri, but there was no increase in mics for the isolates and it did not select strains derepressed for beta-lactamase production. synergy of cgp 31608 and gentamicin was found against 90% p. aeruginosa, 60% enterobacter cloacae, and 50% serratia marcescens strains. no synergy was found with rifampin. a postantibiotic effect was found against e. coli.

TI  == in vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. a total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). ofloxacin was highly active against e. coli, klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp., proteus mirabilis, proteus morganii, salmonella sp., campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, eubacterium sp., propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus sp. pseudomonas sp., serratia sp. and proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. high percentages of resistance to ofloxacin  were found only for providencia sp., proteus rettgeri and bacteroides fragilis. with regard to streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and mic determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.

TI  == microbiologic features and treatment of persistent peritonitis in patients in the intensive care unit.
AB  == the charts of 25 patients who died in the intensive care unit of persistent peritonitis after abdominal operations were reviewed to determine the microbial flora and the efficacy of antibiotic treatment. all patients had undergone two or more surgical procedures for abdominal sepsis and 23 had at least three-system organ failure. the most common organisms cultured were: staphylococcus epidermidis, 24 cultures from 16 patients, candida albicans, 19 cultures from 10  patients, pseudomonas aeruginosa, 16 cultures from 12 patients, enterobacter, 16  cultures from 8 patients and enterococcus, 14 cultures from 8 patients. the classic isolates, escherichia coli (11 cultures from six patients) and bacteroides fragilis (4 cultures from three patients) were found infrequently. to determine the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy for this "new" flora, we examined the ability of appropriate agents to eradicate the micro-organism upon subsequent culture. candida sp. were eradicated in 54% (6 of 11) of the assessable cases, while enterococcus and s. epidermidis were cleared in only 25% and 28% respectively. the spectrum of intra-abdominal organisms cultured from critically  ill surgical patients in the intensive care unit differs from that seen in those  with acute peritonitis. despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial agents, these organisms tend to persist, probably reflecting impaired host defences with multiple-system organ failure rather than antimicrobial failure.

TI  == colonoscopy and bacteraemia: an experience in 50 patients.
AB  == there is little consensus concerning the incidence of bacteraemia during colonoscopy and the need for antibiotic prophylaxis in susceptible patients. hepatic abscesses in one patient which may have been related to prior colonoscopic examinations led the authors to carry out a prospective study of 50  patients undergoing colonoscopy. multiple blood cultures were carried out to maximise the positive yield of transient bacteraemia and to attempt to determine  the time when bacteraemia is most likely to occur. five patients had positive blood cultures. in two patients s epidermidis was isolated, but only from the precolonoscopic blood sample. in three subjects enteric organisms were cultured from blood samples obtained during the procedure. in one of these three the same  organism was cultured from the preendoscopic blood sample so that in only two patients (4%) could the bacteraemia be attributed to the colonoscopy. these results would suggest that the risk of bacteraemia during colonoscopy is low.

TI  == ability of oral bacteria to degrade fibronectin.
AB  == the fibronectin-degrading ability of 116, mainly oral, strains was assayed by using plasma-derived fibronectin adsorbed to a polystyrene surface. ability to degrade fibronectin was revealed in strains of bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, bacteroides loeschii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, peptococcus prevotii, clostridium sporogenes, and propionibacterium acnes. the fibronectinolytic activity of subgingival bacteriological samples was found to be related to the presence of b. gingivalis  and b. intermedius. in addition, strains of the nonoral bacteroides species b. asaccharolyticus and b. fragilis showed fibronectin-degrading ability. no such ability was detected in the oral strains tested of streptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, lactobacillus, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, or haemophilus species.

TI  == antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and its mode of action.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae, branhamella catarrhalis, and neisseria gonorrhoeae was comparable to norfloxacin and enoxacin, and far exceeded the activity of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. the activity of ofloxacin was two  to eight times less than that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was more active against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, acinetobacter spp., legionella spp., and bacteroides fragilis, than norfloxacin,  enoxacin, pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid, and the activity of ofloxacin was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. ofloxacin was two to seven times more effective than norfloxacin in systemic infections in mice with s. aureus, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens and p. aeruginosa. ofloxacin strongly inhibited dna supercoiling activity of dna gyrase purified from e. coli kl-16. there is a parallel relationship between antibacterial activity of ofloxacin and  its inhibitory action against dna gyrases from ofloxacin-susceptible and ofloxacin-resistant clinical isolates of e. coli. these results indicate that the high bactericidal action of ofloxacin and the related new quinolone agents can be explained by their potent inhibitory activities against dna gyrase in bacterial cells.

TI  == protease production by microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
AB  == factors influencing pathogenicity of various microbes found in the female lower genital tract remain incompletely understood. protease production by cervico/vaginal microorganisms may alter or inactivate a variety of proteins important in host defense and structural-functional integrity including collagen-containing chorioamniotic membranes and uterine cervix. host tissues may be made more susceptible to other organisms' virulence factors by protease-producing members of genital tract local flora. microorganisms themselves may also be influenced by the presence of other microbial protease. nonspecific protease, gelatinase, collagenase, and elastase production was examined for in vitro with use of aerobic (30) and anaerobic (25) strains of microorganisms typical of those isolated from the lower genital tract of women with premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and puerperal infection. microorganisms including bacteroides bivius, bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides fragilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus species, and propionibacterium acnes produce various proteases. protease production by both acknowledged pathogenic and commensal bacteria may contribute to the occurrence of reproductive tract morbidity including premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime in combination with other antibiotics.
AB  == 189 bacterial strains were investigated for their in vitro sensitivity against ceftazidime (alone and in combination with another antibiotic). moreover, the possibility to prevent development of secondary bacterial resistance as observed  in subcultures at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations, was studied using specific antibiotic combinations. of 115 staphylococcal strains (91 strains of staphylococcus aureus, 24 strains of staphylococcus epidermidis), 2% were sensitive, 82% were moderately sensitive and 16% were resistant to ceftazidime. on combining ceftazidime with vancomycin, synergism was found in 61% of the strains, and secondary resistance to ceftazidime could be prevented with this combination. the combination of ceftazidime and clindamycin showed synergism in 26% and an additive effect in 48% of the strains. secondary resistance to ceftazidime did not develop with this combination in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations in which loss of activity was only minimal with clindamycin alone. rifampicin and fusidic acid were highly active against staphylococci. in combination with ceftazidime, only weak synergism or additive effects were seen in most strains; no antagonism could be observed. in subcultures at subinhibitory concentrations, secondary resistance to rifampicin and fusidic acid developed rapidly and could be partially prevented by adding ceftazidime. of 60 pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 84% were sensitive, 13% were moderately sensitive and 2% were resistant to ceftazidime. synergism was most frequently observed when ceftazidime was combined with tobramycin. using this combination, secondary resistance of pseudomonas strains to ceftazidime did not develop. when ceftazidime was combined with piperacillin, synergism was observed in most strains, but the development of secondary resistance in vitro was not prevented.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == in vitro activity of imipenem--a review.
AB  == a review is given of the microbiological properties of imipenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic with an exceptionally broad spectrum of antibacterial activity. an evaluation of results of numerous in vitro studies reveals that imipenem effectively inhibited growth of 53 of 55 bacterial species, the mean mic90 being  less than 8 mg/l. the mic90 for cocci, with the exception of staphylococcus epidermidis, is in the range of 0.01-3.1 mg/l. the mic90 for all enterobacteriaceae is equal to or less than 8 mg/l. pseudomonas aeruginosa and other non-fermentative gram-negative bacteria are generally susceptible to imipenem, only pseudomonas maltophilia and pseudomonas cepacia showing intrinsic  resistance. imipenem is currently the most active drug available against anaerobic bacteria, the mic usually being below 1 mg/l even for bacteroides fragilis. rare bacteria such as nocardia asteroides, listeria monocytogenes or fast growing mycobacterium spp. which cause difficult-to-treat infections are also susceptible to imipenem. increases in inoculum size have only a minimal effect on activity of the drug. in most species the mbc only slightly exceeded the mic; however in the case of streptococcus faecalis the mbc value was many times the mic value. synergism has been observed in combinations of imipenem with aminoglycosides, and antagonism in combinations with other beta-lactam antibiotics against pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens. imipenem is stable in the presence of the common chromosomal and plasmid-mediated enzymes. induction of inactivating enzymes was observed in staphylococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and serratia marcescens.

TI  == experimental anaerobic brain abscess. computerized tomographic and neuropathological correlations.
AB  == the neuropathological progression of brain abscess formation induced by a mixed anaerobic culture of bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus epidermidis was studied experimentally in dogs. histological findings were correlated with computerized tomographic (ct) brain scans. the evolution of brain abscess formation could be divided into three stages based on histological criteria: early cerebritis (days 1 to 3); late cerebritis (days 4 to 9); and capsule formation (day 10 and later). capsule formation could not be divided into early and late stages because encapsulation was delayed compared with a previously reported model of alpha-streptococcus brain abscess. histologically, there was evidence for a very virulent infection. leptomeningitis was significant even in the late stages. early ventricular rupture occurred in 25% of the animals. a pattern of extensive purulent encephalitis was seen in 25% of the animals. in the early cerebritis stage, blood vessels near the necrotic center were engorged and  were surrounded by hemorrhage and/or protein-rich fluid. cerebral edema was extensive. although fibroblasts appeared in late cerebritis, there was marked delay of capsule formation. three-week-old lesions still had areas of incomplete  capsule formation and foci of uncontrolled infection. in the cerebritis stages, ct scans showed an area of ring enhancement which was incomplete on early scans (at 5 minutes after injection of contrast material) but partially filled in and thickened on delayed scans (at 20 to 45 minutes). on even later delayed scans there was no decrease in intensity of ring enhancement. lesions in which capsule  formation occurred also showed ring enhancement, but delayed scans showed a decrease in the intensity of enhancement. the lesions that ruptured into the ventricular system showed atypical ct findings, with either lack of contrast enhancement (histologically there was minimal cerebritis adjacent to the abscess  cavity) or a marked delay in contrast enhancement (cerebritis was more extensive  and corresponded to the width of ring of enhancement). this study suggests that bacteroides fragilis is a virulent organism in the brain. the developing abscesses enlarged quickly, were prone to early ventricular rupture, and showed incomplete and delayed encapsulation.

TI  == premature labor. ii. bacterial sources of phospholipase.
AB  == human term labor is thought to be initiated by amniotic and chorionic phospholipase a2, an enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid esters from the phospholipids of these membranes, leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins by the placental membranes. the striking association of premature labor with intrauterine infection or contamination, urinary tract infection, and early neonatal sepsis led us to study the microorganisms present in these infections for phospholipase a2 activity. activity was found in bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptococcus viridans, streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus a and b, escherichia coli, klebsiella, staphylococcus epidermidis, pneumococcus, lactobacillus, and mycoplasma hominis.  bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus, fusobacterium, and s viridans had the highest activities. the specific activities of phospholipase a2 from these organisms were several times higher than that of the membrane phospholipase a2 of the amnion and chorion. we postulate that premature labor may be initiated by microorganisms with phospholipase a2 activity from endocervical and/or intrauterine contamination or infection, producing deacylation of arachidonic acid from amniotic phospholipids with increased concentrations of free arachidonic acid and increased prostaglandin synthesis, which triggers labor.

AB  == the in vitro activity of ceftriaxone (ro 13-9904), a parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with that of other beta-lactam antibiotics. the compound was less active against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis than was cephalothin or cefamandole, but it was comparable to cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and moxalactam in inhibiting most isolates of s. aureus at 3.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 inhibited streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations below 0.25 microgram/ml, but streptococcus faecalis required concentrations above 25 microgram/ml. neisseria gonorrhoeae and haemophilus influenzae were inhibited at concentrations similar to those of cefotaxime, less  than 0.1 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was as active as cefotaxime and moxalactam against most enterobacteriaceae and was the most active agent tested against proteus, inhibiting all strains tested at 0.006 microgram/ml. ro 13-9904 was slightly less active than moxalactam or cefoxitin against bacteroides fragilis, requiring more than 100 microgram/ml to inhibit 90% of isolates, and it was less  active than cefoperazone against pseudomonas aeruginosa. presence of serum, alteration of ph, and use of various media did not change the inhibitory levels.  bactericidal concentrations were similar to inhibitory levels. ro 13-9904 was stable to most plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by some enterobacter, proteus, and bacteroides beta-lactamases of chromosomal origin.

TI  == cefamandole in the treatment of serious bone and joint diseases.
AB  == the safety and efficacy of treatment with cefamandole were evaluated in 77 patients (from 33 institutions) with serious bone and joint infections. the antibiotic was given intramuscularly or intravenously in doses ranging from 1.5 to 12 g/day for 6 to 58 days. seventy-three of the 77 patients responded satisfactorily, and 63 (of 70 from whom material for culture was obtainable) patients had a bacteriologic cure. forty-one of 81 isolates were identified as staphylococcus aureus. other pathogens included streptococcus epidermidis, haemophilus influenzae, enterobacter sp., escherichia coli, aerobic and anaerobic cocci, as well as bacteroides fragilis. the drug was well tolerated. pharmacological studies indicated that cefamandole penetrated the bones and joints. cefamandole would seem to be a safe and efficacious drug, for the treatment of serious bone and joint infections due to a wide variety of gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of the maternal cervix and newborn gastric  fluid and conjunctiva: a prospective study.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures were performed on cervical swabs from 35 mothers and their newborn infants' gastric aspirates and conjunctival sacs. four hundred  seventy-nine isolates were obtained; 287 were aerobes and 192 were anaerobes. the cervical and gastric cultures overall yielded a similar flora, but this was not always the case when one compared mothers with their own newborn infants. the conjunctival cultures yielded about half of the number of bacteria per specimen that the gastric contents yielded, and a repeat conjunctival culture done 48 hours later showed a marked reduction in the number of potentially pathogenic bacteria isolated. the predominant aerobes isolated were staphylococcus epidermidis, diphtheroids, viridans streptococci and haemophilus vaginalis. the predominant anaerobes were the bacteroides fragilis group, propionibacterium acnes, peptococcus, other bacteroides and peptostreptococcus organisms. statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between the isolation of certain groups of organisms and increased duration of pregnancy, increased baby's weight, and prolonged duration of labor.

TI  == effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  == an anaerobic transport system (ats) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ats environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. bacteria in a three-part mixture of bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of b. fragilis, p. anaerobius, fusobacterium nucleatum, staphylococcus epidermidis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ats and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for b. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ats and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ats. these data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ats would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.

TI  == a rapid slide test for penicillinase.
AB  == the authors developed a rapid slide test modification of the iodometric method for detection of penicillinase produced by organisms growing on routine plating media. a loopful of colonies is scraped from the agar surface and emulsified in one drop of an iodine-penicillin solution on a glass slide. addition of a drop of 0.4% starch solution results in a purple color when penicillinase is not present; a colorless reaction denotes a positive test. the slide test yielded positive results identical to those of a starch agar-plate method with 26 staphylococcus aureus isolates; a further seven showed comparable negative tests. penicillinase  production was associated with a s. aureus penicillin mic of greater than or equal to 0.5 micron/ml. all 15 staphylococcus epidermidis isolates gave negative  test results, as did 22 bacteroides fragilis (mic greater than or equal to 3.1).  twenty ampicillin-susceptible haemophilus influenzae were negative by both the slide test and a levinthal broth method; an additional five resistant (mic greater than or equal to 10) isolates were positive by both methods. twenty-eight (penicillin mic greater than or equal to 0.8) of 50 bacteroides melaninogenicus were slide test-positive for penicillinase. two penicillinase-producing strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae gave positive slide tests, while eight other non-penicillinase-producers were negative.

TI  == colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice.
AB  == a study of colonization resistance against potentially pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was conducted in hexaflora-associated gnotobiotic mice. groups of germfree akr mice were swabbed with five bacterial and a single gastrointestinal yeast species: streptococcus faecalis. lactobacillus brevis. staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, bacteroides fragilis var. vulgatus, and torulopsis sp. all species became established in the gut in 8 weeks. later these associated mice were divided and challenged by four graded doses of e. coli or p. aeruginosa. the presence of challenge organism was monitored specifically in the freshly voided fecal specimens of the challenged mice. escherichia coli colonized the gut of each mouse at each level up to 60 days post challenge. pseudomonas aeruginosa was completely eliminated from each mouse at each dose level after 30 days post challenge. evidence suggests that all six species were sufficient to prevent the  colonization of p. aeruginosa and not of e. coli in the gut of the gnotobiotic mice.

TI  == in vitro activity of josamycin against aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobes.
AB  == josamycin, a new macrolide antibiotic, was compared with ampicillin, erythromycin, and clindamycin in vitro against 25 isolates each of pneumococci, enterococci, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, and nonenterococcal hemolytic streptococci and against 25 anaerobes including 10 bacteroides fragilis. minimal  inhibitory concentration and minimal bactericidal concentration data were obtained for the aerobic organisms, using serial twofold tube dilutions in mueller-hinton broth. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined for the anaerobes by the agar dilution technique. josamycin was comparable to erythromycin and clindamycin in activity against the pneumococci, streptococci, and staphylococci and was more active than clindamycin against enterococci. it was somewhat less active than ampicillin against enterococci and s. epidermidis and showed its greatest in vitro activity against anaerobes, being comparable to  clindamycin.

TI  == intracolonic tensions of oxygen and carbon dioxide in germfree, conventional, and gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the relation of intracolonic gaseous tension to fecal microflora was investigated by mass spectrometric measurements of intracolonic o2 and co2 in unanesthetized germfree, conventional, and gnotobiotic rats; ip measurements were obtained in rats whose colons became perforated accidentally; fecal bacterial flora and cecal size were also determined. gnotobiotes were monoassociated with escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus epidermidis, and were diassociated with e. coli plus b. fragilis and with bacillus macerans plus an aerobic diphtheroid.  mean intracolonic po2 in conventional rats (11.1 mmhg) was significantly lower than in germfree rats (12.8 mmhg); mean intracolonic pco2 in conventionals (83.4  mmhg) was greater than in germfree rats (54.6 mmhg). differences of po2 values among all rats were slight. however, intracolonic pco2 values were directly related to co2 production by the normal intestinal flora, and were thus significantly lower in both germfree and gnotobiotic rats. intraperitoneal tensions were independent of the status of rats, and the mean ip po2 and pco2 (38.9 and 49.1 mmhg, respectively) agreed with values in the literature. the enlarged cecum, characteristic of germfree rats, was also present in gnotobiotic  rats. counts of each bacterial species in feces of monoassociated rats were 10(8) to 10(10)/g; counts were progressively smaller in feces of diassociated rats and  conventional rats (10(8) to 10(9)/g and 10(5) to 10(8)/g, respectively). intracolonic gaseous tensions of co2 clearly reflected the presence of a normal flora inconventional rats, and were inversely proportional to cecal size.

TI  == bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmn) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, eh < -42 mv at ph 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic pmn. anaerobic pmn were able to kill staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus, viridans streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, bacteroides fragilis, clostridium perfringens, and peptococcus magnus normally. organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic pmn included staphylococcus  aureus (strains wood 46 and 502a), escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, and salmonella typhimurium. these findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide  may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
