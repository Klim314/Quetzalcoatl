TI  == infectious agents associated with diarrhoea in neonatal foals in central kentucky: a comprehensive molecular study.
AB  == reasons for performing study: diarrhoea caused by infectious agents is common in  foals but there is no comprehensive molecular work-up of the relative prevalence  of common agents and appearance of coinfections. objectives: to determine the prevalence of 9 infectious agents in gastrointestinal (gi)-diseased and healthy foals with ages ranging from 1 to 20 weeks of age and to what degree coinfections are associated with clinical signs of gi disease. study design: retrospective controlled observational study. methods: the population consisted of 88 thoroughbred foals aged 2 days to 17 weeks born on 32 different studfarms in kentucky. healthy (n = 37) and gi-diseased (n = 51) foals were identified based on clinical presentation. faecal samples were analysed for 9 infectious agents by real-time pcr: equine rotavirus, equine coronavirus, clostridium difficile toxins a & b, neorickettsia risticii, clostridium perfringens alpha toxin, lawsonia intracellularis, rhodococcus equi, cryptosporidium spp., and salmonella spp. salmonella was also cultured from overnight selenite enrichment broth. results: the prevalence of infectious pathogens under study was between 0% (lawsonia intracellularis) and 34.6% (equine rotavirus). the overall prevalence for any infectious agent was 63.2% in the gi-diseased group and 43.2% in the healthy group. coinfections were significantly more frequent in the sick group (15 monoinfections vs. 22 coinfections) than in the healthy group (12 vs. 4, respectively, p = 0.0002). six of the 8 infectious agents were associated with the gi-diseased group, the other 2 were not (equine coronavirus and r. equi). conclusions: the use of panels rather than individual tests in combination with quantitative toxin gene analysis enables detection of coinfections significantly  associated with risk of disease. several infectious diseases previously not tested for or considered unimportant were found at high prevalence and require further investigation.

TI  == prevalence of selected enteropathogenic bacteria in hungarian finishing pigs.
AB  == the aim of this study was to obtain prevalence estimates about the most important enteropathogenic bacteria: lawsonia intracellularis, brachyspira hyodysenteriae,  brachyspira pilosicoli, salmonella enterica and clostridium perfringens a and c in hungarian farrow-to-finish pig herds. a total of 31 herds were selected, from  where six pooled faecal samples, each containing three individual rectal faecal samples were collected from fattening pigs of 5-6 months of age. all 186 samples  were examined by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the presence of the pathogens mentioned above. lawsonia intracellularis was found in 29 herds (93.55%) and in 108 samples (58.06%); b. hyodysenteriae in 14 herds (45.16%) and  in 23 samples (12.37%); b. pilosicoli in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 53 samples (28.49%); s. enterica in 17 herds (54.83%) and in 40 samples (21.50%). we detected the presence of c. perfringens a in 19 herds (61.29%) and in 46 samples  (24.73%), while c. perfringens c was found in 8 herds (25.81%) and in 11 samples  (5.91%). all examined herds were infected with one or more of these agents. herds with diarrhoea in the mid- to late finishing phase had almost 10 times higher prevalence of b. hyodysenteriae than herds without such a history.

TI  == comparative pathology of bacterial enteric diseases of swine.
AB  == enteric bacterial infections are among the most common and economically significant diseases affecting swine production worldwide. clinical signs of these infections include diarrhea, reduced growth rate, weight loss, and death of preweaned, weanling, grower-finisher, young and adult age breeding animals. the most common etiological agents include escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, lawsonia intracellularis, salmonella enterica, and brachyspira (serpulina) spp. with the exception of brachyspira (serpulina) hyodysenteriae, the cause of swine  dysentery, and lawsonia intracellularis, the cause of proliferative enteropathy,  the pathological changes seen with these agents closely resemble the diseases occurring in human beings. histological changes in the intestines of swine with enteric bacterial infections include bacterial colonization without significant damage (e.g., certain enterotoxigenic e. coli and c. perfringens type a), attaching and effacing lesions with enteropathogenic e. coli and brachyspira pilosicoli, the cause of colonic spirochetosis, inflammation with s. enterica, and necrotizing and hemorrhagic lesions with certain c. perfringens. extraintestinal spread of bacteria and/or toxins occurs with some serotypes of e. coli and most serotypes of s. enterica. enteric bacterial diseases of swine have  been used as models to study the pathogenesis of similar diseases of human beings. several of these pathogens are also important causes of food-borne disease in humans.
