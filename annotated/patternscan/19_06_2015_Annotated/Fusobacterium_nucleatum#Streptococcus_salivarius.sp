TI  == microflora in oral ecosystems and salivary secretion rates - a 3-year follow-up after radiation therapy to the head and neck region.
AB  == objective: results indicate that late improvements of radiation therapy (rt) in the head and neck region may diminish the long-term effects on salivary glands and oral microflora. the aim was therefore to analyze salivary secretion rates and oral microflora over time in rt subjects. design: twelve dentate subjects (28+/-2 teeth) and 12 controls were included. a clinical examination was performed and the salivary secretion rates were determined. microbial samples, analyzed using cultivation technique, were collected from the soft tissues, supragingival plaque and gingival crevice region. results: compared with the controls, the rt group (n=11) had 3 years post rt higher numbers and proportions  of lactobacilli (p<0.001 and p<0.01) and candida albicans (p<0.01 and p<0.05) in  the supragingival plaque, higher numbers of enterococci in the vestibulum in the  molar region and on the tongue (p<0.05 for both), a lower total count (p<0.001) and lower numbers of streptococci, streptococcus salivarius and fusobacterium nucleatum (p<0.01) on the tongue. although both stimulated and unstimulated salivary secretion rates were increased over time, the proportion of microorganisms associated with oral health decreased, and microorganisms associated with oral disorders increased. despite a comparable oral hygiene, it was only the 27% who had a stimulated salivary secretion rate >/=1.0ml/min and a  buffering capacity >/=6.0, where a recovery of the flora could be seen. conclusion: the results indicate that regaining a normal, stimulated salivary secretion rate and buffering capacity are prerequisites to regaining an oral flora associated with good oral health.

TI  == mechanistic analysis of plga/hpmc-based in-situ forming implants for periodontitis treatment.
AB  == in-situ forming implant formulations based on poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga), acetyltributyl citrate (atbc), minocycline hcl, n-methyl pyrrolidone (nmp) and optionally hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hpmc) were prepared and thoroughly characterized in vitro. this includes electron paramagnetic resonance  (epr), nuclear magnetic resonance (1h nmr), mass change and drug release measurements under different conditions, optical microscopy, size exclusion chromatography (sec) as well as antibacterial activity tests using gingival crevicular fluid samples from periodontal pockets of periodontitis patients. based on these results, deeper insight into the physico-chemical phenomena involved in implant formation and the control of drug release could be gained. for instance, the effects of adding hpmc to the formulations, resulting in improved implant adherence and reduced swelling, could be explained. importantly, the in-situ formed implants effectively hindered the growth of bacteria present in the patients' periodontal pockets. interestingly, the systems were more effectively hindering the growth of pathogenic bacterial strains (e.g., fusobacterium nucleatum) than that of strains with a lower pathogenic potential (e.g., streptococcus salivarius). in vivo, such a preferential action against the pathogenic bacteria can be expected to give a chance to the healthy flora to re-colonize the periodontal pockets.

TI  == regulation of adrenomedullin and nitric oxide production by periodontal bacteria.
AB  == objectives: in periodontitis the host response to bacterial challenge includes activity of the multifunctional molecules adrenomedullin (am) and nitric oxide (no). the aim of this study was to investigate the role of periodontal bacteria in regulating the production of these molecules from cultured cells. material and methods: regulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes when challenged with culture supernatants from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, veillonella atypica, streptococcus salivarius and candida  albicans was examined. am and no were measured in cell culture supernatants using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and the nitrate/nitrite (no metabolites) griess assay respectively. cellular production of am and inducible no synthase was also analysed in target cells by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis. the inter-relationship of am and no production were further investigated with macrophages. results: a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus induced maximal levels of both am and no after 6 and 48 h respectively from oral  keratinocytes. am production in macrophages was upregulated in response to the no donor s-nitrosoglutathione and partially blocked by the inducible no synthase inhibitor, nomega -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride. likewise, no production was increased upon exposure to am, while the am receptor antagonist am 22-52 reduced the release of no. conclusions: pathogens associated with aggressive periodontitis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and c. rectus, were more effective than those associated with chronic periodontitis, p. gingivalis and prev. intermedia, and commensals, s. salivarius and v. atypica, as regards the upregulation of am and no production from oral keratinocytes. interaction between these molecules was also demonstrated with macrophages. understanding the coordinated regulation of am and no production in response to periodontal bacteria may identify ways to promote their protective effects and minimize destructive potential.

TI  == biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: the purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (pds ii(r)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (met) or ciprofloxacin (cip) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. materials and methods: fibrous matrices were processed from pds polymer solution by electrospinning. antibiotic-containing pds solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% met, 25 wt.% met, 5 wt.% cip, and 25 wt.% cip. pure pds was used as a control. high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) was done to evaluate met and cip release. dual-species biofilms formed by lactobacillus casei (lc) and streptococcus salivarius (ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. after 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens fusobacterium nucleatum (fn) and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (aa) using agar diffusion assay. results: a three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. pure pds showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% met (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% met (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% cip (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% cip (765 +/- 288 nm). hplc demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. no inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. meanwhile, cip-containing matrices inhibited growth of fn and aa. conclusion: cip-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. clinical relevance: based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.

TI  == radiography-based score indicative for the pathogenicity of bacteria in odontogenic infections.
AB  == objective: to develop a new radiography-based score to assess the potential of bacteria to cause odontogenic infections derived from the occurrence of bacteria  at small or large radiographical lesions. materials and methods: the patients analyzed were a sub-population from a large randomized clinical trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. routine radiographs were used to analyze the area of the periapical radiolucent lesions. lesions were stratified by their radiographically measured area as large (>9 mm(2)) or small (</=9 mm(2)). a risk ratio was calculated for each species from the frequency of their occurrence in large vs in small lesions. results: fifty-one patients, 19 with abscesses and 32 with infiltrates, were evaluated. overall, the radiographical lesion areas ranged from 0.4-46.2 mm(2) (median = 9 mm(2)). an increased risk (risk ratio >1) to occur at  large abscess lesions was observed for prevotella (p.) oralis, p. buccae, p. oris, p. intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum and streptococcus (strep.) anginosus group. an increased risk to occur at large infiltrate lesions was found for strep. salivarius, strep. parasanguis, strep. anginosus group, capnocytophaga spp., neisseria (n.) sicca, neisseria spp., staphylococcus (staph.) aureus, p. intermedia, p. buccae, prevotella spp. and p. melaninogenica. conclusions: the radiography-based score suggests that certain prevotella spp., f. nucleatum and strep. anginosus groups play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of odontogenic abscesses, and that various streptococci, neisseria spp., capnocytophaga spp., staph. aureus and prevotella spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == the surface layer of tannerella forsythia contributes to serum resistance and oral bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == tannerella forsythia is an anaerobic, gram-negative bacterium involved in the so-called "red complex," which is associated with severe and chronic periodontitis. the surface layer (s-layer) of t. forsythia is composed of cell surface glycoproteins, such as tfsa and tfsb, and is known to play a role in adhesion/invasion and suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression. here we investigated the association of this s-layer with serum resistance and coaggregation with other oral bacteria. the growth of the s-layer-deficient mutant in a bacterial medium containing more than 20% non-heat-inactivated calf serum (cs) or more than 40% non-heat-inactivated human serum was significantly suppressed relative to that of the wild type (wt). next, we used confocal microscopy to perform quantitative analysis on the effect of serum. the survival  ratio of the mutant exposed to 100% non-heat-inactivated cs (76% survival) was significantly lower than that of the wt (97% survival). furthermore, significant  c3b deposition was observed in the mutant but not in the wt. in a coaggregation assay, the mutant showed reduced coaggregation with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, and porphyromonas gingivalis but strong coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum. these results indicated that the s-layer of t. forsythia plays multiple roles in virulence and may be associated with periodontitis.

TI  == comprehensive analysis of bacterial flora in postoperative maxillary cyst fluid by 16s rrna gene and culture methods.
AB  == intracystic fluid was aseptically collected from 11 patients with postoperative maxillary cyst (pomc), and dna was extracted from the pomc fluid. bacterial species were identified by sequencing after cloning of approximately 580 bp of the 16s rrna gene. identification of pathogenic bacteria was also performed by culture methods. the phylogenetic identity was determined by sequencing 517-596 bp in each of the 1139 16s rrna gene clones. a total of 1114 clones were classified while the remaining 25 clones were unclassified. a total of 103 bacterial species belonging to 42 genera were identified in pomc fluid samples by 16s rrna gene analysis. species of prevotella (91%), neisseria (73%), fusobacterium (73%), porphyromonas (73%), and propionibacterium (73%) were found  to be highly prevalent in all patients. streptococcus mitis (64%), fusobacterium  nucleatum (55%), propionibacterium acnes (55%), staphylococcus capitis (55%), and streptococcus salivarius (55%) were detected in more than 6 of the 11 patients. the results obtained by the culture method were different from those obtained by  16s rrna gene analysis, but both approaches may be necessary for the identification of pathogens, especially of bacteria that are difficult to detect  by culture methods, and the development of rational treatments for patients with  pomc.

TI  == salivary beta-galactosidase activity affects physiological oral malodour.
AB  == objectives: previous reports have associated salivary beta-galactosidase activity with non-periodontopathic oral malodour. in this study, we investigated the localization of beta-galactosidase and elucidated the relationship between its enzymatic activity and physiological oral malodour. study design: fifty-six patients complaining of halitosis were separated into two groups: periodontally healthy and periodontitis. saliva samples from the subjects were separated by centrifugation, and the level of beta-galactosidase activity was measured in the  supernatant, pellet lysate, and whole saliva using the chromogenic substrate o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside. the correlation of salivary beta-galactosidase activity with breath odour and associated parameters was examined. results: similar levels of beta-galactosidase activity were detected in the pellet lysate and whole saliva, but not in the saliva supernatant. positive correlations were observed between the beta-galactosidase activity in whole saliva and oral malodour levels in the periodontally healthy group, but not in the periodontitis group. in addition, the plaque index and tongue coating score were positively correlated with beta-galactosidase activity in the periodontally  healthy group. overall, stimulated salivary flow and salivary ph were negatively  correlated with enzyme activity. the amounts of total bacteria, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus salivarius were positively associated with beta-galactosidase activity in the periodontally healthy group. furthermore, the  amounts of total bacteria and s. salivarius were positively associated with the amount of volatile sulphur compounds. conclusions: our results indicate that beta-galactosidase is located on the cell surface of oral bacteria derived from dental plaque and tongue coating, and it plays an important role in producing the malodour underlying physiological oral malodour.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == microbial interactions influence inflammatory host cell responses.
AB  == the inflammatory response plays an important role in the tissue destruction associated with periodontitis. bacterial species can regulate the inflammatory responses of host cells, triggered by pathogens. it was hypothesized that, in the field of oral microbiology/immunology, such effects of bacterial interactions on  inflammatory host cell responses might also be present. in this study, the effects of beneficial, commensal, and pathogenic species on aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production by human cells were investigated. the beneficial species, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis, were able to lower the il-8 production triggered by a. actinomycetemcomitans. the inhibitory effect was also achieved by the application of streptococcal supernatants. in contrast, the commensal streptococcus gordonii caused no reduction, and the pathogen fusobacterium nucleatum increased il-8 production by the host cells. these results show that bacterial species can influence the inflammatory responses of host cells triggered by infection with a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus salivarius with periodontopathogens: evidence for  involvement of fimbriae in the interaction with prevotella intermedia.
AB  == streptococcus salivarius is divided into two serological subgroups that carry either fibrils or fimbriae. although fimbriae have been observed on up to 50% of  s. salivarius strains in the human oral cavity, no function has yet been assigned to them. to determine whether s. salivarius fimbriae have a role in adhesion, we  examined the ability of s. salivarius to coaggregate with selected microorganisms involved in periodontal diseases. our results show that s. salivarius coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia. however, only fimbriated s. salivarius cells were able to  coaggregate with p. intermedia, suggesting a specific role for these structures in the interaction. heat treatment, sensitivity to sugars, amino acids, and edta, as well as protease treatment were also used to further characterize coaggregation between s. salivarius and periodontopathogens.

TI  == subgingival microbiota levels and their associations with periodontal status at the sampled sites in an adult sudanese population using miswak or toothbrush regularly.
AB  == little information is available on the effect of miswak use on gingival microbiota. we assessed levels of 28 oral bacteria in subgingival plaque of adult sudanese miswak (n = 38) and toothbrush users (n = 36) age range 20-53 years (mean 34.6 years) to study associations between these bacteria, oral hygiene method, and periodontal status at the sampled sites. a pooled subgingival plaque  sample from 6 probing sites of 1 selected tooth in each jaw was obtained from each subject. whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization were used in assessing 74 pooled samples. using 10(5) bacterial cells threshold,  between 2.6% and 47.4% of miswak users and between 2.8% and 36.1% of toothbrush users harbored the investigated species. the percentages of subjects with the investigated species at 10(6) bacterial cells varied between 2.6% and 39.5% in miswak and between 2.8% and 36.1% in toothbrush users. miswak users harbored significantly higher streptococcus intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii, and capnocytophaga gingivalis, and significantly lower selenomonas sputigena, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis than did toothbrush users. probing pocket depth > or = 6 mm showed significantly (p <  0.05) higher levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, bacteroides forsythus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and v. parvula than those 4-5 mm. our results indicate that the type of oral hygiene had a significant effect on levels of 11 out of 28 bacterial species, and that the type of effect was also dependent on type of bacteria and probing pocket depth.

TI  == palmitoleic acid isomer (c16:1delta6) in human skin sebum is effective against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the percent lipid composition of pooled human sebum analyzed by thin-layer chromatography was: ceramides (13%), fatty acid (47%), cholesterol (7%), cholesterol esters (2%), squalene (11%), triglycerides (3%), and wax esters (17%). total sebum lipids (2- 4 mg/ml), sonicated into bacterial culture medium,  caused 4- to 5-fold log reduction in growth of gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus salivarius and the anaerobe fusobacterium nucleatum, but was ineffective against most gram-negative bacteria. fractionation of the sebum lipids showed that both saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contained the bulk of the antimicrobial activity. lauric acid (c12:0) was the most active saturated fatty acid. the unsaturated fatty acid, palmitoleic acid (c16:1delta6, cpa) was both the most predominant monoene and the most active antimicrobial fatty acid. purified cpa (>99%) yielded typical minimal inhibitory  concentration (mic) values of 10-20 microg/ml against gram-positive bacteria. organically synthesized cpa isomer gave mic values comparable to the natural material. both natural and synthetic cpa were found to be the most active sebum lipid fraction in blocking the adherence of a pathogenic strain of candida albicans to porcine stratum corneum. ethanol in combination with cpa exerts a synergistic bactericidal activity against gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, propionibacterium acnes, escherichia coli, and  several methacillin-resistant strains of s. aureus. palmitoleic acid may be useful in topical formulations for treatment of secondary gram-positive bacterial infections, as a gram-positive bacteria antimicrobial in wound dressings, and as  a natural gram-positive antimicrobial preservative in skin and hair care products.

AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == disinfection of dental impressions and occlusal records by ultraviolet radiation.
AB  == as chemical disinfection of dental impressions may cause adverse effects on materials and the dental personnel this study examined disinfection by ultraviolet radiation. alginate, addition silicone rubber and red wax contaminated by streptococcus salivarius, fusobacterium nucleatum and five other  bacteria in different suspension media were radiated for up to 18 min, and the number of colony forming units was compared to non-radiated controls. the effect  of ultraviolet radiation differed among bacterial species and depended on the organic content in the suspension. generally, the bacterial reduction after ultraviolet radiation was below 4 log steps and thus insufficient for disinfection of dental impressions.

TI  == an evaluation of the action of different root canal irrigants on facultative aerobic-anaerobic, obligate anaerobic, and microaerophilic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the effect of different concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, chlorhexidine, and cetrimide on the following bacterial strains: facultative aerobes-anaerobes: candida albicans atcc 10231; enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212; escherichia coli atcc 25,922; pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27,853; streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. microaerophiles: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans atcc 29522. obligate anaerobes: actinomyces odontolyticus atcc 17929; fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25,586; porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277; and prevotella melaninogenica atcc 25845. each irrigant was kept in contact with the bacterial species used for the  experiment for 10, 20, or 30 min. results showed that all irrigants had a bactericidal effect on both facultative aerobes-anaerobes and on microaerophilic  and obligate anaerobic strains, in all concentrations and even after short periods of contact.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == the effect of areca nut on salivary and selected oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the growth of salivary and selected oral microorganisms of areca nut, aqueous extracts of the nut, its major alkaloid arecoline and the components tannic acid and catechin of its tannin fraction. the antibacterial properties of the above were tested on streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus salivarius, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum and, as a control, staphylococcus aureus. this was followed by investigating its  effect on salivary organisms cultured from the saliva after chewing boiled areca  nut. extracts inhibited the growth of the selected organisms in a concentration dependent manner, baked and boiled nuts being significantly more potent than raw  nut. growth of c. albicans was the least affected by the nut extracts. tannic acid was strongly antibacterial but not catechin or arecoline. no antibacterial effect could be demonstrated on salivary organisms after chewing the nut for 5 minutes but exposure of saliva to the cud for 1 hour caused a significant depression of bacterial growth. it is concluded that the hydrolysable tannins in  the tannin fraction, which include tannic acid, are responsible for the antibacterial properties of the nut and that prolonged intraoral exposure to the  nut can suppress bacteria in the mouth.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == coagglutination reactions between candida albicans and oral bacteria.
AB  == an agglutination assay for detecting intermicrobial adherence between the cells of candida albicans and various oral bacteria is described. strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, s. mitis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces viscosus all coagglutinated with c. albicans. no interaction could be demonstrated between the cells of bacteroides melaninogenicus and those of c. albicans. preliminary investigations of these interactions suggest that binding of f. nucleatum and a. viscosus to c. albicans  is mediated by bacterial proteins, possibly lectins. other mechanisms must account for the binding of oral streptococci to c. albicans. the possible implications of these findings in relation to oral mucosal colonisation and oral  candidal clearance are discussed.

TI  == microbial ecology of plaque in rats with naturally occurring gingivitis.
AB  == the microbial ecology of adherent plaque was investigated in relation to the pathological findings of gingivitis in plaque-susceptible rats. plaque developed  in the gingiva of the lower incisor in plaque-susceptible rats, but not in plaque-resistant rats, after they were fed a commercial powder diet. with increase in plaque volume, the total counts of bacteria increased 10(9) to 10(11)/g. in the first 3 months, bacteroides species increased and became the predominant population. streptococcus species also increased at the same time. after 9 months, fusobacterium species and oral treponema species were recognized  in increasing numbers. the anaerobic bacteria increased in proportion with the progression of plaque development. bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus salivarius, and other species were isolated. acute gingivitis was observed within 3 months, and subacute-chronic gingivitis was observed between 2 and 12 months. these findings suggest that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == characterization of the adherence properties of streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the adherence and aggregation properties of 46 human oral streptococcus salivarius isolates were examined. a total of 41% of the isolates aggregated with whole human saliva, 50% aggregated with human erythrocytes, and 85% adhered to human buccal epithelial cells. strains that aggregated with saliva and erythrocytes usually reacted with streptococcus group k typing serum whereas the  non-hemagglutinating strains did not. k+ strains also adhered more strongly to human buccal epithelial cells than k- strains. all isolates coaggregated with fusobacterium nucleatum lf and bacteroides asaccharolyticus 2d, 91% coaggregated  with veillonella alcalescens v1, and 50% coaggregated with veillonella parvula v4. s. salivarius hb aggregated with saliva from 15 different human donors and aggregated with human erythrocytes irrespective of the blood group. this strain only weakly aggregated with rat saliva or rat erythrocytes. we isolated mutants which concomitantly lost the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes, aggregate with  saliva, and bind to buccal epithelial cells, but retained their interbacterial aggregation properties. a second class of mutants lost the ability to coaggregate with veillonella, but these mutants retained all of the other aggregation properties. treatment of s. salivarius hb cells with pronase or subtilisin destroyed their ability to aggregate with saliva and erythrocytes and to bind to  buccal epithelial cells. the unique characteristics of the aggregation and adherence reactions were suggested by differences in the rate of loss of activity during protease treatment and in the response to chemical modification. the presence of saliva did not affect hemagglutination and adherence to buccal epithelial cells. binding of the salivary aggregating factor to the bacteria could be distinguished from aggregation on the basis that the latter required divalent cations. the factor involved in coaggregation with f. nucleatum lf was physicochemically different from the other factors, since it was resistant to heat and to extraction with trichloroacetic acid, aqueous phenol, sodium dodecyl  sulfate, and formamide, but was sensitive to proteases and was present in both classes of mutants. coaggregation with v. alcalescens was not sensitive to proteases. a variety of mono- and disaccharides had no influence on any of the reactions tested.
