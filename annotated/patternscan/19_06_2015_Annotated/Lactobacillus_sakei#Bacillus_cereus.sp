TI  == the cyclic antibacterial peptide enterocin as-48: isolation, mode of action, and  possible food applications.
AB  == enterocin as-48 is a circular bacteriocin produced by enterococcus. it contains a 70 amino acid-residue chain circularized by a head-to-tail peptide bond. the conformation of enterocin as-48 is arranged into five alpha-helices with a compact globular structure. enterocin as-48 has a wide inhibitory spectrum on gram-positive bacteria. sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria increases in combination with outer-membrane permeabilizing treatments. eukaryotic cells are bacteriocin-resistant. this cationic peptide inserts into bacterial membranes and causes membrane permeabilization, leading ultimately to cell death. microarray analysis revealed sets of up-regulated and down-regulated genes in bacillus cereus cells treated with sublethal bacteriocin concentration. enterocin as-48 can be purified in two steps or prepared as lyophilized powder from cultures in whey-based substrates. the potential applications of enterocin as-48 as a food biopreservative have been corroborated against foodborne pathogens and/or toxigenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica) and spoilage bacteria (alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, bacillus spp., paenibacillus spp., geobacillus stearothermophilus, brochothrix thermosphacta, staphylococcus carnosus, lactobacillus sakei and other spoilage lactic acid bacteria). the efficacy of enterocin as-48 in food systems increases greatly in combination with chemical preservatives, essential oils, phenolic compounds, and physico-chemical treatments such as sublethal heat, high-intensity pulsed-electric fields or high  hydrostatic pressure.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  == the biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. the objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic lab from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.lab were isolated using mrs and m17 media. the agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen  for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (bls) producing lab using lactobacillus sakei and listeria innocua as indicator organisms. out of 138 lab isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains  of enterococcus faecium, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus casei and lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16s rrna gene sequencing. eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees c and 20 degrees c against l. innocua, escherichia coli, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas fluorescens, erwinia carotovora, and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against penicillium expansum, botrytis cinerea and monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. the effect of selected lab strains on l. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.twenty percent of our isolates produced bls inhibiting the growth of l. innocua and/or lact. sakei. organic acids and/or h2o2 produced by lab and not  the bls had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of e. coli. ent. faecium, strep. thermophilus and lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and l. innocua inoculated  onto fresh-cut onions. bacteriocinogenic lab present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.

TI  == the role of two families of bacterial enzymes in putrescine synthesis from agmatine via agmatine deiminase.
AB  == putrescine, one of the main biogenic amines associated to microbial food spoilage, can be formed by bacteria from arginine via ornithine decarboxylase (odc), or from agmatine via agmatine deiminase (agdi). this study aims to correlate putrescine production from agmatine to the pathway involving n-carbamoylputrescine formation via addi (the agua product) and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (the agub product), or putrescine carbamoyltransferase (the ptca product) in bacteria. pcr methods were developed to detect the two genes involved in putrescine production from agmatine. putrescine production from agmatine could be linked to the agua and ptca genes in lactobacillus hilgardii x1b, enterococcus faecalis atcc 11700, and bacillus cereus atcc 14579. by contrast lactobacillus sakei 23k was unable to produce putrescine, and although a fragment of dna corresponding to the gene agua was amplified, no amplification was observed for the ptca gene. pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 produces putrescine and is reported to harbour agua and agub genes, responsible for agmatine deiminase and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activities. the enzyme from p. aeruginosa pao1 that converts n-carbamoylputrescine to putrescine (the agub product) is different from other microorganisms studied (the ptca product). therefore, the agub gene from p. aeruginosa pao1 could not be amplified with ptca-specific primers. the agub and ptca genes have frequently been erroneously annotated in the past, as in fact these two enzymes are neither homologous nor analogous. furthermore, the agua, agub and ptca sequences available from genbank were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, revealing that gram-positive bacteria harboured ptca, whereas gram-negative bacteria harbour agub. this paper also discusses the role of the agmatine deiminase system (agds) in acid stress resistance.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == characterization of a 3944 da bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus mundtii st15, with activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == strain st15, isolated from soy beans, and identified as enterococcus mundtii, produces a 3944 da bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium sp., clostridium tyrobutyricum, acinetobacter baumanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and streptococcus caprinus. bacteriocin st15 is inactivated by proteinase k, pronase, pepsin, protease and triton x-114, but not when treated with catalase, alpha-amylase, triton x-100, sds, tween 20, tween 80, urea and edta. no change in activity was recorded after 2 h at ph values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100  degrees c for 90 min. activity was, however, lost after treatment at 121 degrees  c for 20 min. the mode of activity is bactericidal. the highest level of activity (51200 au ml(-1)) was recorded when cells were grown in mrs broth, ph 6.5. bacteriocin st15 differs from other broad-spectrum bacteriocins described for enterococcus spp. by being active against gram-negative bacteria and by being smaller.
