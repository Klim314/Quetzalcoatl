TI  == short communication: in vitro assessment of antioxidant, antibacterial and phytochemical analysis of peel of citrus sinensis.
AB  == antibacterial effect of citrus sinensis peel extracts was evaluated against several pathogenic bacteria associated with human and fish infections viz., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus epidermidis, serratia marcesnces,  shigella flexneri, enterobacter amnigenus, salmonella typhimurium and serratia odorifera. methanol, ethanol, chloroform and diethyl ether solvents were used for extraction. in vitro antibacterial activity was analyzed by agar well and agar disc diffusion methods. it was found that ethanol extract showed highly significant inhibition of e. coli and k. pneumonia (12.6+/-0.94 mm and 11.6+/-1.2 mm) whereas methanol extract of c. sinensis also showed high zone of inhibition of s. odorifera (10.0+/-2.16 mm). the potential activity of active extracts was assessed and also compared with standard antibiotics through activity index formulation. the order of antioxidant activity through abts.+ and dpph free radical scavenging activity was ethanol>methanol>chloroform>diethyl ether. phytochemical screening of all solvents had determined the presence of terpenoids, alkaloids, steroids, glycosides and flavonoids. it was also found that chloroform/methanol (5:5) and butanol/ethanol/water (4:1:2.2) solvent systems showed significant separation of active phytochemical constituents. these findings reveal the potential use of c. sinensis peel to treat infectious diseases, which are being caused by microorganisms.

TI  == antibiotic resistance patterns in fecal bacteria isolated from christmas shearwater (puffinus nativitatis) and masked booby (sula dactylatra) at remote easter island.
AB  == antibiotic use and its implications have been discussed extensively in the past decades. this situation has global consequences when antibiotic resistance becomes widespread in the intestinal bacterial flora of stationary and migratory  birds. this study investigated the incidence of fecal bacteria and general antibiotic resistance, with special focus on extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) isolates, in two species of seabirds at remote easter island. we identified 11 species of bacteria from masked booby (sula dactylatra) and christmas shearwater (puffinus nativitatis); five species of gram-negative bacilli, four species of streptococcus (enterococcus), and 2 species of staphylococcus. in addition, 6 types of bacteria were determined barely to the genus level. general antibiotic susceptibility was measured in the 30 isolated enterobacteriaceae to 11 antibiotics used in human and veterinary medicine. the 10 isolates that showed a phenotypic esbl profile were verified by clavulanic acid inhibition in double mixture discs with cefpodoxime, and two esbl strains were found, one strain in masked booby and one strain in christmas shearwater. the two bacteria harboring the esbl type were identified as serratia odorifera biotype 1, which has zoonotic importance. despite minimal human presence in the masked booby and christmas shearwater habitats, and the extreme geographic isolation of easter island, we found several multiresistant bacteria and even two isolates with esbl phenotypes. the finding of esbls has animal and public health  significance and is of potential concern, especially because the investigation was limited in size and indicated that antibiotic-resistant bacteria now are distributed globally.

TI  == bacterial colonization of intravenous catheters in young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence of bacterial colonization of iv catheters  among young dogs suspected to have parvoviral enteritis, to identify the organisms responsible for catheter colonization, and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of organisms that were obtained. design: case series. animals: 100 dogs. procedure: catheters were aseptically removed when fluid therapy was discontinued, the catheter was replaced, or the dog died. the distal tip of the catheter was cut off, split open, and vortexed with sterile saline (0.9% nacl) solution. the saline solution was plated on culture plates, which were then incubated and examined for bacterial growth every 24 hours for 72 hours. all bacteria cultured were identified, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined. results: bacteria were isolated from 22 catheters. most bacteria  that were isolated were of gastrointestinal tract or environmental origin (serratia odorifera, s. liquefaciens, s. marcescens, acinobacter anitratus, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp). only 2 gram-positive organisms were isolated (staphylococcus intermedius and streptococcus spp). high percentages of organisms were resistant  to penicillin, lincomycin, cloxacillin, erythromycin, and cephalexin. percentages of organisms resistant to amikacin, enrofloxacin, chloramphenicol, potentiated sulfonamides, and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were low. conclusions and clinical  relevance: results suggest that iv catheters may be colonized with bacteria in 22% of young dogs suspected to have parvovirus infection.

TI  == gadolinium-based mr contrast media: potential for growth of microbial contaminants when single vials are used for multiple patients.
AB  == objective: to assess potential risk if single-dose vials of gadolinium-based contrast media are used for multiple patients. the use of multidose vials can pose a significant risk if contaminants are accidentally introduced into the vials and proliferate. therefore, we tested the ability of gadolinium-based contrast to support the growth of a variety of microbial pathogens. materials and methods: we collected the unused portions of 15 single-use vials of gadolinium-based contrast media. the residual contrast material was refrigerated  after use and checked for sterility prior to inoculation with a selection of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria and yeast. contrast material was incubated at room temperature and at 4 degrees c, and quantitative cultures were  performed at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hr and at 7 days. results: no microbial growth occurred from cultures of the used contrast solutions prior to inoculation. none  of the organisms tested in our study proliferated in the contrast material. all test organisms persisted at least 48 hr after inoculation at both temperatures. at 7 days, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus epidermidis, and corynebacterium  jeikeium were recovered in significant quantities. colony counts of serratia odorifera rapidly decreased at room temperature but persisted beyond 7 days at 4  degrees c. conclusion: the risk of contaminating vials of contrast agents punctured aseptically is small. our study demonstrates a lack of proliferation of organisms in the two gadolinium-based compounds tested, suggesting that these solutions could be used for more than one procedure.
