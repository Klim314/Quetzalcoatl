TI  - Effect of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates on the growth of aerobic heterotrophic cultivable bacteria isolated from an agricultural soil.
AB  - An enrichment culture technique was used to isolate soil bacteria capable of growing in the presence of two different concentrations of linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) (10 and 500 microg ml(-1)). Nine bacterial strains, representatives of the major colony types of aerobic heterotrophic cultivable bacteria in the enriched samples, were isolated and subsequently identified by PCR-amplification and partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Amongst the isolates, strains LAS05 (Pseudomonas syringae), LAS06 (Staphylococcus epidermidis), LAS07 (Delftia tsuruhatensis), LAS08 (Staphylococcus epidermidis) and LAS09 (Enterobacter aerogenes), were able to grow in pure culture in dialysed soil media amended with LAS (50 microg ml(-1)). The three Gram-negative strains grew to higher cell numbers in the presence of 50 microg ml(-1) of LAS, compared to LAS-unamended dialysed soil medium, and were selected for further testing of their ability to use LAS as carbon source. However, HPLC analysis of culture supernatants showed that the three strains can tolerate but not degrade LAS when grown in pure cultures. A higher concentration of soluble phosphates was recorded in dialysed soil media amended with LAS (50 microg ml(-1)) compared to unamended control media, suggesting an effect of the surfactant that enhanced the bioavailability of P from soil. The presence of LAS at a concentration of 50 microg ml(-1) had an important impact on growth of selected aerobic heterotrophic soil bacteria, a deleterious effect which may be relevant for the normal function and evolution of agricultural soil.
TI  - Preliminary investigations on inducing salt tolerance in maize through inoculation with rhizobacteria containing ACC deaminase activity.
AB  - Twenty rhizobacterial strains containing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase were isolated from the rhizosphere of salt-affected maize fields. They were screened for their growth-promoting activities under axenic conditions at 1, 4, 8, and 12 dS x m-1 salinity levels. Based upon the data of the axenic study, the 6 most effective strains were selected to conduct pot trials in the wire house. Besides one original salinity level (1.6 dS x m-1), 3 other salinity levels (4, 8, and 12 dS x m-1) were maintained in pots and maize seeds inoculated with selected strains of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, as well as uninoculated controls were sown. Results showed that the increase in salinity level decreased the growth of maize seedlings. However, inoculation with rhizobacterial strains reduced this depression effect and improved the growth and yield at all the salinity levels tested. Selected strains significantly increased plant height, root length, total biomass, cob mass, and grain yield up to 82%, 93%, 51%, 40%, and 50%, respectively, over respective uninoculated controls at the electrical conductivity of 12 dS x m-1. Among various plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial strains, S5 (Pseudomonas syringae), S14 (Enterobacter aerogenes), and S20 (Pseudomonas fluorescens) were the most effective strains for promoting the growth and yield of maize, even at high salt stress. The relatively better salt tolerance of inoculated plants was associated with a high K+/Na+ ratio as well as high relative water and chlorophyll and low proline contents.
TI  - Medicinal smoke reduces airborne bacteria.
AB  - This study represents a comprehensive analysis and scientific validation of our ancient knowledge about the effect of ethnopharmacological aspects of natural products' smoke for therapy and health care on airborne bacterial composition and dynamics, using the Biolog microplate panels and Microlog database. We have observed that 1h treatment of medicinal smoke emanated by burning wood and a mixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs (havan samagri=material used in oblation to fire all over India), on aerial bacterial population caused over 94% reduction of bacterial counts by 60 min and the ability of the smoke to purify or disinfect the air and to make the environment cleaner was maintained up to 24h in the closed room. Absence of pathogenic bacteria Corynebacterium urealyticum, Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens, Enterobacter aerogenes (Klebsiella mobilis), Kocuria rosea, Pseudomonas syringae pv. persicae, Staphylococcus lentus, and Xanthomonas campestris pv. tardicrescens in the open room even after 30 days is indicative of the bactericidal potential of the medicinal smoke treatment. We have demonstrated that using medicinal smoke it is possible to completely eliminate diverse plant and human pathogenic bacteria of the air within confined space.
TI  - Bacterial species specificity in proU osmoinducibility and nptII and lacZ expression.
AB  - Reporter gene-based transcriptional fusions are increasingly being used to address questions in microbial ecology, with constitutively expressed fusions enabling microbe tracking and inducible fusions reporting the presence of environmental signals. To more readily apply this technology to a variety of bacterial species, we examined species specificity in the expression of three promoters of interest. A comparison of two potentially constitutive promoters, each fused to the reporter gene gfp, showed that the nptII promoter (P(nptII)) was expressed in a broader range of species (100% of 11 tested) than the lacZ promoter (P(lacZ)) (75% of 11 tested), and thus has broader applicability for marking bacteria than P(lacZ). For the species that expressed P(lacZ), however,P(lacZ) was expressed 3-fold more than P(nptII), on average. The Escherichia coli proU promoter, which is induced by low water potential in E. coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Pantoea agglomerans, and Pseudomonas syringae, was shown to be similarly responsive to water potential in strains of Clavibacter michiganensis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as mildly osmoresponsive in Agrobacterium tumefaciens, supporting its broad use as a reporter of water potential. Surprisingly, this promoter was not regulated by water potential in strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Erwinia amylovora, illustrating heretofore unrecognized species specificity in proU inducibility, as well as potential limitations in the species that can serve as bioreporters of water potential.
