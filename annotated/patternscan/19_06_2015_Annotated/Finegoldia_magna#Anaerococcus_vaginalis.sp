TI  == identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci by maldi-tof mass spectrometry.
AB  == gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) are part of the commensal microbiota of humans and are a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of organisms. to evaluate the suitability of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof ms) for the identification of gpac, a database was constructed, using reference strains of commonly encountered gpac and clinical isolates of which the sequence of the 16s rrna gene was determined. subsequently, the database was validated by identifying 107 clinical isolates of gpac. results  were compared with the identifications obtained by 16s sequencing or fluorescent  in situ hybridization (fish). strains belonging to the same species grouped together, in most cases, by maldi-tof ms analyses. strains with sequence similarities less than 98% to their closest relatives, formed clusters distinct from recognized species in the maldi-tof ms dendrogram and, therefore could not be identified. these strains probably represent new species. only three clinical  isolates (2 strains of finegoldia magna and 1 strain of anaerococcus vaginalis) could not be identified. for all the other gpac strains (96/107), reliable identifications were obtained. therefore, we concluded that maldi-tof ms is an excellent tool for the identification of phylogenetically heterogeneous groups of micro-organisms such as gpac.

TI  == development of 16s rrna-based probes for the identification of gram-positive anaerobic cocci isolated from human clinical specimens.
AB  == fluorescent probes targeted at 16s rrna were designed for peptostreptococcus anaerobius and peptostreptococcus stomatis (pana134), parvimonas micra (pamic1435), finegoldia magna (fmag1250), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (pnasa1254), peptoniphilus ivorii (pnivo731), peptoniphilus harei (pnhar1466), anaerococcus vaginalis (avag1280) and anaerococcus lactolyticus (alac1438), based on the 16s rrna sequences of reference strains and 88 randomly chosen clinical isolates. these strains were also used for validation of the probes. application  of the probes to an additional group of 100 clinical isolates revealed that 87% of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) could be identified with this set of probes. the 16s rrnas of 13 clinical isolates that could not be identified were sequenced. most of these isolates were gpac that were not targeted by the probes. no clinical isolates of pn. asaccharolyticus were encountered. near full-length sequences were obtained from 71 of 101 (n = 88 + 13) sequenced clinical isolates. of these, 25 showed <98% similarity with the homologues of the closest established species. the fmag1250, pamic1435, pnhar1466, pana134, pnasa1254 and pnivo731 probes allowed reliable identification and hybridised with all corresponding isolates. the avag1280 and alac1438 probes failed to hybridise with two isolates and one isolate, respectively, because of intra-species variation. however, overall, the set of probes yielded fast and reliable identification for  the majority of clinical isolates.

TI  == rapid identification of gram-positive anaerobic coccal species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus by multiplex pcr assays using genus- and species-specific primers.
AB  == here, a rapid and reliable two-step multiplex pcr assay for identifying 14 gram-positive anaerobic cocci (gpac) species originally classified in the genus peptostreptococcus (anaerococcus hydrogenalis, anaerococcus lactolyticus, anaerococcus octavius, anaerococcus prevotii, anaerococcus tetradius, anaerococcus vaginalis, finegoldia magna, micromonas micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, peptoniphilus harei, peptoniphilus indolicus, peptoniphilus ivorii and peptoniphilus lacrimalis) is reported. fourteen type strains representing 14 gpac species were first identified to the genus level by multiplex pcr (multiplex pcr-g). since three of these genera (finegoldia, micromonas and peptostreptococcus) contain only a single species, f. magna, m. micros and p. anaerobius, respectively, these organisms were identified to the species level directly by using the multiplex pcr-g. then six species of the genus anaerococcus (a. hydrogenalis, a. lactolyticus, a. octavius, a. prevotii, a. vaginalis and a. tetradius) were further identified to the species level using multiplex pcr assays (multiplex pcr-ia and multiplex pcr-ib). similarly, five species of the genus peptoniphilus (pn. asaccharolyticus, pn. harei, pn. indolicus, pn. ivorii and pn. lacrimalis) were identified to the species level using multiplex pcr-iia and multiplex pcr-iib. the established two-step multiplex pcr identification scheme was applied to the identification of 190 clinical isolates of gpac species that had been identified previously to the  species level by 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic tests. the identification obtained from multiplex pcr assays showed 100 % agreement with 16s rdna sequencing identification, but only 65 % (123/190) agreement with the identification obtained by phenotypic tests. the multiplex pcr scheme established in this study is a simple, rapid and reliable method for the identification of gpac species. it will permit a more accurate assessment of the role of various gpac species in infection and of the degree of antimicrobial resistance in each of the group members.
