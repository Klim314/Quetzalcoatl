TI  == molecular analysis and identification of the radc gene from the phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus b10.
AB  == the radc gene, whose product plays a role in the prokaryotic repair of dna damage after uv and x-ray irradiation, was cloned and sequenced from the phototrophic bacterium rhodobacter capsulatus b10. the gene codes for a protein of 214 amino acids with a molecular mass of 23,792 da. the deduced amino acid sequence showed  significant homology with the radc proteins of escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis and haemophilus influenzae. northern blot analysis indicated that under  both chemotrophic and phototrophic growth conditions the radc gene was relatively highly expressed and was induced about five-fold after uv-irradiation. primer extension analysis revealed that transcription was initiated from the same position before and after uv treatment. mutants (radc negative) have a low survival rate and a slower growth rate than the wild type.

TI  == the structural and functional organization of h-ns-like proteins is evolutionarily conserved in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the structural gene of the h-ns protein, a global regulator of bacterial metabolism, has been identified in the group of enterobacteria as well as in closely related bacteria, such as erwinia chrysanthemi and haemophilus influenzae. isolated outside these groups, the bph3 protein of bordetella pertussis exhibits a low amino acid conservation with h-ns, particularly in the n-terminal domain. to obtain information on the structure, function and/or evolution of h-ns, we searched for other h-ns-related proteins in the latest databases. we found that hvra, a trans-activator protein in rhodobacter capsulatus, has a low but significant similarity with h-ns and h-ns-like proteins. this gram-negative bacterium is phylogenetically distant from escherichia coli. using theoretical analysis (e.g. secondary structure prediction and dna binding domain modelling) of the amino acid sequence of h-ns, stpa (an h-ns-like protein in e. coli), bph3 and hvra and by in vivo and in vitro experiments (e.g. complementation of various h-ns-related phenotypes and competitive gel shift assay), we present evidence that these proteins belong to the same class of dna binding proteins. in silico analysis suggests that this family also includes spb in r. sphaeroides, xrva in xanthomonas oryzae and vich in vibrio cholerae. these results demonstrate that proteins structurally and functionally related to h-ns are widespread in gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == overexpression in escherichia coli of the rnf genes from rhodobacter capsulatus--characterization of two membrane-bound iron-sulfur proteins.
AB  == the rnf genes of rhodobacter capsulatus, essential for nitrogen fixation, are thought to encode a system for electron transport to nitrogenase. in the present  study, we have attempted to overexpress the rnf genes in escherichia coli to investigate the molecular properties of the corresponding proteins. corrections were made to the published dna sequence of the rnf operon, resulting in the identification of two genes, rnfg and rnfh. the rnfabcdgeh operon thus comprises  seven genes and shows similarities in gene arrangement and deduced protein sequences to homologous regions in the genomes of haemophilus influenzae and e. coli. four of the rnf gene products were found to be similar in sequence to components of an na+-dependent nadh:ubiquinone oxidoreductase from vibrio alginolyticus. three of the rnf genes were successfully overexpressed in e. coli  as his-tagged polypeptides, whereas the products of rnfa, rnfd and rnfe, predicted to be transmembrane proteins, could not be stably maintained in e. coli. the rnfb and rnfc gene products were isolated as two brown proteins with apparent molecular-mass values of 25 kda and 55 kda, respectively. rnfb was shown to contain one [2fe-2s] cluster, based on absorption spectrophotometry, epr spectroscopy and iron content. recombinant rnfc contained at least one iron-sulfur cluster, most likely of the [4fe-4s] type. unambiguous identification of the prosthetic groups was, however, precluded by the extreme instability of this protein. in r. capsulatus, rnfb and rnfc were found by immunoblot analysis to be tightly bound to the membrane, despite their hydrophilic character. the rnfb and rnfc proteins were absent in mutant strains bearing insertions at various positions within the rnfabcdgeh operon, suggesting that their stability depends on the cosynthesis of the other rnf gene products. we observed that iron  limitation during growth resulted in a decrease both in the cellular content of rnfb and in the level of transcription of the rnfabcdgeh operon, indicating that  the expression of this operon is regulated as a function of iron availability.

TI  == molybdate transport and regulation in bacteria.
AB  == molybdate is transported in bacteria by a high-affinity transport system composed of a periplasmic binding protein, an integral membrane protein, and an energizer  protein. these three proteins are coded by moda, modb, and modc genes, respectively. the moda, modb, and modc proteins from various organisms (escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, azotobacter vinelandii, and rhodobacter capsulatus) are very similar. the lowest km value reported for molybdate in the molybdate transport process is approximately 50 nm. in a mod mutant, molybdate is transported by the sulfate transport system or by a nonspecific anion transporter. molybdate transport is tightly coupled to utilization in e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, while other dinitrogen-fixing organisms appear to have a molybdenum storage protein. in all organisms studied so far, molybdate transport genes are regulated by a repressor protein, mode. the mode-molybdate complex binds to the sequences tayat (y = t or c) in the operator/ promoter region in e. coli and prevents transcription of the modabcd operon. the  mode-molybdate complex binds to dna as a homodimer in e. coli and possibly in other organisms as well. in r. capsulatus, however, two mode homologues (mopab proteins) are required for repression.

TI  == trap transporters: a new family of periplasmic solute transport systems encoded by the dctpqm genes of rhodobacter capsulatus and by homologs in diverse gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the dct locus of rhodobacter capsulatus encodes a high-affinity transport system  for the c4-dicarboxylates malate, succinate, and fumarate. the nucleotide sequence of the region downstream of the previously sequenced dctp gene (encoding a periplasmic c4-dicarboxylate-binding protein) was determined. two open reading  frames (orfs) of 681 bp (dctq) and 1,320 bp (dctm) were identified as additional  dct genes by insertional mutagenesis and complementation studies. dctq (24,763 da) and dctm (46,827 da) had hydropathic profiles consistent with the presence of 4 and 12 potential transmembrane segments, respectively, and were localized in the cytoplasmic membrane fraction after heterologous expression of the dctqm orfs in escherichia coli. dctp, dctq, and dctm were found to be unrelated to known transport proteins in the abc (atp-binding cassette) superfamily but were shown to be homologous with the products of previously unidentified orfs in a number of gram-negative bacteria, including bordetella pertussis, e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, haemophilus influenzae, and synechocystis sp. strain pcc6803. an additional orf (rypa) downstream of dctm encodes a protein with sequence similarity to eukaryotic protein-tyrosine phosphatases, but interposon mutagenesis of this orf did not result in a dct- phenotype. complementation of a  rhizobium meliloti dctabd deletion mutant by heterologous expression of the dctpqm genes from r. capsulatus demonstrated that no additional structural genes  were required to form a functional transport system. transport via the dct system was vanadate insensitive, and in uncoupler titrations with intact cells, the decrease in the rate of succinate transport correlated closely with the fall in membrane potential but not with the cellular atp concentration, implying that the proton motive force, rather than atp hydrolysis, drives uptake. it is concluded that the r. capsulatus dct system is a new type of periplasmic secondary transporter and that similar, hitherto-unrecognized systems are widespread in gram-negative bacteria. the name trap (for tripartite atp-independent periplasmic) transporters is proposed for this new group.

TI  == membrane localization, topology, and mutual stabilization of the rnfabc gene products in rhodobacter capsulatus and implications for a new family of energy-coupling nadh oxidoreductases.
AB  == the rnf genes in rhodobacter capsulatus are unique nitrogen fixation genes that encode potential membrane proteins (rnfa, rnfd, and rnfe) and potential iron-sulfur proteins (rnfb and rnfc). in this study, we first analyzed the localization and topology of the rnfa, rnfb, and rnfc proteins. by activity and immunoblot analysis of expression of translational fusions to escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, rnfa protein was shown to span the chromatophore membrane with its odd-numbered hydrophilic regions exposed to periplasm. by alkaline treatment of membrane fractions and following immunoblot analysis using antibodies against recombinant proteins expressed in e. coli, both rnfb and rnfc  proteins were revealed to situate at the periphery of the chromatophore membranes. second, mutual interaction of the rnf proteins was analyzed by immunochemical determinations of rnfb and rnfc proteins in rnf mutants and their  complemented derivatives. the contents in cellular fractions indicated that rnfb  and rnfc stabilize each other and that the presence of rnfa is necessary for stable existence of both proteins. these results support a hypothesis that the rnf products are subunits of a membrane complex. finally, we detected homologs of rnf genes in haemophilus influenzae and vibrio alginolyticus by data base searches and in e. coli by cloning of a fragment of an rnfa homolog followed by a data base search. close comparisons revealed that rnfc has potential binding sites for nadh and fmn which are similar to those found in proton-translocating nadh:quinone oxidoreductases and that rnfa, rnfd, and rnfe show similarity to subunits of sodium-translocating nadh:quinone oxidoreductases. we predict that the putative rnf complex represents a novel family of energy-coupling nadh oxidoreductases.

TI  == repression of the escherichia coli modabcd (molybdate transport) operon by mode.
AB  == the modabc gene products constitute the molybdate-specific transport system in escherichia coli. another operon coding for two proteins which diverges from the  modabcd operon has been identified. the first gene of this operon codes for a 262-amino-acid protein, designated mode (28 kda), and the second genes codes for  a 490-amino-acid protein. modf (54 kda). the role of modf has not yet been determined; however, mutations in mode depressed modabcd transcription even in the presence of molybdate, suggesting that mode is a repressor. mode, in the presence of 1 mm molybdate, repressed the production of plasmid-encoded moda and  modb' proteins in an in vitro transcription-translation system. dna mobility shift experiments confirmed that mode binds to an oligonucleotide derived from the operator region of the modabcd operon. further experimentation indicated that mode binding to target dna minimally requires an 8-bp inverted-repeat sequence, taac gita. a highly conserved amino acid sequence, tsarnoxxg (amino acids 125 to  133), was identified in mode and homologs from azotobacter vinelandii, haemophilus influenzae, rhodobacter capsulatus, and clostridium pasterianum. mutants with mutations in either t or g of this amino acid sequence were isolated as "superrepressor" mutants. these mutant proteins repressed modabcd transcription even in the absence of molybdate, which implies that this stretch of amino acids is essential for the binding of molybdate by the mode protein. these results show that molybdate transport in e. coli is regulated by mode, which acts as a repressor when bound to molybdate.
