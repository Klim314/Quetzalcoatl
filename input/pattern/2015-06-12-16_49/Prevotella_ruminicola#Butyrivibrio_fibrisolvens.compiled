TI  - Effects of vanillin, quillaja saponin, and essential oils on in vitro fermentation and protein-degrading microorganisms of the rumen.
AB  - This study investigated the effects of vanillin on methanogenesis and rumen fermentation, and the responses of ruminal protein-degrading bacteria to vanillin (at concentrations of 0, 0.76 and 1.52 g/L), essential oils (clove oil, 1 g/L; origanum oil, 0.50 g/L, and peppermint oil, 1 g/L), and quillaja saponin (at concentration of 0 and 6 g/L) in vitro. Methane production, degradabilities of feed substrate, and ammonia concentration decreased linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. Concentration of total volatile fatty acids also decreased, whereas proportion of butyrate tended to increase linearly with increasing doses of vanillin. Protozoa population decreased, but abundances of Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Prevotella bryantii, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Prevotella ruminicola, Clostridium aminophilum, and Ruminobacter amylophilus increased with increasing doses of vanillin. Origanum and clove oils resulted in lower ammonia concentrations compared to control and peppermint oil. All the tested essential oils decreased abundances of protozoa, Selenomonas ruminantium, R. amylophilus, P. ruminicola and P. bryantii, with the largest decrease resulted from origanum oil followed by clove oil and peppermint oil. The abundances of Megasphaera elsdenii, C. aminophilum, and Clostridium sticklandii were deceased by origanum oil while that of B. fibrisolvens was lowered by both origanum and clove oils. Saponin decreased ammonia concentration and protozoal population, but increased the abundances of S. ruminantium, R. amylophilus, P. ruminicola, and P. bryantii, though the magnitude was small (less than one log unit). The results suggest that reduction of ammonia production by vanillin and saponin may not be caused by direct inhibition of major known proteolytic bacteria, and essential oils can have different inhibitory effects on different proteolytic bacteria, resulting in varying reduction in ammonia production.
TI  - Effects of soybean small peptides on rumen fermentation and on intestinal and total tract digestion of luxi yellow cattle.
AB  - Four Luxi beef cattle (400+/-10 kg) fitted with ruminal, duodenal and ileal cannulas were used in a 4x4 Latin square to assess the effects of soybean small peptide (SSP) infusion on rumen fermentation, diet digestion and flow of nutrient in the gastrointestinal tract. The ruminal infusion of SSP was 0 (control), 100, 200 and 300 g/d. Ruminal SSP infusion linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased microbial protein synthesis and rumen ammonia-N concentration. Concentrations of total volatile fatty acid were linearly increased (p = 0.029) by infusion SSP. Rumen samples were obtained for analysis of microbial ecology by real-time PCR. Populations of rumen Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ciliate protozoa, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Prevotella ruminicola were expressed as a proportion of total Rumen bacterial 16S ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA). Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations which related to total bacterial 16S rDNA were increased (p<0.05), while Streptococcus bovis populations were linearly (p = 0.049) and quadratically (p = 0.020) decreased by infusion of SSP. Apparent rumen digestibility of DM and NDF were (Q, p<0.05; L, p<0.05) increased with infusion SSP. Total tract digestion of DM, OM and NDF were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased by infusing SSP. The flow of total amino acids (AA), essential amino acids (EAA) and individual amino acids were linearly (p<0.01) and quadratically (p<0.01) increased with infusion SSP. The digestibility of Lysine was quadratically (p = 0.033) increased and apparent degradability of Arginine was linearly (p = 0.032) and quadratically (p = 0.042) increased with infusion SSP. The results indicated that infusion SSP could improve nutrient digestion, ruminal fermentation and AA availability.
TI  - Effects of disodium fumarate on ruminal fermentation and microbial communities in sheep fed on high-forage diets.
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate effects of disodium fumarate (DF) on fermentation characteristics and microbial populations in the rumen of Hu sheep fed on high-forage diets. Two complementary feeding trials were conducted. In Trial 1, six Hu sheep fitted with ruminal cannulae were randomly allocated to a 2 x 2 cross-over design involving dietary treatments of either 0 or 20 g DF daily. Total DNA was extracted from the fluid- and solid-associated rumen microbes, respectively. Numbers of 16S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen methanogens and bacteria, and 18S rDNA gene copies associated with rumen protozoa and fungi were measured using real-time PCR, and expressed as proportion of total rumen bacteria 16S rDNA. Ruminal pH decreased in the DF group compared with the control (P < 0.05). Total volatile fatty acids increased (P < 0.001), but butyrate decreased (P < 0.01). Addition of DF inhibited the growth of methanogens, protozoa, fungi and Ruminococcus flavefaciens in fluid samples. Both Ruminococcus albus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens populations increased (P < 0.001) in particle-associated samples. Trial 2 was conducted to investigate the adaptive response of rumen microbes to DF. Three cannulated sheep were fed on basal diet for 2 weeks and continuously for 4 weeks with supplementation of DF at a level of 20 g/day. Ruminal samples were collected every week to analyze fermentation parameters and microbial populations. No effects of DF were observed on pH, acetate and butyrate (P > 0.05). Populations of methanogens and R. flavefaciens decreased in the fluid samples (P < 0.001), whereas addition of DF stimulated the population of solid-associated Fibrobacter succinogenes. Population of R. albus increased in the 2nd to 4th week in fluid-associated samples and was threefold higher in the 4th week than control week in solid samples. Analysis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis fingerprints revealed that there were significant changes in rumen microbiota after adding DF. Ten of 15 clone sequences from cut-out bands appearing in both the 2nd and the 4th week were 94% to 100% similar to Prevotella-like bacteria, and four sequences showed 95% to 98% similarity to Selenomonas dianae. Another 15 sequences were obtained from bands, which appeared in the 4th week only. Thirteen of these 15 sequences showed 95% to 99% similarity to Clostridium sp., and the other two showed 95% and 100% similarity to Ruminococcus sp. In summary, the microorganisms positively responding to DF addition were the cellulolytic bacteria, R. albus, F. succinogenes and B. fibrisolvens as well as proteolytic bacteria, B. fibrisolvens, P. ruminicola and Clostridium sp.
TI  - Molecular diversity of bacteria in Yunnan yellow cattle (Bos taurs) from Nujiang  region, China.
AB  - The rumen content of four Yunnan Yellow Cattle (Bos taurs) were collected to determine the bacteria diversity by using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. A total of 129 sequences were examined and the sequences were referred as 107 OTU (Operational Taxonomy Unit) according to the similarity level of 97% in gene sequence. Similarity analysis revealed that Yunnan Yellow Cattle had 12 sequences (10 OTU) shared 97% or greater similarity with cultured rumen bacteria Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Succiniclasticum ruminis, Ruminococcus bromii, Clostridium proteoclasticum, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus, and Prevotella ruminicola, which accounting for 9.3% of the total clones (9.2% of the total OTU). The further 12 sequences (9 OTU) shared 90-97% similarity with cultured bacteria Clostridium aminobutyricum, butyrate-producing bacterium, Schwartzia succinivorans, Prevotella ruminicola, Eubacterium ruminantium, Ruminococcus albus, and Clostridium termitidis, also accounting for 9.3% of the total sequences (8.3% of the total OTU). The remaining 105 sequences (90 OTU) shared less than 90% similarity with cultured bacteria, accounting for 81.4% of the total sequences (82.5% of the total OTU). According to the phylogenetic analysis, all sequences were phylogenetically placed within phyla of low G+C subdivision (accounting for 72.1 and 72.5% of the total clones and OTU, respectively) and CFB subdivision (Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides; accounting for 27.9 and 27.5% of the total clones and OTU, respectively). Among the examined clones, rare bacteria Jeotgalicoccus psychrophilus was detected in the rumen of cattle.
TI  - Detection and identification of rumen bacteria constituting a fibrolytic consortium dominated by Fibrobacter succinogenes.
AB  - A fibrolytic consortium, dominated by the rumen cellulolytic bacterium Fibrobacter succinogenes, was artificially constructed on hay stems to detect and identify rumen bacteria that can potentially interact with F. succinogenes. Consortium-bacterial members were determined by DGGE and sequencing analysis targeted bacterial 16S rDNA. An artificial consortium was formed in a 2-step incubation of hay stems; the first step with group 1, 2 or 3 F. succinogenes strains, the second step with rumen fluid. After consortium formation, morphologically different bacteria were observed in association with F. succinogenes. DGGE exhibited more than 30 bands, the pattern of which depended on the F. succinogenes group. Sequencing suggested that Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Clostridium sp., F. succinogenes group 2, Prevotella ruminicola and unclassified Bacteroides were prominent in the group 1 consortium and that Treponema bryantii, B. fibrisolvens, Acinetobacter sp, and Wolinella succinogenes were prominent in the group 2 consortium. However, in the group 3 consortium, F. succinogenes-like bacteria were microscopically undetectable, whereas cellulolytic Ruminococcus albus and F. succinogenes group 1 were prominent, suggesting that the group 3 cannot be a core member of this consortium. This study is the first attempt to identify bacterial members of a fibrolytic consortium dominated by a specific bacterium.
TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences reveals rumen bacterial diversity in Yaks (Bos grunniens).
AB  - Six matured male Yaks (Bos grunniens) with a mean live weight of 450 +/- 23 kg (mean +/- SD), were housed indoors in metabolism cages and fed pelleted lucerne (Medicago sativum). After an adjustment period of 24 days of feeding the diet, samples of rumen content were obtained for analysis of the bacteria in the liquor. The diversity of rumen bacteria was investigated by constructing a 16S rRNA gene clone library using the general bacterial primers F27 and R1492. A total of 130 clones, comprising nearly full length sequences (approx. 1.5 kb) were sequenced and submitted to BLAST and phylogenetic analysis. Using the criterion that similarity of 97% or greater with the sequences of cultivated bacteria, 16 clones were identified as Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Succiniclasticum ruminis, Selenomonas ruminantium and Prevotella ruminicola, respectively. A further 10 clones shared similarity ranging from 90 to 97% with cultivated bacteria but the similarity in sequences for the remaining 104 clones were less than 90% of those of cultivated bacteria. Using a phylogenetic analysis it was found that the majority of the clones identified (63.8%) were located in the Low G + C Subdivision, with most of the remainder (35.4% of clones) located in the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides phylum and one clone (0.8%) was identified as a Proteobacteria. It was apparent that Yaks have a large and diverse range of bacteria in the rumen content which differ from those of cattle and other ruminants.
TI  - Biotransformation of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by pure culture ruminal bacteria.
AB  - Twenty-one ruminal bacteria species were tested for their ability to degrade 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) within 24 h. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Fibrobacter succinogenes, Lactobacillus vitulinus, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus caprinus, and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with <5% of the original TNT recovered as diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Eubacterium ruminantium, Lactobacillus ruminis, Ruminobacter amylophilus, Streptococcus bovis, and Wolinella succinogenes were able to completely degrade 100 mg/L TNT, with 23-60% of the TNT recovered as aminodinitrotoluene and/or diaminonitrotoluene metabolites. Clostridium polysaccharolyticum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens were able to degrade 80-90% of 100 mg/L TNT. Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans, Prevotella albensis, and Treponema bryantii degraded 50-80% of the TNT. Anaerovibrio lipolytica was completely inhibited by 100 mg/L TNT. These results indicate that a variety of rumen bacteria is capable of transforming TNT.
TI  - Dominance of Prevotella and low abundance of classical ruminal bacterial species  in the bovine rumen revealed by relative quantification real-time PCR.
AB  - Relative quantification real-time PCR was used to quantify several bacterial species in ruminal samples from two lactating cows, each sampled 3 h after feeding on two successive days. Abundance of each target taxon was calculated as a fraction of the total 16S rRNA gene copies in the samples, using taxon-specific and eubacterial domain-level primers. Bacterial populations showed a clear predominance of members of the genus Prevotella, which comprised 42% to 60% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies in the samples. However, only 2% to 4% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies were represented by the classical ruminal Prevotella species Prevotella bryantii, Prevotella ruminicola and Prevotella brevis. The proportion of rRNA gene copies attributable to Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, Selenomonas ruminantium and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens were each generally in the 0.5% to 1% range. Proportions for Ruminobacter amylophilus and Eubacterium ruminantium were lower (0.1% to 0.2%), while Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Streptococcus bovis, Ruminococcus albus and Megasphaera elsdenii were even less abundant, each comprising <0.03% of the bacterial rRNA gene copies. The data suggest that the aggregate abundance of the most intensively studied ruminal bacterial species is relatively low and that a large fraction of the uncultured population represents a single bacterial genus.
TI  - Butyrivibrio spp. and other xylanolytic microorganisms from the rumen have cinnamoyl esterase activity.
AB  - High concentrations of hydroxycinnamic acids in the hemicellulosic fraction of dry season tropical grasses may influence the rate of microbial degradation of arabinoxylans by ruminant animals. The ability of 22 strains of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, other ruminal bacteria (Ruminococcus albus SY3, Ruminococcus flavefaciens RF1,Prevotella ruminicola AR20) and the ruminal phycomycete Neocallimastix patriciarum CX to digest the tropical grass Heteropogon contortus(spear grass) and hydrolyse esterified ferulic and p-coumaric acid was examined. Significant digestion (8-36%) of spear grass occurred with the B. fibrisolvens strains H17c, A38, LP92-1-1, 49,R. albus SY3 and N. patriciarum. Hydrolysis of ester-linked ferulic and p-coumaric acid occurred with all organisms except B. fibrisolvens strains GS113, OB156 and LP1028 and P. ruminicola AR20. The ratio of ferulic to p-coumaric acid hydrolysed by different strains of Butyrivibrio spp. varied markedly from 0.96 for AR 51 to 0.16 for A38. Butyrivibrios which were fibrolytic (H17c and A38) had higher extracellular cinnamoyl esterase activity than bacteria that did not digest spear grass fibre (LP 91-4-1 and AR 20) which had low activities or only produced cell associated enzyme. Cell associated and extracellular esterase activity were induced when Butyrivibrio spp. strains H17c, A38 and E14 and the Ruminococcus spp. were grown on birchwood xylan but induction did not occur to the same extent with N. patriciarum. This is the first reported observation of cinnamoyl esterase activity in the genus Ruminococcus. The fungus N. patriciarum had significantly higher digestibility of spear grass and solubilisation of phenolic acids than the bacteria. The study shows that high levels of extracellular cinnamoyl esterases are characteristic of a selection of fibre-degrading ruminal bacteria and fungi which probably indicates that these enzymes are common amongst xylanolytic ruminal microorganisms.
TI  - Feasibility of using total purines as a marker for ruminal bacteria.
AB  - A procedure for measuring total purine content of mixed ruminal bacteria was adapted for use in the determination of purines in pure cultures of ruminal bacteria. Recovery of adenine and guanine, alone or in mixture, was quite variable. The problem was traced to solubility of the silver salt of adenine in the acid wash solution. When the precipitating solution was used as the wash, recovery of the purines was over 97%. Recovery of a 1:1 mixture of adenine and guanine added to yeast RNA was 100.6+/-3.2%. Purine, protein, and bacterial concentrations were determined for 10 pure cultures of ruminal bacteria: Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, D16f, H10b, and H17c; Fibrobacter succinogenes B21a; Lachnospira multiparus D25e; Lactobacillus lactis ARD26e; Prevotella ruminicola H15a; Ruminococcus albus 7; Ruminococcus flavefaciens B34b; and Streptococcus bovis ARD5d. The CV for the most-probable-number (MPN) assay (bacterial concentrations), purine analysis, and protein analysis were 55.86, 5.25 and 6.52%, respectively. Considerable variation was found among bacterial species and strains when purine and protein concentrations were compared as the amount per individual cell. More consistent values were obtained when these components were expressed on a dry matter basis. Purine:protein ratios for the 10 pure cultures ranged from .023 to .1299, with a mean value of .0883. For samples of mixed bacteria separated from ruminal fluid, this ratio was found to average .0306, which is approximately one-third of the value for the pure cultures. The value determined for the mixed bacterial sample is similar to previously reported values. Based on the ratio obtained with the pure cultures, the microbial protein flow out of the rumen has probably been overestimated in most previous reports. Limited studies suggest that the samples of mixed ruminal bacteria used as a standard are probably contaminated with feed particles containing protein, which results in lower purine:protein ratios.
TI  - How many ruminal bacteria are there?
AB  - With the development of strictly anaerobic techniques and habitat-simulating media, a variety of bacteria were isolated from the rumen in the 1940s and 1950s. Based on standard morphological and physiological characteristics, the microbial ecosystem of the rumen contains a very complex population of bacteria. In recent years, ruminal bacteria have been re-evaluated with newer, more objective, and genetically valid methods of classification. Ribosomes are complicated structures, and their DNA-encoding sequences are relatively free from selective pressure. Because ribosomes have evolved slowly, they provide a long-term natural history of evolution. The invariable and hypervariable regions of rRNA genes can be used to group bacteria into kingdoms, genera, and species. The 16S rRNA sequences have provided a basis for renaming some ruminal species (Bacteroides amylophilus is now Ruminobacter amylophilus and Bacteroides succinogenes is now Fibrobacter succinogenes) and for classifying at least one recently isolated ruminal bacterium (e.g., Clostridium aminophilum). The DNA:DNA hybridization is a more sensitive method of assessing bacterial relatedness than is 16S rRNA. Bacterial strains within a species should have a high degree of DNA:DNA homology, but some species of ruminal bacteria (e.g., Prevotella ruminicola and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens) had highly unrelated strains. Studies of 16S rRNA and DNA:DNA hybridization indicate that the diversity of ruminal bacteria has been greatly underestimated. Traditional studies of phylogeny of ruminal bacteria were stymied by the fastidious growth requirements of many ruminal bacteria, and enumeration was tedious and inaccurate. Modern methods of bacterial classification do not require in vitro culture and have the potential of detecting even a single cell.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing, and characterization of a membrane-associated Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 beta-glucosidase with cellodextrinase and cyanoglycosidase activities.
AB  - Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 is a gram-negative, anaerobic gastrointestinal bacterium. A 2.4-kbp chromosomal fragment from P. ruminicola encoding an 87-kDa aryl-glucosidase (CdxA) with cellodextrinase activity was cloned into Escherichia coli DH5 alpha and sequenced. CdxA activity was found predominantly in the membrane fraction of both P. ruminicola and E. coli, but P. ruminicola localized the protein extracellularly while E. coli did not. The hydrolase had the highest activity on cellodextrins (3.43 to 4.13 mumol of glucose released min-1 mg of protein-1) and p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside (3.54 mumol min-1 mg of protein-1). Significant activity (70% of p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucoside activity) was also detected on arbutin and prunasin. Less activity was obtained with cellobiose, amygdalin, or gentiobiose. CdxA attacks cellodextrins from the nonreducing end, releasing glucose units, and appears to be an exo-1,4-beta-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.74) which also is able to attack beta-1,6 linkages. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with other glycosyl-hydrolases suggests that this enzyme belongs to family 3 (B. Henrissat, Biochem. J. 280:309-316, 1991). On the basis of this sequence alignment, the catalytic residues are believed to be Asp-275 and Glu-265. This is the first report of a cloned ruminal bacterial enzyme which can cleave cyanogenic plant compounds and which may therefore contribute to cyanide toxicity in ruminants.
TI  - A defined medium for rumen bacteria and identification of strains impaired in de  novo biosynthesis of certain amino acids.
AB  - A completely defined growth medium has been developed to determine the nitrogen requirements for several species of ruminal bacteria, and has revealed two strains which are impaired in de novo biosynthesis of certain amino acids. Using NH4Cl as a sole nitrogen source, the medium supported growth of Butyrivibrio, Selenomonas, Prevotella and Streptococcus species. One strain of B. fibrisolvens (E14) and one strain of P. ruminicola (GA33) did not grow in the presence of NH4Cl until the medium was supplemented with amino acids or peptides. For B. fibrisolvens strain E14, methionine was identified as the specific growth-limiting amino acid although methionine alone did not support growth in the absence of NH4Cl. For P. ruminicola strain GA33, any individual amino acid other than methionine or cysteine could supplement the medium and support growth. Enzyme assays confirmed a lack of NADH and NADPH-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) activities in this strain.
TI  - Identification of proteolytic rumen bacteria isolated from New Zealand cattle.
AB  - The protease activities of 212 strains of rumen bacteria isolated from New Zealand cattle grazing pasture were measured. Thirty-seven per cent of strains had activity greater than or equal to the proteolytic rumen bacterium Prevotella ruminicola and 43 of these isolates were identified by morphology, carbon source utilization, Gram stain, biochemical tests and fermentation end-product analysis. Hierarchical Cluster Analysis showed that the strains formed four clusters: cluster A contained 26 strains and clustered with a reference strain of Streptococcus bovis; cluster C contained three strains and clustered with a reference strain of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, while clusters B (10 strains) and D (three strains) did not cluster with any of the remaining rumen bacterial type strains. Further tests identified strains of cluster B as Eubacterium budayi, while cluster D strains most closely resembled B. fibrisolvens and were described as B. fibrisolvens-like. An unclustered strain, C21a, was identified as P. ruminicola. The significance of these proteolytic bacterial populations is discussed in relation to protein breakdown in New Zealand ruminants.
TI  - Cyclic AMP in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An examination of cAMP levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. Cellular cAMP concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Prevotella ruminicola D31d, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 and D, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. The results were compared to those for Escherichia coli NRRL B3704. The levels of cAMP ranged from undetectable for B. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for P. ruminicola D31d. Varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of cAMP in these organisms. In general, cAMP concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for E. coli. The levels of cAMP in P. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. Based on these data it seems unlikely that cAMP is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in P. ruminicola where it may have an unknown regulatory function.
TI  - Influence of Yucca shidigera extract on ruminal ammonia concentrations and ruminal microorganisms.
AB  - An extract of the desert plant Yucca shidigera was assessed for its possible benefit in ruminal fermentation. The extract bound ammonia in aqueous solution when concentrations of ammonia were low (up to 0.4 mM) and when the extract was added at a high concentration to the sample (20%, vol/vol). The apparent ammonia-binding capability was retained after autoclaving and was decreased slightly following dialysis. Acid-precipitated extract was inactive. No evidence of substantial ammonia binding was found at higher ammonia concentrations (up to 30 mM). When Y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) was added to strained rumen fluid in vitro, a small (6%) but significant (P < 0.05) decrease in ammonia concentration occurred, apparently because of decreased proteolysis. Inclusion of Y. shidigera extract (1%, vol/vol) in the growth medium of the rumen bacterium Streptococcus bovis ES1 extended its lag phase, while growth of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens SH13 was abolished. The growth of Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola B(1)4 was stimulated, and that of Selenomonas ruminantium Z108 was unaffected. Protozoal activity, as measured by the breakdown of 14C-leucine-labelled S. ruminantium in rumen fluid incubated in vitro, was abolished by the addition of 1% extract. The antimicrobial activities were unaffected by precipitating tannins with polyvinylpyrrolidone, but a butanol extract, containing the saponin fraction, retained its antibacterial and antiprotozoal effects. Saponins from other sources were less effective against protozoa than Y. shidigera saponins. Y. shidigera extract, therefore, appears unlikely to influence ammonia concentration in the rumen directly, but its saponins have antimicrobial properties, particularly in suppressing ciliate protozoa, which may prove beneficial to ruminal fermentation and may lead indirectly to lower ruminal ammonia concentrations.
TI  - Effects of Sainfoin (Onobrychis viciifolia Scop.) Condensed Tannins on Growth and Proteolysis by Four Strains of Ruminal Bacteria.
AB  - Sainfoin leaf condensed tannins inhibited growth and protease activity in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens A38 and Streptococcus bovis 45S1 but had little effect on Prevotella ruminicola B(1)4 or Ruminobacter amylophilus WP225. Tannins bound to cell coat polymers in all strains. Morphological changes in B. fibrisolvens and S. bovis implicated the cell wall as a target of tannin toxicity.
TI  - Comparison of utilization of pectins from various sources by pure cultures of pectinolytic rumen bacteria and mixed cultures of rumen microorganisms.
AB  - Utilization of citrus, lucerne, apple and sugar beet pulp pectins by pure strains of rumen bacteria, Prevotella ruminicola, Lachnospira multiparus and Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens was compared. Additionally, the utilization of pectins by mixed rumen microorganisms was evaluated. The comparison was based on the depletion of galacturonic acid from medium, content of cellular protein in the cultures and the amount of end products of pectin fermentation in cell-free culture fluids. It was found that citrus pectin was utilized best; utilization of lucerne, apple and sugar beet pectins was dependent on the species of bacteria. P. ruminicola and B. fibrisolvens utilized polygalacturonic acid from sugar beet pectins better than that from apple or lucerne pectin, while L. multiparus was capable of significantly better utilization of lucerne pectin than pectin from sugar beet or apple. The source of pectin was less important for mixed cultures of rumen microorganisms than for pure cultures of rumen bacteria. The amount of fermentation products in the culture fluids supported the conclusion that citrus pectin was utilized better than others. Microbial protein content in the cultures was found to be a less sensitive indicator of pectin utilization than the remaining examined parameters. P. ruminicola strains and mixed cultures of rumen microorganisms were shown to have the highest ability to utilize pectins, L. multiparus-moderate, while the B. fibrisolvens strains utilized pectin the least.
TI  - Utilization of xylooligosaccharides by selected ruminal bacteria.
AB  - The ability of ruminal bacteria to utilize xylooligosaccharides was examined. Xylooligosaccharides were prepared by partially hydrolyzing oat spelt xylan in phosphoric acid. This substrate solution was added (0.2%, wt/vol) to a complex medium containing yeast extract and Trypticase that was inoculated with individual species of ruminal bacteria, and growth and utilization were monitored over time. All of the xylanolytic bacteria examined were able to utilize this oligosaccharide mixture as a growth substrate. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Eubacterium ruminantium, and Ruminococcus albus used xylooligosaccharides and whole, unhydrolyzed xylan to similar extents, while Prevotella ruminicola used twice as much xylooligosaccharides as xylan (76 versus 34%). Strains of Selenomonas ruminantium were the only nonxylanolytic species that were able to grow on xylooligosaccharides. The ability of individual S. ruminantium strains to utilize xylooligosaccharides was correlated with the presence of xylosidase and arabinosidases activities.
TI  - Analyses of the gene and amino acid sequence of the Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola 23 xylanase reveals unexpected homology with endoglucanases from other genera of bacteria.
AB  - The DNA sequence for the xylanase gene from Prevotella (Bacteroides) ruminicola 23 was determined. The xylanase gene encoded for a protein with a molecular weight of 65,740. An apparent leader sequence of 22 amino acids was observed. The promoter region for expression of the xylanase gene in Bacteroides species was identified with a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. A region of high amino acid homology was found with the proposed catalytic domain of endoglucanases from several organisms, including Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and Clostridium thermocellum. The cloned xylanase was found to exhibit endoglucanase activity against carboxymethyl cellulose. Analysis of the codon usage for the xylanase gene found a bias towards G and C in the third position in 16 of 18 amino acids with degenerate codons.
TI  - Interactions between proteolytic and cellulolytic rumen bacteria during hydrolysis of plant cell wall protein.
AB  - During the degradation of the plant cell wall protein of dried alfalfa, interactions may occur between hydrolytic activities of cellulolytic (Ruminococcus albus or Fibrobacter succinogenes) and proteolytic (Prevotella ruminicola or Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens) bacteria. In vitro the hydrolysis of these protein compounds begins after the depolymerization of the cell wall polysaccharides has started. Maximal degradation of cell wall protein of dried alfalfa (37.2%) was obtained with cocultures of Prevotella ruminicola and Ruminococcus albus.
