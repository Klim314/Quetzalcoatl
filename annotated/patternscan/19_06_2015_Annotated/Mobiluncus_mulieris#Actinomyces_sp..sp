TI  == [analysis of community composition in dental plaque of elder people with root caries].
AB  == objective: to analyze the community in dental plaque of elder people with root caries. methods: total dnas were extracted from the root caries dental plaques of nine elders over 60 years of age. polymerase chaid reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to analyze the microbial composition, dgge bands were excised from the gels for sequencing and identification. results: the dominant genus in root caries dental plaque of elder people were: acinetobacte [0.9% (1/114)], actinobaculum [1.8% (2/114)], actinomyces [15.8% (18/114)], aggregatibacter [0.9% (1/114)], capnocytophaga [14.0% (16/114)], corynebacterium [0.9% (1/114)], haemophilus [0.9% (1/114)], mobiluncus [0.9% (1/114)], naxibacter [0.9% (1/114)], neisseriaceae [10.5% (12/114)], porphyromonas [0.9% (1/114)], prevotella [12.3% (14/114)], selenomonas [6.1% (7/114)], staphylococcus [1.8% (2/114)], oralis streptococcus [6.1% (7/114)], mutans streptococcu [7.9% (9/114)], tannerella [0.9% (1/114)], treponema [1.8% (2/114)], veillonella [10.5% (12/114)] and two uncultured unknown genus [1.8% (2/114)]. uncultred genotypes accounted for 19.30% of the total. gram-positive bacteria genotype accounted for 31.6% (36/114), and gram-negative bacteria genotype accounted for 66.7% (76/114). conclusions: there were many bacteria genotypes in root caries dental plaque in the elderly, which were widely distributed. gram-negative bacteria accounted for the majority. genotype-specific pathogenic bacteria were not found.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == [anaerobic bacteria isolated from patients with suspected anaerobic infections].
AB  == the study involved 394 clinical samples sent to the clinical microbiology laboratory of hacettepe university adult hospital between january 1997 and may 2004 for anaerobic cultivation. since multiple cultures from the same clinical samples of the same patient were excluded, the study was carried on 367 samples.  the anaerobic cultures were performed in anaerobic jar using anaerogen kits (oxoid, basingstoke, u.k.) or genbox (biomerieux, lyon, france). the isolates were identified by both classical methods and "bbl crystal system" (becton dickinson, u.s.a.). while no growth was detected in 120 (32.7%) of the clinical samples studied, in 144 samples (39.2%) only aerobes, in 28 (7.6%) only anaerobes and in 75 (20.5%) of the samples both aerobes and anaerobes were isolated. the number of the anaerobic isolates was 217 from 103 samples with anaerobic growth.  of these 103 samples 15 showed single bacterial growth whereas in 88 samples multiple bacterial isolates were detected. anaerobic isolates consisted of 92 gram negative bacilli (bacteroides spp. 50, prevotella spp. 14, porphyromonas spp. 10, fusobacterium spp. 7, tisierella spp. 2, unidentified 9), 57 gram positive bacilli (clostridium spp.17, propionibacterium spp. 16, lactobacillus spp. 8, actinomyces spp. 5, eubacterium spp. 2, bifidobacterium adolescentis 1, mobiluncus mulieris 1, unidentified nonspore forming rods 7), 61 gram positive cocci (anaerobic cocci 44, microaerophilic cocci 17), and 7 gram negative cocci (veillonella spp.). in conclusion, in the samples studied with prediagnosis of anaerobic infection, bacteroides spp. (23%) were the most common bacteria followed by anaerobic gram positive cocci (20.3%) and clostridium spp (7.8%).

TI  == transfer of members of the genus falcivibrio to the genus mobiluncus, and emended description of the genus mobiluncus.
AB  == it has long been thought that the genera mobiluncus and falcivibrio contain the same organisms. using a polyphasic approach, it was found that mobiluncus curtisii and mobiluncus mulieris were the same as falcivibrio vaginalis and falcivibrio grandis, respectively. as the genus name mobiluncus takes precedence, it is proposed that f. vaginalis and f. grandis be transferred to the genus mobiluncus. in agreement with previous studies, results from phenotypic tests did not support the separation of m. curtisii strains into its two subspecies, m. curtisii subsp. curtisii and m. curtisii subsp. holmesii. phenotypic complexity within m. curtisii dictates that the species should be treated as a complex until more in-depth analyses of the species have been performed. phylogenetic analyses, based on 16s rrna gene sequences, demonstrated that the genus mobiluncus was associated with varibaculum cambriense and the two subspecies of actinomyces neuii, and that a. neuii is only distantly related to actinomyces sensu stricto.

TI  == characterization of some actinomyces-like isolates from human clinical sources: description of varibaculum cambriensis gen nov, sp nov.
AB  == fifteen strains of an anaerobic, catalase-negative, gram-positive diphtheroid-shaped bacterium recovered from human sources were characterized by phenotypic and molecular chemical and molecular genetic methods. the unidentified bacterium showed some resemblance to actinomyces species and related taxa, but biochemical testing, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of whole-cell proteins, and amplified 16s ribosomal dna restriction analysis indicated the strains were distinct from all currently named actinomyces species and related taxa. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies showed that the bacterium represents a hitherto-unknown phylogenetic line that is related to but distinct from actinomyces, actinobaculum, arcanobacterium, and mobiluncus: we propose, on  the basis of phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, that the unknown bacterium from human clinical specimens should be classified as a new genus and species, varibaculum cambriensis gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain of varibaculum cambriensis sp. nov. is ccug 44998(t) = cip 107344(t).

TI  == evaluation of the oxyrase oxyplate anaerobe incubation system.
AB  == the oxyrase oxyplate anaerobe incubation system was evaluated for its ability to  support the growth of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria previously identified by the anaerobe reference laboratory at the centers for disease control and prevention. the results were compared with those obtained with conventional anaerobe blood agar plates incubated in an anaerobe chamber. we tested 251 anaerobic bacterial strains. plates were read at 24, 48, and 72 h; growth was scored by a numerical coding system that combines the degree of growth and the colony size. organisms (number of strains tested) used in this study were actinomyces (32), anaerobiospirillum (8), bacteroides (39), campylobacter (8), clostridium (96), fusobacterium (12), leptotrichia (8), mobiluncus (8), peptostreptococcus (16), and propionibacterium (24). at 24 h, 101 (40.2%) of the  251 strains tested showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber than with the oxyplate system, 10 (4.1%) showed better growth with the oxyplate system, and the remaining 140 (55. 8%) showed equal growth with both systems. at 48 h, 173 (68.9%) showed equal growth with both systems, while 78 (31.1%) showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber. at 72 h, 176 (70.1%) showed equal growth with both systems, while 75 (29.9%) showed better growth with the anaerobe chamber. the oxyplate system performed well for the most commonly isolated anaerobes but was inadequate for some strains. these results indicate that the oxyrase oxyplate system was effective in creating an anaerobic atmosphere and supporting the growth of anaerobic bacteria within 72 h. oxyplates would be a useful addition to the clinical microbiology laboratory lacking resources for traditional anaerobic  culturing techniques.

TI  == evaluation of the bbl crystal anaerobe identification system.
AB  == the bbl crystal anaerobe (anr) identification system was evaluated, and the results were compared with those from conventional anaerobic methods. we tested 322 clinically significant anaerobic bacteria according to the manufacturer's instructions. the system identified correctly 286 of 322 (88.8%) of the anaerobic bacteria tested. of these, 263 of 322 (81.7%) were identified correctly on initial testing and 49 were identified correctly only to the genus level; on repeat testing, 23 of 49 (46.9%) were identified correctly to both the genus and  the species levels. a total of 26 (8.5%) were misidentified at the species level, and 10 (3.1%) were not identified. performance characteristics for individual strains varied. the system correctly identified all tested strains of campylobacter, desulfomonas, desulfovibrio, leptotrichia, mobiluncus, peptostreptococcus, porphyromonas, provetella, propionibacterium, tisierella, and veillonella and 36 of 37 (97.3%) actinomyces strains, 42 of 46 (91.3%) b. fragilis group strains, 79 of 103 (76.7%) clostridium strains, (however, the system failed to identify any of the 7 c. innocuum and 9 c. tetani strains tested), and 8 of 15 (53.3%) bacteroides strains. this system was easy to use, did not involve the addition of reagents, and was faster than conventional anaerobic procedures. it would be a useful addition to the anaerobe laboratory of most hospitals.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of the genus actinomyces based on 16s rrna gene sequences:  description of arcanobacterium phocae sp. nov., arcanobacterium bernardiae comb.  nov., and arcanobacterium pyogenes comb. nov.
AB  == a systematic phylogenetic analysis of the genus actinomyces was performed. the 16s rrna gene sequences of 13 actinomyces species, an unnamed actinomyces strain  (atcc 49338), and an actinomyces-like isolate from sea mammals were determined. comparative sequence analysis with closely related taxa revealed phylogenetic diversity and internal structure within the genus actinomyces. in addition, some  members of other genera (viz., the genera arcanobacterium, mobiluncus, and rothia) were shown to be phylogenetically intermixed with the actinomyces species. it was evident from both distance and tree topology considerations that  the genus actinomyces is in urgent need of taxonomic revision and requires subdivision into several genera. based on the results of the present study it is  proposed that actinomyces bernardiae and actinomyces pyogenes be assigned to the  genus arcanobacterium as arcanobacterium bernardiae comb. nov. and arcanobacterium pyogenes comb. nov., respectively. in addition, a new species, arcanobacterium phocae, is proposed for actinomyces-like bacteria isolated from seals.

TI  == recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.

TI  == detection and identification of mobiluncus species by direct filter hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe complementary to rrna.
AB  == a hybridization assay for direct detection and identification of mobiluncus species has been developed and tested. a [32p]-labelled synthetic oligonucleotide probe, complementary to a nucleotide sequence in the variable region v8 of mobiluncus 16s ribosomal rna, was utilized. one of the advantages of using rrna as target molecule for the hybridization assays is the copy number of rrna, which can be as high as 10(4), and that additionally three to six sites on the minus strand of the dna gene can be utilized. this probe was found to be sensitive and  to react with 62 of 68 tested typical or atypical mobiluncus isolates. it was also specific, and was shown not to react with 96 tested unrelated bacterial species and isolates, including taxonomically closely related species like actinomyces or bifidobacterium spp., or with bacteria isolated from the vagina of both healthy persons with an undisturbed flora, as well as from patients suffering from the bacterial vaginosis syndrome (bv).

TI  == phylogenetic evidence for the transfer of eubacterium suis to the genus actinomyces as actinomyces suis comb. nov.
AB  == the 16s rrna primary structures of eubacterium suis dsm 20639t (t = type strain)  and bifidobacterium bifidum dsm 20456t were determined by sequencing in vitro amplified rdna. sequence comparisons indicated that b. bifidum is moderately related to representatives of the genera actinomyces and mobiluncus. the closest  relative of e. suis is actinomyces pyogenes. e. suis and a. pyogenes are more closely related phylogenetically to one another than to the other actinomyces species that have been investigated by using comparative 16s rrna analysis. therefore, we propose that e. suis should be transferred to the genus actinomyces as actinomyces suis comb. nov.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == phylogenetic evidence for the relationship between the genera mobiluncus and actinomyces.
AB  == partial reverse transcriptase sequencing of 16s rrna from mobiluncus curtisii and m. mulieris clearly indicate that the genus mobiluncus is not a member of the bacteroidaceae but belongs to the order actinomycetales. the highest degree of relationship is found with the genus actinomyces which is supported by the presence of common physiological properties.

TI  == antigenic distinctiveness of mobiluncus curtisii and mobiluncus mulieris.
AB  == a total of 26 mobiluncus strains (17 m. curtisii and 9 m. mulieris strains) were  compared serologically by double immunodiffusion and immunoblotting against antisera prepared against representative isolates of each species. all strains from the same species were strongly reactive with homologous antisera but generally weakly reactive with antisera to the heterologous mobiluncus spp. the antisera did not react with strains of the unrelated genera campylobacter, succinivibrio, wolinella, actinomyces, anaerobiospirillum, and anaerovibrio.
