TI  == biomechanical loading modulates proinflammatory and bone resorptive mediators in  bacterial-stimulated pdl cells.
AB  == the present study aimed to evaluate in vitro whether biomechanical loading modulates proinflammatory and bone remodeling mediators production by periodontal ligament (pdl) cells in the presence of bacterial challenge. cells were seeded on bioflex culture plates and exposed to fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586 and/or cyclic tensile strain (cts) of low (ctsl) and high (ctsh) magnitudes for 1 and 3  days. synthesis of cyclooxygenase-2 (cox2) and prostaglandin e2 (pge2) was evaluated by elisa. gene expression and protein secretion of osteoprotegerin (opg) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-b ligand (rankl) were evaluated by quantitative rt-pcr and elisa, respectively. f. nucleatum increased  the production of cox2 and pge2, which was further increased by cts. f. nucleatum-induced increase of pge2 synthesis was significantly (p < 0.05) increased when ctsh was applied at 1 and 3 days. in addition, ctsh inhibited the  f. nucleatum-induced upregulation of opg at 1 and 3 days, thereby increasing the  rankl/opg ratio. opg and rankl mrna results correlated with the protein results.  in summary, our findings provide original evidence that cts can enhance bacterial-induced syntheses of molecules associated with inflammation and bone resorption by pdl cells. therefore, biomechanical, such as orthodontic or occlusal, loading may enhance the bacterial-induced inflammation and destruction  in periodontitis.

TI  == oral community interactions of filifactor alocis in vitro.
AB  == filifactor alocis is a gram positive anaerobe that is emerging as an important periodontal pathogen. in the oral cavity f. alocis colonizes polymicrobial biofilm communities; however, little is known regarding the nature of the interactions between f. alocis and other oral biofilm bacteria. here we investigate the community interactions of two strains of f. alocis with streptococcus gordonii, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, organisms with differing pathogenic potential in the oral cavity. in an in vitro community development model, s. gordonii was antagonistic to the accumulation of f. alocis into a dual species community. in contrast, f. nucleatum and the type strain of f. alocis formed a synergistic partnership. accumulation of a low passage isolate of f. alocis was also enhanced by f. nucleatum. in three species communities of s. gordonii, f. nucleatum and f. alocis, the antagonistic effects of s. gordonii superseded the synergistic effects of f. nucleatum toward f. alocis. the interaction between a.  actinomycetemcomitans and f. alocis was strain specific and a. actinomycetemcomitans could either stimulate f. alocis accumulation or have no effect depending on the strain. p. gingivalis and f. alocis formed heterotypic communities with the amount of p. gingivalis greater than in the absence of f. alocis. however, while p. gingivalis benefited from the relationship, levels of f. alocis in the dual species community were lower compared to f. alocis alone. the inhibitory effect of p. gingivalis toward f. alocis was dependent, at least partially, on the presence of the mfa1 fimbrial subunit. in addition, ai-2 production by p. gingivalis helped maintain levels of f. alocis. collectively, these results show that the pattern of f. alocis colonization will be dictated by the spatial composition of microbial microenvironments, and that the organism may preferentially accumulate at sites rich in f. nucleatum.

TI  == macrolides inhibit fusobacterium nucleatum-induced muc5ac production in human airway epithelial cells.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is one of the most common anaerobic bacteria in periodontitis and is responsible for several extraoral infections, including respiratory tract diseases. in this study, we examined whether f. nucleatum induces mucin secretion in airway epithelial cells. we also examined the effects  of macrolides on f. nucleatum-induced mucus production compared with the effects  of other antibiotics that exert anti-anaerobic activities. the production of muc5ac, the major core protein of mucin secreted from the airway surface epithelium, in bronchial epithelial cells after stimulation with culture supernatants (sup) of f. nucleatum was analyzed by performing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative rt-pcr. the cell-signaling pathway of f. nucleatum sup stimulation was also analyzed by western blotting. for inhibition studies, cells were treated with azithromycin, clarithromycin, clindamycin (cldm), and metronidazole (mtz). the f. nucleatum sup induced nci-h292 cells to express muc5ac at both the protein level and the mrna level in both a time- and dose-dependent manner. macrolides inhibited f. nucleatum sup-induced muc5ac production, while cldm and mtz were less effective. f. nucleatum sup induced the  phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (erk1/2), and this induction was suppressed by macrolides. f. nucleatum sup-induced muc5ac production was blocked by the erk pathway inhibitor u0126. f. nucleatum is likely to contribute to excessive mucin production, which suggests that periodontitis may correlate with the pathogenesis of chronic respiratory tract infection. macrolides seem to reduce this mucin production and might represent an additional means of therapeutic intervention for f. nucleatum respiratory tract infections other than cldm and mtz.

TI  == autoinducer 2 of fusobacterium nucleatum as a target molecule to inhibit biofilm  formation of periodontopathogens.
AB  == periodontitis is initiated by bacteria in subgingival biofilms, which are composed mostly of gram-negative anaerobes. autoinducer 2 (ai-2) is a universal quorum sensing (qs) molecule that mediates intergeneric signalling in multispecies bacterial communities and may induce biofilm formation. as fusobacterium nucleatum is the major coaggregation bridge organism that links early colonising commensals and late pathogenic colonisers in dental biofilms via the accretion of periodontopathogens, we hypothesised that ai-2 of f. nucleatum contributes to this interspecies interaction, and interruption of this signalling could result in the inhibition of biofilm formation of periodontopathogens. to test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of partially purified f. nucleatum  ai-2 on monospecies biofilm as well as mutualistic interactions between f. nucleatum and the so-called 'red complex' (porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and tannerella forsythia). then we tested the effect of two qs inhibitors (qsis), (5z)-4-bromo-5-(bromomethylene)-2(5h)-furanone (furanone compound) and d-ribose, on ai-2-induced biofilm formation and coaggregation. f. nucleatum ai-2 remarkably induced biofilm growth of single and dual species and coaggregation between f. nucleatum and each species of the 'red complex', all of  which were inhibited by the qsis. f. nucleatum ai-2 induced the expression of the representative adhesion molecules of the periodontopathogens, which were inhibited by the qsis. our results demonstrate that f. nucleatum ai-2 plays an important role in inter- and intraspecies interactions between periodontopathogens via enhanced expression of adhesion molecules and may be a target for the inhibition of pathogenic dental biofilm formation.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == effects of methyl gallate and gallic acid on the production of inflammatory mediators interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 by oral epithelial cells stimulated with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == interactions between periodontal bacteria and human oral epithelial cells can lead to the activation and expression of a variety of inflammatory mediators in epithelial cells. fusobacterium nucleatum is a filamentous human pathogen that is strongly associated with periodontal diseases. this study examined the effects of methyl gallate (mg) and gallic acid (ga) on the production of inflammatory mediators, interleukin (il)-6 and il-8, by oral epithelial cells stimulated by f. nucleatum. in a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and an  enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, live f. nucleatum induced high levels of gene  expression and protein release of il-6 and il-8. the effects of mg and ga were examined by treating kb oral epithelial cells with mg and ga and stimulating them with f. nucleatum. mg and ga inhibited significantly the increases in the il-6 and il-8 gene and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. these compounds also inhibited the growth of f. nucleatum. no visible effects of mg and ga on the adhesion and invasion of kb cells by f. nucleatum were observed. in conclusion, both mg and ga inhibit il-6 and il-8 production from f. nucleatum-activated kb cells.

TI  == coaggregation of porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum pk 1594 is  mediated by capsular polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide.
AB  == previous reports have shown that coaggregation between porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum, two important periodontopathogens, is mediated by a  galactoside on the surface of p. gingivalis and a lectin on f. nucleatum. in the  present study, purified capsular polysaccharide (cps) and lipopolysaccharide (lps) of p. gingivalis pk 1924 (serotype k5) were found to be able to bind to f.  nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of f. nucleatum to p. gingivalis serotype  k5. sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of p. gingivalis serotype k5 cps and lps to the f. nucleatum lectin are: the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4 and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at position 3 and 6 of d-galactose. these data suggest that p. gingivalis serotype k5- cps and lps act as receptors mediating coaggregation between p. gingivalis and fusobacteria.

TI  == inhibitory effect of weissella cibaria isolates on the production of volatile sulphur compounds.
AB  == aims: the objective of this study was to characterize the inhibitory effects of weissella cibaria isolates on volatile sulphur compounds (vsc) production both in vitro and in vivo. material and methods: we isolated and identified three hydrogen peroxide-generating lactobacilli from children's saliva, and assessed their inhibitory effects on vsc production and fusobacterium nucleatum proliferation. clinical studies were conducted with 46 subjects in order to measure the vsc of their mouth air. results: these lactobacilli were identified as w. cibaria. these isolates inhibited the production of vsc by f. nucleatum (p<0.05). the concentration of f. nucleatum was decreased by 5-log cycles as a result of exposure to the w. cibaria strains (p<0.05), whereas the catalase-treated w. cibaria cultures exerted no evident inhibitory effects on f.  nucleatum replication. in the clinical studies, gargling with one isolate resulted in a significant reduction in the levels of h2s and ch3sh by approximately 48.2% (p<0.01) and 59.4% (p<0.05), respectively. conclusions: these results indicate that w. cibaria isolates possess the ability to inhibit vsc production under both in vitro and in vivo conditions, demonstrating that they bear the potential for development into novel probiotics for use in the oral cavity.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum transports noninvasive streptococcus cristatus into human epithelial cells.
AB  == analysis of human buccal epithelial cells frequently reveals an intracellular polymicrobial consortium of bacteria. although several oral bacteria have been demonstrated to invade cultured epithelial cells, several others appear unable to internalize. we hypothesized that normally noninvasive bacteria may gain entry into epithelial cells via adhesion to invasive bacteria. fusobacterium nucleatum  is capable of binding to and invading oral epithelial cells. by contrast, streptococcus cristatus binds weakly to host cells and is not internalized. f. nucleatum and s. cristatus coaggregate strongly via an arginine-sensitive interaction. coincubation of kb or tert-2 epithelial cells with equal numbers of  f. nucleatum and s. cristatus bacteria led to significantly increased numbers of  adherent and internalized streptococci. f. nucleatum also promoted invasion of kb cells by other oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii. dissection of fusobacterial or streptococcal adhesive interactions by using sugars, amino acids, or antibodies demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to direct attachment of s. cristatus to adherent and invading f. nucleatum. inhibition of f. nucleatum host cell attachment and invasion with galactose, or fusobacterial-streptococcal coaggregation by the arginine homologue l-canavanine, abrogated the increased s. cristatus adhesion to, and invasion of, host cells. in addition, polyclonal antibodies to f. nucleatum, which inhibited fusobacterial attachment to both kb cells and s. cristatus, significantly decreased invasion by both species. similar decreases were obtained when epithelial cells were pretreated with cytochalasin d, staurosporine, or cycloheximide. these studies indicate that f. nucleatum may facilitate the colonization of epithelial cells by bacteria unable to adhere or invade directly.

TI  == fluorescence based measurements of fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregation and of fusobacterial attachment to mammalian cells.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum is a common oral anaerobe associated with gingivitis, periodontal disease and preterm deliveries. coaggregation among oral bacteria is  considered to be a significant factor in dental plaque development. adhesion to host cells was suggested to be important for the f. nucleatum virulence associated with oral inflammation and with preterm births. an uncharacterized fusobacterial galactose inhibitible adhesin mediates coaggregation of f. nucleatum 12230 and f. nucleatum pk1594 with the periodontal pathogen porphyromonas gingivalis. this adhesin is also involved with the attachment of both fusobacterial strains to host cells. however, it has been suggested that additional unidentified fusobacterial adhesins are involved in f. nucleatum virulence associated with preterm births. in this study, a fluorescence-based high throughput sensitive and reproducible method was developed for measuring bacterial coaggregation and bacterial attachment to mammalian cells. using this method we found that coaggregation of f. nucleatum 4h with p. gingivalis and its  attachment to murine macrophages is less inhibitible by galactose than that of f. nucleatum pk1594. these findings suggest that f. nucleatum 4h can serve as a model organism for identifying nongalactose inhibitible f. nucleatum adhesins considered to be involved in fusobacterial attachment to mammalian cells.

TI  == multi-target antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes.
AB  == objective: zinc is used in oral care products as an antiplaque/antigingivitis agent. our objective was to assess the antimicrobial actions of zinc against oral anaerobes associated with gingivitis, specifically fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, with focus on catabolism and oxidative metabolism. methods: the oral anaerobes were grown in complex medium in an anaerobic chamber, harvested by centrifugation and used directly for experiments with suspensions. biofilm growth involved super-infection by f. nucleatum of an initial biofilm formed by streptococcus sanguis. results: zn(2+) inhibited catabolism of glutamate, glutamyl-glutamate, glucose and fructose by f. nucleatum cells in suspensions with id(50) values, respectively, of 0.05, 0.005, 0.01 and 0.01 mm. the id(50) value for inhibition of glutamate catabolism by biofilms was 0.10 mm.  inhibition of glutamate catabolism could be related to inhibition of substrate uptake and of 2-oxoglutarate reductase. zn(2+) also inhibited catabolism of aspartate or aspartyl-aspartate by p. intermedia with id(50) values of 0.07 and about 0.03 mm, respectively. respiration of intact cells of f. nucleatum and nadh oxidase in cell extracts were sensitive to zinc with id(50) values, respectively, of about 1.0 and 1.4 mm. zinc also inhibited production of hydrogen peroxide by f. nucleatum (id(50) = ca. 0.04 mm.) but at high concentrations acted to potentiate and enhance peroxide killing of the anaerobe. conclusion: zn(2+) is a  potent inhibitor of catabolism by f. nucleatum and p. intermedia, including catabolism of peptides, which can be degraded to yield inflammatory metabolic end products. zn(2+) also inhibits o(2) metabolism of f. nucleatum by about 50% and hydrogen peroxide production nearly completely but also enhances killing by peroxide added to cells.

TI  == modulation of the antibody response by porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum in a mouse model.
AB  == successive immunization of mice with fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis has been shown to modulate the specific serum igg responses to these organisms. the aim of this study was to investigate these antibody responses further by examining the igg subclasses induced as well as the opsonizing properties of the specific antibodies. serum samples from balb/c mice immunized with f. nucleatum (gp1-f), p. gingivalis (gp2-p), p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum (gp3-pf) f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis (gp4-fp) or saline alone (gp5-s) were examined for specific igg1 (th2) and igg2a (th1) antibody levels using an elisa and the opsonizing properties measured using a neutrophil chemiluminescence assay. while igg1 and igg2a subclasses were induced in all immunized groups, there was a tendency towards an igg1 response in mice immunized with p. gingivalis alone, while immunization with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis induced significantly higher anti-p. gingivalis igg2a levels than igg1. the maximum light output due to neutrophil phagocytosis of p. gingivalis occurred at 10 min using nonopsonized bacteria. chemiluminescence was reduced using serum-opsonized p. gingivalis and, in particular, sera from p. gingivalis-immunized mice (gp2-p), with maximum responses occurring at 40 min. in contrast, phagocytosis of immune serum-opsonized f. nucleatum demonstrated peak light output at 10 min, while that of f. nucleatum opsonized with sera from saline injected mice (gp5-s) and control nonopsonized bacteria showed peak responses at 40 min. the lowest phagocytic response occurred using gp4-fp serum-opsonized f. nucleatum. in conclusion, the results of the present study have demonstrated a systemic th1/th2 response in mice immunized with p. gingivalis and/or f. nucleatum with a trend towards a th2 response in p. gingivalis-immunized mice and a significantly increased anti-p. gingivalis igg2a  (th1) response in mice immunized with f. nucleatum prior to p. gingivalis. further, the inhibition of neutrophil phagocytosis of immune serum-opsonized p. gingivalis was modulated by the presence of anti-f. nucleatum antibodies, while anti-p. gingivalis antibodies induced an inhibitory effect on the phagocytic response to f. nucleatum.

AB  == microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. the aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and lactobacillus casei, l. salivarius, l. rhamnosus and l. plantarum isolated from saliva. different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain,  alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double  layer method; and (d) od(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of lactobacillus strains in laptg broth with different volumes of f. nucleatum supernatant. p. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on lactobacillus growth, except for l. casei, when the double plaque method was used. f. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. f. nucleatum inhibited l. casei growth whatever the method used. the substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. none of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of p. intermedia or f. nucleatum.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lipopolysaccharide mediates coaggregation with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == purified actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lipopolysaccharide (lps) was found to be able to bind fusobacterium nucleatum cells and to inhibit binding of f. nucleatum to a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b. sugar binding studies showed that the requirements for binding of a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lps to the f. nucleatum lectin are the presence of a metal divalent ion, an axial free hydroxyl group at position 4, and free equatorial hydroxyl groups at positions 3 and 6 of d-galactose, indicating that the beta-n-acetyl-d-galactosamine in the serotype b lps trisaccharide repeating unit  is the monosaccharide residue recognized by the f. nucleatum lectin. these data strongly suggest that a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b lps is one of the receptors responsible for the lactose-inhibitable coaggregation of a. actinomycetemcomitans to fusobacteria.

TI  == effect of fusobacterium nucleatum on the t and b cell responses to porphyromonas  gingivalis in a mouse model.
AB  == t cell cytokine profiles and specific serum antibody levels in five groups of balb/c mice immunized with saline alone, viable fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 25586, viable porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277, f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis and p. gingivalis followed by f. nucleatum were determined. splenic cd4 and cd8 cells were examined for intracytoplasmic interleukin (il)-4, interferon (ifn)-gamma and il-10 by dual colour flow cytometry and the levels of  serum anti-f. nucleatum and anti-p. gingivalis antibodies determined by an elisa. both th1 and th2 responses were demonstrated by all groups, and while there were  slightly lower percentages of cytokine positive t cells in mice injected with f.  nucleatum alone compared with the other groups immunized with bacteria, f. nucleatum had no effect on the t cell production of cytokines induced by p. gingivalis in the two groups immunized with both organisms. however, the percentages of cytokine positive cd8 cells were generally significantly higher than those of the cd4 cells. mice immunized with f. nucleatum alone had high levels of serum anti-f. nucleatum antibodies with very low levels of p. gingivalis antibodies, whereas mice injected with p. gingivalis alone produced anti-p. gingivalis antibodies predominantly. although the levels of anti-f. nucleatum antibodies in mice injected with f. nucleatum followed by p. gingivalis were the same as in mice immunized with f. nucleatum alone, antibody levels to p. gingivalis were very low. in contrast, mice injected with p. gingivalis followed  by f. nucleatum produced equal levels of both anti-p. gingivalis and anti-f. nucleatum antibodies, although at lower levels than the other three groups immunized with bacteria, respectively. anti-actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus and prevotella intermedia serum antibody levels were also determined and found to be negligible. in conclusion, f. nucleatum immunization does not affect the splenic t cell cytokine response to p. gingivalis. however, f. nucleatum immunization prior to that of p. gingivalis almost completely inhibited the production of anti-p. gingivalis antibodies while p. gingivalis injection before f. nucleatum demonstrated a partial inhibitory effect by p. gingivalis on antibody production to f. nucleatum. the significance of these results with respect to human periodontal disease is difficult to determine. however, they may explain in part differing responses to p. gingivalis in different individuals who may or may not have had prior exposure to f. nucleatum. finally, the results suggested that p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum do not induce  the production of cross-reactive antibodies to other oral microorganisms.

TI  == interleukin-8 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 regulation in oral epithelial cells by selected periodontal bacteria: multiple effects of porphyromonas gingivalis via antagonistic mechanisms.
AB  == interaction of bacteria with mucosal surfaces can modulate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules produced by epithelial cells. previously, we showed that expression of interleukin-8 (il-8) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (icam-1) by gingival epithelial cells increases following interaction with several putative periodontal pathogens. in contrast, expression  of il-8 and icam-1 is reduced after porphyromonas gingivalis atcc 33277 challenge. in the present study, we investigated the mechanisms that govern the regulation of these two molecules in bacterially infected gingival epithelial cells. experimental approaches included bacterial stimulation of gingival epithelial cells by either a brief challenge (1.5 to 2 h) or a continuous coculture throughout the incubation period. the kinetics of il-8 and icam-1 expression following brief challenge were such that (i) secretion of il-8 by gingival epithelial cells reached its peak 2 h following fusobacterium nucleatum  infection whereas it rapidly decreased within 2 h after p. gingivalis infection and remained decreased up to 30 h and (ii) il-8 and icam-1 mrna levels were up-regulated rapidly 2 to 4 h postinfection and then decreased to basal levels 8  to 20 h after infection with either actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum, or p. gingivalis. attenuation of il-8 secretion was facilitated by adherent p. gingivalis strains. the il-8 secreted from epithelial cells after f.  nucleatum stimulation could be down-regulated by subsequent infection with p. gingivalis or its culture supernatant. although these results suggested that il-8 attenuation at the protein level might be associated with p. gingivalis proteases, the arg- and lys-gingipain proteases did not appear to be solely responsible for il-8 attenuation. in addition, while p. gingivalis up-regulated il-8 mrna expression, this effect was overridden when the bacteria were continuously cocultured with the epithelial cells. the il-8 mrna levels in epithelial cells following sequential challenge with p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum and vice versa were approximately identical and were lower than those following f. nucleatum challenge alone and higher than control levels or those following p. gingivalis challenge alone. thus, together with the protease effect, p. gingivalis possesses a powerful strategy to ensure the down-regulation of il-8 and icam-1.

TI  == abscess forming ability of streptococcus milleri group: synergistic effect with fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  == the abscess forming abilities of "streptococcus milleri" strains (streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginiosus, and streptococcus intermedius) isolated from dentoalveolar abscesses and the synergistic effect of fusobacterium nucleatum co-inoculated with the isolates were examined on a mouse subcutaneous abscess model. five days after inoculation, all s. milleri strains formed abscesses, which showed less pathological spread to surrounding connective tissues than those formed by staphylococcus aureus 209p strain and were similar to those by f. nucleatum atcc25586. when each s. milleri strain and f. nucleatum  were co-inoculated, abscess sizes and each bacterial number recovered from abscesses increased in comparison to those treated by bacterial mono-inoculation  of each s. milleri strain or f. nucleatum alone. the strongest synergistic effect was observed in the combination of s. constellatus and f. nucleatum. in a time course experiment with this combination, the recovery of s. constellatus subsequently decreased after the decrement of f. nucleatum, and it appeared that  the association with f. nucleatum maintained the bacterial number of s. constellatus in the abscess. the cell-free supernatant of f. nucleatum had a tendency to increase the abscess size caused by s. constellatus in this model. when s. constellatus was cultured with f. nucleatum culture supernatant in vitro, growth enhancement in the early phase was observed. furthermore, the phagocytic killing of s. constellatus by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) was significantly suppressed and the pmn membranes appeared to be injured by addition of the f. nucleatum culture supernatant. these results suggest that the pathogenicity of s. milleri strains in odontogenic infections may be enhanced by  the co-existence of f. nucleatum.

TI  == cytotoxic effect of endodontic bacteria on periapical fibroblasts.
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate the effects of sonicated bacterial extracts (sbes) from anaerobic gram-negative bacteria on periapical fibroblast obtained from the apical portion of human periodontal ligaments. porphyromonas endodontalis, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium  nucleatum were chosen from among the endodontic bacteria isolated from root canals having a periapical lesion and compared in terms of their cytotoxicity. the purpose of this study was to examine which bacteria are involved in the development of periapical inflammation. the anaerobes were cultured under strict  anaerobic conditions, and the bacterial cells were then harvested by centrifugation after incubation. the concentrated cell suspensions were sonicated and subsequently centrifuged. an sbe was made of each of the filtered supernatants. each sbe was added to cultures of periapical fibroblasts. the cell  growth and proliferation were measured by the mtt method after 3, 5, and 7 days.  the sbes from p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum inhibited the growth of the fibroblasts, whereas the sbe from p. intermedia did not inhibit it. the sbes from p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum inhibited the fibroblast growth more strongly than did the p. endodontalis, p. gingivalis, and f. nucleatum may participate in the development of periapical lesions.

TI  == identification of a fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 galactose-binding adhesin which mediates coaggregation with periopathogenic bacteria and hemagglutination.
AB  == attachment of fusobacterium nucleatum to various oral surfaces is mediated by several adhesins anchored on its outer surface. monoclonal antibodies (mabs) were prepared and used to identify the putative galactose-binding adhesin of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique mabs, 8g7, 26b9, 28g11, and 29d4, were isolated on  the basis of their ability to inhibit coaggregation of f. nucleatum pk1594 with porphyromonas gingivalis pk1924. all four mabs were also capable of inhibiting galactose-inhibitable interactions of f. nucleatum pk1594 with other oral gram-negative bacteria and with erythrocytes. preincubation of f. nucleatum pk1594 with mab 26b9 or its fab fragments at concentrations lower than 1 microg/ml resulted in complete inhibition of coaggregation with p. gingivalis pk1924 or hemagglutination. f. nucleatum pk1594 surface components prepared by mild sonication or by extracting whole cells with detergents were subjected to western blot analysis. none of the mabs were able to recognize any polypeptide in these experiments. therefore, detergent extracts of f. nucleatum pk1594 surface components were subjected to three experimental procedures: (i) separation by ion-exchange chromatography and testing of fractions for reaction with mab 26b9 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), (ii) lactose-sepharose affinity  chromatography and testing of the lactose eluate in elisa with mab 26b9, and (iii) immunoseparation with either mab 26b9 or 8g7. collectively, the results suggest that the putative adhesin is a 30-kda outer membrane polypeptide which mediates the coaggregation with p. gingivalis pk1924 as well as other galactose-sensitive interactions of f. nucleatum pk1594.

TI  == polyclonal b cell activation, endotoxin tolerance, and limulus tests of endotoxin preparations of some periodontopathogens.
AB  == potencies of polyclonal b-cell activation in c3h/hen mice of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis endotoxins were 0.36, 0.13 and 0.04, taking salmonella abortusequi as 1.0. f. nucleatum and p. gingivalis endotoxins showed positive reactions in c3h/hej mice. most activities in c3h/hen other than that of f. nucleatum were suppressed by polymyxin b. in c3h/hej mice, similar inhibitions were only 60% for p. gingivalis and hardly observed with f. nucleatum. the resistances to polymyxin b could be due to protein in the endotoxins. a promoting effect of t cells added to b cells  was observed only in the activity of f. nucleatum endotoxin in c3h/hej mice; there was no influence in other groups. test endotoxins had nearly the same ability to produce colony stimulating factor as did references and could not produce the factor in tolerant mice. the clinical significance of tolerance is discussed. regression lines of endotoxin doses and limulus activities of test endotoxins and salmonella were parallel, either in specific or non-specific tests. the lines of two test groups were also parallel; values obtained by two tests were very close. these data indicate that the test endotoxins did not contain (1-3)-beta-d-glucan and elicited qualitatively similar limulus reactions  to that of the reference, despite their different chemical natures. in conclusion, these test preparations had an endotoxicity similar to that of the reference and contribute to produce periodontitis through polyclonal b cell activation.

TI  == localization of the fusobacterium nucleatum t18 adhesin activity mediating coaggregation with porphyromonas gingivalis t22.
AB  == adherence of pathogenic bacteria is often an essential first step in the infectious process. the ability of bacteria to adhere to one another, or to coaggregate, may be an important factor in their ability to colonize and function as pathogens in the periodontal pocket. previously, a strong and specific coaggregation was demonstrated between two putative periodontal pathogens, fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis. the interaction appeared to be mediated by a protein adhesin on the f. nucleatum cells and a carbohydrate receptor on the p. gingivalis cells. in this investigation, we have localized the adhesin activity of f. nucleatum t18 to the outer membrane on the basis of the ability of f. nucleatum t18 vesicles to coaggregate with whole cells of p. gingivalis t22 and the ability of the outer membrane fraction of f. nucleatum t18 to inhibit coaggregation between whole cells of f. nucleatum t18 and p. gingivalis t22. proteolytic pretreatment of the f. nucleatum t18 outer membrane fraction resulted in a loss of coaggregation inhibition, confirming the proteinaceous nature of the adhesin. the f. nucleatum t18 outer membrane fraction was found to be enriched for several proteins, including a 42-kda major outer membrane protein which appeared to be exposed on the bacterial cell surface. fab  fragments prepared from antiserum raised to the 42-kda outer membrane protein were found to partially but specifically block coaggregation. these data support  the conclusion that the 42-kda major outer membrane protein of f. nucleatum t18 plays a role in mediating coaggregation with p. gingivalis t22.

TI  == a non-lectin-like mechanism by which fusobacterium nucleatum 10953 adheres to and activates human lymphocytes.
AB  == most (approximately 80%) strains of fusobacterium nucleatum adhere to human erythrocytes in a lectin-like manner that is strongly inhibited by n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (galnac). in this study, we investigated the capacity of f. nucleatum 10953, a strain that is weakly inhibited by galnac, to adhere to and activate human lymphocytes in vitro. experiments using [3h]-labeled bacteria and  scanning electron microscopy clearly showed that 10953 adhered to lymphocytes and that adherence was blocked by l-arginine+galnac greater than l-arginine much greater than galnac. adherence was ca(2+)-dependent, inhibited by pretreatment of the bacteria with proteases or heat, and unaffected by paraformaldehyde fixation  of the bacteria. strain 10953 induced lymphocyte mitogenesis that was blocked by  l-arginine but not by galnac. these results suggest that certain strains of f. nucleatum, such as 10953, express a distinct, non-lectin-like mechanism by which  they adhere to and activate lymphocytes. activation of lymphocytes may be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases associated with these bacteria.

TI  == lectinlike interactions of fusobacterium nucleatum with human neutrophils.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum expresses lectinlike adherence factors which mediate binding to a variety of human tissue cells. adherence is selectively inhibited by galactose, lactose, and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine. in this study, adherence of f.  nucleatum to human peripheral blood polymorphonuclear neutrophils (pmns) was investigated. the results indicated that the fusobacteria adhered to live and metabolically inactivated or fixed pmns. adherence of f. nucleatum resulted in activation of pmns as determined by pmn aggregation, membrane depolarization, increased intracellular free ca2+, superoxide anion production, and lysozyme release. transmission electron micrographs showed that f. nucleatum was phagocytized by the pmns. microbicidal assays indicated that greater than 98% of  f. nucleatum organisms were killed by pmns within 60 min. adherence to and activation of pmns by f. nucleatum were inhibited by n-acetyl-d-galactosamine or  lactose greater than galactose, whereas equal concentrations of glucose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, mannose, and fucose had little or no effect on f. nucleatum-pmn interactions. pretreatment of the fusobacteria with heat (80 degrees c, 20 min) or proteases inhibited adherence to and activation of pmns, but superoxide production was also stimulated by heated bacteria. the results indicate that interaction of f. nucleatum with pmns is lectinlike and is probably mediated by fusobacterial proteins which bind to other human tissue cells. adherence of f. nucleatum to pmns in the absence of serum opsonins, such as antibodies and complement, may play an important role in pmn recognition and killing of f. nucleatum in the gingival sulcus and in the subsequent release of pmn factors associated with tissue destruction.
