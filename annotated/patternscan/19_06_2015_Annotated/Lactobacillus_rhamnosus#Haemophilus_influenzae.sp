TI  == maternal supplementation with lgg reduces vaccine-specific immune responses in infants at high-risk of developing allergic disease.
AB  == probiotics are defined as live micro-organisms that when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. among their pleiotropic effects, inhibition of pathogen colonization at the mucosal surface as well as modulation  of immune responses are widely recognized as the principal biological activities  of probiotic bacteria. in recent times, the immune effects of probiotics have led to their application as vaccine adjuvants, offering a novel strategy for enhancing the efficacy of current vaccines. such an approach is particularly relevant in regions where infectious disease burden is greatest and where access  to complete vaccination programs is limited. in this study, we report the effects of the probiotic, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg) on immune responses to tetanus, haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) and pneumococcal conjugate (pcv7) vaccines in infants. this study was conducted as part of a larger clinical trial  assessing the impact of maternal lgg supplementation in preventing the development of atopic eczema in infants at high-risk for developing allergic disease. maternal lgg supplementation was associated with reduced antibody responses against tetanus, hib, and pneumococcal serotypes contained in pcv7 (n = 31) compared to placebo treatment (n = 30) but not total igg levels. maternal lgg supplementation was also associated with a trend to increased number of tetanus toxoid-specific t regulatory in the peripheral blood compared to placebo-treated  infants. these findings suggest that maternal lgg supplementation may not be beneficial in terms of improving vaccine-specific immunity in infants. further clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings. as probiotic immune effects can be species/strain specific, our findings do not exclude the potential use of other probiotic bacteria to modulate infant immune responses to vaccines.

TI  == treatment of acute otitis media with probiotics in otitis-prone children-a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised study.
AB  == background & aims: to examine whether probiotics would reduce the occurrence or duration of acute otitis media (aom), or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children. methods: during this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised, 24-week intervention, 309 otitis-prone children (10 months-6 years) consumed either one probiotic capsule (lactobacillus rhamnosus gg and lc705, bifidobacterium breve 99 and propionibacterium freudenreichii js) (n=155) or placebo (n=154) daily. clinical examinations were carried out and nasopharyngeal samples taken three times. parents recorded the symptoms of upper respiratory infection (uri) in a diary. results: probiotic treatment did not reduce the occurrence (probiotic vs. placebo: 72% vs. 65%, or=1.48, 95% ci 0.87-2.52, p=n.s.) or the recurrence ( three) of aom episodes (18% vs. 17%, or=1.04, 95% ci 0.55-1.96, p=n.s.). the median duration of aom episodes was 5.6 (iqr 3.5-9.4) vs. 6.0 (iqr 4.0-10.5) days, respectively (p= n.s.). there was a tendency showing a reduction in the occurrence of recurrent (4 to 6) respiratory infections in the probiotic group (or for 4 uris: 0.56, 95%ci 0.31-0.99, p=0.046; or for 6 uris: 0.59, 95% ci 0.34 to 1.03, p=n.s.). probiotics did not affect the carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae or haemophilus influenzae, but increased the prevalence of moraxella catarrhalis (or=1.79, 95% ci 1.06-3.00, p=0.028). conclusions: probiotics did not prevent the occurrence of aom or the nasopharyngeal carriage of otitis pathogens in otitis-prone children.  a tendency showing a reduction in recurrent respiratory infections must be confirmed in further studies.

TI  == effect of probiotics on vaccine antibody responses in infancy--a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.
AB  == probiotics are immunomodulatory and may thus affect vaccine antibody responses. with the accumulating evidence of their health-promoting effects, probiotics are  increasingly administered in allergy-prone infants. therefore, we studied the effect of probiotics on antibody responses to diphtheria, tetanus and haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) vaccines in 6-month-old infants participating in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind allergy-prevention trial. mothers of unborn children at increased risk for atopy used a combination of four probiotic  strains, or a placebo, for 4 wk before delivery. during 6 months from birth, their infants received the same probiotics and galacto-oligosaccharides, or a placebo. the infants were immunized with a dtwp (diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis) at ages 3, 4, and 5 months, and with a hib polysaccharide conjugate at 4 months. serum diphtheria, tetanus, and hib igg antibodies were measured at 6 months. in the probiotic group, protective hib antibody concentrations (>/=1 microg/ml) occurred more frequently, 16 of 32 (50%) vs. six  of 29 (21%) (p = 0.020), and the geometric mean (inter-quartile range) hib igg concentration tended to be higher 0.75 (0.15-2.71) microg/ml than in the placebo  group 0.40 (0.15-0.92) microg/ml (p = 0.064). in these respective groups, diphtheria, 0.38 (0.14-0.78) vs. 0.47 (0.19-1.40) iu/ml (p = 0.449), and tetanus, 1.01(0.47-1.49) vs. 0.81 (0.56-1.39) iu/ml (p = 0.310), igg titers were comparable. in conclusion, in allergy-prone infants probiotics seem not to impair antibody responses to diphtheria, tetanus, or hib, but may improve response to hib immunization.
