TI  == resistance determinant erm(x) is borne by transposon tn5432 in bifidobacterium thermophilum and bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis.
AB  == the erm(x) gene from erythromycin- and clindamycin-resistant bifidobacterium strains was characterised by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis, including flanking regions. results suggest that the resistance determinant was part of transposon tn5432 that has been described in several opportunistic pathogens such as corynebacterium striatum and propionibacterium acnes.

TI  == plasmid-borne macrolide resistance in micrococcus luteus.
AB  == a plasmid designated pmec2 which confers resistance to erythromycin, other macrolides, and lincomycin was detected in micrococcus luteus strain maw843 isolated from human skin. curing of this approximately 4.2 kb plasmid from the host organism resulted in erythromycin sensitivity of the strain. introduction of pmec2 into a different m. luteus strain conferred erythromycin resistance upon this strain. macrolide resistance in m. luteus maw843 was an inducible trait. induction occurred at subinhibitory erythromycin concentrations of about 0.02-0.05 micro g ml(-1). erythromycin and oleandomycin were inducers, while spiramycin and tylosin exerted no significant inducer properties. with heterologous expression experiments in corynebacterium glutamicum, using hybrid plasmid constructs and deletion derivatives thereof, it was possible to narrow down the location of the plasmid-borne erythromycin-resistance determinant to a region of about 1.8 kb of pmec2. sequence analysis of the genetic determinant, designated erm(36), identified an orf putatively encoding a 281-residue protein with similarity to 23s rrna adenine n(6)-methyltransferases. erm(36) was most related (about 52-54% identity) to erythromycin-resistance proteins found in high-g+c gram-positive bacteria, including the (opportunistic) pathogenic corynebacteria corynebacterium jeikeium, c. striatum, c. diphtheriae and propionibacterium acnes. this is believed to be the first report of a plasmid-borne, inducible antibiotic resistance in micrococci. the possible role of non-pathogenic, saprophytic micrococci bearing antibiotic-resistance genes in  the spreading of these determinants is discussed.
