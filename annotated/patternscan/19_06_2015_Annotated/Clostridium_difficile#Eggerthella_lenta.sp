TI  == discovery of a cyclic phosphodiesterase that catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis  of both ester bonds to phosphorus.
AB  == the bacterial c-p lyase pathway is responsible for the metabolism of unactivated  organophosphonates under conditions of phosphate starvation. the cleavage of the  c-p bond within ribose-1-methylphosphonate-5-phosphate to form methane and 5-phospho-ribose-1,2-cyclic phosphate (prcp) is catalyzed by the radical sam enzyme phnj. in escherichia coli the cyclic phosphate product is hydrolyzed to ribose-1,5-bisphosphate by phnp. in this study, we describe the discovery and characterization of an enzyme that can hydrolyze a cyclic phosphodiester directly to a vicinal diol and inorganic phosphate. with prcp, this enzyme hydrolyzes the  phosphate ester at carbon-1 of the ribose moiety to form ribose-2,5-bisphosphate, and then this intermediate is hydrolyzed to ribose-5-phosphate and inorganic phosphate. ribose-1,5-bisphosphate is neither an intermediate nor a substrate for this enzyme. orthologues of this enzyme are found in the human pathogens clostridium difficile and eggerthella lenta. we propose that this enzyme be called cyclic phosphate dihydrolase (cpdh) and be designated as phnpp.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == in vitro activities of a new des-fluoro(6) quinolone, garenoxacin, against clinical anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial activities of garenoxacin and eight other antibiotics against 641 anaerobic isolates were evaluated with the nccls agar dilution method. overall, the mics of garenoxacin for 50 and 90% of the strains tested (in micrograms per milliliter) were as follows: bacteroides fragilis group, 0.5 and 2; prevotella spp., 0.25 and 2; fusobacterium spp., 0.25 and 0.5; porphyromonas spp., 0.125 and 0.25; bilophila wadsworthia, 0.5 and 1; veillonella spp., 0.25 and 0.5; clostridium spp., 0.25 and 1; clostridium difficile, 2 and >64; bifidobacterium spp., 1 and 2; eggerthella lenta, 0.25 and 1; propionibacterium spp., 0.5 and 0.5; gram-positive cocci, 0.125 and 0.25.
