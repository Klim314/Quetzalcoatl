TI  - A microbiological profile of unexposed and exposed pulp space of primary endodontic infections by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization, the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections in cases associated with exposed (n = 30) and unexposed (n = 30) pulp space. METHODS: Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions. The presence, levels, and proportions of 40 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. RESULTS: The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in exposed pulp space cases were Eubacterium saburreum, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Tannerella forsythia, Enterococcus faecalis, Neisseria mucosa, Campylobacter gracilis, and Prevotella nigrescens, and in unexposed pulp space cases they were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, N. mucosa, E. faecalis, E. saburreum, C. gracilis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Counts of F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Campylobacter sputigena, Capnocytophaga showae, Treponema socrenskii, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Eikenella corrodens, and Capnocytophaga ochracea were significantly higher in unexposed pulp space cases (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The data of the present investigation suggested specific differences between the composition of the microbiota in cases with exposed and unexposed pulp space and an association between higher levels of some specific species and unexposed pulp space cases.
TI  - A microbiological profile of symptomatic teeth with primary endodontic infections.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of the microbiota of primary endodontic infections associated with symptomatic teeth. Samples were collected by means of a #15 H-type file and 2 sterile paper points from 60 symptomatic (n = 30) or asymptomatic (n = 30) single-rooted teeth with necrotic pulp. The presence of 40 bacterial species was determined by the checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization method. The species found in higher counts (x10(5)) in symptomatic cases were Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Veillonella parvula, Treponema socranskii, Enterococcus faecalis, and Campylobacter gracilis and in asymptomatic cases were F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, E. faecalis, Eubacterium saburreum, and Neisseria mucosa. Total bacterial counts and counts of Tannerella forsythia were significant higher in symptomatic cases (p < 0.05), whereas levels of Propionibacterium acnes were reduced in this group of teeth. The data of the present investigation suggested an association between higher total bacterial counts and levels of T. forsythia and the presence of pain.
TI  - Association of Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola with human periodontitis lesions.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present investigation was to compare the levels, proportions and percentage of sites colonized by 40 bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples from periodontally healthy subjects and patients with chronic periodontitis to seek possible pathogens other than the consensus pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Tannerella forsythia. METHOD: Subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 635 subjects with chronic periodontitis and 189 periodontally healthy subjects. The samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization (total samples = 21,832). Mean counts, % DNA probe counts and percentage of sites colonized at >10(5) were determined for each species in each subject and then averaged in each clinical group. Significance of difference between groups was determined using the Mann-Whitney test. Association between combinations of species and periodontal status was examined by stepwise logistic regression analysis. Analyses were repeated using a subset of subjects from both clinical groups who had proportions of P. gingivalis plus T. forsythia less than the median (4.42%) found in periodontally healthy subjects. All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: For the 824 subjects the consensus pathogens P. gingivalis and T. forsythia as well as Eubacterium nodatum and Treponema denticola had significantly higher mean counts, proportions and percentage of sites colonized in samples from subjects with periodontitis than from periodontally healthy subjects. There were significantly more Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Streptococcus gordonii and Veillonella parvula in periodontally healthy subjects. E. nodatum, T. denticola, Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus intermedius, Fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. vincentii all had higher counts and proportions in diseased than healthy subjects who had low proportions of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the same species groups were associated with disease status after adjusting for the proportions of the other species. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation confirmed the strong association of P. gingivalis and T. forsythia with chronic periodontitis and emphasized a strong association of E. nodatum and T. denticola with periodontitis whether in the presence or absence of high levels of the consensus pathogens. Other species, including S. oralis, Eikenella corrodens, S. intermedius and F. nucleatum ssp. vincentii, were associated with disease when P. gingivalis and T. forsythia were present in low proportions.
