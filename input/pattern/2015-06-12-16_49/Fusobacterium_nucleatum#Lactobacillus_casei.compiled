TI  - Antibacterial action of Chlorhexidine/thymol containing varnishes in vitro and in vivo.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antibacterial activity of two different formulations of a chlorhexidine/thymol varnish should be elucidated in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The agar diffusion assay with Cervitec((R)) and CervitecPlus((R)) and three reference strains each of streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and periodontal pathogens was performed. In a split-mouth study, 40 volunteers applied the test (CervitecPlus((R)), solvent water and ethanol) and control (Cervitec((R)), solvent ethyl acetate) varnish at buccal recessions of premolar teeth at baseline as well as after two, four and seven days. Supra- and subgingival plaques were collected 2 weeks before baseline and at the screening appointments. Supragingival plaque was analysed for mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and subgingival samples for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Porphyromonas intermedia. Friedman/Wilcoxon tests and U-test were used for statistical analysis (P < 0.05). RESULTS: Most reference strains were susceptible with inhibition zones (mm) as follows: Cervitec((R))/CervitecPlus((R)) streptococci 27 +/- 1.7/21.3 +/- 2.5, lactobacilli 26 +/- 9.2/23.7 +/- 4.9, actinomyces 36.3 +/- 6.6/27.3 +/- 1.5, periodontal pathogens 18.7 +/- 7.6/18 +/- 1.7. Both varnishes reduced significantly the counts of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli in the patients. However, no significant differences were found between test and control sides at any time. The total counts of periodontal pathogens were low. A tendency to higher counts of A. actinomycetemcomitans at the control side could be shown; the test side did not harbour significantly higher counts. CONCLUSION: Both varnishes may influence the plaque formation and reduce mutans streptococci in supragingival plaque.
TI  - Biodegradable nanofibrous drug delivery systems: effects of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin on periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purposes of this study were to fabricate biodegradable polydioxanone (PDS II(R)) electrospun periodontal drug delivery systems (hereafter referred to as matrices) containing either metronidazole (MET) or ciprofloxacin (CIP) and to investigate the effects of antibiotic incorporation on both periodontopathogens and commensal oral bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fibrous matrices were processed from PDS polymer solution by electrospinning. Antibiotic-containing PDS solutions were prepared to obtain four distinct groups: 5 wt.% MET, 25 wt.% MET, 5 wt.% CIP, and 25 wt.% CIP. Pure PDS was used as a control. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was done to evaluate MET and CIP release. Dual-species biofilms formed by Lactobacillus casei (Lc) and Streptococcus salivarius (Ss) were grown on the surface of all electrospun matrices. After 4 days of biofilm growth, the viability of bacteria on biofilms was assessed. Additionally, antimicrobial properties were evaluated against periodontopathogens Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (Aa) using agar diffusion assay. RESULTS: A three-dimensional interconnected porous network was observed in the different fabricated matrices. Pure PDS showed the highest fiber diameter mean (1,158 +/- 402 nm) followed in a descending order by groups 5 wt.% MET (1,108 +/- 383 nm), 25 wt.% MET (944 +/- 392 nm), 5 wt.% CIP (871 +/- 309 nm), and 25 wt.% CIP (765 +/- 288 nm). HPLC demonstrated that groups containing higher amounts (25 wt.%) of incorporated drugs released more over time, while those with lower levels (5 wt.%) the least. No inhibitory effect of the tested antibiotics was detected on biofilm formation by the tested commensal oral bacteria. Meanwhile, CIP-containing matrices inhibited growth of Fn and Aa. CONCLUSION: CIP-containing matrices led to a significant inhibition of periodontopathogens without negatively impairing the growth of periodontal beneficial bacteria. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Based on the proven in vitro inhibition of periodontitis-related bacteria, future in vivo research using relevant animal models is needed to confirm the effectiveness of these drug delivery systems.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) root against oral microorganisms.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates (ITCs) extracted from horseradish root was investigated against oral microorganisms: 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, Lactobacillus casei, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans; one strain of yeast, Candida albicans, and 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella nigrescens, and Clostridium perfringens. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed antimicrobial activity against all oral microorganisms by the paper disk method. The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of the ITCs extracted from horseradish root ranged from 1.25 to 5.00 mg/ml against 6 strains of facultative anaerobic bacteria and one strain of yeast, and 4.17 to 16.67 mg/ml against 3 strains of anaerobic bacteria. The ITCs extracted from horseradish root showed the strongest antimicrobial activity, with a MBC of 1.25 mg/ml, against C. albicans among facultative microorganisms, and 4.17 mg/ml against F. nucleatum among anaerobic bacteria. These results suggest that the ITCs extracted from horseradish root may be a candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent against oral microorganisms.
TI  - Bacterial antagonism against periodontopathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the current study is to compare the prevalence of commensal bacteria, with beneficial properties, for healthy and diseased individuals and additionally to examine the inhibitory effect of some commercial dietary probiotics on periodontopathogens, comparing this inhibitory effect to that of orally derived beneficial bacteria. METHODS: Subgingival plaque samples from 35 patients (healthy and periodontitis patients) were analyzed. Growth inhibition of the periodontal pathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was examined using the agar overlay technique and agar well diffusion method. The quantification of the inhibitory effect was checked with the agar well diffusion method. RESULTS: Using the agar overlay technique, the prevalence of strains antagonistic toward P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and F. nucleatum was found to be higher in healthy individuals than in individuals with periodontitis, but this could not be validated by the agar well diffusion assay. Compared with the antagonistic activity of the isolated strains, the probiotic strains overall showed a stronger inhibition of the periodontal pathogens. CONCLUSION: It was shown that some oral bacteria can cause antagonism toward periodontopathogens, and these observations underline the therapeutic potential of applications that stimulate oral health by the application of beneficial effector strains.
TI  - Using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  - High throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. However, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. In this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. We then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity and biogeography patterns. Mock community analysis showed primer and DNA isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Sequencing of salivary and mucosal communities found a total of 455 OTUs (0.3% dissimilarity) with only 78 of these present in all subjects. We demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. With respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. These differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by the abundance of Streptococcus mitis and Gemella haemolysans in mucosa. In summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. Despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.
TI  - Effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  - Oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. We report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Streptococcus mitis, Veillonella parvula, and Fusobacterium nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens Porphyromonas gingivalis and Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. The presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding RNAs is stimulated. In the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. However, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. We also observed a significant upregulation of ABC transport systems and putative transposases. Changes in Clusters of Orthologous Groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of transcription factors were upregulated. Finally, we identified several small noncoding RNAs whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. These results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.
TI  - Community-based interference against integration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  - As part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. Unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. Less emphasis has been given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. In this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. When co-cultivated in saliva medium, P. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. Furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. More interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent P. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. Our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbiota of dentinal caries as assessed by reverse-capture checkerboard analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to identify the microbiota of different layers  of dentinal caries by using a culture-independent molecular biology approach. METHODS: DNA was extracted from samples taken from 3 distinct layers (superficial, middle and deep) of advanced occlusal caries and analyzed for the presence and relative levels of 28 oral bacterial species/phylotypes using a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. RESULTS: The mean number of target taxa per layer was 7.7 (+/- 3.96) in the superficial, 7 (+/- 3.4) in the middle, and 6.3 (+/- 3.04) in the deep layer. No statistical significance was observed for these differences (p = 0.36). Overall, the most prevalent taxa in the 3 layers were Atopobium genomospecies C1 (72.5%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (69%), Lactobacillus casei (68%), Veillonella species (55%) and Lactobacillus fermentum (52%). No differences were found in the prevalence rates of the most frequent target species in the 3 layers. The most prevalent taxa found at levels above 10(5) in the advanced front line of deep-dentin caries were Atopobium genomospecies C1, F. nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus species and Veillonella species. CONCLUSION: The present results revealed that the prevalences of several established or candidate caries pathogens do not differ significantly in the different zones of dentinal caries lesions. The finding that some as-yet-uncharacterized species and novel species were found in high frequencies join other molecular studies to include them in the set of candidate caries pathogens.
TI  - TGF-beta1 Inhibits TLR-mediated odontoblast responses to oral bacteria.
AB  - TGF-beta1 exerts diverse functions in tooth development and tissue repair, but its role in microbial defenses of the tooth is not well-understood. Odontoblasts extending their cellular processes into the dentin are the first cells to recognize signals from TGF-beta1 and bacteria in carious dentin. This study aimed to determine the role of TGF-beta1 in modulating odontoblast responses to oral bacteria. We show that these responses depend upon the expression levels of microbial recognition receptors TLR2 and TLR4 on the cell surface. Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum activated both TLRs, but TLR4 played a greater role. Lack of cell-surface TLR2 was associated with poor response to Streptococcus mutans, Enterococcus faecalis, and Lactobacillus casei. TGF-beta1 inhibited TLR2 and TLR4 expression and attenuated odontoblast responses. Our findings suggest that the balance between TLR-mediated inflammation and TGF-beta1 anti-inflammatory activity plays an important role in pulpal inflammation.
TI  - Effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on biofilm-forming bacteria associated with endodontic pathogens in vitro.
AB  - With the development of dental laser delivery systems that can enter into the root canals, it is possible to use Er:YAG lasers to remove the residual biofilm associated with infected root canals. We examined their effects against biofilms made of Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus casei, Propionibacterium acnes, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, or Prevotella nigrescens in vitro. After Er:YAG laser irradiation with energy densities ranging between 0.38-0.98 J/cm(2), the biofilm samples on hydroxyapatite disks were quantitatively and morphologically evaluated. The Er:YAG laser was effective against biofilms of 6 of the bacterial species examined, with the exception of those formed by L. casei. After irradiation, the numbers of viable cells in the biofilms were significantly decreased, whereas atrophic changes in bacterial cells and reductions in biofilm cell density were seen morphologically. Er: YAG lasers might be suitable for clinical application as a suppressive and removal device of biofilms in endodontic treatments.
TI  - In vitro antioxidant potential of medicinal plant extracts and their activities against oral bacteria based on Brazilian folk medicine.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine antibacterial activities  of Cocos nucifera (husk fiber), Ziziphus joazeiro (inner bark), Caesalpinia pyramidalis (leaves), aqueous extracts and Aristolochia cymbifera (rhizomes) alcoholic extract against Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus casei. The antioxidant activity and acute toxicity of these extracts were also evaluated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The plant extracts antibacterial activity was evaluated in vitro and the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth micro-dilution assay. The bacterial killing kinetic was also evaluated for all extracts. In addition, the antibacterial effect of the extracts was tested in vitro on artificial oral biofilms. The acute toxicity of each extract was determined in according to Lorke [Lorke D. A new approach to practical acute toxicity testing. Arch Toxicol 1983;54:275-87] and the antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH photometric assay [Mensor LL, Menezes FS, Leitao GG, Reis AS, Santos TC, Coube CS, et al. Screening of Brazilian plants extract for antioxidant activity by the use of DPPH free radical method. Phytother Res 2001;15:127-30]. RESULTS: MIC and the bactericidal concentrations were identical, for each evaluated extract. However, microbes of artificial biofilms were less sensitive to the extracts than the planktonic strains. A. cymbifera extract induced the highest bactericidal effect against all tested bacteria, followed by C. nucifera, Z. joazeiro and C. pyramidalis extracts, respectively. All extracts showed good antioxidant potential, being C. nucifera and C. pyramidalis aqueous extracts the most active ones. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, all oral bacteria tested (planktonic or in artificial biofilms) were more susceptible to, and rapidly killed in presence of A. cymbifera, C. pyramidalis and C. nucifera than Z. joazeiro extracts, respectively. Thus, these extracts may be of great interest for future studies about treatment of oral diseases, considering their potent antioxidant activity and low toxicity.
TI  - Effects of sonicated Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Lactobacillus casei extracts on interleukin-8 production by human dental pulp cells.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the effects of Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Lactobacillus casei on the production of IL-8 by human dental pulp cells. Human dental pulp cells from teeth of young patients (aged 18-25 years) were cultured and tested with sonicated P. intermedia ATCC 25611, F. nucleatum ATCC 25586 and L. casei ATCC 4646 extracts. IL-8 secreted into the culture supernatants were measured at 6, 12 and 24 hours using a quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay technique. Cell viability was evaluated using trypan blue exclusion technique. IL-8 production by human dental pulp cells increased significantly at 12 and 24 hours after exposure to P. intermedia and F. nucleatum, whereas L. casei extract exhibited low IL-8 production. The sonicated bacterial extracts did not significantly affect viability or total number of dental pulp cells.
TI  - The ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  - Some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. The aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. Streptococcus mutans, S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus fermentans, L. casei, L. rhamnosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, A. israelii, Prevotella intermedia, and Fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto Columbia agar with haemin and vitamin K and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. The resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. The red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. All colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. The green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) S. oralis, S. salivarius, S. mutans, F. nucleatum and S. sobrinus. The red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) P. intermedia, A. naeslundi, A. israelii, L. fermentans, L. rhamnosus and L. casei. With all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. We conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.
TI  - Susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and LL37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. The susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. METHODS: Synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hBD1), hBD2, hBD3 and LL37 (CAP18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. They included Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), Porphyromonas gingivalis (6), Prevotella intermedia (7), Fusobacterium nucleatum (7), Streptococcus mutans (5), Streptococcus sobrinus (5), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus sanguis (4), Streptococcus mitis (2) and Lactobacillus casei (1). RESULTS: Although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. The antibacterial activity of hBD1 was lower than that of the other peptides. Among the bacteria tested in this study, F. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hBD3 and LL37, and S. mutans was highly susceptible to hBD3. We measured the Zeta-potential, representing the net charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. Although we found some correlation in A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that beta-defensins and LL37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.
TI  - Effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  - According to the US Surgeon General's report, "Oral Health in America," published in 2000, most adults in the United States show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. Periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. New evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. For this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. This article summarizes laboratory research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. This unique combination of agents is found in Colgate Total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. Data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. In addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone resorption. Overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of Colgate Total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.
TI  - Antagonistic interactions among Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia with oral lactobacilli.
AB  - Microbiota residing in oral ecosystems show great complexity because of the mutual interdependence of certain microorganisms that might influence their presence or absence at a given site. The aim of this work was to evaluate possible antagonistic interactions among Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella intermedia, isolated from periodontal pockets, and Lactobacillus casei, L. salivarius, L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum isolated from saliva. Different tests were carried out using each strain as an effector as well as a sensitive strain, alternatively: (1) agar diffusion with paper disks embedded with supernatants and pellets in different culture media; (b) the well diffusion assay; (c) the double layer method; and (d) OD(560) measurements of the kinetic growth of Lactobacillus strains in LAPTg broth with different volumes of F. nucleatum supernatant. P. intermedia supernatant did not have an inhibitory effect on Lactobacillus growth, except for L. casei, when the double plaque method was used. F. nucleatum supernatant inhibited growth of all Lactobacillus strains when the well diffusion method was used. F. nucleatum inhibited L. casei growth whatever the method used. The substance responsible for inhibition was a thermoresistant extracellular protein which was hydrolyzed by trypsin-like proteases. None of the species of lactobacilli studied inhibited the growth of P. intermedia or F. nucleatum.
TI  - An immunohistological study of the localization of bacteria invading root pulpal  walls of teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  - We immunohistologically examined the prevalence and localization of bacteria invading dentinal tubules of the roots of teeth with infected canals. Forty extracted teeth with apical lesions were selected and divided into two groups: a group of untreated teeth and a group of canal-enlarged teeth. The bacteria in the specimens were detected by Brown-Brenn stain and the labeled-streptavidin-biotin method with specific antisera for 16-bacteria. Seventy percent of the examined teeth showed bacteria invading the dentinal tubules of the roots. Fusobacterium nucleatum, Eubacterium alactolyticum, E. nodatum, Lactobacillus casei, and Peptostreptococcus micros were abundant. Even in the canal-enlarged group, invasion of bacteria was observed in 65% of teeth. This study revealed the actual condition of bacteria in infected root dentin and suggested that the canal-enlargement procedure could not completely remove all the bacteria in the infected dentinal tubules of the root.
TI  - Competition for glucose between Candida albicans and oral bacteria grown in mixed culture in a chemostat.
AB  - The competition for glucose as a growth-limiting substrate between Candida albicans and a mixed community of oral bacteria was investigated. A chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting and glucose excess conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05/h. A mixed population of oral bacteria was established and after a steady state had been reached the chemostat was inoculated with C. albicans. Seven bacterial species Streptococcus sanguis, S. sobrinus, S. mitis, Lactobacillus casei, Veillonella dispar, Eubacterium saburreum and Fusobacterium nucleatum - were able to establish stable populations under glucose-limiting conditions. The yeast was unable to grow with the bacteria under glucose limitation. Only three bacterial species, S. sobrinus, L. casei and E. saburreum, became established under glucose-excess conditions. C. albicans was also able to become established in the glucose-excess chemostat and could grow and maintain a steady state in a mixed culture with these organisms. L. casei, S. mitis and S. sobrinus had faster glucose consumption rates than C. albicans. All the bacteria, except for E nucleatum, had maximum specific growth rates higher than C. albicans. The results suggest that glucose may act as a growth-limiting substrate for C. albicans in the establishment and growth of the yeast in a mixed community of oral bacteria.
TI  - The formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  - A chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). Eleven bacterial species (Streptococcus gordonii, Strep. mitis I, Strep. mutans, Strep. oralis, Actinomyces naeslundii, Lactobacillus casei, Neisseria subflava, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. A flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. The biofilm produced from state-1 showed a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 Pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 Pa). The biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. Gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while Gram-negative species were predominant in state-2.
TI  - Comparative antimicrobial activity of an essential oil and an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse in vitro.
AB  - Although laboratory studies are not necessarily predictive of clinical activity;  they can help to elucidate mechanisms underlying clinical activity when the latter has been established. In a recent clinical study, an essential oil mouthrinse (Listerine Antiseptic) was shown to be significantly more effective than an amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse (Meridol) in inhibiting supragingival plaque formation. This paper reports the results of laboratory studies comparing the antimicrobial effectiveness of these 2 mouthrinses using a kill kinetics assay and a plaque biofilm kill assay. In both assays, the essential oil mouthrinse was considerably more effective than the amine fluoride/stannous fluoride mouthrinse. These findings are consistent with the results of the clinical trial and may help to explain the observed differences in clinical activity.
TI  - The establishment of a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of Candida albicans in a chemostat.
AB  - The purpose of this study was to establish and identify a community of oral bacteria that controls the growth of Candida albicans in the chemostat. The chemostat was operated under glucose-limiting conditions at a dilution rate of 0.05 h-1 and inoculated with a yeast-free suspension of a tongue scraping. After a steady state had been reached, it was inoculated with C. albicans to establish the yeast and determine whether its growth could be contained. The steady-state community comprised the species Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus sobrinus, Streptococcus mitis, Lactobacillus casei, Eubacterium saburreum, Veillonella dispar and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Bacteroides gracilus and Haemophilus segnis were also detected but infrequently. Yeast growth was suppressed and yeast cells were lost at the same rate as the theoretical washout rate. It is concluded that this mixed community of oral bacteria can be used to identify the parameters that maintain the equilibrium between oral bacteria and C. albicans in the oral cavity.
TI  - The effects of triclosan and zinc citrate, alone and in combination, on a community of oral bacteria grown in vitro.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of Triclosan and zinc citrate. The inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/L Triclosan and 39.8 mumol/L zinc citrate. When dosed, Triclosan inhibited A. viscosus and all five Gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. Similar effects were seen when Triclosan was pulsed, except that S. mutans was the most sensitive Gram-positive species and V. dispar was unaffected. However, when the inhibitors were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against Gram-negative species, although S. gordonii and S. oralis were relatively unaffected. The data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.
TI  - Isolation and properties of the Capnocytophaga ochracea bacteriocin.
AB  - A bacteriocin from a subgingival plaque isolate of Capnocytophaga ochracea was purified and characterized. It was isolated from cell extract and had a molecular weight of 100,000. Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans and Propionibacterium acnes were susceptible to the bacteriocin.
TI  - A mixed-culture chemostat system to predict the effect of anti-microbial agents on the oral flora: preliminary studies using chlorhexidine.
AB  - A mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. The advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. The effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (CHX) and (ii) three pulses of CHX (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/L) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. Only L. casei survived the continuous provision of CHX; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to CHX. After each CHX pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. Again, L. casei was least affected, while A. viscosus, B. intermedius, and F. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. Counts of S. mutans were affected more by CHX than those of S. sanguis or S. mitior. The effect of successive pulses of CHX on the viability of some bacteria and on acid production (as measured by pH-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to CHX had occurred. The fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.
TI  - Lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion lysis of oral bacterial strains in buffers and stimulated whole saliva.
AB  - Similar to Streptococcus mutans, buffer suspensions of Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Fusobacterium nucleatum all undergo cell lysis when treated with the lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system. For Lactobacillus species treated with lysozyme and proteases at pHs of 4 and 5.3, lysis resulted when a lytic activating concentration of bicarbonate anion followed enzyme treatment. Furthermore, synergistic lysis of these bacteria was noted when lysozyme-protease treatment was followed by bicarbonate anion used in combination with chloride or fluoride anions. Noteworthy, the halides were not active in promoting lysis when used by themselves in the absence of bicarbonate. For F. nucleatum suspended at pH 6.9, lysis was dependent upon the ionic strength of the buffer and resulted when lysozyme-protease treatment of the organism was followed by 100 mmol/L bicarbonate activation. When lysozyme and proteases were omitted from the incubation mixtures and replaced by stimulated whole saliva, pH 5.3, lysis was observed only with L. plantarum and S. mutans, but not with L. casei. The latter could be lysed, however, if suspended in saliva which was diluted several-fold with distilled water. In experiments where lysozyme was selectively depleted from whole saliva by immunoadsorption affinity chromatography, the great majority of the lysis capability of the saliva for L. plantarum was lost, although a significant degree of lysis appeared to be due to salivary factors other than lysozyme. F. nucleatum was also found to lyse in saliva at neutral pH, suggesting that both Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral bacteria may be susceptible to this antibacterial system in vivo.
TI  - The establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  - Nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant pH 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. The bacterial populations were Streptococcus mutans ATCC 2-27351, Strep. sanguis NCTC 7865, Strep. mitior EF 186, Actinomyces viscosus WVU 627, Lactobacillus casei AC 413, Neisseria sp. A1078, Veillonella alkalescens ATCC 17745, Bacteroides intermedius T 588 and Fusobacterium nucleatum NCTC 10593. All nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although Strep. sanguis and Neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. In contrast, even following repeated inoculations, Strep. mutans, B. intermedius and Neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. A more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (Y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. Microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring among community members. To compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. The bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. Although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.
TI  - Effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  - Pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. Fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and Streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than Fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. The effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.
