TI  == detection, partial purification and characterization of bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 isolated from freshwater fish: bacteriocin from lb. brevis fptlb3.
AB  == lactobacillus brevis fptlb3 was isolated from freshwater fish, capable of producing bacteriocin that had broad spectrum of inhibition (3200 au/ml) against  escherichia coli mtcc 1563, enterococcus faecalis mtcc 2729, lactobacillus casei  mtcc 1423, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923. the antimicrobial activity of crude supernatant fluid was stable after heating at 121 degrees c for 60 min and declined thereafter. stability of antimicrobial activity was observed at ph range of 2.0 to 8.0. its active principle was proteinaceous in nature since the bacteriocin was inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not by other non-proteolytic enzymes. mitomycin c and uv light did not affect the activity of the bacteriocin, while chloroform extraction completely destroyed their activity. exposure to surfactant resulted in an increase in titre, except nonidet p-40, which led to total loss of activity. no bacteriocin adsorption was detected at ph 1 to 2, whereas 100% bacteriocin adsorption was found at ph 6.5. based on tricine sds-page the estimated molecular mass of bacteriocin was 54 kda. no plasmid was found to present in the isolate.

TI  == technological and safety properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from spanish dry-cured sausages.
AB  == technological and safety-related properties were analyzed in lactic acid bacteria isolated from spanish dry-cured sausages in order to select them as starter cultures. in relation to technological properties, all the strains showed significative nitrate reductase activity; lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus  paracasei and 52% of the enterococcus faecium strains showed lipolytic activity and only lactobacillus sakei strains (43%) were able to form biofilms. related to safety aspects, e. faecium strains were the most resistant to antibiotics, whereas, l. sakei strains were the most sensitive. in relation to virulence factors, in the e. faecium strains analyzed, only the presence of efaa gene was detected. the analysis of biogenic amine production showed that most e. faecium strains and l. sakei al-142 produced tyramine. in conclusion, l. paracasei al-128 and l. sakei al-143 strains possess the best properties to be selected as adequate and safe meat starter cultures.

TI  == application of bacteriocinogenic enterococcus mundtii crl35 and enterococcus faecium st88ch in the control of listeria monocytogenes in fresh minas cheese.
AB  == several strains of enterococcus spp. are capable of producing bacteriocins with antimicrobial activity against important bacterial pathogens in dairy products. in this study, the bacteriocins produced by two enterococcus strains (enterococcus mundtii crl35 and enterococcus faecium st88ch), isolated from cheeses, were characterized and tested for their capability to control growth of  listeria monocytogenes 426 in experimentally contaminated fresh minas cheese during refrigerated storage. both strains were active against a variety of pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms and bacteriocin absorption to various l. monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 and lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 varied according to the strain and the testing conditions (ph, temperature, presence of salts and surfactants). growth of l. monocytogenes 426 was inhibited in cheeses containing e. mundtii crl35 up to 12 days at 8 degrees c, evidencing a bacteriostatic effect. e. faecium st88ch was less effective, as the bacteriostatic affect occurred only after 6 days at 8 degrees c. in cheeses containing nisin (12.5 mg/kg), less than one log reduction was observed. this research underlines the potential application of e. mundtii crl35 in the control  of l. monocytogenes in minas cheese.

TI  == comparison of different ilve aminotransferases in lactobacillus sakei and investigation of their contribution to aroma formation from branched chain amino  acids.
AB  == branched chain aminotransferases (ilve/bcat), specific for leucine, isoleucine, and valine initialize the formation of methyl-branched volatiles, which are strongly linked to the typical aroma of cured meat products. lactobacillus sakei, one of the dominating lactic acid bacteria species for meat fermentations and commonly used as starter lacks this enzyme, whereas the presence of ilve has been reported for lactobacillus paracasei, a non-starter lactic acid bacterium occurring in meat products and with probiotic properties, in staphylococcus carnosus, a catalase positive cocci also used as starter for meat products, and in enterococcus faecalis belonging to the natural microbiota of meat and that may impact on the aroma of fermented meat products. the genes for branched-chain aminotransferases of these three bacterial species were used to complement the ilve negative strain l. sakei tmw1.1322. for that purpose, ilve genes were heterologously expressed in l. sakei tmw1.1322 under the control of the constitutive l. sakei promotor pldhl via replicative plasmids and chromosomal integration. to examine effective expression the constructs were transcriptionally coupled to mcherry, a red fluorescent protein. aminotransferase activities and formation of volatile compounds were compared. activities of l. sakei arct and aspd purified enzymes were also measured. conversion of branched chain amino acids to the corresponding alpha-keto-acids was significantly increased in all transformants expressing the ilve genes. the activity of ilve obtained from l. paracasei was highest. substrate specificities of ilves towards  leucine, isoleucine and valine were similar. however, enhanced transaminase activities did not increase formation of the respective methyl-branched volatiles by recombinant l. sakei strains. this indicates that presence of ilve cannot be the only bottleneck in aroma formation from amino acids. amino acid or peptide uptake into the cell via specific transport systems and the conversion of alpha-keto acids to the corresponding aldehydes, alcohols and carboxylic acids must be considered as further limiting steps.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == protein expression vector and secretion signal peptide optimization to drive the  production, secretion, and functional expression of the bacteriocin enterocin a in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == replacement of the leader sequence (ls) of the bacteriocin enterocin a (ls(enta)) by the signal peptides (sp) of the protein usp45 (sp(usp45)), and the bacteriocins enterocin p (sp(entp)), and hiracin jm79 (sp(hirjm79)) permits the production, secretion, and functional expression of enta by different lactic acid bacteria (lab). chimeric genes encoding the sp(usp45), the sp(entp), and the sp(hirjm79) fused to mature enta plus the enta immunity genes (enta+entia) were cloned into the expression vectors pnz8048 and pmsp3545, under control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter, and in pmg36c, under control of the constitutive p(32) promoter. the amount, antimicrobial activity, and specific antimicrobial activity of the enta produced by the recombinant lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, e. faecalis, lactobacillus sakei and pediococcus acidilactici hosts varied depending on the signal peptide, the expression vector, and the host strain. however, the antimicrobial activity and the specific antimicrobial activity of the enta produced by most of the lab transformants was lower than expected from their production. the supernatants of the recombinant l. lactis nz9000 (pnzuai) and l. lactis nz9000 (pnzhai), overproducers of enta, showed a 1.2- to 5.1-fold higher antimicrobial activity than that of the natural producer  e. faecium t136 against different listeria spp.

TI  == the role of two families of bacterial enzymes in putrescine synthesis from agmatine via agmatine deiminase.
AB  == putrescine, one of the main biogenic amines associated to microbial food spoilage, can be formed by bacteria from arginine via ornithine decarboxylase (odc), or from agmatine via agmatine deiminase (agdi). this study aims to correlate putrescine production from agmatine to the pathway involving n-carbamoylputrescine formation via addi (the agua product) and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (the agub product), or putrescine carbamoyltransferase (the ptca product) in bacteria. pcr methods were developed to detect the two genes involved in putrescine production from agmatine. putrescine production from agmatine could be linked to the agua and ptca genes in lactobacillus hilgardii x1b, enterococcus faecalis atcc 11700, and bacillus cereus atcc 14579. by contrast lactobacillus sakei 23k was unable to produce putrescine, and although a fragment of dna corresponding to the gene agua was amplified, no amplification was observed for the ptca gene. pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 produces putrescine and is reported to harbour agua and agub genes, responsible for agmatine deiminase and n-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase activities. the enzyme from p. aeruginosa pao1 that converts n-carbamoylputrescine to putrescine (the agub product) is different from other microorganisms studied (the ptca product). therefore, the agub gene from p. aeruginosa pao1 could not be amplified with ptca-specific primers. the agub and ptca genes have frequently been erroneously annotated in the past, as in fact these two enzymes are neither homologous nor analogous. furthermore, the agua, agub and ptca sequences available from genbank were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, revealing that gram-positive bacteria harboured ptca, whereas gram-negative bacteria harbour agub. this paper also discusses the role of the agmatine deiminase system (agds) in acid stress resistance.

TI  == potential beneficial properties of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from smoked salmon.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the probiotic properties of strains isolated from smoked salmon and previously identified as bacteriocin producers. methods and results: strains  lactobacillus curvatus et06, et30 and et31, lactobacillus fermentum et35, lactobacillus delbrueckii et32, pediococcus acidilactici et34 and enterococcus faecium et05, et12 and et88 survived conditions simulating the gastrointestinal tract (git) and produced bacteriocins active against several strains of listeria  monocytogenes, but presented very low activity against other lactic acid bacteria (lab). cell-free supernatants containing bacteriocins, added to 3-h-old cultures  of l. monocytogenes 603, suppressed growth over 12 h. auto-aggregation was strain-specific, and values ranged from 7.2% for et35 to 12.1% for et05. various  degrees of co-aggregation with l. monocytogenes 603, lactobacillus sakei atcc 15521 and enterococcus faecalis atcc 19443 were observed. adherence of the bacteriocinogenic strains to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. the highest levels of hydrophobicity were recorded for lact. curvatus (61.9-64.6%), lact. fermentum (78.9%), lact. delbrueckii (43.7%) and ped. acidilactici (51.3%), which are higher than the one recorded for lact. rhamnosus gg (53.3%). these strains were highly sensitive to several antibiotics and affected by several drugs from different generic groups in a strain-dependent manner. conclusions: smoked salmon is a rich source of probiotic lab. all strains survived conditions simulating the git and produced bacteriocins active against various pathogens. adherence to caco-2 cells was within the range reported for lact. rhamnosus gg, a well-known probiotic. in addition, the high hydrophobicity readings recorded define the strains as good probiotics.

TI  == polyphasic taxonomic studies of lactic acid bacteria associated with tunisian fermented meat based on the heterogeneity of the 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer region.
AB  == the objective of this work was to investigate the structure and diversity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) communities in traditionally fermented meat collected  from different areas of tunisia. a polyphasic study, which involves phenotypic tests and ribosomal dna-based techniques, was used to identify gram-positive and  catalase-negative isolates. pcr amplification of the 16s-23s rdna isr of 102 isolates and other reference lab strains gave (1) one type of rrn operon (m-isr)  for lactococci, (2) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and m-isr) for enterococci, (3) two types of rrn operon (s-isr and l-isr) for lactobacilli, and (4) three pcr amplicons (s-isr, m-isr, and l-isr) obtained for pediococcus spp. and weissella genus. the clustering and comparison of isr-rflp profiles given by the isolates with those given by reference lab strains, allowed their identification as lactococcus lactis, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus sanguinicola, enterococcus hawaiiensis, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus alimentarius, pediococcus pentosaceus, and weissella confusa. combined 16s-23s rdna isr and rflp patterns can be considered as a good potential target for a rapid and reliable differentiation between isolates of lab and provided further information on the organization of their rrn operons.

TI  == phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from "alheira", a traditional fermented sausage produced in portugal.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from "alheira", a fermented sausage produced  in portugal. lab were identified to genus and species level by phenotypic characteristics, using genus or species-specific primers and sequencing of the gene encoding 16s rrna. two-hundred and eighty-three isolates were grouped into 14 species. lactobacillus plantarum was isolated from all sausages and enterococcusfaecalis from most of the samples. low numbers of lactobacillus paraplantarum, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus zeae, lactobacillus paracasei, leuconostoc mesenteroides, pediococcus pentosaceus, pediococcus acidilactici, weissella cibaria, weissella viridescens and enterococcus faecium were recorded. the genetic heterogeneity of  l. plantarum and e. faecalis strains were determined by numerical analysis of dna banding patterns obtained by rapd-pcr. strains of l. plantarum and e. faecalis were different from different producers. this study forms the basis from which starter cultures could be selected for production of "alheira".

TI  == diversity of the resident microbiota in a thermophilic municipal biogas plant.
AB  == biogas plants continuously convert biological wastes mainly into a mixture of methane, co2 and h2o-a conversion that is carried out by a consortium of bacteria and archaea. especially in the municipal plants dedicated towards waste treatment, the reactor feed may vary considerably, exposing the resident microbiota to a changing variety of substrates. to evaluate how and if such changes influence the microbiology, an established biogas plant (6,600 m3, up to  600 m3 biogas per h) was followed over the course of more than 2 years via polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of 16s rrna genes and subsequent sequencing. both the bacterial and the archaeal community remained stable over the investigation. of the bacterial consortium, about half of the sequences were in decreasing order of occurrence: thermoacetogenium sp., anaerobaculum mobile, clostridium ultunense, petrotoga sp., lactobacillus hammesii, butyrivibrio sp., syntrophococcus sucromutans, olsenella sp., tepidanaerobacter sp., sporanaerobacter acetigenes, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, lactobacillus fuchuensis or lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus parabrevis or lactobacillus spicheri and enterococcus faecalis. the other half matched closely to ones from similar habitats (thermophilic anaerobic methanogenic digestion). the archaea consisted of methanobrevibacter sp., methanoculleus bourgensis, methanosphaera stadtmanae, methanimicrococcus blatticola and uncultured methanomicrobiales. the role of these species in methane production is discussed.

TI  == vectors for lactobacilli and other gram-positive bacteria based on the minimal replicon of prv500 from lactobacillus sakei.
AB  == the low-copy-number plasmid prv500, belonging to the pucl287 group of theta-type  plasmids, was previously isolated from lactobacillus sakei and characterized. we  show here that the replicon of this plasmid enables replication also in enterococcus faecalis and bacillus subtilis but not in lactococcus lactis. a 1.25 kb region encompassing the iterons and the repa gene was sufficient for replication, copy-number control and relative stable maintenance in l. sakei. functional implications of host or plasmid-borne factors in the maintenance of pucl287-type plasmids are discussed. the minimal replicon from prv500 was fused to pbluescript for constructing the shuttle e. coli/lactobacilli cloning vector prv610. prv610 enables the white/blue lacz alpha-complementation in e. coli. the  cassettes for selection (erythromycin resistance) and replication (iterons and repa gene) are each bordered by unique restriction sites for easy replacement if  needed. derivatives in which chloramphenicol or tetracycline resistance replaced  erythromycin resistance were constructed. in order to allow inducible gene expression, a copper-inducible promoter was placed on the prv613 derivative. expression of the downstream reporter gene lacz was shown to be induced by 30 microm cuso(4).

TI  == cloning and heterologous production of hiracin jm79, a sec-dependent bacteriocin  produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, in lactic acid bacteria and pichia pastoris.
AB  == hiracin jm79 (hirjm79), a sec-dependent bacteriocin produced by enterococcus hirae dch5, was cloned and produced in lactococcus lactis, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, and pichia pastoris. for heterologous production of hirjm79 in lactic acid bacteria (lab), the hirjm79 structural gene (hirjm79), with or without the hirjm79 immunity gene (hirijm79),  was cloned into the plasmid pmg36c under the control of the constitutive promoter p(32) and into the plasmid pnz8048 under the control of the inducible p(nisa) promoter. for the production of hirjm79 in p. pastoris, the gene encoding the mature hirjm79 protein was cloned into the ppiczalphaa expression vector. the recombinant plasmids permitted the production of biologically active hirjm79 in the supernatants of l. lactis il1403, l. lactis nz9000, l. sakei lb790, e. faecalis jh2-2, and p. pastoris x-33, the coproduction of hirjm79 and nisin a in  l. lactis dpc5598, and the coproduction of hirjm79 and enterocin p in e. faecium  l50/14-2. all recombinant lab produced larger quantities of hirjm79 than e. hirae dch5, although the antimicrobial activities of most transformants were lower than that predicted from their production of hirjm79. the synthesis, processing, and secretion of hirjm79 proceed efficiently in recombinant lab strains and p. pastoris.

TI  == protein synthesis in lactic acid and pathogenic bacteria during recovery from a high pressure treatment.
AB  == recovery of injured bacteria after high hydrostatic pressure (hhp) treatment is a key point in food safety. in this study, protein synthesis during the recovery of meat environment bacteria listeria monocytogenes ctc1011, lactobacillus sakei 23k, l. sakei ctc494, enterococcus faecalis ctc6365 and enterococcus faecium ctc6375 after a 400 mpa hhp treatment was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting. after 2 h recovery from hhp treatment, the four species induced transcription factors and proteins related to protein synthesis or fate and enzymes from energy metabolism. however, several stress proteins were specifically induced in the two l. sakei strains. proteins from the general metabolism predominated in e. faecalis and e. faecium, and stress proteins and proteases predominated in l. monocytogenes. thus, each species induced a different number of proteins and displayed a specific response  which may reflect its specific fitness status.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == complete sequence of the enterocin q-encoding plasmid pciz2 from the multiple bacteriocin producer enterococcus faecium l50 and genetic characterization of enterocin q production and immunity.
AB  == the locations of the genetic determinants for enterocin l50 (entl50a and entl50b), enterocin q (entq), and enterocin p (entp) in the multiple bacteriocin  producer enterococcus faecium strain l50 were determined. these bacteriocin genes occur at different locations; entl50ab (encoding entl50a and entl50b) are on the  50-kb plasmid pciz1, entqa (encoding entq) is on the 7.4-kb plasmid pciz2, and entp (encoding entp) is on the chromosome. the complete nucleotide sequence of pciz2 was determined to be 7,383 bp long and contains 10 putative open reading frames (orfs) organized in three distinct regions. the first region contains three orfs: entqa preceded by two divergently oriented genes, entqb and entqc. entqb shows high levels of similarity to bacterial atp-binding cassette (abc) transporters, while entqc displays no significant similarity to any known protein. the second region encompasses four orfs (orf4 to orf7), and orf4 and orf5 display high levels of similarity to mobilization proteins from e. faecium and enterococcus faecalis. in addition, features resembling a transfer origin region (orit) were found in the promoter area of orf4. the third region contains  three orfs (orf8 to orf10), and orf8 and orf9 exhibit similarity to the replication initiator protein repe from e. faecalis and to repb proteins, respectively. to clarify the minimum requirement for entq synthesis, we subcloned and heterologously expressed a 2,371-bp fragment from pciz2 that encompasses only the entqa, entqb, and entqc genes in lactobacillus sakei, and we demonstrated that this fragment is sufficient for entq production. moreover, we also obtained  experimental results indicating that entqb is involved in abc transporter-mediated entq secretion, while entqc confers immunity to this bacteriocin.

AB  == enterococcus faecium t8, isolated from vaginal secretions of children with human  immunodeficiency virus, produces a class iia sec-dependent bacteriocin that is structurally different from three other class iia sec-dependent bacteriocins, i.e., enterocin p and an enterocin p-like bacteriocin, produced by enterococcus faecium, and bacteriocin 31, produced by enterococcus faecalis, and from a class  iii bacteriocin produced by e. faecalis. the genes encoding the bacteriocin, immunity protein, mobilization protein, and relaxase nuclease are located on a 7-kb plasmid. bacteriocin t8 has a molecular mass of 5.1 kda based on its dna sequence, similar to the 5.0 kda recorded for bacteriocin 31 but larger than the  4.6 kda reported for enterocin p. at the amino acid level, bacteriocin t8 is 69%  homologous to bacteriocin 31 and 47% homologous to enterocin p. bacteriocin t8 is active against e. faecalis isolated from patients diagnosed with vaginosis, against lactobacillus sakei, and against a propionibacterium sp. the peptide is heat stable (60 min at 100 degrees c) and remains active in phosphate buffer from ph 4.0 to 10.0. the mode of activity is bactericidal, as determined with e. faecalis.

TI  == lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == background: genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. from the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many  cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. results: a novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called csca, cscb, cscc  and cscd. clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, enterococcus faecalis, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of l. lactis ssp cremoris, lactobacillus casei, enterococcus faecium, pediococcus pentosaceus, lactobacillius brevis, oenococcus oeni, leuconostoc mesenteroides, and bacillus thuringiensis. these genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. all encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel wxl domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. transcriptome analysis in l. plantarum shows that the csca-d genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpa-mutant derivative of l. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. this is supported by the presence of predicted cre-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated csca-d gene clusters. conclusion: we propose that the csca, cscb, cscc and cscd proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.

TI  == enterococcus species dominating in fresh modified-atmosphere-packaged, marinated  broiler legs are overgrown by carnobacterium and lactobacillus species during storage at 6 degrees c.
AB  == in order to show which of the initial lactic acid bacteria (lab) contaminants are also causing spoilage of a modified-atmosphere-packaged (map), marinated broiler  leg product at 6 degrees c, lab were enumerated and identified on the 2nd and 17th days following manufacture. a total of 8 fresh and 13 spoiled packages were  studied for lab levels. in addition, aerobic mesophilic bacteria and enterobacteriaceae were determined. the average cfu/g values in the 8 fresh packages were 1.3 x 10(3), 9.8 x 10(3) and 2.6 x 10(2) on de man rogosa sharpe agar (mrs), plate count agar (pca) and violet red bile glucose agar (vrbg), respectively. the commercial shelf life for the product had been set as 12 days,  and all packages analyzed on the 17th day were deemed unfit for human consumption by sensory analysis. the corresponding cfu/g averages in the spoiled product were 1.4 x 10(9), 1.1 x 10(9) and 3.9 x 10(7) on mrs, pca and vrbg agar, respectively. for characterization of lab population, 104 colonies originating from the fresh packages and 144 colonies from the spoiled packages were randomly picked, cultured pure and identified to species level using a 16 and 23s rdna hindiii rflp (ribotyping) database. the results showed that enterococci (35.7% of the lab population) were dominating in the fresh product, whereas carnobacteria (59.7%) dominated among the spoilage lab. enterococcus faecalis, carnobacterium piscicola and carnobacterium divergens were the main species detected. in general, when the initial lab population is compared to the spoilage lab, a shift from homofermentative cocci towards carnobacteria, lactobacillus sakei/curvatus and heterofermentative rods is seen in this marinated product.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == antimicrobial potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 against selected bacteria.
AB  == immobilization of living cells of lactic acid bacteria could be an alternative or complementary method of immobilizing organic acids and bacteriocins and inhibit undesirable bacteria in foods. this study evaluated the inhibition potential of immobilized lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis atcc 11454 on selected bacteria by a modified method of the agar spot test. l. lactis was immobilized in calcium alginate (1 to 2%)-whey protein concentrate (0 and 1%) beads. the antimicrobial potential of immobilized l. lactis was evaluated in microbiological media against pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus) or  pseudomonas putida, a natural meat contaminant, and against seven gram-positive bacteria used as indicator strains. results obtained in this study indicated that immobilized l. lactis inhibited the growth of s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus curvatus, lactobacillus sakei, kocuria varians, and pediococcus acidilactici. only 4 h of incubation at 35 degrees c resulted in a clear inhibition zone around the beads that increased with time. with the addition of 10 mm of a chelating agent (edta) to the media, results showed growth inhibition of e. coli; however, p. putida and salmonella typhi were unaffected by this treatment. these results indicate that immobilized lactic acid bacteria strains can be successfully used to produce nisin and inhibit bacterial  growth in semisolid synthetic media.

TI  == phylogenetic analysis of gram-positive bacteria based on grpe, encoded by the dnak operon.
AB  == the dnak operon in gram-positive bacteria includes grpe, dnaj and, in some members, hrca as well. both dnak and dnaj have been utilized for constructing phylogenetic relationships among various organisms. multiple copies exist for dnak and dnaj genes in some bacterial genera, as opposed to a single gene copy for grpe and for hrca, according to the currently available data. here, we present a partial protein-based phylogenetic tree for gram-positive bacteria, derived by using the amino acid sequence identity of grpe; the results are compared with the phylogenetic trees generated from 5s rrna, 16s rrna, dnak and dnaj sequences. our results indicate three main groupings: two are within low-g+c dna gram-positive bacteria comprising bacillus species and staphylococcus aureus  on the one hand and streptococcus species/lactococcus lactis/enterococcus faecalis/lactobacillus sakei on the other hand; the mycobacterium species and streptomyces coelicolor, belonging to the high-g+c dna gram-positive bacteria, form the third cluster. this hierarchical arrangement is in close agreement with  that obtained with 16s rrna and dnak sequences but not dnaj-based phylogeny.

TI  == clpe, a novel type of hsp100 atpase, is part of the ctsr heat shock regulon of bacillus subtilis.
AB  == clp atpases, which include the ubiquitous hsp100 family, are classified according to their structural features and sequence similarities. during the course of the  bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project, we identified a gene encoding a new  member of the hsp100 family. we designated this protein clpe, as it is the prototype of a novel subfamily among the clp atpases, and have identified homologues in several bacteria, including listeria monocytogenes, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, lactobacillus sakei and clostridium acetobutylicum. a unique feature of these hsp100-type clp atpases is their amino-terminal zinc finger motif. unlike the other class iii genes of b. subtilis (clpc and clpp ), clpe does not appear to be required for stress tolerance. transcriptional analysis revealed two sigmaa-type promoters, expression from which was shown to be inducible by heat shock and puromycin treatment. investigation of the regulatory mechanism controlling clpe expression  indicates that this gene is controlled by ctsr and is thus a member of the class  iii heat shock genes of b. subtilis. ctsr negatively regulates clpe expression by binding to the promoter region, in which five ctsr binding sites were identified  through dnase i footprinting and sequence analysis.
