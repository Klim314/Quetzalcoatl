TI  - Detection of two groups of 25.2 MDa Tet M plasmids by polymerase chain reaction of the downstream region.
AB  - Forty-four Neisseria gonorrhoeae, 12 N. meningitidis, four Kingella denitrificans and one Eikenella corrodens carrying 25.2 MDa Tet M plasmids were analysed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to the downstream region of the incomplete Tet M transposon. From each isolate, one of two different PCR fragments of approximately 700 or 1600 bp were obtained. The two different sized PCR fragments had > or = 90% DNA sequence identity with Ureaplasma urealyticum Tet M downstream sequences. The difference between the large PCR fragment and the smaller PCR fragment was a deletion of over 800 bp in the smaller fragment. Both PCR fragments were found in plasmids isolated from N. gonorrhoeae and K. denitrificans. The smaller PCR fragment was found in N. meningitidis plasmids and the larger PCR fragment was found in the E. corrodens plasmid.
TI  - Characterization of the Tet M determinants in urogenital and respiratory bacteria.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant Fusobacterium nucleatum, Haemophilus ducreyi, Mycoplasma hominis, Peptostreptococcus spp., Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Veillonella parvula had DNA sequences which showed homology throughout the length of the Tet M transposon, Tn916. In contrast, Gardnerella vaginalis, commensal Neisseria spp., and the 25.2-megadalton plasmid family lacked the complete transposon.
