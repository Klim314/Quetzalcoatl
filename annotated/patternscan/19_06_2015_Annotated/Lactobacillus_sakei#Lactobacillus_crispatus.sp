TI  == susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == bacteria used as probiotics or in starter cultures may serve as hosts of antibiotic resistance genes, which can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. before launching a starter culture or a probiotic product into the market, it is  therefore important to verify that the single bacterial isolates (strains) do not contain transferable resistance genes. a study has been undertaken to establish the levels of susceptibility of lactobacillus spp. to various antimicrobial agents. this is a prerequisite for differentiating putative transferable resistance from natural resistance. a selection of 62 strains has been screened with the use of the etest (abbiodisk, stockholm, sweden) for their susceptibility to 25 antimicrobial agents. the strains belonged to the following species: lactobacillus plantarum/pentosus, l. rhamnosus, l. paracasei, l. sakei, l. curvatus and species of the l. acidophilus group: l. johnsonii, l. crispatus, l.  gasseri, and l. acidophilus. the results from the etests have shown that the level of susceptibility to the antimicrobial agents is species-dependent. for the following antimicrobial agents, susceptibility varied several folds between species: vancomycin, teicoplanin, tetracycline, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, fusidic acid, and clindamycin. the differences between the species were more subtle for the rest of the tested antimicrobial agents. on the basis of the result, it was possible to suggest minimal inhibition concentrations (mics) for the individual lactobacillus species to be used as a microbiological breakpoint when screening strains for transferable resistance genes.
