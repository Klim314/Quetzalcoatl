TI  == impact of systemic antimicrobials combined with anti-infective mechanical debridement on the microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis: a 6-month  rct.
AB  == aim: to compare the effects of systemic amoxicillin (amx) plus metronidazole (met) or placebos combined with anti-infective mechanical debridement on the sub-gingival microbiota of generalized aggressive periodontitis (gap). material and methods: the study was a 6-month randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial. thirty-one subjects received full-mouth ultrasonic debridement followed by scaling and root planing with chlorhexidine rinsing, brushing and irrigation. during mechanical therapy, subjects received systemic amx (500mg)+met (250mg) or placebo, t.i.d. for 10 days. sub-gingival samples were obtained from each patient and analysed for their composition by checkerboard at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-therapy. significant differences between groups over time were examined by general linear model of repeated measures. results: high levels of periodontal pathogens, as well as some "non-periodontal" species were observed. most of the periodontal pathogens decreased significantly over time (p<0.05), whereas "non-periodontal" bacteria tended to increase in both groups. sites that showed attachment loss and probing  depth increase harboured higher levels of dialister pneumosintes, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium necrophorum, prevotella tannerea and peptostreptococcus anaerobius than sites that improved after both therapies (p<0.05). conclusions: systemic amx+met or placebos adjunctive to anti-infective mechanical debridement  were comparable in lowering periodontal pathogens up to 6 months after treatment. species not commonly associated with gap were less affected by both therapies.

TI  == competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  == objective: to investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. material and methods: the antimicrobial activity  of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains.  four probiotic bacterial species (lactobacillus bulgaricus, streptococcus thermophilus, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium) were isolated from  yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. results: fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. in addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', streptococcus sanguinis. the competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. when probiotics were inoculated first, bifidobacterium inhibited porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas circumdentaria, and prevotella nigrescens; l. acidophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. circumdentaria, p. nigrescens, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius; l. bulgaricus inhibited p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and p. nigrescens; and s. thermophilus inhibited p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, and p. nigrescens. however, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens)  were inoculated simultaneously. when periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, prevotella intermedia inhibited bifidobacterium and s. thermophilus. conclusions: the results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are  capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.

TI  == actinomycetemcomitin: a new bacteriocin produced by aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans p(7-20) strain isolated from a periodontally diseased patient has produced a bacteriocin (named as actinomycetemcomitin) that is active against peptostreptococcus anaerobius atcc 27337. actinomycetemcomitin was produced during exponential and stationary growth phases, and its amount decreased until it disappeared during the decline growth phase. it was purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation (30-60% saturation), and further by fplc (mono-q ionic exchange and phenyl superose hydrophobic interaction) and hplc (c-18 reversed-phase). this bacteriocin loses its activity  after incubation at a ph below 7.0 or above 8.0, following heating for 30 min at  45 degrees c, and after treatment with proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, and papain. actinomycetemcomitin has a molecular mass of 20.3 kda and it represents a new bacteriocin from a. actinomycetemcomitans.

TI  == the gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  == a gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, eikenella  corrodens, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, capnocytophaga ochracea, eubacterium nodatum and fusobacterium nucleatum and one  nonoral microorganism, porphyromonas asaccharolytica. of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were e. nodatum (72%) and a. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). more juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to p. intermedia, c. ochracea, e. nodatum and p. micros. no significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. cluster analysis revealed  the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of p. micros and  c. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. the data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.

TI  == periodontal bone loss in mice induced by different periodontopathic organisms.
AB  == periodontal bone loss in mice orally inoculated with peptostreptococcus anaerobius, pept. magnus and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was compared to that in sham-inoculated mice. six-to-8-week-old balb/c mice were inoculated with  1 x 10(5), 1 x 10(7) or 1 x 10(9) colony-forming units (c.f.u.) of bacteria in 50 microliters of medium. ten mice received each concentration of bacteria and 10 sham-inoculated mice acted as controls. five mice from each of the groups were killed 6 weeks after inoculation and the remaining five mice at 12 weeks. right hemimandibles were defleshed, stained and bone loss was measured using an image analyser. all the organisms tested were associated with bone loss. animals that had received pept. anaerobius and pept. magnus had up to 18% more bone loss than  those sham inoculated. in contrast, mice inoculated with a. actinomycetemcomitans had up to 38% more bone loss than the sham-inoculated animals, this amount of loss occurring at the lowest inoculation of 1 x 10(5) c.f.u. these data demonstrate a differential ability of micro-organisms to cause periodontal bone loss in mice.
