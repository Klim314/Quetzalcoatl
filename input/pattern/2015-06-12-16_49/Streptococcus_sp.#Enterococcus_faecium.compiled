TI  - Telavancin activity tested against Gram-positive clinical isolates from European, Russian and Israeli hospitals (2011-2013) using a revised broth microdilution testing method: redefining the baseline activity of telavancin.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To reassess the activity of telavancin when tested against Gram-positive clinical pathogens recovered from hospitalized patients in European and adjacent regions using a revised broth microdilution method. METHODS: 11 601 consecutive, non-duplicate isolates originating from 36 institutions among 18 countries recovered between 2011 and 2013 were tested for susceptibility using a revised broth microdilution method for telavancin. Interpretive telavancin breakpoints appropriate for the method were those recently approved by the FDA and EUCAST, as available. RESULTS: Telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) was equally potent against methicillin-susceptible ((MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) Staphylococcus aureus. All Enterococcus faecalis was susceptible to telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mg/l) and inhibited at the susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. </= 0.25 mg/l), except for VanA-phenotype vancomycin-resistant isolates (telavancin MIC, >1 mg/l). Telavancin ( </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l) was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MIC values were obtained for VanA strains. Telavancin (both MIC50 and MIC90, </= 0.015 mg/l) was potent against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, </= 0.015/0.06 mg/l) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50/90, </= 0.015/0.03 mg/l). CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin exhibited potent activity against this contemporary (2011-2013) collection of organisms, inhibiting indicated pathogens at or below the FDA/EUCAST-approved breakpoints for susceptibility. VanA-phenotype enterococci were less susceptible to telavancin, a feature observed using the previous testing method. These results redefine telavancin's activity against isolates from Europe.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species isolated from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multi-drug-resistant Enterococci colonizing the intestinal tract of hospitalized patients are the major source of infection as well as nosocomial spread. Despite worldwide increasing rate of multidrug resistant Enterococci colonization and infection among hospitalized patients, there is scarcity of data from resource limited setting. The present study aimed at determining the antimicrobial resistance profile of Enterococcus species from intestinal tracts of hospitalized patients in Jimma, Ethiopia. METHODS: The study was conducted among hospitalized patients at Jimma University Specialized Hospital, from January to July 2013. Fecal samples were collected and processed for bacterial isolation and susceptibility testing to antimicrobial agents. Stool samples were inoculated onto enterococcus selective media (Bile Esculin azide agar plate) with and without 6 microg/ml of vancomycin. The isolates were identified to genus and species level by cultural characteristics, Gram's stain, catalase test, growth in 6.5% NaCl broth, growth at 45 degrees C, motility test and by using API 20 Streptococcus system. Sensitivity testing was done using Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin were determined using E-test strips. RESULT: Overall, Enterococci were isolated from 114 (76%) of the study subjects. The isolates were Enterococcus faecium (35.1%) followed by Enterococcus faecalis (29.8%), Enterococcus gallinarum (17.5%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (8.8%) and Enterococcus durans (8.8%). Among 114 tested Enterococci isolates, 41 (36%) were resistant to ampicillin, 62 (54.4%) to streptomycin and 39 (34.2%) to gentamycin. Other alternative antibiotics to treat mixed nosocomial infection caused by Enterococci also showed high rate of resistance in vitro: ciprofloxacin (50% of resistance), norfloxacin (49.1%), erythromycin (63.2%), tetracycline (64.9%), chloramphenicol (34.2%), and nitrofrantoin (32.4%). Multiple drug resistance was observed among 89.5% of E. faecium and E. faecalis. Vancomycin resistant Enterococci were observed in 5% of E. faecium isolates. CONCLUSION: This study reveals high rate of fecal colonization by multidrug-resistant Enterococci and prevalence of vancomycin resistance strains. Thus periodic surveillance of antibacterial susceptibilities is recommended to detect emerging resistance and to prevent the spread of antibacterial-resistant strains.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents: Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004-2013.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global  antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study which has been ongoing since 2004. This report examines the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against clinically important pathogens collected globally between 2004 and 2013. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The Cochran Armitage Trend Test was used to identify statistically significant changes in susceptibility between 2004 and 2013. RESULTS: Among the Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility was highest to the carbapenems [imipenem 97.1% (24,655/25,381), meropenem 97.0% (90,714/93,518)], tigecycline (97.0%, 115,361/118,899) and amikacin (96.9%, 115,200/118,899). Against Acinetobacter baumannii the highest rates of susceptibility were for minocycline (84.5%, 14,178/16,778) and imipenem (80.0%, 3,037/3,795). The MIC90 for tigecycline was 2 mg/L. 40% (6,743/16,778) of A. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant. Enterococci were highly susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid (>99%); vancomycin resistance was observed among 2% of Enterococcus faecalis (325/14,615) and 35% of Enterococcus faecium (2,136/6,167) globally. 40% (14,647/36,448) of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant while 15% (2,152/14,562) of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant. Against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline was >/=99.9%. Globally, 81% (331/410) of statistically significant susceptibility changes during the study period were decreases in susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Amikacin, the carbapenems, and tigecycline were active against most gram-negative pathogens while linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin retained activity against most gram-positive pathogens collected in TEST during 2004-2013.
TI  - Evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Hampton Roads, Virginia.
AB  - We studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated with Eastern Virginia Medical School. The data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram- positive and E. coli the most common Gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. Overall 53% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. There was a broad scatter of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and MIC of 4 mug/mL was reported in 2012. Penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of Enterococcus faecium and 2% of Enterococcus faecalis respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant Gram negative organism in the data compiled. Among the Escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( SXT) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. We found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. Based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.
TI  - Utilization of blood cultures in Danish hospitals: a population-based descriptive analysis.
AB  - This national population-based study was conducted as part of the development of  a national automated surveillance system for hospital-acquired bacteraemia and ascertains the utilization of blood cultures (BCs). A primary objective was to understand how local differences may affect interpretation of nationwide surveillance for bacteraemia. From the Danish Microbiology Database, we retrieved all BCs taken between 2010 and 2013 and linked these to admission data from the National Patient Registry. In total, 4 587 295 admissions were registered, and in 11%, at least one BC was taken. Almost 50% of BCs were taken at admission. The chance of having a BC taken declined over the next days but increased after 4 days of admission. Data linkage identified 876 290 days on which at least one BC was taken; 6.4% yielded positive results. Ten species, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca, accounted for 74.7% of agents for this purpose classified as pathogenic. An increase in BCs and positive BCs was observed over time, particularly among older patients. BCs showed a seasonal pattern overall and for S. pneumoniae particularly. A predominance of male patients was seen for bacteraemias due to S. aureus, E. faecium and K. pneumoniae. Minor differences in BCs and positive BCs between departments of clinical microbiology underpin the rationale of a future automated surveillance for bacteraemia. The study also provides important knowledge for interpretation of surveillance of invasive infections more generally.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid as assessed through the 2013 LEADER surveillance program.
AB  - The 2013 LEADER surveillance program monitored the in vitro activity of linezolid and comparator agents against Gram-positive bacteria at 60 medical centers in the United States. A total of 7183 pathogens were contributed from 6 predetermined pathogen groups. The groups were Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. The MIC90 value for each of the 6 pathogen groups was 1 mug/mL. Susceptibility of "all organisms" to linezolid was 99.83%. Only 12 isolates (2 S. aureus, 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 1 Streptococcus sanguinis, 5 Enterococcus faecium, and 1 Enterococcus faecalis) were nonsusceptible to linezolid (0.17%). Three of these (2 S. aureus and 1 E. faecium) harbored the cfr resistance mechanism. The findings indicate that linezolid activity remains stable, although there are examples of clonal dissemination within several monitored institutions.
TI  - Endophytic fungi: a reservoir of antibacterials.
AB  - Multidrug drug resistant bacteria are becoming increasingly problematic particularly in the under developed countries of the world. The most important microorganisms that have seen a geometric rise in numbers are Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium, Penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumonia and multiple drug resistant tubercule bacteria to name a just few. New drug scaffolds are essential to tackle this every increasing problem. These scaffolds can be sourced from nature itself. Endophytic fungi are an important reservoir of therapeutically active compounds. This review attempts to present some data relevant to the problem. New, very specific and effective antibiotics are needed but also at an affordable price! A Herculean task for researchers all over the world! In the Asian subcontinent indigenous therapeutics that has been practiced over the centuries such as Ayurveda have been effective as "handed down data" in family generations. May need a second, third and more "in-depth investigations?"
TI  - Update of the telavancin activity in vitro tested against a worldwide collection  of Gram-positive clinical isolates (2013), when applying the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - A revised broth microdilution susceptibility testing method for telavancin was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Telavancin activity was assessed against Gram-positive pathogens collected worldwide (2013) using the revised method. A total of 12,346 isolates from 90 sites were included as part of the Telavancin International Surveillance Program for the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/mL, respectively, against staphylococci, regardless of methicillin susceptibility, and inhibited all Staphylococcus aureus at </=0.12 mug/mL (revised FDA breakpoint). Telavancin was 8-fold more active than daptomycin (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) and 16- to 32-fold more active than vancomycin (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) and linezolid (MIC50/90, 1/1 mug/mL) against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. All 692 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis were inhibited by telavancin (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/mL) at </=0.25 mug/mL (FDA breakpoint), except for 1 strain (MIC, 0.5 mug/mL). All Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis with telavancin MIC values of >/=0.5 and >/=1 mug/mL, respectively, had a VanA phenotype. A comparison data analysis based on the MIC90 demonstrated that telavancin was at least 8-fold more potent than comparators against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci. Streptococci showed telavancin MIC50 values of </=0.015 mug/mL, except for Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50, 0.03 mug/mL). These in vitro results obtained by the recently approved susceptibility testing method establish a new benchmark of telavancin activity worldwide.
TI  - Antibiotic Resistance Prevalence in Routine Bloodstream Isolates from Children's  Hospitals Varies Substantially from Adult Surveillance Data in Europe.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is central for defining appropriate strategies to deal with changing AMR levels. It is unclear whether childhood AMR patterns differ from those detected in isolates from adult patients. METHODS: Resistance percentages of nonduplicate Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa bloodstream isolates from children less than 18 years of age reported to the Antibiotic Resistance and Prescribing in European Children (ARPEC) project were compared with all-age resistance percentages reported by the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) for the same pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, period and countries. In addition, resistance percentages were compared between ARPEC isolates from children less than 1 year of age and children greater than or equal to1 year of age. RESULTS: Resistance percentages for many important pathogen-antibiotic class combinations were different for ARPEC isolates compared with EARS-Net. E. coli and K. pneumoniae fluoroquinolone resistance percentages were substantially lower in ARPEC (13.4% and 17.9%) than in EARS-Net (23.0% and 30.7%), whereas the reverse was true for all pathogen-antibiotic class combinations in P. aeruginosa (for example, 27.3% aminoglycoside resistance in ARPEC, 19.3% in EARS-Net, 32.8% carbapenem resistance in ARPEC and 20.5% in EARS-Net), and for S. pneumoniae and macrolide resistance. For many Gram-negative pathogen-antibiotic class combinations, isolates from children greater than or equal to 1 year of age showed higher resistance percentages than isolates from children less than 1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Age-stratified presentation of resistance percentage estimates by surveillance programs will allow identification of important variations in resistance patterns between different patient groups for targeted intervention.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese.
AB  - The water buffalo mozzarella cheese is a typical Italian cheese which has been introduced in the thriving Brazilian market in the last 10 y, with good acceptance by its consumers. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) play an important role in the technological and sensory quality of mozzarella cheese. In this study, the aim was to evaluate the diversity of the autochthones viable LAB isolated from water buffalo mozzarella cheese under storage. Samples were collected in 3 independent trials in a dairy industry located in the southeast region of Brazil, on the 28th day of storage, at 4 masculineC. The LAB were characterized by Gram staining, catalase test, capacity to assimilate citrate, and production of CO2 from glucose. The diversity of LAB was evaluated by RAPD-PCR (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction), 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and by Vitek 2 system. Twenty LAB strains were isolated and clustered into 12 different clusters, and identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus helveticus. Enterococcus species were dominant and citrate-positive. Only the strains of L. mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides and L. fermentum produced CO2 from glucose and were citrate-positive, while L. casei was only citrate positive. This is the first report which elucidates the LAB diversity involved in Brazilian water buffalo mozzarella cheese. Furthermore, the results show that despite the absence of natural whey cultures as starters in production, the LAB species identified are the ones typically found in mozzarella cheese.
TI  - Pyrosequencing vs. culture-dependent approaches to analyze lactic acid bacteria associated to chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented beverage from Northwestern Argentina.
AB  - The diversity of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) associated with chicha, a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from Northwestern Argentina, was analyzed using culture-dependent and culture-independent approaches. Samples corresponding to 10 production steps were obtained from two local producers at Maimara (chicha M) and Tumbaya (chicha T). Whereas by culture-dependent approach a few number of species (Lactobacillus plantarum and Weissella viridescens in chicha M, and Enterococcus faecium and Leuconostoc mesenteroides in chicha T) were identified, a higher quantitative distribution of taxa was found in both beverages by pyrosequencing. The relative abundance of OTUs was higher in chicha M than in chicha T; six LAB genera were common for chicha M and T: Enterococcus, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella, Leuconostoc and Lactobacillus while Pediococcus only was detected in chicha M. Among the 46 identified LAB species, those of Lactobacillus were dominant in both chicha samples, exhibiting the highest diversity, whereas Enterococcus and Leuconostoc were recorded as the second dominant genera in chicha T and M, respectively. Identification at species level showed the predominance of Lb. plantarum, Lactobacillus rossiae, Leuconostoc lactis and W. viridescens in chicha M while Enterococcus hirae, E. faecium, Lc. mesenteroides and Weissella confusa predominated in chicha T samples. In parallel, when presumptive LAB isolates (chicha M: 146; chicha T: 246) recovered from the same samples were identified by ISR-PCR and RAPD-PCR profiles, species-specific PCR and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, most of them were assigned to the Leuconostoc genus (Lc. mesenteroides and Lc. lactis) in chicha M, Lactobacillus, Weissella and Enterococcus being also present. In contrast, chicha T exhibited the presence of Enterococcus and Leuconostoc, E. faecium being the most representative species. Massive sequencing approach was applied for the first time to study the diversity and evolution of microbial communities during chicha manufacture. Although differences in the LAB species profile between the two geographically different chicha productions were observed by culturing, a larger number for predominant LAB species as well as other minorities were revealed by pyrosequencing. The fine molecular inventory achieved by pyrosequencing provided more precise information on LAB population composition than culture-dependent analysis processes.
TI  - Misidentification of Streptococcus uberis as a human pathogen: a case report and  literature review.
AB  - Streptococcus uberis is an environmental bacterium responsible for bovine mastitis. It is occasionally described as a human pathogen, though in most cases the identification was based on biochemical phenotyping techniques. This report shows that the biochemical phenotyping may incorrectly identify Enterococcus faecium as S. uberis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2010 and March 2011].
AB  - Bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from April 2010 to March 2011 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 631 strains including 25 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 170 (81.7%) of 208 patients with surgical infections. Four hundred and twenty two strains were isolated from primary infections, and 184 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. Among aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Enterococcus spp. such as Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus avium was highest, followed by Streptococcus spp. such as Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus spp. such as Staphylococcus aureus, in this order, from primary infections, while Enterococcus spp. such as E. faecalis and E. faecium was highest, followed by Staphylococcus spp. such as S. aureus from surgical site infection. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in this order, and from surgical site infection, E. coli and R aeruginosa were most predominantly isolated, followed by E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rates of Parvimonas micra, Eggerthella lenta, Streptococcus constellatus, Gemella morbillorum, and Collinsella aerofaciens were the highest from primary infections, and the isolation rate from surgical site infection was generally low. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bilophila wadsworthia was the highest from primary infections, followed by, Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides ovatus, and from surgical site infection, B. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by Bacteroides thetaiotaomnicron, in this order. In this series, vancomycin-resistant MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. and multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa were not observed.
TI  - Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene as novel antibacterial agents.
AB  - Current antibacterial chemotherapeutics are facing an alarming increase in bacterial resistance pressuring the search for novel agents that would expand the available therapeutic arsenal against resistant bacterial pathogens. In line with these efforts, a series of 9 amidine derivatives of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene were synthesized and, together with 18 previously synthesized analogs, evaluated for their relative DNA binding affinity, in vitro antibacterial activities and preliminary in vitro safety profile. Encouraging antibacterial activity of several subclasses of tested amidine derivatives against Gram-positive (including resistant MRSA, MRSE, VRE strains) and Gram-negative bacterial strains was observed. The bis-phenyl derivatives were the most antibacterially active, while compound 19 from bis-benzimidazole class exhibited the widest spectrum of activity (with MIC of 4, 2, 0.5 and </=0.25 mug/ml against laboratory strains of Staphyloccocus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, respectively and 4-32 mug/ml against clinical isolates of sensitive and resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium) and also demonstrated the strongest DNA binding affinity (DeltaTm of 15.4 degrees C). Asymmetrically designed compounds and carboxamide-amidines were, in general, less active. Molecular docking indicated that the shape of the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene derivatives and their ability to form multiple electrostatic and hydrogen bonds with DNA, corresponds to the binding modes of other minor-groove binders. Herein reported results encourage further investigation of this class of compounds as novel antibacterial DNA binding agents.
TI  - [Recurrent meningitis due to anatomical defects: The bacteria indicates its origin].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recurrent meningitis is a rare disease. Anatomical abnormalities and immunodeficiency states are predisposing factors. Four cases, in which immunodeficiency was excluded, are presented. The causal microorganism led to the detection of the anatomical defect responsible for the recurrences. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective review of 4 cases with clinical diagnosis of recurrent bacterial meningitis. RESULTS: Case 1: a thirty month-old boy with unilateral hearing loss, diagnosed with Mondini abnormality by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) after 2 episodes of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. Surgical repair after third recurrence. Case 2: fourteen year-old girl diagnosed by MRI with cribriform plate defect after 3 episodes of meningitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ventriculoperitoneal shunt was placed. Case 3: girl with meningitis due to Staphylococcus aureus at 2 and 7 months. MRI shows occipital dermal sinus requiring excision. Complication with cerebellar abscesses because of a coexisting dermoid cyst. Case 4: child with meningitis due to Streptococcus bovis at 9 days and Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli at 7 months, with positive cultures to Citrobacter freundii and E. faecium later on. Spinal MRI led to the diagnosis of Currarino syndrome with CSF fistula, which was surgically repaired. The 4 patients had undergone image studies reported as normal during the first episodes. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with recurrent meningitis the possibility of an anatomical defect should be considered. The isolated microorganism should help to locate it. It is essential to know the normal flora of the different anatomical sites. The definitive treatment is usually surgical.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. Ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of STEC and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of STEC into the food chain. The initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. However, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-O157 STEC strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. The probiotic mixture contained Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. The numbers of non-O157 STEC in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. It was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-O157 STEC in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.
TI  - Bacteriocin protein BacL1 of Enterococcus faecalis targets cell division loci and specifically recognizes L-Ala2-cross-bridged peptidoglycan.
AB  - Bacteriocin 41 (Bac41) is produced from clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and consists of two extracellular proteins, BacL1 and BacA. We previously reported that BacL1 protein (595 amino acids, 64.5 kDa) is a bacteriolytic peptidoglycan D-isoglutamyl-L-lysine endopeptidase that induces cell lysis of E. faecalis when an accessory factor, BacA, is copresent. However, the target of BacL1 remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the targeting specificity of BacL1. Fluorescence microscopy analysis using fluorescent dye-conjugated recombinant protein demonstrated that BacL1 specifically localized at the cell division-associated site, including the equatorial ring, division septum, and nascent cell wall, on the cell surface of target E. faecalis cells. This specific targeting was dependent on the triple repeat of the SH3 domain located in the region from amino acid 329 to 590 of BacL1. Repression of cell growth due to the stationary state of the growth phase or to treatment with bacteriostatic antibiotics rescued bacteria from the bacteriolytic activity of BacL1 and BacA. The static growth state also abolished the binding and targeting of BacL1 to the cell division-associated site. Furthermore, the targeting of BacL1 was detectable among Gram-positive bacteria with an L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridging peptidoglycan, including E. faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Streptococcus pneumoniae, but not among bacteria with alternate peptidoglycan structures, such as Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Listeria monocytogenes. These data suggest that BacL1 specifically targets the L-Ala-L-Ala-cross-bridged peptidoglycan and potentially lyses the E. faecalis cells during cell division.
TI  - Activity of oritavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented skin and soft-tissue infections in European and US hospitals (2010-13).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess oritavancin activity in vitro against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens causing skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTIs) in European and US hospitals. METHODS: 13 262 consecutive and unique isolates deemed to be responsible for SSTIs were included. Isolates originated from 36 and 27 institutions in Europe (Israel included) and the USA, respectively, between 2010 and 2013. RESULTS: Oritavancin (98.8% susceptible) showed modal MIC, MIC50 and MIC90 results of 0.03, 0.03 and 0.06 mg/L, respectively, for Staphylococcus aureus. CoNS from the USA (MIC50, 0.015 mg/L) demonstrated an MIC50 value of oritavancin slightly lower than those from Europe (MIC50, 0.03 mg/L). Overall, vancomycin-resistant (VanA-phenotype) Enterococcus faecalis had oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.25/0.5 mg/L) that were 16-fold higher than those obtained for vancomycin-susceptible isolates (MIC50/90, 0.015/0.03 mg/L; 99.2%-99.8% susceptible); nevertheless, oritavancin inhibited all VanA E. faecalis at </=0.5 mg/L. Equivalent oritavancin MICs (MIC50/90, 0.004/0.008 mg/L) were noted for all VanB and vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, while higher MICs (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L) were obtained for VanA strains. Oritavancin had low MICs against the overall populations of Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.12 mg/L; 98.4%-98.6% susceptible), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mg/L; 97.9%-98.0% susceptible) and the Streptococcus anginosus group (MIC50/90, 0.008/0.015 mg/L; 100.0% susceptible), with slightly higher MICs for Streptococcus dysgalactiae (MIC50/90, 0.06/0.25 mg/L; >/=98.3% susceptible). CONCLUSIONS: Oritavancin had potent activity in vitro against this contemporary collection of European and US isolates causing SSTIs. These results describe oritavancin activity against Gram-positive pathogens collected shortly prior to its regulatory approval in the USA.
TI  - Baseline activity of telavancin against Gram-positive clinical isolates responsible for documented infections in U.S. hospitals (2011-2012) as determined by the revised susceptibility testing method.
AB  - Telavancin had MIC50 and MIC90 values of 0.03 and 0.06 mug/ml (100.0% susceptible), respectively, against methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Telavancin was active against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 100% susceptible) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), while higher MIC values were obtained against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml) and E. faecalis (MIC50/90, >2/>2 mug/ml). Streptococci showed telavancin modal MIC results of </= 0.015 mug/ml, except against Streptococcus agalactiae (i.e., 0.03 mug/ml). This study reestablishes the telavancin spectrum of activity against isolates recovered from the United States (2011-2012) using the revised broth microdilution method.
TI  - In vitro fermentation of lactulose by human gut bacteria.
AB  - Lactulose has been known as a prebiotic that can selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Recent studies have indicated that Streptococcus mutans, Clostridium perfringens, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii are also able to utilize lactulose. However, the previous studies mainly focused on the utilization of lactulose by individual strains, and few studies were designed to identify the species that could utilize lactulose among gut microbiota. This study aimed to identify lactulose-metabolizing bacteria in the human gut, using in silico and traditional culture methods. The prediction results suggested that genes for the transporters and glycosidases of lactulose are well distributed in the genomes of 222 of 453 strains of gastrointestinal-tract bacteria. The screening assays identified 35 species with the ability to utilize lactulose, of which Cronobacter sakazakii, Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas putida were reported for the first time to be capable of utilizing lactulose. In addition, significant correlations between lactulose and galactooligosaccharide metabolism were found. Thus, more attention should be paid to bacteria besides bifidobacteria and lactobacilli to further investigate the relationship between functional oligosaccharides and gut bacteria.
TI  - Novel imidazoline antimicrobial scaffold that inhibits DNA replication with activity against mycobacteria and drug resistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Bacterial antimicrobial resistance is an escalating public health threat, yet the current antimicrobial pipeline remains alarmingly depleted, making the development of new antimicrobials an urgent need. Here, we identify a novel, potent, imidazoline antimicrobial compound, SKI-356313, with bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Gram-positive cocci, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). SKI-356313 is active in murine models of Streptococcus pneumoniae and MRSA infection and is potently bactericidal for both replicating and nonreplicating M. tuberculosis. Using a combination of genetics, whole genome sequencing, and a novel target ID approach using real time imaging of core macromolecular biosynthesis, we show that SKI-356313 inhibits DNA replication and displaces the replisome from the bacterial nucleoid. These results identify a new antimicrobial scaffold with a novel mechanism of action and potential therapeutic utility against nonreplicating M. tuberculosis and antibiotic resistant Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Construction of a chimeric lysin Ply187N-V12C with extended lytic activity against staphylococci and streptococci.
AB  - Developing chimeric lysins with a wide lytic spectrum would be important for treating some infections caused by multiple pathogenic bacteria. In the present work, a novel chimeric lysin (Ply187N-V12C) was constructed by fusing the catalytic domain (Ply187N) of the bacteriophage lysin Ply187 with the cell binding domain (146-314aa, V12C) of the lysin PlyV12. The results showed that the chimeric lysin Ply187N-V12C had not only lytic activity similar to Ply187N against staphylococcal strains but also extended its lytic activity to streptococci and enterococci, such as Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, which Ply187N could not lyse. Our work demonstrated that generating novel chimeric lysins with an extended lytic spectrum was feasible through fusing a catalytic domain with a cell-binding domain from lysins with lytic spectra across multiple genera.
TI  - [Identification of staphylococci directly from positive blood culture bottles by  MALDI-TOF MS system].
AB  - Bloodstream infections are substantial causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Staphylococcus species are the most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood cultures in clinical microbiology laboratories. MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time- of- Flight Mass Spectrometry) system allows the identification of microorganisms directly from positive blood culture bottles. The aim of this study was to evaluate the MALDI-TOF MS system for the identification of staphylococci directly from the positive blood culture bottles which revealed the presence of gram-positive cocci by staining. A total of 96 positive blood culture bottles that yielded gram-positive cocci by Gram stain were evaluated. These blood cultures were obtained from 69 patients between December 2013-February 2014. Conventional methods and BD Phoenix automated bacterial identification system (Becton Dickinson, USA) were used for routine identification. The strains were also identified by real-time Taqman PCR (qPCR) which was considered as the reference method. In MALDI-TOF MS method, MALDI Sepsityper Kit was used for the bacterial identification and all measurements were carried out by using Microflex LT instrument and FlexControl 3.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, USA). Of 96 culture bottles positive for gram-positive cocci, 90 were correctly identified as staphylococci at genus level with all the three study methods (qPCR, BD Phoenix, Bruker MALDI-TOF MS). The other six samples were identified as Enterococcus faecium (n= 4) and Streptococcus pyogenes (n= 2) by both Phoenix and the MALDI-TOF systems. Of the 90 samples, 87 were identified at the species level (15 S.aureus, 33 S.epidermidis, 29 S.hominis, 10 S.haemolyticus) and three at the genus level by the reference qPCR method. When comparing the results obtained by qPCR and Bruker MALDI-TOF MS, incompatibility was detected for three isolates. Those isolates were identified as S.hominis by qPCR, however two of them were identified as S.haemolyticus and one as S.epidermidis by MALDI-TOF MS. Compared with real-time Taqman PCR it was detected that Bruker MALDI TOF MS was identified 100% of S.aureus to the genus and species level and 100% and 96.6% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) to the genus and species level, respectively. In conclusion, it was thought that Bruker MALDI TOF MS system may allow rapid and reliable identification of S.aureus and CNS directly from positive blood culture bottles compared with the routine methods used in the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Increase in the Prevalence of Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter Isolates and Ampicillin-Resistant Non-Typhoidal Salmonella Species in Korea: A KONSAR Study Conducted in 2011.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial surveillance is important for providing an up-to-date understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance and for creating a forum for rational drug development. In this study, we analyzed antimicrobial test data generated in 2011 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program (KONSAR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data on the results of susceptibility tests conducted in 32 hospitals and two commercial laboratories were analyzed. Data on isolates from patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) and those admitted to other wards were compared. Intermediate susceptibility was not analyzed and duplicate isolates were excluded. RESULTS: Escherichia coli was the most prevalent organism identified in both the hospital and commercial laboratories. Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin G-non-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium remained as prevalent as they were in 2009. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VR-EFM) slightly decreased from 29% in 2009 to 23% in 2011. Resistance rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefoxitin, fluoroquinolone, and amikacin were 24%, 14%, 27%, and 8%, respectively. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to fluoroquinolone, ceftazidime, imipenem, and amikacin were 33%, 20%, 22%, and 16%, respectively, whereas those of Acinetobacter spp. resistance were 71%, 66%, 64, and 51%, respectively. The prevalence of oxyimino-cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa, MRSA, and VR-EFM among ICU isolates was higher than those among non-ICU isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae, imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, and VR-EFM were more prevalent among isolates from commercial laboratories than those from hospitals. Resistance rates of K. pneumoniae to ceftazidime and amikacin decreased from 32% and 24% in 2005 to 24% and 8% in 2011, respectively. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to amikacin decreased from 22% in 2005 to 16% in 2011. The proportion of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased from 16% in 2005 to 64% in 2011. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of MRSA, penicillin G-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae, and ampicillin-resistant E. faecium among clinical isolates tested in laboratories remained high. Multidrug resistance was more prevalent among isolates from ICUs. The prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant and amikacin-resistant K. pneumoniae and amikacin-resistant P. aeruginosa decreased after 2005, while the prevalence of imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased.
TI  - Revised reference broth microdilution method for testing telavancin: effect on MIC results and correlation with other testing methodologies.
AB  - The reference broth microdilution (BMD) antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for telavancin was revised to include dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a solvent and diluent for frozen-form panel preparation, following the CLSI recommendations for water-insoluble agents. Polysorbate 80 (P-80) was also added to the test medium to minimize proven drug losses associated with binding to plastic surfaces. Four hundred sixty-two Gram-positive isolates, including a challenge set of organisms with reduced susceptibilities to comparator agents, were selected and tested using the revised method for telavancin, and the MIC results were compared with those tested by the previously established method and several Sensititre dry-form BMD panel formulations. The revised method provided MIC results 2- to 8-fold lower than the previous method when tested against staphylococci and enterococci, resulting in MIC50 values of 0.03 to 0.06 mug/ml for staphylococci and 0.03 and 0.12 mug/ml for Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis, respectively. Less-significant MIC decreases (1 to 2 log2 dilution steps) were observed when testing streptococci in broth supplemented with blood, which showed similar MIC50 values for both methods. However, Streptococcus pneumoniae had MIC50 results of 0.008 and 0.03 mug/ml when tested by the revised and previous methods, respectively. Highest essential agreement rates (>/=94.0%) were noted for one candidate dry-form panel formulation compared to the revised test. The revised BMD method provides lower MIC results for telavancin, especially when tested against staphylococci and enterococci. This is secondary to the use of DMSO for panel production and the presence of P-80, which ensure the proper telavancin testing concentration and result in a more accurate MIC determination. Moreover, earlier studies where the previous method was applied underestimated the in vitro drug potency.
TI  - Microbial diversity in persistent root canal infections investigated by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of the present study was to investigate the composition of  the root canal microbiota in endodontic failures in order to identify and quantify these microorganisms. METHODS: Microbiological samples were taken from 36 root canals with persistent endodontic infection. The presence, levels, and proportions of 79 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to investigate the relations between bacterial counts and clinical conditions (P </= .05). RESULTS: Enterococcus faecium (36%), Streptococcus epidermidis (36%), Eubacterium saburreum (28%), Parvimonas micra (28%), Streptococcus sanguis (28%), Capnocytophaga sputigena (28%), Leptotrichia buccalis (28%), Enterococcus faecalis (28%), and Staphylococcus warneri (28%) were the most prevalent species; and there was a low prevalence of Treponema socranskii (3%), Fusobacterium periodonticum (3%), Capnocytophaga gingivalis (3%), and Spiroplasma ixodetis (3%). The highest mean levels were found for the following species: E. faecium, Dialister pneumosintes, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Helicobacter pylori. There was a statistically significant difference between the levels of gram-negative species and gram-positive species (13.5 x 10(5) vs 6.5 x 10(5), respectively). A positive correlation was found between the area of the periapical lesion and the levels of gram-negative and rod species (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The microbiota from teeth with persistent apical periodontitis presents a mixed and complex profile, hosting E. faecium and S. epidermidis as the most highly prevalent species. No correlation was found between any of the species tested and clinical findings; however, periapical lesions with the largest areas presented higher counts of gram-negative and rod species.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - Ceftobiprole activity against over 60,000 clinical bacterial pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel from 2005 to 2010.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is a newly approved drug in Europe for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) (excluding patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia but including ventilated HAP patients) and community-acquired pneumonia in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole against prevalent Gram-positive and -negative pathogens isolated in Europe, Turkey, and Israel during 2005 through 2010. A total of 60,084 consecutive, nonduplicate isolates from a wide variety of infections were collected from 33 medical centers. Species identification was confirmed, and all isolates were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole had high activity against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (100.0% susceptible), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (99.3% susceptible), with MIC90 values of 0.25, 0.12, </= 0.06, and 0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Ceftobiprole was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (98.3% susceptible) and methicillin-resistant CoNS, having a MIC90 of 2 mug/ml. Ceftobiprole was active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50/90, 0.5/4 mug/ml) but not against most Enterococcus faecium isolates. Ceftobiprole was very potent against the majority of Enterobacteriaceae (87.3% susceptible), with >80% inhibited at </= 0.12 mug/ml. The potency of ceftobiprole against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC50/90, 2/>8 mug/ml; 64.6% at MIC values of </= 4 mug/ml) was similar to that of ceftazidime (MIC50/90, 2/>16 mug/ml; 75.4% susceptible), but limited activity was observed against Acinetobacter spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. High activity was also observed against all Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, </= 0.06 mug/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, </= 0.06/0.25 mug/ml) isolates. Ceftobiprole demonstrated a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against this very large longitudinal sample of contemporary pathogens.
TI  - Microbiological spectrum and antibiotic sensitivity in endophthalmitis: a 25-year review.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the spectrum and susceptibility pattern of pathogens responsible for culture-positive endophthalmitis referred to a single institution and investigate possible trends in both pathogens and antibiotic sensitivities over the past 25 years. DESIGN: A retrospective, laboratory-based study of consecutive microbiological isolates. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 988 consecutive culture-positive endophthalmitis isolates from 911 eyes. METHODS: All culture-positive endophthalmitis isolates collected from 1987 to 2011 were identified. Susceptibility rates to a variety of antibiotics were calculated. Chi-square test for trend was used to detect changes in spectrum or susceptibility over time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microbial spectrum and susceptibility pattern over time. RESULTS: A total of 988 isolates were identified from 911 eyes. The average patient age was 67 +/- 18 years, and 55% of the patients were female. The most prevalent pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (39.4%), followed by Streptococcus viridans species (12.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (11.1%). Gram-negative organisms and fungi accounted for 10.3% and 4.6% of all isolates, respectively. With the exception of 2 isolates, Enterococcus faecium and Nocardia exalbida, all the other 725 (99.7%) gram-positive bacteria tested were susceptible to vancomycin. Of the 94 gram-negative organisms tested against ceftazidime, 2 were of intermediate sensitivity and 6 were resistant. For 8 antibiotics, increasing microbial resistance over time was observed: cefazolin (P = 0.02), cefotetan (P = 0.006), cephalothin (P<0.0001), clindamycin (P = 0.04), erythromycin (P<0.0001), methicillin/oxacillin (P<0.0001), ampicillin (P = 0.01), and ceftriaxone (P = 0.006). For 3 antibiotics, increasing microbial susceptibility was observed: gentamicin (P<0.0001), tobramycin (P = 0.005), and imipenem (P<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Coagulase-negative staphylococcus remains the most frequently identified cause of endophthalmitis. Vancomycin and ceftazidime seem to be excellent empiric antibiotics for treating endophthalmitis. Although a statistically significant trend toward increasing microbial resistance against a variety of antibiotics, including cephalosporins and methicillin, was observed, a significant trend toward decreasing microbial resistance against aminoglycosides and imipenem also was detected.
TI  - The Physiology and Metabolism of Enterococci
AB  - When possible, the authors have provided open reading frame (ORF) numbers (EF####) from the extensively annotated E. faecalis V583 genome sequence. This information can be easily accessed at enterocyc.broadinstitute.org. If applicable, non-V583 enterococcal sequences with homology to the annotated ORF have been supplied. Additionally, we have included IUBMB nomenclature for most reactions, which are available at http://www.iubmb.org. Enterococci have been isolated and characterized for more than 113 years (MacCallum & Hastings, 1899). During the past century, the classification of this genus has been refined, with the most significant change occurring in 1984 when most members of the Group D streptococci, including Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium, were included in the new genus Enterococcus (Schleifer & Kilpper-Balz, 1984). This genus currently consists of 37 species that occupy a broad range of habitats that include the gastrointestinal microbiota of nearly every animal phylum (See Enterococcus Diversity, Origins in Nature, and Gut Colonization for details). An ability to widely colonize is due, at least in part, to their metabolic versatility and intrinsic resistance to inhospitable conditions. Despite being unable to form spores, enterococci are highly tolerant to desiccation and can persist for months on dried surfaces. Enterococci also tolerate extremes of pH, ionizing radiation, osmotic and oxidative stresses, high heavy metal concentrations, and antibiotics. Enterococci survive or grow over a wide range of temperatures for mesophilic bacteria, from 10 to 45 degrees C. These bacteria, as highly evolved commensals, have been extensively used in the food industry and as probiotics to prevent or ameliorate disease. Finally, rogue strains of enterococci have emerged on the worldwide stage as multidrug-resistant and hospital-acquired pathogens. Enterococci are often simply described as lactic-acid-producing bacteria-a designation that understates their vast metabolic potential. The ubiquitous nature of enterococci in our environment implies this potential. Investigations into the remarkable physiology of these bacteria have fluctuated over the past century. Prior to publication of The Enterococci (Huycke M. M., 2002), and now with this volume, the last formal comprehensive review of enterococcal metabolism was written in 1964 (Deibel, 1964). At that time, substantial efforts by Gunsalus, Sokatch, Gale, Niven, and Deibel, among others, focused on the central metabolism of enterococci. Since then, research into enterococcal physiology has increasingly used the tools of molecular biology and has shifted toward understanding antibiotic resistance, pathogenesis, and genomics. With this new information, there has been increasing recognition that many metabolic genes and pathways vary, even within single species, and led investigators to question the concept of a uniform core metabolism for enterococci. To address this perspective and update the available information on enterococcal physiology, this chapter compiles and reviews the most recent findings from laboratories around the world, and integrates those results with the older literature. As will be evident, the rapid growth of genomic databases continues to offer valuable insights into the physiology of enterococci and greatly facilitates experimental designs into their metabolism.
TI  - Is there a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy?
AB  - Heart valve repair or replacement is a serious problem. Patients can benefit from an open dialogue between both cardiologists and gastroenterologists for the optimal effective patients care. The focused update on infective endocarditis of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association 2008 (ACC/AHA guidelines) and guidelines on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infective endocarditis (new version 2009) of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC guidelines) describe prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (IE) as not recommended for gastroscopy and colonoscopy in the absence of active infection but increasing evidence suggests that the role of IE antibiotic prophylaxis remains a dark side of the cardio-oncology prevention. New evidences concerning infective endocarditis due to Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, and new findings indicate that there is a need for bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy especially in elderly patients and in cancer and immunocompromised patients, to avoid serious consequences.
TI  - Chemical composition and nutrient degradability in elephant grass silage inoculated with Streptococcus bovis isolated from the rumen.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to assess the chemical and bromatological  composition and in situ degradability of elephant grass silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis isolated from cattle rumen. A complete randomized design was used with four treatments and six replications: elephant grass silage, elephant grass silage inoculated with 10(6) CFU/g Streptococcus bovis JB1 strains; elephant grass silage inoculated with 106 CFU/g Streptococcus bovis HC5 strains; elephant grass silage inoculated with 106 CFU/g Enterococcus faecium with six replications each. The pH and ammoniacal nitrogen values were lower (P<0.05) for the silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis JB1 and HC5, respectively. The silage inoculated with Streptococcus bovis had a higher crude protein content (P<0.05) and there were no differences for the fiber contents in the silage. The (a)soluble fraction degradability, especially in the silages inoculated with Streptococcus bovis JB1 and HC5, had higher values, 30.77 and 29.97%, for dry matter and 31.01 and 36.66% for crude protein, respectively. Inoculation with Streptococcus bovis improved the fermentation profile, protein value and rumen degradability of the nutrients.
TI  - Animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Pyrosequencing targeting the 16S rRNA gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) to the genus/species level. Among lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. Twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. All rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (UHT) milk as shown by pH and total titratable acidity (TTA). Presumptive LAB isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analysis, and subjected to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus Enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. The phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. All strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. All isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid pH drop in milk, but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. This work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of LAB, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.
TI  - Characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal Travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (LAB) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in the Vlasic mountain region of central Bosnia and Herzegovina near the town of Travnik over a four season period. These three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. Preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-PCR with a (GTG)5 primer and 16S rDNA sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 LAB isolates obtained from all the examined samples. Fifteen species were identified as follows: Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus garviae, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus italicus, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus mitis. A wide genotypic and phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the Lc. lactis strains. In all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. Forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the total LAB isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates collected from the Middle East and Africa between 2004 and 2011.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. In this study, susceptibility among Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the Middle East and Africa was examined. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. In total, 2967 Gram-positive and 6322 Gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. All Enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of Escherichia coli and 32.9% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. More than 95% of E. coli and Enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against A. baumannii was low at 2mg/L. Tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most Gram-negative pathogens. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most Gram-positive pathogens from the Middle East and Africa.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - A new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - An in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant Hypericum olympicum L. cf. uniflorum. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae; group A streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes); and Clostridium difficile. MICs were 2-8 mg/L for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/L for S. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/L for all species in the presence of blood. Compound 1 was also tested against Gram-negative bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium but was inactive. The MIC for Mycobacterium bovis BCG was 60 mg/L, and compound 1 inhibited the ATP-dependent Mycobacterium tuberculosis MurE ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) = 75 muM]. In a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of S. aureus overexpressing the NorA multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)C-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. Only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with IC50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 muM against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.
TI  - ICESluvan, a 94-kilobase mosaic integrative conjugative element conferring interspecies transfer of VanB-type glycopeptide resistance, a novel bacitracin resistance locus, and a toxin-antitoxin stabilization system.
AB  - A 94-kb integrative conjugative element (ICESluvan) transferable to Enterococcus  faecium and Enterococcus faecalis from an animal isolate of Streptococcus lutetiensis consists of a mosaic of genetic fragments from different Gram-positive bacteria. A variant of ICESluvan was confirmed in S. lutetiensis from a patient. A complete Tn5382/Tn1549 with a vanB2 operon is integrated into a streptococcal ICESde3396-like region harboring a putative bacteriophage exclusion system, a putative agglutinin receptor precursor, and key components of a type IV secretion system. Moreover, ICESluvan encodes a putative MobC family mobilization protein and a relaxase and, thus, in total has all genetic components essential for conjugative transfer. A 9-kb element within Tn5382/Tn1549 encodes, among others, putative proteins similar to the TnpX site-specific recombinase in Faecalibacterium and VanZ in Paenibacillus, which may contribute to the detected low-level teicoplanin resistance. Furthermore, ICESluvan encodes a novel bacitracin resistance locus that is associated with reduced susceptibility to bacitracin when transferred to E. faecium. The expression of a streptococcal pezAT toxin-antitoxin-encoding operon of ICESluvan in S. lutetiensis, E. faecium, and E. faecalis was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, indicating an active toxin-antitoxin system which may contribute to stabilizing ICESluvan within new hosts. Junction PCR and DNA sequencing confirmed that ICESluvan excised to form a circular intermediate in S. lutetiensis, E. faecalis, and E. faecium. Transfer between E. faecalis cells was observed in the presence of helper plasmid pIP964. Sequence analysis of the original S. lutetiensis donor and enterococcal transconjugants showed that ICESluvan integrates in a site-specific manner into the C-terminal end of the chromosomal tRNA methyltransferase gene rumA.
TI  - Update of contemporary antimicrobial resistance rates across China: reference testing results for 12 medical centers (2011).
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (R) surveillance across Asia and especially in China has documented unique patterns and mechanisms. This 2011 study reports results for 2278 isolates from 12 hospitals in China (94-216 strains/site); most from bacteremia (20.4%), pneumonias (29.1%), or skin and skin structure infections (20.9%). Samples were tested by reference broth microdilution methods, interpreted by published susceptibility (S) breakpoints. The most common species were Staphylococcus aureus (343, 45.8% MRSA), Escherichia coli (EC; 288), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PSA; 221), Klebsiella spp. (KSP; 208), acinetobacters (ACB; 178), enterobacters (155), Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN; 154, 46.8% penicillin-S), and enterococci (ENT; 137). Among 849 Gram-positive (GP) cocci, linezolid, tigecycline (TIG), daptomycin, and vancomycin provided best antimicrobial coverage (>/=99.7% S). Resistance patterns of concern were 0.3% VISA, 15.4% teicoplanin non-S coagulase-negative staphylococci, 1.5% vancomycin-R ENT (all Enterococcus faecium), 1.9% levofloxacin-R beta-haemolytic streptococci, and 35.1 and 12.7% ceftriaxone-non-S rates for SPN and viridans group streptococci, respectively. For Gram-negative bacilli, R among Enterobacteriaceae was highest against beta-lactams (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-phenotype strains at 73.6 and 42.8% in EC and KSP, respectively; carbapenem-R was only 2.1-4.3% with KPC and IMP type enzymes detected in KSP). The widest spectrum agents were cefoperazone/sulbactam (79.5-86.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (88.9-92.0%), TIG (98.6-100%), amikacin (AMK; 91.8-93.7%), and meropenem (95.7-97.1% S). PSA was most inhibited by AMK (90.5% S) and colistin (COL; 99.5%), with cefepime (67.9%) best among the tested beta-lactams. Only COL (100% S) and TIG (MIC90, 2 mug/mL) showed significant potencies against ACB. In conclusion, R among pathogens from 12 Chinese hospitals illustrates several agents active against GP pathogens, but more serious R problems were noted among Enterobacteriaceae, PSA, and ACB. Combination treatment for the latter multidrug-R strains appears necessary, guided by local antibiograms and national surveillance results applying reference methods.
TI  - Evaluation of the nanosphere verigene gram-positive blood culture assay with the  VersaTREK blood culture system and assessment of possible impact on selected patients.
AB  - The Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) assay (Nanosphere, Northbrook, IL) is a molecular method for the rapid identification of Gram-positive organisms and resistance markers directly from blood culture bottles. A total of 148 VersaTREK REDOX 1 40-ml aerobic bottles demonstrating Gram-positive bacteria were tested. Results were compared with those from conventional biochemical and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) identifications. We obtained isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (24), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (14), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) (17), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE) (9), other coagulase-negative staphylococci (19), Streptococcus salivarius (5), Streptococcus parasanguinis (2), Streptococcus sanguinis (1), Streptococcus cristatus (1), the Streptococcus bovis group (5), Streptococcus agalactiae (9), the Streptococcus anginosus group (1), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE FCM) (16), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (3), Aerococcus viridans (2), Bacillus (6), Corynebacterium (8), Lactobacillus (2), Micrococcus (2), Neisseria mucosa (1), Escherichia coli (3), Candida tropicalis (1), Propionibacterium (1), and Rothia (1). Overall agreement with the culture results was 95%. A total of 137 of 138 (99%) monomicrobial cultures were concordant. We tested 9 polymicrobial samples and found 33% agreement. A chart review of 31 patients with MRSA, MSSA, or VRE demonstrated that the Nanosphere BC-GP assay might have led to more appropriate antibiotic selection for these patients an average of 42 h earlier. Additionally, contact isolation could have been initiated an average of 37 h earlier for patients with MRSA or VRE. The BC-GP assay may have a positive impact on patient care, health care costs, and antibiotic stewardship.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of propolis special extract GH 2002 against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - The need to discover and develop alternative therapies to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections is timely. The aim of this study was to examine the antimicrobial potential of propolis, as a purified and concentrated special extract GH 2002, against clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-resistent Stapylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and Candida. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimal microbicidial concentrations (MMCs) of propolis against microbial pathogens were evaluated using the broth microdilution method. Propolis extract GH 2002 revealed low MICs in the range of 0.03 to 2 mg/ml against S. pyogenes, S. aureus, E. faecium and Candida. A high bactericidal activity of propolis extract in the range of 0.06 to 1.0 mg/ml was determined for S. pyogenes and S. aureus, however propolis was not bactericidal against E. faecium. Propolis concentrations between 0.6 and 2.4 mg/ml displayed fungicidal activity against different Candida species. Whereas all tested MRSA strains were highly susceptible against propolis, only minor activity was found against VRE strains. Time-kill curves demonstrated a high antimicrobial activity at low MICs already after few hours of incubation against reference strains, clinical antibiotic-susceptible strains, clinical antifungal susceptible strains as well as all tested clinical MRSA strains, but not against VRE strains. In conclusion, clinical drug-sensitive as well as some clinical multidrug-resistant microbial isolates, i.e. MRSA, were susceptible to propolis with different degrees of susceptibility. These results suggest that the special propolis extract GH2002 might be used in the development of alternative products for therapy of microbial infections.
TI  - Rapid detection of Gram-positive organisms by use of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test and the BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN system in a multicenter pediatric evaluation.
AB  - Assays that expedite the reporting of organism identification and antibiotic susceptibility status in positive blood cultures can fast track interventions that improve clinical outcomes. We evaluated the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test (BC-GP) in two pediatric hospitals. Positive BacT/Alert Pediatric FAN blood cultures with Gram-positive organisms were tested using the BC-GP in tandem with routine laboratory procedures. To test organisms underrepresented in the clinical blood culture evaluation, blood culture bottles were spiked with diluted organism suspensions at concentrations of 10 to 100 CFU per milliliter. A total of 249 Gram-positive bacterial isolates were recovered from 242 blood cultures. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus with sensitivities of 100%, 99%, and 100% and specificities of 100%, 100%, and 99.5%, respectively. The BC-GP detected Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis, and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis with sensitivities of 95%, 80%, and 96%, respectively, and 100% specificity. The BC-GP correctly identified 14/15 cases of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium bacteremia and 9 cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae. It misidentified 5/15 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus mitis/Streptococcus oralis and 1/3 blood cultures spiked with Streptococcus anginosus group as S. pneumoniae. The BC-GP detected a case of Streptococcus pyogenes bacteremia but failed to detect 2/3 clinical blood cultures with Streptococcus agalactiae. BC-GP's rapid accurate detection of Staphylococcus spp., E. faecium, and E. faecalis and its ability to ascertain mecA, vanA, and vanB status may expedite clinical decisions pertaining to optimal antibiotic use. False-positive S. pneumoniae results may warrant reporting of only "Streptococcus spp." when this organism is reported by the BC-GP.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the pleuromutilin antibiotic BC-3781 against bacterial  pathogens isolated in the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program in 2010.
AB  - BC-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antibiotic inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. BC-3781 has completed a phase 2 clinical trial in acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI). Its antibacterial spectrum additionally covers the predominant pathogens causing community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). In this study, the antibacterial activity of BC-3781 was evaluated against a contemporary collection of 10,035 bacterial isolates predominately causing ABSSSI and CABP, among other infections, collected within the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program worldwide in 2010. BC-3781 exhibited potent activity against organisms commonly isolated from ABSSSI such as Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.12 mug/ml; 99.8% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC50/90, 0.03/0.03 mug/ml; 99.3% inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml), and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; MIC50/90, 0.06/0.12 mug/ml; 97.8% inhibited at </=1 mug/ml). BC-3781 displayed similar MIC distributions among methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant (MRSA) S. aureus strains. BC-3781 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, with 76.3% of vancomycin-susceptible and 97.0% of vancomycin-resistant isolates being inhibited at BC-3781 concentrations of </=1 mug/ml. Beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci were highly susceptible to BC-3781, with 99.3% and 96.7% of isolates inhibited at </=0.5 mug/ml, respectively. Further, activity of BC-3781 against Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50/90, 1/2 mug/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC50/90, 0.12/0.25 mug/ml) was not negatively influenced by beta-lactamase production or resistance to other antimicrobial classes tested. In all, BC-3781 displayed a very potent antibacterial profile including the most prevalent bacterial pathogens causing ABSSSI and CABP, thus warranting further clinical development of this antibiotic in these and possibly other indications.
TI  - Lysins: the arrival of pathogen-directed anti-infectives.
AB  - Lysins represent a novel class of anti-infectives derived from bacteriophage. Lysins are bacterial cell-wall hydrolytic enzymes that selectively and rapidly kill (>/=3 log c.f.u. in 30 min) specific Gram-positive bacteria providing a targeted therapeutic approach with minimal impact on unrelated commensal flora. The potential for bacterial resistance to lysins is considered low due to targeting of highly conserved peptidoglycan components. Through cutting-edge genetic engineering, lysins can be assembled into large libraries of anti-infective agents tailored to any bacterium of interest including drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens such as meticillin- and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Lysins can eliminate bacteria systemically and topically from mucosal surfaces and biofilms, as evidenced by experimental models of sepsis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, and nasopharyngeal, skin and vaginal decolonization. Furthermore, lysins can act synergistically with antibiotics and, in the process, resensitize bacteria to non-susceptible antibiotics. Clinical trials are being prepared to assess the safety and pharmacokinetic properties of lysins in humans.
TI  - Characterization of thermophilic streptococci isolated from rustic white cheese.
AB  - The thermophilic streptococci are dominant members of the microflora of several types of cheese produced with a natural starter. A total of 205 isolates of thermophilic streptococci were obtained from 70 samples of white cheese which had been collected from producing areas of different regions of Syria during 2009 and 2010. The isolates were cocci gram positive and catalase negative. From these isolates, 120 were identified as Enterococcus spp. including: 72 isolates of E. faecium, 35 isolates of E. fecalis and 13 isolates of E. durans. In addition, 70 isolates were identified as Streptococcus including: 50 isolates of S. thermophilus, and 20 isolates of S. equines. Fifteen isolates of cocci grew at 45 degrees C with spherical morphology, gram positive and catalase negative. The PCR technique could be efficiently used for identifying and typing the thermophilic streptococci.
TI  - Bacterial spectrum and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bloodstream infections in children with febrile neutropenia: experience of single center in southeast of Turkey.
AB  - Empirical antimicrobial therapy is usually started in febrile neutropenic patients without having culture results. The aim of this study was to help determine the policies of empirical antibiotic usage in febrile neutropenic children by detecting the antimicrobial susceptibility profile in this group of patients. In this study 811 blood cultures taken from neutropenic children hospitalized at the Department of Oncology of Gaziantep Children Hospital November 2007 and February 2010 were retrospectively evaluated. Blood cultures were routinely collected in aerobic and anaerobic media and incubated using the BACTEC system. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of the isolates to antimicrobial agents was performed using the Vitek2((R)) system according to the recommendations of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Of 811 isolates analyzed, 128 (56.4%) were gram positive cocci, 43 (18.9%) were gram negative bacilli and fungi accounted for 56 (24.7%). The main isolated Gram-positive bacteria from blood were coagulase-negative staphylococcus (56.7%), followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (14.1%). S. aureus and Streptococcus spp. were all susceptible to linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin. S aureus was still susceptible to few other antimicrobial agents such as tetracycline (82.4%), chloramphenicol (55.6%). Seven E. faecium, 7 E. fecalis and 1 E. hirae was isolated from blood cultures. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 6 out of 15 (40%) Enterococcus spp. isolates. Among gram-negative bacteria E. coli (30.2%) was followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (20.9%) and Proteus spp. (18.6%). Imipenem (89.2%), meropenem (86.6%), chloramphenicol (88.9%), amicasin (82.4%) and fosfomycin (81.3%) showed highest susceptibility in vitro activity against all Gram-negative isolates. To know the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of the pathogens frequently isolated from febrile neutropenic children and to consider this profile before starting an empirical antibiotic therapy would help the clinics which have any role in the treatment of these patients to determine the empirical antibiotic usage policies.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among Gram-positive organisms collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was designed to monitor  global longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to a panel of antimicrobial agents, including tigecycline. In this study, we examine susceptibility among Gram-positive isolates collected from pediatric patients globally between 2004 and 2011. A total of 9,422 Gram-positive isolates were contributed by 1,255 centers, predominantly from Europe and North America. One-third of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were methicillin resistant, peaking in prevalence in 2007. All S. aureus isolates (n = 3,614) were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin; minocycline, imipenem, and meropenem were also highly active (>92% susceptibility). Ampicillin and penicillin susceptibility increased significantly during the study period (P < 0.0001 for both). Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 3,373) were highly susceptible to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (>99%), and levofloxacin and tigecycline (both >96%); imipenem susceptibility was low (32%) in Africa while minocycline susceptibility was low in Asia-Pacific Rim (38%). Penicillin resistance occurred in one-fifth of all S. pneumoniae isolates, with penicillin susceptibility ranging from 14% in Africa to 65% in Europe. Streptococcus agalactiae isolates (n = 1,056) were highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although only 16% were susceptible to minocycline. Enterococcus faecalis isolates (n = 1,112) were highly susceptible (>97%) to ampicillin, linezolid, penicillin, tigecycline, and vancomycin globally, but only 34% were minocycline susceptible; minocycline susceptibility decreased significantly from 2004 to 2011 (P < 0.001). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Enterococcus faecium (n = 267) globally (100% and 98% susceptible, respectively). Tigecycline and linezolid were highly active against Gram-positive pathogens from pediatric patients in TEST 2004 to 2011, with vancomycin and the carbapenems performing well against most pathogens.
TI  - Identification of pathogens in mastitis milk samples with fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  - Traditionally, the bacteriological examination of mastitis milk samples is performed by culture followed by biochemical tests on the cultured bacteria to allow identification of the causative pathogen. Depending on the species involved, this classic identification is time-consuming compared to other techniques such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a culture-independent method that utilizes oligonucleotides (labeled with a fluorophore) that are specific to a string of target DNA/RNA. In the current study, the applicability of FISH was evaluated for the detection of mastitis pathogens directly in milk samples. To remove interfering lipids and proteins from mastitis milk samples prior to FISH, a previously published enzymatic treatment with savinase was evaluated. FISH was performed using oligonucleotides specific for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus uberis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Trueperella (Arcanobacterium) pyogenes. The enzymatic pretreatment and the sensitivity of FISH were evaluated using spiked whole milk samples and mastitis milk samples with bacterial loads of less than 10(3) up to 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/ml. Bacteria were reliably detected in milk samples with bacterial numbers of 10(6) CFU/ml or higher. However, bacteria present in numbers below 10(6) CFU/ml were not detectable in all cases. The ability of FISH to identify mastitis-causing pathogens directly in milk samples, and therefore earlier than classical culture methods, can supplement the classic diagnostic procedures for mastitis milk samples.
TI  - Antibacterial serrulatane diterpenes from the Australian native plant Eremophila  microtheca.
AB  - Chemical investigations of the aerial parts of the Australian plant Eremophila microtheca resulted in the isolation of three serrulatane diterpenoids, 3-acetoxy-7,8-dihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (1), 3,7,8-trihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (2) and 3,19-diacetoxy-8-hydroxyserrulat-14-ene (3) as well as the previously reported compounds verbascoside (4) and jaceosidin (5). Acetylation and methylation of the major serrulatane diterpenoid 2 afforded 3,8-diacetoxy-7-hydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid (6) and 3,7,8-trihydroxyserrulat-14-en-19-oic acid methyl ester (7), respectively. The antibacterial activity of 1-7 was assessed against a panel of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial isolates. All of the serrulatane compounds exhibited moderate activity against Streptococcus pyogenes (ATCC 12344) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 64-128 mug/mL. Serrulatane 1 demonstrated activity against all Gram-positive bacterial strains (MICs 64-128 mug/mL) except for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. This is the first report of natural products from E. microtheca.
TI  - Evaluation of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test for rapid detection of bacteria and resistance determinants.
AB  - Rapid identification of pathogens from blood cultures can decrease lengths of stay and improve patient outcomes. We evaluated the accuracy of the Verigene Gram-positive blood culture (BC-GP) nucleic acid test for investigational use only (Nanosphere, Inc., Northbrook, IL) for the identification of Gram-positive bacteria from blood cultures. The detection of resistance genes (mecA in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and vanA or vanB in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis) by the BC-GP assay also was assessed. A total of 186 positive blood cultures (in BacT/Alert FA bottles) with Gram-positive cocci observed with Gram staining were analyzed using the BC-GP assay. The BC-GP results were compared with the identification and susceptibility profiles obtained with routine methods in the clinical laboratory. Discordant results were arbitrated with additional biochemical, cefoxitin disk, and repeat BC-GP testing. The initial BC-GP organism identification was concordant with routine method results for 94.6% of the blood cultures. Only 40% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae identifications were correct. The detection of the mecA gene for 69 blood cultures with only S. aureus or S. epidermidis was concordant with susceptibility testing results. For 3 of 6 cultures with multiple Staphylococcus spp., mecA detection was reported but was correlated with oxacillin resistance in a species other than S. aureus or S. epidermidis. The detection of vanA agreed with susceptibility testing results for 45 of 46 cultures with E. faecalis or E. faecium. Comparison of the mean times to results for each organism group showed that BC-GP results were available 31 to 42 h earlier than phenotypic identifications and 41 to 50 h earlier than susceptibility results.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of Enterococcus species from meat and fermented meat products isolated by a PCR-based rapid screening method.
AB  - Enterococci are predominantly found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, but species commonly resident on vegetation are known. Their presence in large numbers in foods may indicate a lapse in sanitation and their ability to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic resistance is of concern. Conventional culture methods for identification of enterococci are slow and sometimes give false results because of the biochemical diversity of the organisms in this genus. This work reports the development of a PCR-based assay to detect enterococci at the genus level by targeting a 16S rRNA sequence. Published 16S rRNA sequences were aligned and used to design genus specific primers (EntF and EntR). The primers were able to amplify a 678 bp target region from Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 7080 and 20 other strains of enterococci from 11 different species, but there was no amplification by 32 species from closely related genera (Pediococcus, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus and Listeria) or species of Escherichia coli and Salmonella. The PCR positive samples were plated, screened by a colony patch technique and their identities were confirmed by API 20 Strep panels and sequencing. When dry fermented sausage and ham as well as fresh meat batter for dry cured sausage manufacture were tested for enterococci by the method, 29 Enterococcus strains (15 E. faecalis, 13 E. faecium, and one E. gallinarum) were identified. When susceptibility of these enterococci to 12 antibiotics was tested, the highest incidence of resistance was to clindamycin (89.6%), followed by tetracycline hydrochloride (65.5%), tylosin (62%), erythromycin (45%), streptomycin and neomycin (17%), chloramphenicol (10.3%), penicillin (10.3%), ciprofloxacin (10.3%) and gentamicin (3.4%). None was resistant to the clinically important drugs vancomycin or ampicillin. Most strains (27/29) were resistant to more than one antibiotic while 17 of 29 strains were resistant to three to 8 antibiotics. The molecular method developed was validated for speciation of enterococci and was useful in assessing uncooked processed meat products as a reservoir for multi-drug resistant Enterococcus species.
TI  - An international activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid: ZAAPS Program results for 2011.
AB  - Through a continuing resistance surveillance monitoring program, linezolid was shown to maintain its spectrum and potency against a collection of 8059 clinically relevant Gram-positive strains collected from patients at 79 medical centers in 33 countries and Hong Kong. Linezolid MIC90 values were 2 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant and -susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci, and the MIC90 value was 1 mug/mL for coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), beta-hemolytic streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci. Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing for linezolid demonstrated a 99.83% susceptibility rate for all organisms. All S. aureus were inhibited by </=2 mug/mL. Three (0.3%) of 928 strains of CoNS had a linezolid MIC of 4 mug/mL and contained the cfr resistance gene; 1 also had a mutation in L3. There were 14 linezolid-resistant strains detected from 7 countries (Brazil [5], France [1], Germany [2] Greece [2], Italy [2], Ireland [1], and Spain [1]) representing 5 species (E. faecium, S. capitis, S. epidermidis, S. hominis, S. lugdenensis). A mobile cfr gene was noted in 2 species having elevated linezolid MIC values; one was a S. haemolyticus isolate with a MIC at 4 mug/mL. Resistance rates were as follows for the 6 groups of organisms sampled in the 2011 ZAAPS Program: CoNS, 1.2%; enterococci, 0.39%; among S aureus, S. pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci, and beta-hemolytic streptococci, no resistance was detected. As the activities of commonly used antimicrobials continue to be compromised by evolving resistance mechanisms in Gram-positive pathogens, linezolid-resistant strains remain uncommon and without increasing occurrence.
TI  - Update of dalbavancin spectrum and potency in the USA: report from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2011).
AB  - Dalbavancin (DAL) is an investigational lipoglycopeptide with a prolonged serum half-life allowing once weekly dosing. DAL potency was assessed in the 2011 SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program among 1555 isolates sampled from all 9 US Census regions. Monitored Gram-positive cocci included Staphylococcus aureus (SA; 1,036/50.4% MRSA), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 115), Enterococcus faecalis (25), E. faecium (31), Streptococcus pyogenes (155), Streptococcus agalactiae (153), and viridans group streptococci (VGS; 40). All susceptibility (S) testing used Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution methods and interpretations. DAL (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.06 mug/mL) was 8- and 16-fold more active than daptomycin (DAP) and vancomycin (VAN), respectively against SA, with MSSA and MRSA having the same MIC(90) results. CoNS was slightly more DAL-S (MIC(50), </=0.03mug/mL). The highest staphylococcal DAL MIC was only 0.25 mug/mL. beta-Haemolytic streptococci (betaHS) and VGS had DAL MIC results ranging from </=0.03 to 0.25 mug/mL (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL), and only enterococci showed elevated DAL MIC results. VanA phenotype-resistant E. faecalis or E. faecium had DAL MIC values at >/=1 mug/mL; VanB strains were DAL-S (MIC, </=0.25 mug/mL). All cited DAL quantitative values were consistent with earlier surveillance data (2006-2009), without evidence of MIC creep. In conclusion, year 2011 SENTRY Program data for DAL documents sustained potent activity against SA, CoNS, betaHS, VGS, and VAN-S enterococci, which averaged 4- to 32-fold greater than VAN, DAP, or linezolid.
TI  - Verigene(R) gram-positive blood culture nucleic acid test.
AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and impose considerable costs on healthcare systems. A key predictor of clinical outcomes in patients with BSIs is the early initiation of appropriate targeted antimicrobial therapy. However, with conventional blood culture methods, the gold standard, there is a significant time delay of approximately 2-3 days before clinical results are available, with many patients receiving inappropriate and/or unnecessary antimicrobial therapy in the interim. During the past two decades, the use of in vitro assays that utilize nucleic acid amplification-based detection of pathogen-associated molecular patterns has led to a significant reduction in the time (hours vs. days with blood culture) to detection and identification of several of the causative pathogens of BSIs and, potentially, earlier initiation of targeted antimicrobial therapy. This review focuses on the properties and clinical use of one of these molecular diagnostic assays, the Verigene((R)) Gram-Positive Blood Culture Nucleic Acid Test (BC-GP), which detects many of the potentially pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria associated with BSIs, including Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Listeria spp., and Enterococcus spp., and specific resistance markers (mecA, vanA, and vanB). Based on more than 1,600 samples, there was a high degree of agreement between BC-GP test results and those obtained using conventional blood culture and assay methods, irrespective of whether samples were fresh or frozen, and a high degree of agreement for identification of mecA-mediated meticillin resistance in S. aureus and S. epidermidis organisms and vanA- or vanB-mediated vancomycin resistance in E. faecalis and E. faecium organisms.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin and comparators against selected groups of Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - Telavancin is a novel, rapidly cidal, dual-action glycopeptide. This study examined its in vitro activity against relevant Gram-positive pathogens, comprising 99 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 40 meticillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 79 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 45 Enterococcus faecalis, 60 Enterococcus faecium, 40 beta-haemolytic streptococci and 60 Streptococcus pneumoniae. Except with VanA enterococci, telavancin MICs were tightly clustered and unimodal. Telavancin MICs for staphylococci ranged from </=0.03 mg/L to 0.5mg/L, with no shift for MRSA or MSSA in relation to vancomycin MIC. Nevertheless, and independently of species, CoNS with raised vancomycin MICs had reduced susceptibility to telavancin, however this was much more marked for teicoplanin. Modal telavancin MICs were 0.5mg/L and </=0.03 mg/L for glycopeptide-susceptible E. faecalis and E. faecium, respectively, with no rise for VanB isolates, but ranges rose to 4-16 mg/L and 1-4 mg/L for VanA isolates, respectively. Streptococci were consistently susceptible, with MICs of </=0.06 mg/L. Telavancin MICs by Etest agreed within 1 doubling dilution with those found previously by BSAC agar dilution in 96.2% of cases, although with slight bias towards lower values. In the few cases (13/345) where telavancin MICs by Etest were >/=2 doubling dilutions different from those by agar dilution, the Etest value was always lower; this effect was greater for the other antibiotics tested. Telavancin had excellent activity, except against enterococci with VanA, with no erosion of this activity against MRSA with raised vancomycin MICs. MICs by Etest were nearly always within 1 dilution of those by BSAC agar dilution.
TI  - Enterococcus faecium isolated from Lombo, a Portuguese traditional meat product:  characterisation of antibacterial compounds and factors affecting bacteriocin production.
AB  - Strain ST211CH, identified as a strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from Lombo produced a bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of Enterococcus spp., Listeria spp., Klebsiella spp., Lactobacillus spp., Pseudomonas spp., Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. The mode of action of the bacteriocin named as bacteriocin ST211Ch was bactericidal against Enterococcus faecalis ATCC19443. As determined by Tricine-SDS-PAGE, the approximate molecular mass of the bacteriocin was 8.0 kDa. Loss in antimicrobial activity was recorded after treatment with proteolytic enzymes. Maximum activity of bacteriocin ST211Ch was measured in broth cultures of E. faecium strain ST211Ch after 24 h; thereafter, the activity was reduced. Bacteriocin ST211Ch remained active after exposure to various temperatures and pHs, as well as to Triton X-100, Tween-80, Tween-20, sodium dodecyl sulfate, NaCl, urea and EDTA. Effect of media components on production of bacteriocin ST211Ch was also studied. On the basis of PCR reactions targeting different bacteriocin genes, i.e. enterocins, curvacins and sakacins, no evidences for the presence of these genes in the total DNA of E. faecium strain ST211Ch was obtained. The bacterium most probably produced a bacteriocin different from those mentioned above. Based on the antimicrobial spectrum, stability and mode of action of bacteriocin ST211CH, E. faecium strain ST211Ch might be considered as a potential candidate with beneficial properties for use in biopreservation to control food spoilage bacteria.
TI  - Bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy Ethiopian infants.
AB  - The objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from faecal samples of healthy Ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. One hundred fifty LAB were obtained from 28 healthy Ethiopian infants. The isolates belonged to Lactobacillus (81/150), Enterococcus (54/150) and Streptococcus (15/150) genera. Lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while Enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. Bacteriocin-producing LAB species were isolated from eight of the infants. Many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from Streptococcus salivarius, avicin A (class IIa) from Enterococcus avium, one class IIa bacteriocin from Enterococcus faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from E. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from Lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin T from Lactobacillus gasseri isolate. Susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. The streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. All enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. Only one E. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. Tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to E. faecalis (47 %) and Enterococcus faecium (33 %). Screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. The structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being E. faecalis and Enterococcus raffinosus. This study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal LAB of Ethiopian infants while virulence factors occur at low levels.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. associated with chronic and self-medicated urinary tract infections in Vietnam.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are one of the most common infections  among women worldwide. E. coli often causes more than 75% of acute uncomplicated UTI, however, little is known about how recurrent UTIs and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials affect the aetiology of UTIs. This study aimed to establish the aetiology of UTI in a population of recurrent and self-medicated patients referred from pharmacies to a hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam and to describe genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of the associated bacterial pathogens. The aetiology of bacterial pathogens associated with UTI (defined as >/= 104 CFU/ml urine) was established by phenotypic and molecular methods. Enterococcus faecalis isolates were typed by Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST), Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. METHODS: Urine samples from 276 patients suffering symptoms of urinary tract infection were collected and cultured on Flexicult agar(R) allowing for detection of the most common urine pathogens. Patients were interviewed about underlying diseases, duration of symptoms, earlier episodes of UTI, number of episodes diagnosed by doctors and treatment in relation to UTI. All tentative E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates were identified to species level by PCR, 16S rRNA and partial sequencing of the groEL gene. E. faecalis isolates were further characterized by Multi Locus Sequence Typing and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. RESULTS: Mean age of 49 patients was 48 yrs (range was 11-86 yrs) and included 94% women. On average, patients reported to have suffered from UTI for 348 days (range 3 days-10 years, and experienced 2.7 UTIs during the previous year). Cephalosporins were reported the second drug of choice in treatment of UTI at the hospital. E. faecalis (55.1%), E. coli (12.2%) and Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus (8.2%) were main bacterial pathogens. MIC testing of E. faecalis showed susceptibility to ampicillin, penicillin and vancomycin, but high-level resistance against gentamicin (48.1%). MLST revealed 12 Sequence Types (ST) of which ST 16 made up 44.5% and showed closely related PFGE types. CONCLUSION: The different aetiology of UTI compared with reports elsewhere, where E. coli dominates, may be a result of chronic and recurrent UTIs together with indiscriminate use of antimicrobials. The similar genotypes shown by epidemiologically unrelated ST 16 isolates in Vietnam and elsewhere, suggest that E. faecalis ST 16 might represent a globally distributed clone. Treatment of UTI with cephalosporins may select for E. faecalis as it is intrinsic resistant and further studies are needed to establish the source(s) and role of E. faecalis ST 16 in acute UTI.
TI  - ZAAPS Program results for 2010: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from 75 medical centres in 24 countries.
AB  - The Zyvox(R) Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program monitors the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents for Gram-positive organisms in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific. For the 2010 Program a total of 6305 Gram-positive strains were collected from 75 medical centres on five continents (24 countries). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility tests were performed on organisms from the following groups: Staphylococcus aureus (2875), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) (855), enterococci (787), Streptococcus pneumoniae (926), viridans group and other streptococci (325), and beta-haemolytic streptococci (507). Linezolid demonstrated a 99.81% susceptibility rate among 6305 strains tested from 24 nations. Of the resistant isolates, four linezolid-resistant strains of enterococci (two each for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) were found in four nations (China, Thailand, Germany, and Brazil). Eight CoNS (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus hominis) isolates were observed to be resistant to linezolid (MIC, >/=8 mug/ml). Two strains from Mexico were determined to be from an ongoing epidemic, and investigations showed that isolates from Italy and Brazil were also from circulating resistant clones discovered in earlier years. MRSA rates varied by region and between nations, as did resistances to other potential therapeutic agent options frequently listed for MRSA therapy such as clindamycin, fluoroquinolones and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In summary, the 2010 ZAAPS Program demonstrated that linezolid activity remains stable around the world with >99% susceptibility.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Rapid identification of Gram-positive pathogens and their resistance genes from positive blood culture broth using a multiplex tandem RT-PCR assay.
AB  - The early initiation of targeted antibiotic therapy in patients with bacteraemia  and septic shock impacts favourably on outcomes. Rapid methods are therefore increasingly employed for bacterial identification directly from positive blood culture bottles, but with variable success. We evaluated the performance of the Gram Positive 12 multiplex tandem PCR (MT-PCR) assay (AusDiagnostics; catalogue no. 6202, version 07) containing targets for the identification of staphylococci including Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococci including Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and their common antibiotic resistance genes (mecA, vanA, vanB). A total of 673 aerobic and anaerobic blood culture broths demonstrating Gram-positive cocci on microscopy were analysed in parallel with traditional phenotypic methods. Amplification of the internal control was inhibited in 79/673 (11.7 %) samples; however, MT-PCR identification was in concordance with phenotypic identification to the genus level in 96.6 % (537/556) of the remaining monomicrobial specimens and to the species level, where applicable, in 100 % (172/172) of samples. MT-PCR identification for 94.7 % (36/38) of polymicrobial samples matched traditional phenotypic identification. Meticillin and vancomycin susceptibility results determined by MT-PCR in blood culture broths demonstrated complete agreement with those determined by phenotypic methods in all 143 Staphylococcus aureus isolates and eight E. faecium isolates, respectively. Gram-positive pathogens and their key antibiotic resistance markers were reliably identified with the MT-PCR assay within 3 h of a positive blood culture result.
TI  - A comparative study to determine the recovery rate of microorganisms of bloodstream infections: two versus three blood culture specimens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There has been a development of automated and continuous-monitoring blood culture systems that are more sensitive than conventional systems for the detection of microorganisms. Whether two or three blood culture specimens obtained during a 24-hour period using these automated systems achieving a higher recovery rate of microorganism remains to be determined. The present study was aimed to compare the recovery rates of microorganism of blood-stream infections (BSIs) using two and three blood culture specimens. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A prospective investigator-blinded study was carried out in patients who needed to have blood cultures in medicine wards and intensive care units as well as an emergency room of King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between October 1, 2010 and March 31, 2011. Three blood culture specimens were obtained from each patient during a 24-hour period. Each specimen was inoculated into an aerobic bottle of blood culture broth (TREK Diagnostics, Cleveland, OH, US), and then incubated at 37 degrees C for seven days. RESULTS: Of 568 patients, there were 116 (20.4%) unimicrobial episodes with three blood cultures obtained during a 24-hour period. There were 70 (12.3%) and 46 (8.1%) episodes of true pathogen and contaminant, respectively. The recovery rates of true pathogen were 75.7% (53 isolates), 87.1% (61 isolates), and 100% (70 isolates) with the first, second, and third blood culture specimens, respectively (p < 0.05 between the recovery rate with the first two and the third blood culture specimens). There were 25 (35.7%), 38 (58.6%) isolates, and four (5.7%) of Gram-positive, Gram-negative bacteria, and fungi, respectively. Among 25 Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common isolate (10, 14.3%), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (5, 7.1%) and Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3, 10% each). Among 38 Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most common isolate (13, 18. 6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8, 11.4%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.6%). The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using two blood culture specimens were 85.7% and 92.3%, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of the recovery rate of microorganisms using three blood culture specimens were 100% and 90.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: To the best of the authors'knowledge, the present study is the first prospective study to compare the recovery rate of microorganisms of BSIs between the two and three blood culture specimens using the VersaTREK blood culture system. Three blood culture specimens are required to achieve the recovery rate of more than 99%.
TI  - The changing epidemiology of bacteraemias in Europe: trends from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System.
AB  - We investigated bacteraemia trends for five major bacterial pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and determined how expanding antimicrobial resistance influenced the total burden of bacteraemias in Europe. Aetiological fractions of species and antibiotic phenotypes were extracted from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (EARSS) database for laboratories, which consistently reported between 2002 and 2008. Trend analyses used generalized linear models. Robustness of results was assessed by iterative analysis for different geographic regions. From 2002 to 2008, the overall number of reports increased annually by 6.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 6.2-6.5%), from 46 095 to 67 876. In the subset of laboratories providing denominator information, the overall incidence increased from 0.58/1000 patient-days to 0.90/1000 patient-days (7.2% per year; 95% CI 6.9-7.5%). The frequency of reported bacteraemia isolates of S. aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae increased moderately, while increase in E. coli and Enterococcus faecium was more pronounced. Bacteraemias caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus increased until 2005 (7.6% per year; 95% CI 6.1-9.1%), and then decreased (-4.8% per year; 95% CI -6.1 to -3.5%), whereas the number attributable to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus increased continuously (3.4% per year; 95% CI 3.0-3.7). Increasing rates of E. coli were mainly caused by antibiotic-resistant phenotypes. Our data suggest that the burden of bacterial bloodstream infection has been increasing for all species during EARSS surveillance. Trends were mainly driven by resistant strains and clearly dissociated between resistant and susceptible isolates. It appears that infections with resistant clones add to rather than replace infections caused by susceptible bacteria. As a consequence, expansion of antibiotic resistance creates an additional strain on healthcare systems.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria isolated from cheeses and yogurts.
AB  - The biopreservation of foods using bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated directly from foods is an innovative approach. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify bacteriocinogenic LAB from various cheeses and yogurts and evaluate their antimicrobial effects on selected spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms in vitro as well as on a food commodity.LAB were isolated using MRS and M17 media. The agar diffusion bioassay was used to screen for bacteriocin or bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) producing LAB using Lactobacillus sakei and Listeria innocua as indicator organisms. Out of 138 LAB isolates, 28 were found to inhibit these bacteria and were identified as strains of Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus sakei subsp. sakei using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Eight isolates were tested for antimicrobial activity at 5 degrees C and 20 degrees C against L. innocua, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides using the agar diffusion bioassay, and also against Penicillium expansum, Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia frucitcola using the microdilution plate method. The effect of selected LAB strains on L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions was also investigated.Twenty percent of our isolates produced BLS inhibiting the growth of L. innocua and/or Lact. sakei. Organic acids and/or H2O2 produced by LAB and not the BLS had strong antimicrobial effects on all microorganisms tested with the exception of E. coli. Ent. faecium, Strep. thermophilus and Lact. casei effectively inhibited the growth of natural microflora and L. innocua inoculated onto fresh-cut onions. Bacteriocinogenic LAB present in cheeses and yogurts may have potential to be used as biopreservatives in foods.
TI  - Synergistic effects between silver nanoparticles and antibiotics and the mechanisms involved.
AB  - Silver nanoparticles (nano-Ags), which have well-known antimicrobial properties,  are used extensively in various medical and general applications. In this study, the combination effects between nano-Ags and the conventional antibiotics ampicillin, chloramphenicol and kanamycin against various pathogenic bacteria were investigated. The MIC and fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) were determined to confirm antibacterial susceptibility and synergistic effects. The results showed that nano-Ags possessed antibacterial effects and synergistic activities. The antibiofilm activities of nano-Ags alone or in combination with antibiotics were also investigated. Formation of biofilm is associated with resistance to antimicrobial agents and chronic bacterial infections. The results indicated that nano-Ags also had antibiofilm activities. To understand these effects of nano-Ags, an ATPase inhibitor assay, permeability assay and hydroxyl radical assay were conducted. The antibacterial activity of nano-Ags was influenced by ATP-associated metabolism rather than by the permeability of the outer membrane. Additionally, nano-Ags generated hydroxyl radicals, a highly reactive oxygen species induced by bactericidal agents. It was concluded that nano-Ags have potential as a combination therapeutic agent for the treatment of infectious diseases by bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial spirobisnaphthalenes from the North American cup fungus Urnula craterium.
AB  - Urnucratins A-C (1-3), which possess an unusual bisnaphthospiroether skeleton with one oxygen bridge and one C-C bridge and represent a new subclass of bisnaphthalenes, were isolated from the North American cup fungus Urnula craterium. Their structures, including absolute configurations, were determined by means of HRMS, NMR, and quantum chemical CD calculations. Urnucratin A (1) was found to be active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pyogenes with MIC values of 2, 1, and 0.5 mug/mL, respectively.
TI  - Armeniaspiroles, a new class of antibacterials: Antibacterial activities and total synthesis of 5-chloro-Armeniaspirole A.
AB  - Armeniaspiroles, a novel class of natural products isolated from Streptomyces armeniacus, are characterized by a novel spiro[4.4]non-8-ene scaffold. Various derivatives of Armeniaspiroles could be obtained by halogenation, alkylation, addition/elimination or reductions. A total synthesis of the 5-chloro analog of Armeniaspirole A has been accomplished in a linear six-step sequence. 5-Chloro-Armeniaspirole A exhibits good activity against a range of multidrug-resistant, Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2008].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (25 genus or species, 1029 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (21 genus or species, 187 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2008 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 59.6% and 81.2%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM), linezolid (LZD) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 microg/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 92.0% that was highest among our previous reports. Cefpirome, carbapenems, VCM, teicoplanin (TEIC), LZD and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 15.9% of E. faecalis strains and 1.2% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate to LZD. 17.1% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM was under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity. Carbapenems showed good activity against Clostridiales, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp., but one strain of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems. And so, the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future at detecting continuously.
TI  - [Infective endocarditis in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy: five cases report].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical characteristics of infective endocarditis in patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. METHODS: Clinical characteristics from 5 patients with infective endocarditis and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy hospitalized from January 2000 to December 2010 in our hospital were analyzed. RESULTS: Four patients were diagnosed with left ventricular outflow tract obstructive cardiomyopathy with outflow pressure gradient from 36 to 140 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa) and left atrial size 44 - 68 mm. Another patient was diagnosed as ventricular hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with significant right-ventricular outflow tract hypertrophy (30 mm), high pressure gradient (164 mm Hg) and enlarged right atrial (56 mm x 53 mm), there was a 17 mm x 8 mm vegetation on right-ventricular outflow tract in this patient. Blood cultures were positive for streptococcus viridans in all five patients, and enterococcus faecium was revealed in one aortic valve vegetation culture. Transthoracic echocardiogram was performed 2 - 4 times for each patient, the vegetations of two patients was detected only by transesophageal echocardiography. The mitral valve vegetation was detected in two patients, the aortic and mitral valve vegetations were detected in one patients, mitral and tricuspid vegetations in one patient and right ventricular outflow tract vegetation in one patient. The four hemodynamically stable patients were successfully treated with antibiotic therapy, one patient received urgent surgery (replacement of the aortic and mitral valve as well as septal myectomy). All patients recovered and follow-up (1 - 6 years) was available in 4 patients and no complication was observed. CONCLUSION: The risk of infective endocarditis complicating hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy is the highest in patients with both outflow obstruction and marked valve insufficiency, these patients should receive prophylactic antibiotic therapy during procedures that predispose to infective endocarditis.
TI  - Clinical study of distribution and drug resistance of pathogens in patients with  severe acute pancreatitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous researches about necrotic pancreatic tissue infections are numerous, but the study on systemic infection related to the severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) treatment period is limited. This study aimed to investigate the distribution and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in patients who had hepatobiliary surgery for SAP during the past three years. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on the distribution, category and drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria in patients who had hepatobiliary surgery for SAP from 2008 to 2011. RESULTS: A total of 594 pathogenic bacteria samples were isolated. Among them 418 isolates (70.4%) were Gram bacteria negative, 142 isolates (23.9%) were Gram bacteria positive, and 34 isolates (5.7%) were found fungi. The most common Gram negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (19.8%), and the dominant Gram positive pathogenic bacteria were Enterococcus faecium. The distribution of SAP-related infectious pathogens was mainly in peritoneal drainage fluid, sputum, bile, and wound secretions. Almost all the Gram negative pathogenic bacteria were sensitive to carbapenum. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) producing strains were more resistant to penicillins and cephalosprins than the ESBLs non-producing strains. Staphylococcus was sensitive to vancomycin and linezolid. The drug resistance of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus (MRS) to commonly used antibiotics was higher than meticillin-sensitive streptococcus (MSS). Enterococcus sp. exhibited lower drug-resistance rates to vancomycin and linezolid. CONCLUSIONS: Gram negative bacteria were the dominant SAP-related infection after hepatobiliary surgery. A high number of fungal infections were reported. Drug resistant rates were high. Rational use of antibiotics according to the site of infection, bacterial species and drug sensitivity, correctly executing the course of treatment and enhancing hand washing will contribute to therapy and prevention of SAP-related infection and decrease its mortality.
TI  - Ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - Ceftaroline fosamil is a cephalosporin antibacterial approved by the US Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP). After intravenous administration, ceftaroline fosamil is rapidly converted to its bioactive metabolite, ceftaroline. Ceftaroline has broad-spectrum in vitro activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including contemporary resistant Gram-positive phenotypes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Because of its unique spectrum of activity, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) designated ceftaroline as a member of a new subclass of beta-lactam antimicrobials, cephalosporins with anti-MRSA activity. The activity of ceftaroline against S. aureus extends to heteroresistant vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-intermediate, vancomycin-resistant and daptomycin-nonsusceptible isolates. Ceftaroline has low minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for all tested species of streptococci, and has potent activity against S. pneumoniae isolates with varying degrees of penicillin resistance. The activity of ceftaroline is limited against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium and against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis. The in vitro activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens, but does not extend to bacteria that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, class B metallo-beta-lactamases or AmpC cephalosporinases, or to most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline fosamil has been studied for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in phase III randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre noninferiority clinical trials. Two identical trials (CANVAS 1 and CANVAS 2) compared the efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil with that of vancomycin plus aztreonam in 1378 adults with cSSSI. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam, with 91.6% in the ceftaroline fosamil group (pooled analysis) achieving clinical response compared with 92.7% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (difference -1.1%, 95% CI -4.2, 2.0). An additional analysis evaluated clinical cure in a subgroup of patients who met the FDA guidance definition of ABSSSI at treatment day 3. Clinical response, defined as cessation of lesion spread and absence of fever, was 74.0% in the ceftaroline fosamil group compared with 66.2% in the vancomycin plus aztreonam group (treatment difference 7.8%, 95% CI 1.3, 14.0). Clinical efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in 1240 hospitalized adults with CAP was compared with that of ceftriaxone in two additional phase III trials (FOCUS 1 and FOCUS 2). Of note, because ceftriaxone does not have activity against MRSA, patients with confirmed or suspected MRSA CAP were excluded from the FOCUS trials. Results demonstrated that ceftaroline was noninferior to ceftriaxone, with 84.3% in the ceftaroline fosamil group achieving clinical cure compared with 77.7% in the ceftriaxone group (difference 6.7%, 95% CI 1.6, 11.8). An additional analysis of the trials was conducted in patients with moderate to severe CAP and at least one proven typical bacterial pathogen at baseline (i.e. CABP). Day 4 clinical response rates were 69.5% for ceftaroline and 59.4% for ceftriaxone (difference 10.1%, 95% CI -0.6, 20.6). In the phase III trials, adverse event rates were similar between groups. Overall, ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline fosamil is a broad-spectrum parenteral cephalosporin with excellent in vitro activity against resistant Gram-positive pathogens, including MRSA, as well as many common Gram-negative organisms. It is a welcome treatment option for ABSSSI and CABP.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance among Gram-positive pathogens in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - Several species of Gram-positive cocci are major nosocomial or community pathogens associated with morbidity and mortality. Here, we review the antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens in Saudi Arabia. In the last decades, antimicrobial resistance has increased among Staphylococcus aureus in the Kingdom with a growing prevalence of both nosocomial and community methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. As yet, no vancomycin-resistant MRSA have been reported, although isolates with reduced susceptibility to the drug have been noted. Currently, the prevalence of vancomycin-resistant entrococci (VRE) is low; however, VRE has been described in the Kingdom as well as Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin, sulfamethoxazole, macrolides, tetracycline, and aminoglycosides. In recent decades, the prevalence and rate of penicillin resistance and non-susceptibility among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates have increased in Saudi Arabia. The organism remains, however, susceptible to other beta-lactams and to quinolones. On the other hand, resistance to co-trimoxazole and tetracyclines is high and resistance to macrolides is on the increase.
TI  - Improved identification including MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis of group D streptococci from bovine mastitis and subsequent molecular characterization of corresponding Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium isolates.
AB  - We examined 199 group D streptococci isolated from clinically defined and epidemiologically unrelated cases of bovine mastitis. Samples were collected during a 5-month period from 2010 to 2011 from diseased animals in 199 herds (1 isolate per herd) raised in different counties and federal states in Germany. A classical enterococcal species identification procedure started with PYRase and catalase assays, growth on Enterococcoselagar((R)) and GCG((R)) agar plates and in 6.5% NaCl followed by a biochemical reaction panel. All 199 isolates were also subjected to MALDI-TOF MS diagnostics in which a simple and an extended direct transfer protocol were compared. The latter revealed a much better performance (higher log (score) values) although the same result was obtained in all but three cases. Classical and MALDI TOF MS analyses identified 64 Enterococcus faecalis and 37 Enterococcus faecium isolates which were confirmed by species-specific PCRs. These 101 enterococcal isolates did not display a specific multi-resistance phenotype and resistances to glycopeptides and antibiotics of last resort (linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline) were absent, resistance to tetracycline was the most frequent resistance feature. Molecular typing of the 64 E. faecalis isolates revealed 3 main PFGE clusters of related strains represented by three MLST types (ST40, ST211, ST268). PFGE and MLST analysis of E. faecium isolates revealed several smaller clusters of only a few related strains and identified a number of previously unknown allele and MLST types (n=6; ST624-ST629) besides known variants (ST22, ST32). One of the 37 E. faecium strains showed properties of hospital-associated E. faecium strains (ampicillin resistance, IS16-positive; MLST CC17).
TI  - HIV-1 Integrase Inhibitor-Inspired Antibacterials Targeting Isoprenoid Biosynthesis.
AB  - We report the discovery of antibacterial leads, keto- and diketo-acids, targeting two prenyl transferases: undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase (UPPS) and dehydrosqualene synthase (CrtM). The leads were suggested by the observation that keto- and diketo-acids bind to the active site Mg(2+)/Asp domain in HIV-1 integrase, and similar domains are present in prenyl transferases. We report the x-ray crystallographic structures of one diketo-acid and one keto-acid bound to CrtM, which supports the Mg(2+) binding hypothesis, together with the x-ray structure of one diketo-acid bound to UPPS. In all cases, the inhibitors bind to a farnesyl diphosphate substrate-binding site. Compound 45 had cell growth inhibition MIC(90) values of ~250-500 ng/mL against S. aureus, 500 ng/mL against Bacillus anthracis, 4 mug/mL against Listeria monocytogenes and Enterococcus faecium, and 1 mug/mL against Streptococcus pyogenes M1, but very little activity against E. coli (DH5alpha, K12) or human cell lines.
TI  - Exploration of the chemical space of novel naphthalene-sulfonamide and anthranilic Acid-based inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins are a well established, validated and still a very promising target for the design and development of new antibacterial agents. Based on our previous discovery of several noncovalent small-molecule inhibitor hits for resistant PBPs we decided to additionally explore the chemical space around these compounds. In order to clarify their structure-activity relationships for PBP inhibition two new series of compounds were synthesized, characterized and evaluated biochemically: the derivatives of anthranilic acid and naphthalene-sulfonamide derivatives. The target compounds were tested for their inhibitory activities on three different transpeptidases: PBP2a from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains, PBP5fm from Enterococcus faecium strains, and PBP1b from Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. The most promising results for both of these series of compounds were obtained against the PBP2a enzyme with the IC50 values in the micromolar range. Although these results do not represent a significant breakthrough in the field of noncovalent PBP inhibitors, they do provide useful structure-activity relationship data, and thus a more solid basis for the design of potent and noncovalent inhibitors of resistant PBPs.
TI  - Pantoea agglomerans in immunodeficient patients with different respiratory symptoms.
AB  - The aim of this paper was to determine in 32 patients from 4 different Mexican hospitals the frequency of opportunistic bacteria in the 2010 to 2011 time period. The patients were divided in 4 groups. Group 1 included 21 HIV positive patients with acute respiratory syndrome. Four HIV positive patients with tuberculosis symptoms were included in Group 2; two patients with tuberculosis symptoms and one asymptomatic person formed Group 3. Reference Group 4 included 4 patients from whom 4 strains of Mycobacterium spp. had been reported. The strains were isolated and identified by 16S rRNA gene amplification, API 20E and 50CH, biochemical test, and antibiotic sensitivity. The strains found were 10 Pantoea agglomerans, 6 Mycobacterium spp., 6 Pseudomonas spp. and 10 strains of normal floral species: Thermoactinomycetes bacterium (1), Enterococcus faecium (2), Bacillus licheniformis (1), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (2), Streptococcus oralis (2), Streptococcus anginosus (1), and Enterobacter hormaechei (1).
TI  - Clinical streptococci and their sensitivity to enterocins produced by different strains of the species Enterococcus faecium (short communication).
AB  - In children, acute otitis media (AOM) is one of the most frequently occurring infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Str. pyogenes. The standard treatment of AOMis provided by antibiotics; however, an increased resistance of the causative agents to antibiotics requires the need to search for innovations. This study was focused on in vitro testing sensitivity of streptococci isolated from AOM to enterocins produced by 9 different origin strains of E. faecium. Enterocins (Ent) represent ribosomally synthesized proteinaceous substances with antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and/or Gram-negative bacteria which are produced mostly by strains of the species Enterococcus faecium. Str. pneumoniae were sensitive at least to 1 Ent. Str. pneumoniae SPn 754 was sensitive to 5 Ent. Five Str. pyogenes were sensitive to enterocins. Ent A (P) inhibited the growth of 3 Str. pneumoniae, and 4 Str. pyogenes (activity between 100 and 3,200 AU/ml). Most of Ent inhibited the growth of streptococci tested (100-3,200 AU/ml). Str. pyogenes were more sensitive to Ent than Str. pneumoniae. Although more detailed further studies are required, our results indicate a new possibility for enterocin use.
TI  - Comparison of nitroethane, 2-nitro-1-propanol, lauric acid, Lauricidin(R) and the Hawaiian marine algae, Chaetoceros, for potential broad-spectrum control of anaerobically grown lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The gastrointestinal tract of bovines often contains bacteria that contribute to  disorders of the rumen, and may also contain foodborne or opportunistic human pathogens as well as bacteria capable of causing mastitis in cows. Thus there is a need to develop broad-spectrum therapies that are effective while not leading to unacceptably long antibiotic withdrawal times. The effects of the CH(4)-inhibitors nitroethane (2 mg/mL), 2-nitro-1-propanol (2 mg/mL), lauric acid (5 mg/mL), the commercial product Lauricidin(R) (5 mg/mL), and a finely ground product of the Hawaiian marine algae, Chaetoceros (10 mg/mL), were compared in pure cultures of Streptococcus agalactia, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and in a mixed lactic acid rumen bacterial culture. Lauricidin(R) and lauric acid exhibited the most bactericidal acidity against all bacteria. These results suggest potential animal health benefits from supplementing cattle diets with lauric acid or Lauricidin(R) to improve the health of the rumen and help prevent shedding of human pathogens.
TI  - Minim typing--a rapid and low cost MLST based typing tool for Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - Here we report a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) based genotyping method for Klebsiella pneumoniae utilising high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis of fragments within the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) loci. The approach is termed mini-MLST or Minim typing and it has previously been applied to Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Six SNPs were derived from concatenated MLST sequences on the basis of maximisation of the Simpsons Index of Diversity (D). DNA fragments incorporating these SNPs and predicted to be suitable for HRM analysis were designed. Using the assumption that HRM alleles are defined by G+C content, Minim typing using six fragments was predicted to provide a D = 0.979 against known STs. The method was tested against 202 K. pneumoniae using a blinded approach in which the MLST analyses were performed after the HRM analyses. The HRM-based alleles were indeed in accordance with G+C content, and the Minim typing identified known STs and flagged new STs. The tonB MLST locus was determined to be very diverse, and the two Minim fragments located herein contribute greatly to the resolving power. However these fragments are refractory to amplification in a minority of isolates. Therefore, we assessed the performance of two additional formats: one using only the four fragments located outside the tonB gene (D = 0.929), and the other using HRM data from these four fragments in conjunction with sequencing of the tonB MLST fragment (D = 0.995). The HRM assays were developed on the Rotorgene 6000, and the method was shown to also be robust on the LightCycler 480, allowing a 384-well high through-put format. The assay provides rapid, robust and low-cost typing with fully portable results that can directly be related to current MLST data. Minim typing in combination with molecular screening for antibiotic resistance markers can be a powerful surveillance tool kit.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of the investigational pleuromutilin compound BC-3781 tested against Gram-positive organisms commonly associated with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections.
AB  - BC-3781 is a novel semisynthetic pleuromutilin antimicrobial agent developed as an intravenous and oral therapy for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and respiratory tract infections (RTI). BC-3781 and comparator agents were tested by the broth microdilution method against 1,893 clinical Gram-positive organisms predominantly causing ABSSSI. BC-3781 exhibited potent activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/ml), coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mug/ml), beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 mug/ml), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.5 mug/ml), and Enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin-nonsusceptible strains) (MIC(50/90), 0.12/2 mug/ml). Compared with other antibiotics in use for the treatment of ABSSSI, BC-3781 displayed the lowest MICs and only a minimal potential for cross-resistance with other antimicrobial classes.
TI  - Trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan study, 2006 to 2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 1,141), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in Taiwan. MICs of tigecycline were determined following the criteria of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST-2011). Among drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, all of the PRSP isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (MIC(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one MRSA isolate (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three VRE isolates (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for ESBL-producing E. coli (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (MIC(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by FDA criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by EUCAST-2011 criteria. The susceptibility rate for A. baumannii (MIC(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. A bimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii isolates, and a unimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates. In Taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of A. baumannii.
TI  - Enterococcus faecium WB2000 Inhibits Biofilm Formation by Oral Cariogenic Streptococci.
AB  - This study investigated the inhibitory effect of probiotic Enterococcus faecium WB2000 on biofilm formation by cariogenic streptococci. The ability of E. faecium WB2000 and JCM5804 and Enterococcus faecalis JCM5803 to inhibit biofilm formation by seven laboratory oral streptococcal strains and 13 clinical mutans streptococcal strains was assayed. The Enterococcal strains inhibited biofilm formation in dual cultures with the mutans streptococcal strains Streptococcus mutans Xc and Streptococcus sobrinus JCM5176 (P < 0.05), but not with the noncariogenic streptococcal strains. Enterococcus faecium WB2000 inhibited biofilm formation by 90.0% (9/10) of the clinical S. mutans strains and 100% (3/3) of the clinical S. sobrinus strains. After culturing, the pH did not differ between single and dual cultures. The viable counts of floating mutans streptococci were lower in dual cultures with E. faecium WB2000 than in single cultures. Enterococcus faecium WB2000 acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of cariogenic streptococcal biofilm formation.
TI  - Telavancin activity tested against a contemporary collection of Gram-positive pathogens from USA Hospitals (2007-2009).
AB  - This study updates the activity of telavancin against Gram-positive pathogens collected from USA hospitals (2007-2009). Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 mug/mL) was active against coagulase-negative staphylococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (100% susceptible), for which only daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(50/90), </= 0.25-0.5/0.5 mug/mL; 99% susceptible) exhibited similar activity. Telavancin (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mug/mL) inhibited 96.5% of Enterococcus faecalis at the Food and Drug Administration breakpoint (MIC, </= 1 mug/mL), where ampicillin (99.9% susceptible), daptomycin (99.9% susceptible), and linezolid (100% susceptible) also demonstrated high-level coverage. Telavancin inhibited, respectively, 100.0% and 91.7% of VanB-phenotype E. faecalis and E. faecium at </= 1 mug/mL, whereas it was less active against VanA strains. Telavancin was uniformly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae and resistant subsets, and demonstrated good potency (MIC(90), 0.06-0.12 mug/mL) against other streptococci, regardless of resistance to other drugs. This assessment reveals potent activity of telavancin against Gram-positive isolates collected from USA hospitals with no evidence of emergence of resistance.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline and linezolid among gram-positive isolates collected in the United States as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (TEST) between 2004 and 2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) was initiated in 2004 to chart the activity of tigecycline and comparator antimicrobial agents against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms globally. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to provide an analysis of the antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive organisms collected from the 9 census regions of the United States between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: The MICs and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute methodology. For tigecycline, US Food and Drug Administration susceptibility criteria were used. RESULTS: A total of 8782 Staphylococcus aureus isolates (54.5% methicillin-resistant S aureus) were collected, with the highest percentage of MRSA isolates collected from the South Central region (67.9%). All S aureus isolates were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. Overall, 4.6% of Enterococcus faecalis (n = 3753) and 69.1% of Enterococcus faecium (n = 1417) isolates were vancomycin resistant, with the highest rates in the East North Central region for E faecalis (7.1%) and the South Atlantic region for E faecium (79.5%). Small numbers of linezolid nonsusceptible E faecalis (n = 13) were identified. MIC(90) values for tigecycline were </=0.25 mg/L against E faecalis and 0.12 mg/L against E faecium. Of the Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates collected (n = 4541), 1.1% were penicillin resistant. All S pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin; susceptibility to tigecycline varied between 80.9% (Pacific region) and 95.2% (West North Central region). CONCLUSIONS: The rates of MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp varied among the 9 census regions; however, susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline remained consistent, with low MIC(90) values and high rates of antimicrobial susceptibility.
TI  - Serotypes and antibiotic resistance in Group B streptococcus isolated from patients at the Maternity Hospital, Kuwait.
AB  - A total of 143 group B streptococcus (GBS) isolates collected from mothers at the Maternity Hospital in Kuwait were investigated for their serotypes and antibiotic resistance, and screened by PCR for the carriage of genes for resistance to tetracycline (tetk, tetM, tetL, tetO), erythromycin (ermA, ermB, ermC, ermTR, ermM, mefA, mefE, msrA) and aminoglycosides (aph3, ant4, ant6). All isolates were serotyped using a latex agglutination test. Most of the isolates belonged to serotypes V (38.5 %), III (20.9 %), Ia (7.7 %) and II (11.2 %). Sixteen isolates (11.2 %) were nontypable. All isolates were susceptible to penicillin, ampicillin and cefotaxime (MICs 0.016-0.094 microg ml(-1)) but were resistant to trimethoprim (92.3 %), tetracycline (89.5 %), minocycline (89.5 %), high-level kanamycin (76.9 %), chloramphenicol (30.0 %), erythromycin (12.6 %), clindamycin (7.0 %), high-level streptomycin (3.5 %) and ciprofloxacin (0.7 %). The tetracycline-resistant isolates contained tetM (94.5 %), tetO (3.9 %), tetL (1.6 %) and tetK (0.8 %). The erythromycin-resistant isolates contained ermB (61.1 %), ermTR (38.9 %), ermA (5.5 %), mefA (5.5 %) and mefE (11 %). All high-level kanamycin-resistant isolates contained aph3. One of the high-level streptomycin-resistant isolates contained ant6. Partial DNA sequencing of aph3 revealed sequences with 99 % similarity to aph3 found in Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, suggesting that the GBS isolates could have acquired aph3 from other Gram-positive cocci. The high proportion of isolates with resistance to tetracycline, high-level kanamycin and trimethoprim, and the increase in the prevalence of erythromycin resistance, represents an emerging public health concern that needs further surveillance.
TI  - Influence of synthetic peptide inducers on antibacterial activity of enterococci.
AB  - Antibacterial activity of probiotic enterococci is often related to the production of bacteriocins. There is a variety of Enterococcus faecium strains which synthesise one or several enterocins including A, B, P, 96, L50AB and others. In this work we have analysed the probiotic strain E. faecium L3 whose genome contained the genes encoding enterocins capital A, Cyrillic, capital VE, Cyrillic and a three-component regulatory system. All these genes were found to be expressed in enterococcal strain L3. Antimicrobial activity of the strain tested on the strains of Listeria monocytogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae was pheromone dependent. Chemically synthesised cyclic peptides (analogues and shorter derivates of EntF) with different molecular structures were able to increase the antagonistic activity of the strain E. faecium L3 in contrast to the strain E. faecium SF68, which does nsmall o, Cyrillict have genes encoding enterocins capital A, Cyrillic and capital VE, Cyrillic.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin tested against gram-positive strains collected in European hospitals: results from 7 years of resistance surveillance (2003-2009).
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide approved by the European medicines Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI) and Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and endocarditis. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin and comparators tested against clinical isolates from european hospitals over a 7-year period (2003-2009). A total of 36,769 consecutive isolates were collected in 34 medical centers located in 13 European countries, Turkey and Israel. the collection included S. aureus (18,352; 27.2% oxacillin-resistant [MRSA]); coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 6,874), Enterococcus spp. (7,241; 9.4% vancomycin-resistant), beta-hemolytic (3,009), viridans group streptococci (1,176), and Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus (107). The organisms were isolated mainly from patients with bloodstream infection (56%) or cSSTI (23%). Daptomycin was very active against S. aureus and CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l for both organisms), and its activity was not adversely influenced by oxacillin resistance. All Enterococcus faecalis strains were susceptible to daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 1/1 mg/l). Daptomycin (MIC(50/90), 2/2 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and linezolid (MIC(50/90), 1/2 mg/l; 99.7% susceptible) were the most active agents tested against vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Vancomycin- resistant and -susceptible enterococcal strains were equally susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin was also active against beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible), viridans group streptococci (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 mg/l; 99.8% susceptible) and S. bovis (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible).In summary, daptomycin was very potent against this large collection (36,769) of Gram-positive organisms isolated in european hospitals, and its activity remained stable across the 7-year period evaluated (2003-2009), using reference methods and interpretive criteria. Decreases in daptomycin potency were not observed since EMEA approval and widespread clinical use, and emerging resistance to other compounds did not adversely influence daptomycin activity against contemporary Gram-positive species.
TI  - Further increases in carbapenem-, amikacin-, and fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa in Korea: KONSAR study 2009.
AB  - PURPOSE: The increasing prevalence of antimicrobial resistant bacteria has become a serious worldwide problem. The aim of this study was to analyze antimicrobial resistance data generated in 2009 by hospitals and commercial laboratories participating in the Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Susceptibility data were collected from 24 hospitals and two commercial laboratories. In the analysis, resistance did not include intermediate susceptibility. Duplicate isolates were excluded from the analysis of hospital isolates, but not from the commercial laboratory isolates. RESULTS: Among the hospital isolates, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin G-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae based on meningitis breakpoint, and ampicillin- resistant Enterococcus faecium remained highly prevalent. The proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium gradually increased to 29%. Ceftazidime-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae increased to 17% and 33%, respectively, and fluoroquinolone-resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased to 33%, 67% and 39%, respectively. Amikacin-resistant Acinetobacter spp. increased to 48%. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa increased to 51% and 26%, respectively. Higher resistance rates were observed in intensive care unit (ICU) isolates than in non-ICU isolates among the isolates from hospitals. Resistance rates were higher in hospital isolates than in clinic isolates among the isolates from commercial laboratories. CONCLUSION: Among the hospital isolates, ceftazidime-resistant K. pneumoniae and fluoroquinolone- resistant K. pneumoniae, Acinetobacter spp., and P. aeruginosa further increased. The increase in imipenem resistance was slight in P. aeruginosa, but drastic in Acinetobacter spp. The problematic antimicrobial-organism combinations were much more prevalent among ICU isolates.
TI  - Persistent, toxin-antitoxin system-independent, tetracycline resistance-encoding  plasmid from a dairy Enterococcus faecium isolate.
AB  - A tetracycline-resistant (Tet(r)) dairy Enterococcus faecium isolate designated M7M2 was found to carry both tet(M) and tet(L) genes on a 19.6-kb plasmid. After consecutive transfer in the absence of tetracycline, the resistance-encoding plasmid persisted in 99% of the progenies. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the 19.6-kb plasmid contained 28 open reading frames (ORFs), including a tet(M)-tet(L)-mob gene cluster, as well as a 10.6-kb backbone highly homologous (99.9%) to the reported plasmid pRE25, but without an identified toxin-antitoxin (TA) plasmid stabilization system. The derived backbone plasmid without the Tet(r) determinants exhibited a 100% retention rate in the presence of acridine orange, suggesting the presence of a TA-independent plasmid stabilization mechanism, with its impact on the persistence of a broad spectrum of resistance-encoding traits still to be elucidated. The tet(M)-tet(L) gene cluster from M7M2 was functional and transmissible and led to acquired resistance in Enterococcus faecalis OG1RF by electroporation and in Streptococcus mutans UA159 by natural transformation. Southern hybridization showed that both the tet(M) and tet(L) genes were integrated into the chromosome of S. mutans UA159, while the whole plasmid was transferred to and retained in E. faecalis OG1RF. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) indicated tetracycline-induced transcription of both the tet(M) and tet(L) genes of pM7M2. The results indicated that multiple mechanisms might have contributed to the persistence of antibiotic resistance-encoding genes and that the plasmids pM7M2, pIP816, and pRE25 are likely correlated evolutionarily.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - High-level fluorescence labeling of gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - Fluorescence labeling of bacterial pathogens has a broad range of interesting applications including the observation of living bacteria within host cells. We constructed a novel vector based on the E. coli streptococcal shuttle plasmid pAT28 that can propagate in numerous bacterial species from different genera. The plasmid harbors a promoterless copy of the green fluorescent variant gene egfp under the control of the CAMP-factor gene (cfb) promoter of Streptococcus agalactiae and was designated pBSU101. Upon transfer of the plasmid into streptococci, the bacteria show a distinct and easily detectable fluorescence using a standard fluorescence microscope and quantification by FACS-analysis demonstrated values that were 10-50 times increased over the respective controls. To assess the suitability of the construct for high efficiency fluorescence labeling in different gram-positive pathogens, numerous species were transformed. We successfully labeled Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus anginosus and Staphylococcus aureus strains utilizing the EGFP reporter plasmid pBSU101. In all of these species the presence of the cfb promoter construct resulted in high-level EGFP expression that could be further increased by growing the streptococcal and enterococcal cultures under high oxygen conditions through continuous aeration.
TI  - Population biology of Gram-positive pathogens: high-risk clones for dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Infections caused by multiresistant Gram-positive bacteria represent a major health burden in the community as well as in hospitalized patients. Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium are well-known pathogens of hospitalized patients, frequently linked with resistance against multiple antibiotics, compromising effective therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus pyogenes are important pathogens in the community and S. aureus has recently emerged as an important community-acquired pathogen. Population genetic studies reveal that recombination prevails as a driving force of genetic diversity in E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes, and thus, these species are weakly clonal. Although recombination has a relatively modest role driving the genetic variation of the core genome of S. aureus, the horizontal acquisition of resistance and virulence genes plays a key role in the emergence of new clinically relevant clones in this species. In this review, we discuss the population genetics of E. faecium, E. faecalis, S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. aureus. Knowledge of the population structure of these pathogens is not only highly relevant for (molecular) epidemiological research but also for identifying the genetic variation that underlies changes in clinical behaviour, to improve our understanding of the pathogenic behaviour of particular clones and to identify novel targets for vaccines or immunotherapy.
TI  - Tn916-like genetic elements: a diverse group of modular mobile elements conferring antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacteria are responsible for morbidity and mortality in healthcare environments. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae can all exhibit clinically relevant multidrug resistance phenotypes due to acquired resistance genes on mobile genetic elements. It is possible that clinically relevant multidrug-resistant Clostridium difficile strains will appear in the future, as the organism is adept at acquiring mobile genetic elements (plasmids and transposons). Conjugative transposons of the Tn916/Tn1545 family, which carry major antibiotic resistance determinants, are transmissible between these different bacteria by a conjugative mechanism during which the elements are excised by a staggered cut from donor cells, converted to a circular form, transferred by cell-cell contact and inserted into recipient cells by a site-specific recombinase. The ability of these conjugative transposons to acquire additional, clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes importantly contributes to the emergence of multidrug resistance.
TI  - Detection and characterization of pediocin PA-1/AcH like bacteriocin producing lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Fifty-five bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from seven different sources. Eight isolates were found to produce pediocin PA-1 like bacteriocin as detected by pedB gene PCR and dot-blot hybridization. The culture filtrate (CF) activity of these isolates exhibited strong antilisterial, antibacterial activity against tested food-borne pathogens and LAB. The identification and genetic diversity among the selected LAB was performed by conventional morphological and molecular tools like RFLP, RAPD, and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The isolates were identified as, 1 each of Pediococcus acidilactici Cb1, Lactobacillus plantarum Acr2, and Streptococcus equinus AC1, 2 were of P. pentosaceus Cb4 and R38, and other 3 were Enterococcus faecium Acr4, BL1, V3. Partial characterization of the bacteriocins revealed that the peptide was heat-stable, active at acidic to alkaline pH, inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, and had molecular weight around 4.6 kDa and shared the properties of class IIa pediocin-family. The bacteriocin production at different temperatures, pH, and salt concentrations was studied to investigate the optimal condition for application of these isolates as a starter culture or as a biopreservative in either acidic or non-acidic foods.
TI  - New noncovalent inhibitors of penicillin-binding proteins from penicillin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) are well known and validated targets for antibacterial therapy. The most important clinically used inhibitors of PBPs beta-lactams inhibit transpeptidase activity of PBPs by forming a covalent penicilloyl-enzyme complex that blocks the normal transpeptidation reaction; this finally results in bacterial death. In some resistant bacteria the resistance is acquired by active-site distortion of PBPs, which lowers their acylation efficiency for beta-lactams. To address this problem we focused our attention to discovery of novel noncovalent inhibitors of PBPs. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our in-house bank of compounds was screened for inhibition of three PBPs from resistant bacteria: PBP2a from Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), PBP2x from Streptococcus pneumoniae strain 5204, and PBP5fm from Enterococcus faecium strain D63r. Initial hit inhibitor obtained by screening was then used as a starting point for computational similarity searching for structurally related compounds and several new noncovalent inhibitors were discovered. Two compounds had promising inhibitory activities of both PBP2a and PBP2x 5204, and good in-vitro antibacterial activities against a panel of Gram-positive bacterial strains. CONCLUSIONS: We found new noncovalent inhibitors of PBPs which represent important starting points for development of more potent inhibitors of PBPs that can target penicillin-resistant bacteria.
TI  - [Bacterial strains isolated from systemic infections and reported for evaluation  and antibiotic resistance surveillance by the "Dr. Victor Babes" Clinical Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases, Bucharest].
AB  - AIM: Testing antibiotic resistance of bacterial strains (compulsor, reported for  EARSS surveillance) isolated from patients hospitalised for systemic infection in the "Dr. V. Babe" Hospital for Infectious and Tropical Diseases during 01.01.2005-11.11.2009, for a dynamic evaluation and for the surveillance of resistance emergence for certain classes of antibiotics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial isolation: BacT/ALERT system; strain identification in classic and automated system (ATB Expression. VITEK 2C): antibioresistance: disk-difussion method (NCCLS 2005--CLSI 2009), MIC (E-Test, ATB/ Expression, VITEK 2C). Screening of ESBL-producing strains performed with double disk-difussion method (DDD). Reference strains used: S. aureus ATCC 25923, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619, E. coli A TCC 25922, Enterococcus fiecalis ATCC 29212. RESULTS: During the studied period, 245 bacterial strains have been isolated, identified and tested (Staphylococcus aureus / 70, Streptococcus pneumoniae / 61, Enterococcus faecalis / 18, Enterococcus faecium / 5, Neisseria meningitidis / 18, E. coli / 73). out of 166 hemocultures and 79 cerebrospinal fluids / CSF. The average incidence of MRSA strains in systemic infections was 34.28%. 44.28% of the S. aureus strains were resistant to erythromycin, 17.14% to cyprofloxacyne, 15.71% to rifampicine, 14.49% to gentamycine. No strain resistant to vancomycine and linezolide. Streptococcus pneumoniae presented an average high resistance to penicillin G of 11.47%. and a 1.63% resistance to third generation cephalosporines. 0% resistance to vancomycine and rifampicine. 7/ 18 Enterococcus faecalis strains and 4/5 Enterococcus faecium strains presented high level resistance to gentamycine (CN 120 microg/disk) and no strain was resistant to vancomycine, teicoplanin or linezolid. The 18 Neisseria meningitidis strains were all sensitive to beta-lactams, macrolides, fluoroquinolones and cloramphenicol. For the 73 Escherichia coli strains, the average incidence of ESBL-producing isolates was 10.95%, the average resistance to ampicillin was 58.90%, to gentamycine--13.88% and to cyprofloxacin--20.83%. No strain resistant to carbapenemes and amikacine. CONCLUSIONS: For the systematic surveillance of antibiotic resistance there is a need for a harmonised protocol of data gathering and strain selection and the rigurous implementation of correct evaluating methods for antibiotic resistance in the microbiology laboratory. Carbapenemes. glycopeptides and oxazolidinones still present a major effectiveness in the first intention treatment of systemic infections.
TI  - [Trends of antimicrobial resistance in microbial strains isolated from invasive infections in Romania. Experience of participation in EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System), 2002-2008].
AB  - EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) is the biggest antimicrobial resistance surveillance project in the world financed from public finds, aiming to provide validated and comparable official data on antimicrobial resistance of invasive microbial strains (isolated from blood and CSF), belonging to 6 indicator bacterial species, i.e.: S. aureus, E. coli, E. faecium/faecalis, Str. pneumoniae, Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae. Romania reported data to EARSS since 2002 so far. Though the number of participating laboratories increased progressively from 12 to 35, the number of hospitals which reported for EARSS. as the number of strains included in the data base remained steady and relatively low. This issue is related to the particular position of Romania in the European context, in respect of the very low number of blood cultures performed in hospitals. Our paper is presenting the trends of antimicrobial resistance in the indicator strains in the 2002-2008 interval. During the 2002-2008 interval, Romania reported to EARSS a total number of 1276 bacterial strains, distributed by species as follows: 513 S aureus, 369 E. coli, 128 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 127 Enterococcus spp.. 71 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 68 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were reported, according to the EARSS protocol, only for the 2005-2008 interval. It is difficult to describe trends, specially in Enterococcus, Streptococcus pneumonaie and the 2 species collected only since 2005, because of the low number of isolates, but there are several results that are supporting us to claim that antimicrobial resistance in invasive isolates is a real problem in Romanian hospitals, like in other Central, Southern and South Eastern European countries: more than 25% of S. aureus strains resistant to methicilline, with more than 50% in some years, high aminoglycozides resistance in more than 70-80% of Enterococcus faecium invasive strains, more than 80% of strains resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines etc.
TI  - [Antibiotic resistance of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibiotic resistance evaluation of Gram-positive cocci isolated in 2008. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed for 1044 strains: 610 Staphylococcus aureus (352 from patients, 258 from carriers), 203 Streptococcus pneumoniae (53 from patients, 150 from carriers), 144 Enterococcus faecalis. 57 Enterococcus faecium and 30 Streptococcus spp. using automatic systems Vitek 2 Compact. MicroScan, disc diffusion method and Etest according to 2008 CLSI. A number of 497 Streptococcus pyogenes strains were tested for eritromycin resistance. RESULTS: There were 33.2% MRSA for strains isolated from patients and 30.0% from carriers. From MRSA strains. 35.5% were resistant to gentamicin. 33.6% to ciprofloxacin, 74.3% to erythromycin and 30.5% to rifampin. There were no S. aureus strain resistant to vancomycin and linezolid. S. aureus strains isolated from wounds were more resistant to erythromycin (43.9%) than the strains isolated from systemic infections (12.1%). From 11 S. pneumoniae strains isolated from meningitis, 4 were resistant to penicillin. Neither S. pneumoniae strain isolated from other infections, nor those from carriers had MIC to penicillin more than 4 microg/ml. S. pneumoniae strains isolated from carriers were more resistant to erythromycin. clindamycin and tetracycline than the strains isolated from patients (66.7%, 54.1%, 54.2% vs. 27.4%, 22.6%, 33.9%). E. faecium was 95.9% resistant to penicillin, 90.2% to ampicillin, 64.7% to gentamicin, 72.0% to streptomycin and 78.4% to ciprofloxacin. F. faecalis was less resistant than E. faecium at most of the antibiotics: 32.4% to gentamicin, 59.6% to streptomycin, 28.5% to ciprofloxacin. Viridans group Streptococci, all isolated from blood culture were 92% susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin. To erythromycin, 12% of viridians group Streptococci were resistant. S. pyogenes resistance to eritromycin was 5.8%. CONCLUSIONS: S. aureus strains showed a relatively high level of resistance to oxacillin (33.2%) and resistance in the same time to several antibiotics. S. pneumoniae can not be considered resistant to penicillin administrated parenteral, with exception of the strains isolated from meningitis. E. faecium had a higher resistance rate than E. faecalis.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and linezolid against Gram-positive organisms collected between 2004 and 2009.
AB  - This study reports the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline and comparator antimicrobials, including linezolid, against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium collected as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) between 2004 and 2009. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined using broth microdilution methodology according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined according to CLSI criteria. For tigecycline, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved criteria were used. Overall, 41.3% (8249/19 982) of S. aureus collected were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). All MRSA were susceptible to linezolid and 99.98% were susceptible to tigecycline. A total of 2.3% of E. faecalis (201/8576) and 39.7% of E. faecium (1226/3088) were vancomycin-resistant. Linezolid and tigecycline MIC(90) values (MIC at which 90% of isolates inhibited) against the Enterococcus spp. were 2mg/L and </= 0.25 mg/L, respectively. All S. pneumoniae [including 6.2% (599/9618) penicillin-non-susceptible] were susceptible to linezolid and vancomycin; tigecycline MIC(90) values were </= 0.12 mg/L. This report demonstrates the continuing good activity of tigecycline and linezolid against Gram-positive isolates globally, including resistant organisms such as MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, with antimicrobial activity maintained over the 6 years of isolate collection.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  - Wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. It is therefore imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at West Virginia University Hospital. Standardised corrected zones of inhibition (CZOIs) were performed on all clinical isolates. It was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. In particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of Candida albicans and yeasts with CZOI of 3-11.5 mm. All meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a CZOI range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. Sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. CZOIs of 4.25 mm were calculated for Enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. The bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and Candida albicans. No antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by Kirby Bauer Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute classification system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. When a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. Overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. This finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. Consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.
TI  - Linezolid, the first oxazolidinone antibacterial agent.
AB  - Linezolid (Zyvox) is the first member of an entirely new class of antibiotics to  reach the market in over 35 years; it was approved for use in 2000. A member of the oxazolidinone class of antibiotics, linezolid is highly effective for the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections and has activity that compares favorably with vancomycin for most clinically relevant pathogens. Zyvox is approved for use against serious Gram-positive infections, including those caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the very challenging methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium organisms. Zyvox inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to 23S rRNA in the catalytic site of the 50S ribosome. It can be administered both orally and intravenously and has good tissue distribution. Recent results have demonstrated that oxazolidinone analogs related to linezolid are effective in treating pulmonary tuberculosis caused by resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis in animal infection models and suggest additional new therapeutic applications for these antibiotics.
TI  - [Antimicrobial susceptibility of clinical isolates of aerobic Gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria in 2006].
AB  - The activity of antibacterial agents against aerobic Gram-positive cocci (26 species, 1022 strains) and anaerobic bacteria (23 species, 184 strains) isolated from clinical specimens in 2006 at 16 clinical facilities in Japan were studied using either broth microdilution or agar dilution method. The ratio of methicillin-resistant strains among Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 53.0% and 65.8%, suggesting that resistant strains were isolated at high frequency. Vancomycin (VCM) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (QPR/DPR) had good antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, with MIC90s of < or = 2 micrcog/mL. The ratio of penicillin (PC) intermediate and resistant strains classified by mutations of PC-binding proteins among Streptococcus pneumoniae was 87.6%. Ceftriaxone, cefpirome, cefepime, carbapenem antibiotics, VCM, teicoplanin, linezolid(LZD) and QPR/DPR had MIC90s of < or = 1 microg/mL against PC-intermediate and resistant S. pneumoniae strains. Against all strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, the MICs of VCM and TEIC were under 2 microg/mL, and no resistant strain was detected, suggesting that these agents had excellent activities against these species. 10.9% of E. faecalis strains or 3.5% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to LZD. 24.4% of E. faecium strains showed intermediate or resistant to QPR/DPR. Against all strains of Clostridium difficile, the MIC of VCM were under 1 microg/mL, suggesting that VCM had excellent activity against C. difficile. Carbapenems showed good activity against Peptococcaceae, Bacteroides spp., and Prevotella spp. However since several strains of Bacteroides fragilis showed resistant to carbapenems and the susceptibility of this species should be well-focused in the future.
TI  - Streptococcus
AB  - The genus Streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of Gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. Various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. Among the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. Streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. The nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. For several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: S pyogenes (group A streptococci) and S pneumoniae (pneumococci). In 1984, two members were assigned a new genus - the group D enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became Enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and E faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). In recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. A variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. Some of the other medically important streptococci are S agalactiae (group B), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease; E faecalis (group D), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. Particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. Important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include S mutans and S sanguis (involved in dental caries), S mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "S milleri" (associated with suppurative infections in children and adults). There remains persistent taxonomic confusion regarding "S milleri." These and other streptococci of medical importance are listed inTable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.
TI  - Spectrum of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias after liver transplantation: implications for management.
AB  - Bacteremia is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation. The characterization of the microbiological spectrum of bacteremia after liver transplantation may help physicians in choosing the initial empirical antimicrobial therapy for patients presenting with sepsis. The clinical and microbiology records of patients who received liver transplantation from January 1997 to March 2006 were reviewed. One hundred twenty-three of the 737 liver recipients (16.7%) developed bacteremia during the median follow-up period of 5.8 years (interquartile range = 2.5-8.8 years); 92 patients (12.5%) had gram-positive bacteremia (GPB), whereas 47 (6.4%) had gram-negative bacteremia (GNB). Nosocomial bacteremia was significantly more frequent among patients with early-onset GPB or GNB versus patients with late-onset GPB (66.7% versus 23.7%, P < 0.001) or GNB (70.6% versus 20.0%, P = 0.001). Peritonitis (33.3% versus 7.9%, P = 0.004) and wound infections (13.0% versus 0%, P = 0.04) as sources were more common in patients with early-onset GPB versus patients with late-onset GPB. Likewise, peritonitis was a more common source of early-onset GNB than late-onset GNB (41.2% versus 6.7%, P = 0.007). Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GPB, whereas Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus species were most common in patients with late-onset GPB. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and anaerobes were the most common pathogens in patients with early-onset GNB, whereas Escherichia coli was most common in patients with late-onset GNB. In conclusion, the microbiological spectra of early-onset and late-onset bacteremias differ, and this should be considered by those determining the initial empirical treatment of liver transplant recipients suspected to have bacteremias.
TI  - Probiotic assessment of Enterococcus faecalis CP58 isolated from human gut.
AB  - A total of seventy lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from the faeces of healthy humans and their identities were confirmed by sequencing of their 16S rDNA genes. Of these only 5 isolates were found to resist bile salts and indicated survival in the simulated in vitro digestion assay which reproduces the stomach and intestinal digestion indicating their tolerance to gastric enzymes and the low pH conditions. Species that showed the best resistance to these conditions were: Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus sp., uncultured bifidobacteria, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus anginosus. These strains were investigated further to study their capacity to adhere to human intestinal Caco-2 cells. E. faecalis was the most adherent strain. Examination of the virulence determinants for this strain indicated that it was positive for efaAfs, gelE, agg, cpd, cob, ccf and cad, a profile that is similar to that of many E. faecalis isolates from food sources. The cytolysin biosynthetic genes cylA, cylB and cylM that are more associated with the clinical isolates of E. faecium were not detected in this strain. The antibiotic susceptibility tests indicated that the strain was sensitive to vancomycin, tetracycline, rifampicin and erythromycin but resistant only to kanamycin and chloramphenicol. These data suggest that the strain E. faecalis CP58 may be tested further for beneficial properties and developed as a new probiotic.
TI  - Phenotypic and genotypic analyses of lactic acid bacteria in local fermented food, breast milk and faeces of mothers and their babies.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are generally accepted as beneficial to the host and their presence is directly influenced by ingestion of fermented food or probiotics. While the intestinal lactic microbiota is well-described knowledge on its routes of inoculation and competitiveness towards selective pressure shaping the intestinal microbiota is limited. In this study, LAB were isolated from faecal samples of breast feeding mothers living in Syria, from faeces of their infants, from breast milk as well as from fermented food, typically consumed in Syria. A total of 700 isolates were characterized by genetic fingerprinting with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and identified by comparative 16S rDNA sequencing and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) analyses. Thirty six different species of Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Weissella and Pediococcus were identified. RAPD and MALDI-TOF-MS patterns allowed comparison of the lactic microbiota on species and strain level. Whereas some species were unique for one source, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus fermentum, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus brevis were found in all sources. Interestingly, identical RAPD genotypes of L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and P. pentosaceus were found in the faeces of mothers, her milk and in faeces of her babies. Diversity of RAPD types found in food versus human samples suggests the importance of host factors in colonization and individual host specificity, and support the hypothesis that there is a vertical transfer of intestinal LAB from the mother's gut to her milk and through the milk to the infant's gut.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - Prevalence of hospital-acquired enterococci infections in two primary-care hospitals in osogbo, southwestern Nigeria.
AB  - Enterococci are opportunistic bacteria that become pathogenic when they colonize  niches where they are not normally found. Of recent, they have become major cause of nosocomial infections, especially of the bloodstream, urinary tract and surgical sites. The aim of this study is to determine the point-prevalence rate of human enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in Osogbo, Nigeria. The study was conducted between January and June 2009 in two primary-care hospitals in Osogbo and involved a total of 118 patients who developed clinical evidence of infection at least 48 hours after hospital admission. Appropriate clinical samples were collected from the patients after an informed consent and cultured for isolation/biochemical identification of Enterococcus species at the Bacteriology Laboratory of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology, Osogbo using standard microbiological methods. There were 525 hospital admissions within the time frame of the study of which 118 (22.5%) developed hospital acquired infection (HAI); 58 (49.2%) of which cultured positive for bacterial pathogens. Enterococci were isolated from infective focus in 7 patients, giving a prevalence rate of hospital-acquired enterococci infection of 5.9%. Two species of Enterococcus were identified; Enterococcus faecalis from urinary tract infection (UTI) and surgical site infection (SSI) of 6 (85.7%) patients and Enterococcus faecium from UTI in 1 (14.3%) patient. Other bacteria recovered from other infective foci were Klebsiella spp 31.0%, Pseudomonas spp 20.7%, Staphylococcus aureus 17.2%, Escherichia coli 12.1%, Staphylococcus epidermidis 3.4%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 1.7% and Serratia spp 1.7%. All the enterococci isolates were multiply antibiotic resistant, and 42.9% were vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) with the VRE strains showing resistance to wider range of antibiotics than the vancomycin-sensitive strains. Other Gram-positive and Gram negative bacterial isolates also demonstrated multiple resistance to all commonly available antibiotics in this community except E. coli and Pseudomonas spp which were relatively sensitive to ciprofloxacin and ceftazidime. This limited study demonstrated a high prevalence rate of multiple antibiotic resistant enterococci infections among hospitalized patients in this environment. There is need for systematic surveillance of hospitals for enterococci infections; prudent use and rational prescription of antibiotics and stringent measures to reduce the prevalence rate by health education on infection control measures such as isolation, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization.
TI  - Telavancin Activity against gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with skin and skin-structure infections.
AB  - Telavancin is approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) in adults caused by susceptible Gram-positive organisms. The antimicrobial activity of telavancin and comparators was evaluated against 5,027 (2007-2008) Gram-positive bacteria responsible for SSSI in medical centers in Asia-Pacific, European, Latin American, and North American regions. Telavancin was active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.12/0.25 mg/l). telavancin inhibited all Enterococcus faecalis, including four strains displaying a VanB phenotype, at </= 1 mg/L (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.25/0.5 mg/l), except for two isolates with a VanA phenotype (MIC, >2 mg/l). Vancomycin-susceptible and VanB vancomycin-resistant E. faecium were inhibited by telavancin at </= 0.25 mg/L, while this drug exhibited elevated MIC values (>/= 0.5 mg/l) against E. faecium of VanA phenotype (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 2/>2 mg/l). Telavancin was potent against beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.12 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(5)(0)(/)(9)(0), 0.03/0.06 mg/l; 100.0% susceptible). These in vitro data document the activity of telavancin against contemporary Gram-positive isolates and support its clinical use for the treatment of cSSSI caused by the indicated pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - FTIR-based polyphasic identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Greek Graviera cheese.
AB  - This study used a combination of phenotypic, physical (Fourier Transformed Infra-Red [FTIR] spectroscopy) and molecular (RFLP and SSCP analysis of 16S rRNA genes) methods to identify the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) flora present in traditional Greek Graviera cheese after five weeks of ripening. A total of 300 isolates collected from high dilution plates of TSAYE (incubated at 30 degrees C), M-17 (22 degrees C) and M-17 (42 degrees C) agar media were clustered by FTIR and then representative strains of each cluster were cross-identified blindly by all methods. Based on their FTIR spectra, 282 isolates were LAB grouped in 28 clusters. The LAB species identified and their prevalence in the cheese samples were: Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (68.8%), Lactobacillus plantarum (19.5%), Streptococcus thermophilus (8.9%), Enterococcus faecium (2.1%), and Lactococcus lactis (0.7%). Also, Staphylococcus equorum (11 isolates), Corynebacterium sp. (5 isolates) and Brevibacterium sp. (1 isolate) were recovered from TSAYE. Comparative identification results showed that phenotypic and molecular methods were in mutual agreement as regards the LAB species identified. The present polyphasic identification approach based on rapid FTIR screening of 10-fold more isolates than a previous classical identification approach allowed or improved detection of few sub-dominant species; however the predominant LAB species in the cheese samples were the same with both approaches.
TI  - Telavancin activity against Gram-positive bacteria isolated from respiratory tract specimens of patients with nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The antimicrobial activity of telavancin against 2279 clinical Gram-positive cocci obtained from patients with nosocomial pneumonia [NP; including those with ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP)] located in numerous medical centres worldwide was evaluated. METHODS: A contemporary collection of 2279 non-duplicate consecutive Gram-positive clinical isolates were submitted from 87 hospitals located in North America (913 isolates), Latin America (222 isolates), Europe (690 isolates), and the Asia-Pacific region (454 isolates) as part of the international telavancin surveillance programme for 2007-08. Isolates were tested for susceptibility by the reference broth microdilution method (with 2%-5% lysed horse blood added for testing of streptococci). Interpretive criteria were those from CLSI (M100-S20, 2010) except for telavancin, for which the susceptible breakpoints approved by the US FDA were applied. RESULTS: Telavancin was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC(90), 0.25 mg/L; 100% susceptible), coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC(90), 0.25 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90), 0.03 mg/L), viridans group streptococci (MIC(90), 0.06 mg/L; 100% susceptible), beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(90), 0.06 mg/L; 100% susceptible) and vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90), 0.5 mg/L; 100% susceptible). Telavancin inhibited all staphylococci at </= 0.5 mg/L. Among enterococci non-susceptible to vancomycin (all Enterococcus faecium), telavancin was active against isolates exhibiting a VanB phenotype (MIC, 0.06-0.12 mg/L), but less potent against VanA strains (MIC, >/= 2 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin demonstrated equal or greater potency than the comparators (vancomycin, teicoplanin, daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin) against Gram-positive pathogens implicated in NP. Telavancin showed elevated MIC values only against enterococcus isolates showing a VanA phenotype. The continued appearance of multidrug-resistant pathogens among Gram-positive isolates, mainly S. aureus, necessitates the introduction of new agents and longitudinal surveillance to monitor for the potential emergence of resistance.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of non-thermal argon plasma in vitro, in biofilms and in the animal model of infected wounds.
AB  - Non-thermal (low-temperature) physical plasma is under intensive study as an alternative approach to control superficial wound and skin infections when the effectiveness of chemical agents is weak due to natural pathogen or biofilm resistance. The purpose of this study was to test the individual susceptibility of pathogenic bacteria to non-thermal argon plasma and to measure the effectiveness of plasma treatments against bacteria in biofilms and on wound surfaces. Overall, Gram-negative bacteria were more susceptible to plasma treatment than Gram-positive bacteria. For the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia and Escherichia coli, there were no survivors among the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. The susceptibility of Gram-positive bacteria was species- and strain-specific. Streptococcus pyogenes was the most resistant with 17 % survival of the initial 10(5) c.f.u. after a 5 min plasma treatment. Staphylococcus aureus had a strain-dependent resistance with 0 and 10 % survival from 10(5) c.f.u. of the Sa 78 and ATCC 6538 strains, respectively. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium had medium resistance. Non-ionized argon gas was not bactericidal. Biofilms partly protected bacteria, with the efficiency of protection dependent on biofilm thickness. Bacteria in deeper biofilm layers survived better after the plasma treatment. A rat model of a superficial slash wound infected with P. aeruginosa and the plasma-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strain Sa 78 was used to assess the efficiency of argon plasma treatment. A 10 min treatment significantly reduced bacterial loads on the wound surface. A 5-day course of daily plasma treatments eliminated P. aeruginosa from the plasma-treated animals 2 days earlier than from the control ones. A statistically significant increase in the rate of wound closure was observed in plasma-treated animals after the third day of the course. Wound healing in plasma-treated animals slowed down after the course had been completed. Overall, the results show considerable potential for non-thermal argon plasma in eliminating pathogenic bacteria from biofilms and wound surfaces.
TI  - The effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LAT 187, Lactobacillus acidophilus LAT 180, Lactobacillus helveticus LAT 179, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis LAT 182, Streptococcus thermophilus LAT 205 and Enterococcus faecium E 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. Chickens were divided into three groups (C, control; E1 and E2, experimental groups). Experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. Probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. In the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. Total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. Serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. Probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.
TI  - Worldwide summary of telavancin spectrum and potency against Gram-positive pathogens: 2007 to 2008 surveillance results.
AB  - Telavancin was approved in the United States and Canada for the treatment of adult patients with complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI) caused by susceptible Gram-positive isolates. In this study, telavancin and comparator antimicrobial activities were determined against a total of 24,017 clinical isolates, including Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. (CoNS), Enterococcus spp., and various Streptococcus spp. Overall, telavancin was highly active across all geographic regions for S. aureus (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), CoNS (MIC(50/90), 0.12/0.25 microg/mL), vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.12 microg/mL), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(50/90), < or =0.015/0.03 microg/mL), viridans group Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.06 microg/mL; 100.0% susceptible), and beta-hemolytic Streptococcus spp. (MIC(50/90), 0.03/0.12 microg/mL; 99.8% susceptible). Telavancin had potent activity against vancomycin-nonsusceptible, teicoplanin-susceptible (VanB) E. faecalis (MIC(50/90), 0.25/0.5 microg/mL) and E. faecium (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.25 microg/mL). These in vitro results show continued activity for telavancin, which represents an important alternative available for treating cSSSI.
TI  - Microbial stability and safety of traditional Greek Graviera cheese: characterization of the lactic acid bacterial flora and culture-independent detection of bacteriocin genes in the ripened cheeses and their microbial consortia.
AB  - The microflora of four batches of traditional Greek Graviera cheese was studied at 5 weeks of ripening, and 200 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolates were phenotypically characterized and screened for antilisterial bacteriocins. The cheeses were also analyzed for organic acids by high-performance liquid chromatography and for the potential presence of 25 known LAB bacteriocin genes directly in cheese and their microbial consortia by PCR. All batches were safe according to the European Union regulatory criteria for Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, enterobacteria, and coagulase-positive staphylococci. The cheese flora was dominated by nonstarter Lactobacillus casei/paracasei (67.5%) and Lactobacillus plantarum (16.3%) strains, whereas few Streptococcus thermophilus (3.8%), Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (0.6%), and Leuconostoc (1.9%) organisms were present. Enterococcus faecium (9.4%) and Enterococcus durans (0.6%) were isolated among the dominant LAB from two batches; however, enterococci were present in all batches at 10- to 100-fold lower populations than mesophilic lactobacilli. Sixteen E. faecium isolates produced antilisterial enterocins. In accordance, enterocin B gene was detectable in all cheeses and enterocin P gene was present in one cheese, whereas the consortia of all cheeses contained at least two of the enterocin A, B, P, 31, L50A, and L50B genes. Plantaricin A gene was also amplified from all cheeses. Mean concentrations of lactic, acetic, citric, and propionic acids in the ripened cheeses exceeded 1.5% in total, of which approximately 0.9% was lactate. Thus, organic acid contents constitute an important hurdle factor for inhibiting growth of pathogens in traditional Graviera cheese products, with LAB bacteriocins, mainly enterocins, potentially contributing to increased cheese safety.
TI  - Detection of human intestinal catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - An analytical system based on rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) for enumeration of catalase-negative, Gram-positive cocci was established. Subgroup- or species-specific primer sets targeting 16S or 23S rRNA from Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactococcus were newly developed. The RT-qPCR method using these primers together with the previously reported primer sets specific for the Enterococcus genus, the Streptococcus genus, and several Streptococcus species was found to be able to quantify the target populations with detection limits of 10(3) to 10(4) cells per gram feces, which was more than 100 times as sensitive as the qPCR method (10(6) to 10(8) cells per gram feces). The RT-qPCR analysis of fecal samples from 24 healthy adult volunteers using the genus-specific primer sets revealed that Enterococcus and Streptococcus were present as intestinal commensals at population levels of log(10) 6.2 +/- 1.4 and 7.5 +/- 0.9 per gram feces (mean +/- standard deviation [SD]), respectively. Detailed investigation using species- or subgroup-specific primer sets revealed that the volunteers harbored unique Enterococcus species, including the E. avium subgroup, the E. faecium subgroup, E. faecalis, the E. casseliflavus subgroup, and E. caccae, while the dominant human intestinal Streptococcus species was found to be S. salivarius. Various Lactococcus species, such as L. lactis subsp. lactis or L. lactis subsp. cremoris, L. garvieae, L. piscium, and L. plantarum, were also detected but at a lower population level (log(10) 4.6 +/- 1.2 per gram feces) and prevalence (33%). These results suggest that the RT-qPCR method enables the accurate and sensitive enumeration of human intestinal subdominant but still important populations, such as Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Interpretive reading of the antibiogram in gram positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to the expression of the mecA gene, and involves resistance to all beta-lactams, with the exception of the new cephalosporins, ceftobiprole and ceftaroline. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. For macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramins B, (MLS(B)) the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences in the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been described, as well as highly-vancomycin-resistant isolates (vanA isolates). In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, due to mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to MLS(B) in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is mainly related to mutations in parC/parE (low level) and in gyrA. It is important to detect low level resistance due to its clinical implications. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic low-level resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (high-level resistance) became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in Spain, but nosocomial outbreaks due to vanA enterococci and case reports due to vanB2 enterococci have been recently reported.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from  marketed foods and drugs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the antimicrobial resistance of commercial lactic acid bacteria present in microbial foods and drug additives by analyzing their isolated strains used for fermentation and probiotics. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility of 41 screened isolates was tested with disc diffusion and E-test methods after species-level identification. Resistant strains were selected and examined for the presence of resistance genes by PCR. RESULTS: Distribution of resistance was found in different species. All isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cephalothin, and imipenem. In addition, isolates resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin, streptomycin, bacitracin, and erythromycin were detected, although the incidence of resistance to these antibiotics was relatively low. In contrast, most strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, amikacin, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, and gentamycin. The genes msrC, vanX, and dfrA were detected in strains of Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Lactococcus lactis. CONCLUSION: Antibiotic resistance is present in different species of probiotic strains, which poses a threat to food safety. Evaluation of the safety of lactic acid bacteria for human consumption should be guided by established criteria, guidelines and regulations.
TI  - NXL-103, a combination of flopristin and linopristin, for the potential treatment of bacterial infections including community-acquired pneumonia and MRSA.
AB  - Novexel is developing the novel, orally active, semisynthetic streptogramin NXL-103, which has potential therapeutic application in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, community- or hospital-acquired MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus, and acute bacterial skin and soft tissue infections. NXL-103 is a combination of streptogramin A:streptogramin B components, initially developed in a 70:30 dose ratio. In multiple in vitro studies, NXL-103 demonstrated potent activity against different types of bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. NXL-103 was not affected by the resistance profiles of bacteria against other commonly used antibiotics. In phase I clinical trials, NXL-103 achieved bactericidal levels in plasma and was generally well tolerated, with side effects primarily on the gastrointestinal system. The first phase II trial conducted to evaluate the efficacy of NXL-103 against community-acquired pneumonia revealed that the compound was comparable with amoxicillin. NXL-103 has promise to become an important agent in the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and complex skin and soft tissue infections, pending further development.
TI  - Speciation of Gram-positive bacteria in fresh and ambient-stored sub-tropical marine fish.
AB  - This study identified Gram-positive bacteria in three sub-tropical marine fish species; Pseudocaranx dentex (silver trevally), Pagrus auratus (snapper) and Mugil cephalus (sea mullet). It further elucidated the role played by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage on the composition of the Gram-positive bacteria. A total of 266 isolates of Gram-positive bacteria were identified by conventional biochemical methods, VITEK, PCR using genus- and species-specific primers and/or 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolates were found to fall into 13 genera and 30 species. In fresh fish, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Micrococcus luteus were the most frequent isolates. After ambient storage, S. epidermidis, S. xylosus and Bacillus megaterium were no longer present whereas S. warneri, B. sphaericus, Brevibacillus borstelensis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus uberis increased in frequency. Micrococcus luteus and S. warneri were the most prevalent isolates from P. dentex, while E. faecium and Strep. uberis were the most frequent isolates from P. auratus and M. cephalus. With respect to different parts of the fish body, E. faecium, Strep. uberis and B. sphaericus were the most frequent isolates from the muscles, E. faecium, Strep. uberis from the gills and M. luteus from the gut. This study showed a diversity of Gram-positive bacteria in sub-tropical marine fish; however, their abundance was affected by fish habitat, fish body part and ambient storage.
TI  - Susceptibility to tigecycline of isolates from samples collected in hospitalized  patients with secondary peritonitis undergoing surgery.
AB  - Activity of tigecycline against nosocomial secondary peritonitis isolates collected along 18 months in 29 Spanish hospitals was tested by Etest in a central laboratory, considering Food and Drug Administration (FDA)/British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC)/European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. A total of 600 facultative/aerobic isolates (392 Gram negative, 208 Gram positive) and 100 anaerobes were tested. None of the 220 Escherichia coli isolates was resistant to tigecycline (MIC(50)/MIC(90) = 0.25/0.5 microg/mL), with 0.5% (FDA breakpoint) and 3.6% (BSAC/EUCAST breakpoint) intermediate strains. All Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli isolates (15 strains), all Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca isolates (42 strains) were susceptible to tigecycline. No isolates resistant to tigecycline were found among Streptococcus viridans, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecium, but 18.9% of Enterococcus faecalis strains were intermediate following BSAC/EUCAST breakpoints. All (but 1) isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 45) were tigecycline susceptible, as well as Gram-positive anaerobes. Tigecycline offers an adequate activity profile against isolates from secondary peritonitis when tested by Etest regardless of the breakpoints used for categorization.
TI  - New antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  - The optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. We herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. The newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.
TI  - [Update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  - There is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics in clinical practice. As observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. For instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. In fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium). Therefore, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. Even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for Gram-positive infections. This review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in France (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).
TI  - Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum program: linezolid surveillance program results for 2008.
AB  - The seventh year of the Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program (2008) continues to monitor the in vitro activities of linezolid and comparator agents tested against Gram-positive pathogens in Latin America, Europe, Canada, and the Asia-Pacific region. Linezolid is an oxazolidinone approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, and nosocomial pneumonia caused by various Gram-positive species including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Surveillance isolates were submitted from 64 medical centers (24 countries) for a total of 6121 strains. Each country was requested to send 200 consecutive isolates in 6 targeted pathogen categories to a central processing laboratory, except the United Kingdom, Japan, and China where more strains were processed (400, 400, and 800, respectively). Reference broth microdilution susceptibility testing methods were used to test the following organism groups: S. aureus (3240), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (748), enterococci (864), Streptococcus pneumoniae (655), viridans group (297), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (317). Eight linezolid-resistant (LZD-R) isolates were detected in 7 countries (Italy [2], France, China, Brazil, Sweden, Germany, and United Kingdom) among the enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis [3] and E. faecium [2]) and CoNS (3 Staphylococcus epidermidis). Five LZD-R isolates contained 23S rRNA mutations (G2576T or G2447T), and 2 strains had undeterminable resistance mechanisms. One CoNS (Italy) contained the mobile cfr gene. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci rates ranged from 0.0% in several countries to 59.4% in Taiwan. All streptococci were linezolid susceptible (MIC(90), 1 microg/mL). In conclusion, the activity of linezolid remained uniform and stable across the sampled geographic regions studied when compared to the 2006 to 2007 results. Documented LZD-R remains rare (only 0.13% overall but highest for CoNS [0.41%] and enterococci [0.69%]) among the 24 countries sampled for the 6 different pathogen groups. Rates of clindamycin resistance and the frequency of MRSA varied by geographic region and between nations; therefore, like oxazolidinones, it requires continued surveillance for changing resistance patterns.
TI  - Linezolid surveillance program results for 2008 (LEADER Program for 2008).
AB  - The LEADER Program was initiated in 2004 and monitors emerging linezolid resistance in sampled US medical centers. This report summarizes the data obtained in 2008, the 5th consecutive year. A total of 57 institutions participated in 2008 representing all 9 US census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6113 isolates, 101.9% compliance to protocol design). The organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were Staphylococcus aureus (3156), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS; 856), enterococci (901), Streptococcus pneumoniae (619), and viridans group (223) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (358); also, D-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with MIC(90) results ranging from 1 microg/mL (streptococci and CoNS) to 2 microg/mL (Staphylococcus aureus and enterococci). Only 0.36% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, a slight decrease from 0.45% and 0.44% in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The nonsusceptible strains (22) were Staphylococcus aureus (3), CoNS (14), and Enterococcus faecium (5) each with defined target mutations (G2576T in 19 strains; T2504A in 1 strain), mobile cfr element (1 strain Staphylococcus epidermidis with an identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern to a cfr-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from the same center in LEADER 2007), or an unknown (1 strain) mechanism. The mobile cfr resistance found in a Staphylococcus aureus strain in 2007 was not observed in 2008. In conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 5th year of this LEADER Program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.64% susceptibility levels). The nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable and the plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism that emerged in Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains in 2007 showed no evidence of dissemination or increased prevalence. However, there was evidence of cfr persistence with the S. epidermidis strain. The LEADER Program continues to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect and monitor novel oxazolidinone resistance phenotypes and genotypes.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel non-fluorinated quinolone,  against clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes in Taiwan.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the in vitro activities of nemonoxacin against Gram-positive cocci with various resistance phenotypes. METHODS: MICs of nemonoxacin were determined for 798 recently collected (2005-07) and non-duplicate isolates of Gram-positive cocci by the agar dilution method. These isolates included: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 100); methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), including ciprofloxacin-susceptible (n = 50), ciprofloxacin-resistant (n = 100), vancomycin-intermediate (n = 50) and daptomycin-non-susceptible (DNS-MRSA; n = 5) isolates, and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA; n = 101); invasive Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (n = 150); levofloxacin-non-susceptible (MICs of 4-64 mg/L) S. pneumoniae isolates (n = 30); and enterococci (n = 212), including vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE; n = 112). RESULTS: Nemonoxacin had potent activity against MSSA (MIC(90) of < or =0.03 mg/L), ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA (MIC(90) of < or =0.03 mg/L) and CA-MRSA (MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/L). For all invasive S. pneumoniae isolates, the activity of nemonoxacin (MIC(90) of 0.06 mg/L) was similar to that of gemifloxacin and much better than that of levofloxacin (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L) and moxifloxacin (MIC(90) of 0.25 mg/L). Nemonoxacin had a 32- to 64-fold higher activity than levofloxacin against levofloxacin-non-susceptible isolates. Nemonoxacin exerted limited activity against ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA (MIC(90) of 1 mg/L), vancomycin-intermediate MRSA (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L), DNS-MRSA (MIC(90) of 1 mg/L), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90) of 2 mg/L for Enterococcus faecalis and 4 mg/L for Enterococcus faecium) and VRE (MIC(90) of 4 mg/L for E. faecalis and 16 mg/L for E. faecium). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings point to a potentially useful role for nemonoxacin in the treatment of infections caused by MSSA, ciprofloxacin-susceptible MRSA and S. pneumoniae with various resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Inhibiting effects of Enterococcus faecium non-biofilm strain on Streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Enterococcus faecium is a normal bowel commensal and lactic acid bacterium that is rarely found in the oral cavity. This study investigated whether a non-pathogenic and non-biofilm strain of E. faecium functioned as a probiotic strain toward biofilm formation by Streptococcus mutans, which is an etiological agent for dental caries. METHODS: The effects of E. faecium on streptococcal biofilm was evaluated by absorbance of safranin-stained biofilm at 492 nm in a 96-well microtiter plate. RESULTS: The E. faecium strain demonstrated cell-number-dependent inhibition of biofilm in dual cultures with 4 laboratory and 16 clinical S. mutans strains, as well as laboratory strains of Streptococcus sobrinus and Streptococcus sanguinis, in 96-well microtiter plates. The inhibiting effects of E. faecium were not dependent on the production of bacteriocin from streptococci and E. faecium, low pH after mix culture, or biofilm formation levels of S. mutans. A culture supernatant sample of more than 10 kDa from E. faecium showed direct inhibiting effects toward S. mutans biofilm formation. Treatment of heat, butanol, and phenol to a supernatant sample restored biofilm formation in culture of S. mutans with the sample. Moreover, the tendencies of inhibition levels by the supernatant sample were associated with those by bacterial cells of E. faecium to S. mutans strains. CONCLUSIONS: The E. faecium non-biofilm strain produced an inhibiting protein to streptococci biofilm formation, showed various susceptibilities to inhibit streptococcal biofilm, and acted as a probiotic bacterial inhibitor of streptococcal biofilm formation.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity profile of oritavancin against recent gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - Oritavancin activity was tested against 15,764 gram-positive isolates collected from 246 hospital centers in 25 countries between 2005 and 2008. Organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9,075), coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1,664), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1,738), Enterococcus faecium (n = 819), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 959), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 415), group C, G, and F streptococci (n = 84), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,010). Among the evaluated staphylococci, 56.7% were resistant to oxacillin. The vancomycin resistance rate among enterococci was 21.2%. Penicillin-resistant and -intermediate rates were 14.7% and 21.4%, respectively, among S. pneumoniae isolates. Among nonpneumococcal streptococci, 18.5% were nonsusceptible to erythromycin. Oritavancin showed substantial in vitro activity against all organisms tested, regardless of resistance profile. The maximum oritavancin MIC against all staphylococci tested (n = 10,739) was 4 microg/ml; the MIC(90) against S. aureus was 0.12 microg/ml. Against E. faecalis and E. faecium, oritavancin MIC(90)s were 0.06 and 0.12, respectively. Oritavancin was active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci, including VanA strains (n = 486), with MIC(90)s of 0.25 and 1 microg/ml against VanA E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Oritavancin showed potent activity against streptococci (n = 2,468); MIC(90)s for the different streptococcal species were between 0.008 and 1 microg/ml. These data are consistent with previous studies with respect to resistance rates of gram-positive isolates and demonstrate the spectrum and in vitro activity of oritavancin against a wide variety of contemporary gram-positive pathogens, regardless of resistance to currently used drugs. The data provide a foundation for interpreting oritavancin activity and potential changes in susceptibility over time once oritavancin enters into clinical use.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - Identification of lactic acid bacteria isolated from Tarhana, a traditional Turkish fermented food.
AB  - Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt.
TI  - Main microorganisms involved in the fermentation of Ugandan ghee.
AB  - Ghee is widely produced from a traditional fermented butter-like product named mashita in western Uganda. However, no detailed studies have been done to identify the microorganisms involved in mashita fermentation. The aim of this study was to identify the microorganisms present at the end of mashita ripening using culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. The most commonly identified species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in mashita using culture-dependent techniques were Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus perolens constituting 37.3%, 10.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of total bacterial colonies isolated respectively. L. paracasei was the only bacterial species identified in all mashita samples by culture-dependent technique. Two of the four most commonly isolated LAB species (L. helveticus and L. plantarum) were also identified in mashita by a culture-independent method (PCR-DGGE). Other main LAB species identified in mashita by PCR-DGGE were Bifidobacterium sp., Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus acetotolerans, Lactobacillus sp., Lactococcus raffinolactis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Streptococcus salivarius. The main species of acetic acid bacteria (AAB) identified in the mashita using PCR-DGGE method were Acetobacter aceti, Acetobacter lovaniensis, Acetobacter orientalis and Acetobacter pasteurianus. PCR-DGGE identification of yeasts showed that Brettanomyces custersianus, Candida silvae, Geotrichum sp., Issatchenkia occidentalis, Issatchenkia orientalis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Trichosporon asahii were main yeast species in mashita. A. lovaniensis, A. aceti, and I. orientalis were identified in all the six mashita samples analyzed using PCR-DGGE method. Other microbial species were only found in some samples. These results indicate that LAB and yeasts, as in similar fermentation products, but also AAB are main microbial groups involved in mashita fermentation.
TI  - [In vitro activity of daptomycin and other antimicrobial agents against 499 strains of gram-positive cocci causing bloodstream infection].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, tigecycline, ceftobiprole and linezolid against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram-positive cocci. METHODS: Determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (MICs) of daptomycin with microbrothdilution method and the MICs of other 9 antimicrobial agents with agar dilution method against 499 strains of blood-isolated gram positive cocci was carried out. The data was analyzed with WHONET 5.4 software. RESULTS: The susceptibility rates of staphylococci to daptomycin, tigecycline, linezolid, ceftobiprole, vancomycin and teicoplanin were 100%. All staphylococcus strains were inhibited by daptomycin at a MIC of 1 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 0.5 mg/L against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus coagulase-negative (MRSCoN). Among Enterococcus spp, the highest MIC of daptomycin was 4 mg/L. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of daptomycin were both 2 mg/L against E.faecalis, whereas they were 2 mg/L and 4 mg/L against E.faecium. One strains of linezolid-resistant E.faecalis (MIC: 8 mg/L) was susceptible to daptomycin (MIC: 1 mg/L). Three strains of E.faecium carrying vanA gene with vancomycin MICs above 32 mg/L and teicoplanin MICs also 32 mg/L were susceptible to daptomycin, tigecycline and linezolid. The MIC range of daptomycin against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus viridans was 0.032 - 0.25 mg/L and 0.125 - 1.000 mg/L separately. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin has excellent in vitro activity against common gram-positive pathogens isolated from blood. It may be a good choice for clinicians to treat drug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo properties of dihydrophthalazine antifolates, a novel family of antibacterial drugs.
AB  - Racemic 2,4-diaminopyrimidine dihydrophthalazine derivatives BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 exhibited low in vitro MICs toward small, selected panels of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Mycobacterium avium, though the compounds were less active against Haemophilus influenzae. The constellation of dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) present in 20 enterococci and 40 staphylococci was analyzed and correlated with the antibacterial activities of the dihydrophthalazines and trimethoprim. DHFRs encoded by dfrB, dfrA (S1 isozyme), dfrE, and folA were susceptible to the dihydrophthalazines, whereas DHFRs encoded by dfrG (S3 isozyme) and dfrF were not. Studies with the separated enantiomers of BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 revealed preferential inhibition of susceptible DHFRs by the (R)-enantiomers. BAL0030543, BAL0030544, and BAL0030545 were well tolerated by mice during 5- and 10-day oral toxicity studies at doses of up to 400 mg/kg of body weight. Using a nonoptimized formulation, the dihydrophthalazines displayed acceptable oral bioavailabilities in mice, and efficacy studies with a septicemia model of mice infected with trimethoprim-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus gave 50% effective dose values in the range of 1.6 to 6.25 mg/kg.
TI  - Bacterial diversity of Darfiyeh, a Lebanese artisanal raw goat's milk cheese.
AB  - In order to contribute to the preservation of the Lebanese dairy heritage, the aim of this study was to characterize the Darfiyeh cheese, a traditional variety made from raw goat's milk and ripened in goat's skin. Three independent batches of Darfiyeh production were analyzed after 20, 40 and 60 days of ripening. Mesophilic lactobacilli, thermophilic coccal-shaped lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and thermophilic lactobacilli were enumerated. In order to explore the Darfiyeh natural ecosystem, a combination of phenotypical and molecular approaches was applied. The latter included Polymerase Chain Reaction-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE), classical PCR and quantitative PCR. These methods revealed the presence of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus malodoratus, group D Streptococcus sp., Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and L. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus curvatus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, Clostridium sp./Eubacterium tenue. Real-time PCR enabled quantification of E. faecium, with a detection of 10(7)-10(9) cfu g(-1) of product. The present molecular approaches combined with phenotypic method allowed describing the complex natural ecosystem of Darfiyeh, giving useful information for the preservation of Lebanese artisanal dairy products.
TI  - Assessment of the in vitro efficacy of the novel antimicrobial peptide CECT7121 against human Gram-positive bacteria from serious infections refractory to treatment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Resistant Gram-positive bacteria are causing increasing concern in clinical practice. This work investigated the efficacy of AP-CECT7121 (an antimicrobial peptide isolated from an environmental strain of Enterococcus faecalis CECT7121) against various pathogenic Gram-positive bacteria. METHODS: Strains were isolated from intensive care unit patients unresponsive to standard antibiotic treatments. Inhibitory activity of AP-CECT7121 was assessed using the agar-well diffusion method. The most resistant isolates from each species screened (Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis,Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile) were further examined in time-killing curve studies. RESULTS: These bactericidal kinetic experiments demonstrated a rapid killing effect with no viable bacteria being detected within 30 and 90 min for enterococcal and streptococcal strains and 180 min for community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus and C. perfringens: viable counts for C. difficile were threefold decreased after 90 min. CONCLUSIONS: AP-CECT7121 may provide a novel strategy for treating potentially fatal clinical infections in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Characterisation of thermotolerant cocci from indigenous flora of 'leben' in algerian arid area and DNA identification of atypical Lactococcus lactis strains.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are widely used in food industry and their growth performance is important for the quality of the fermented product. By combining results from conventional isolation methods and molecular investigation of 16S rRNA gene and lactococcal/enterococcal specific genes, we identify at species level catalase negative gram positive thermoresistant cocci isolated from traditional 'leben', a 24-h fermented milk in arid area of west Algeria. Forty strains phenotypically related to cocci LAB were identified as belonging to the species Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and other Enterococcus species. No Streptococcus thermophilus strain was isolated. Ten different phenotype groups were recognized, and the species content of these groups were in some cases different from the expected features usually given in genus and species descriptions. In particular, atypical lactococci, able to grow in 6.5% NaCl, at pH 9.5 and showing high resistance to thermal stresses were isolated. Lactococci, but also enterococci isolated from traditional 'leben' produced in the desert area, may be therefore of interest in milk fermentation. Further studies to assess this source of diversity within the wild microbial population should provide starter new strains for product innovation.
TI  - Prevalence of resistance phenotypes and genotypes to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics in Gram-positive cocci isolated in Tunisian Bone Marrow Transplant Center.
AB  - To investigate the prevalence of resistance to macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics in Gram-positive cocci isolated in a Bone Marrow Transplant Center of Tunisia, we tested the antibiotic susceptibility of 172 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus mitis and Enterococcus faecium to macrolide erythromycin and spiramycin, the lincosamide clindamycin and the streptogramin pristinamycin. These three groups of organisms were mostly resistant to macrolides and lincosamide, but were commonly susceptible to pristinamycin. The resistance phenotypes of erythromycin-resistant isolates were determined by the five-disc test with erythromycin, spiramycin, lincomycin, clindamycin and pristinamycin, which showed that most exhibited constitutive MLS resistance. In order to determine the prevalence of the resistance genotypes and the resistance mechanisms, the prevalence of the erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) (A), erm(B), erm(C), msr(A) and macrolide efflux (mef) (A) genes in the erythromycin-resistant isolates was identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The resistance was due mainly to the presence of ermB in E. faecium (80%), ermC in S. epidermidis (53%) and mefA in S. mitis (65%).
TI  - Global optimal eBURST analysis of multilocus typing data using a graphic matroid  approach.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) is a frequently used typing method  for the analysis of the clonal relationships among strains of several clinically relevant microbial species. MLST is based on the sequence of housekeeping genes that result in each strain having a distinct numerical allelic profile, which is abbreviated to a unique identifier: the sequence type (ST). The relatedness between two strains can then be inferred by the differences between allelic profiles. For a more comprehensive analysis of the possible patterns of evolutionary descent, a set of rules were proposed and implemented in the eBURST algorithm. These rules allow the division of a data set into several clusters of related strains, dubbed clonal complexes, by implementing a simple model of clonal expansion and diversification. Within each clonal complex, the rules identify which links between STs correspond to the most probable pattern of descent. However, the eBURST algorithm is not globally optimized, which can result in links, within the clonal complexes, that violate the rules proposed. RESULTS: Here, we present a globally optimized implementation of the eBURST algorithm - goeBURST. The search for a global optimal solution led to the formalization of the problem as a graphic matroid, for which greedy algorithms that provide an optimal solution exist. Several public data sets of MLST data were tested and differences between the two implementations were found and are discussed for five bacterial species: Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholderia pseudomallei, Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria spp.. A novel feature implemented in goeBURST is the representation of the level of tiebreak rule reached before deciding if a link should be drawn, which can used to visually evaluate the reliability of the represented hypothetical pattern of descent. CONCLUSION: goeBURST is a globally optimized implementation of the eBURST algorithm, that identifies alternative patterns of descent for several bacterial species. Furthermore, the algorithm can be applied to any multilocus typing data based on the number of differences between numeric profiles. A software implementation is available at http://goeBURST.phyloviz.net.
TI  - Ceftaroline: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftaroline is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSI), including those caused by meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Ceftaroline has the ability to bind to penicillin-binding protein (PBP)2a, an MRSA-specific PBP that has low affinity for most other beta-lactam antibacterials. The high binding affinity of ceftaroline to PBP2a (median inhibitory concentration 0.90 microg/mL) correlates well with its low minimum inhibitory concentration for MRSA. Ceftaroline is active in vitro against Gram-positive cocci, including MRSA, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (not E. faecium). The broad-spectrum activity of ceftaroline includes many Gram-negative pathogens but does not extend to extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing or AmpC-derepressed Enterobacteriaceae or most nonfermentative Gram-negative bacilli. Ceftaroline demonstrates limited activity against anaerobes such as Bacteroides fragilis and non-fragilis Bacteroides spp. Limited data show that ceftaroline has a low propensity to select for resistant subpopulations. Ceftaroline fosamil (prodrug) is rapidly converted by plasma phosphatases to active ceftaroline. For multiple intravenous doses of 600 mg given over 1 h every 12 hours for 14 days, the maximum plasma concentration was 19.0 microg/mL and 21.0 microg/mL for first and last dose, respectively. Ceftaroline has a volume of distribution of 0.37 L/kg (28.3 L), low protein binding (<20%) and a serum half-life of 2.6 hours. No drug accumulation occurs with multiple doses and elimination occurs primarily through renal excretion (49.6%). Based on Monte Carlo simulations, dosage adjustment is recommended for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30-50 mL/min); no adjustment is needed for mild renal impairment. Currently, limited clinical trial data are available for ceftaroline. A phase II study randomized 100 patients with cSSSI to intravenous ceftaroline 600 mg every 12 hours or intravenous vancomycin 1 g every 12 hours with or without intravenous aztreonam 1 g every 8 hours (standard therapy) for 7-14 days. Clinical cure rates were 96.7% for ceftaroline compared with 88.9% for standard therapy. Adverse events were similar between groups and generally mild in nature. In a phase III trial, 702 patients with cSSSI were randomized to ceftaroline 600 mg or vancomycin 1 g plus aztreonam 1 g, each administered intravenously every 12 hours for 5-14 days. Ceftaroline was noninferior to vancomycin plus aztreonam in treating cSSSI caused by both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Adverse event rates were similar between groups. Ceftaroline is well tolerated, which is consistent with the good safety and tolerability profile of the cephalosporin class. In summary, ceftaroline is a promising treatment for cSSSI and CAP, and has potential to be used as monotherapy for polymicrobial infections because of its broad-spectrum activity. Further clinical studies are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of ceftaroline, and to define its role in patient care.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: first cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftobiprole medocaril is the first member of a new series of advanced cephalosporins with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The drug received an approvable letter from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 2008 and from Health Canada in June 2008 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections including diabetic foot infections. Ceftobiprole exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) involved in cell wall synthesis. It has an established stability against hydrolysis by many gram-positive beta-lactamases and a higher affinity for various PBPs (such as PBP2a of MRSA or PBP2x of Streptococcus pneumoniae), which leads to a wider spectrum of activity compared with older beta-lactams. Ceftobiprole activity does not cover extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and some other pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium or Acinetobacter baumanii. Generally well tolerated, with nausea and taste disturbance being the most common adverse events, ceftobiprole appeared noninferior to empiric therapy in several clinical trials. Ceftobiprole is available only for intravenous administration; recommended dosage regimens have not been approved by the FDA as of this writing. However, based on the Canadian package insert, expected dosage recommendations are 500 mg as a 1-hour intravenous infusion every 12 hours for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections caused by certain gram-positive pathogens, and 500 mg as a 2-hour infusion every 8 hours when susceptible gram-negative or both gram-positive and susceptible gram-negative pathogens are involved. Dosage adjustments are indicated for patients with moderate or severe renal impairment, and dosage recommendations are expected to be 500 or 250 mg, respectively, as a 2-hour infusion every 12 hours. Several precautions regarding hypersensitivity and drug incompatibility are reported. Ceftobiprole represents a promising option for the treatment of mono- and polymicrobial infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and susceptible gram-negative pathogens, but further toxicity and safety studies are warranted.
TI  - [Identification of probiotic lactic acid bacteria strains].
AB  - The identification of 5 probiotic strains of lactic acid bacteria has been conducted by the method of analysis of physiological properties, API-testing as well as by molecular-genetic methods. It has been confirmed that 4 strains belong to Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus species. S. thermophilus strain has been reidentified as E. durans. The importance of clear identification of microorganism species which is used in probiotics has been demonstrated.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the TEST study in Europe (2004-2007).
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 European countries between 2004 and 2007. Tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most Gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the A. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (8.5% of E. coli) and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of K. pneumoniae). Only amikacin was active against >90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against Gram-positive agents across Europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected S. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the E. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the S. pneumoniae strains). Longitudinal analysis showed no increase in tigecycline MIC values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance was noted for several comparator agents.
TI  - Association of Streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  - The genus Streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only Streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, Streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, Streptococcus gallinaceus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. During investigations of the aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. Phenotypic characterization using the API20 STREP kit identified the isolates as Aerococcus viridans (10), Aerococcus urinae (2), Leuconostoc species (4), Streptococcus salivarius (2), Streptococcus bovis II 3 (1), Enterococcus avium (3), Enterococcus faecium (1) or Gemella morbillorum (1). However, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as Streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were E. avium (3), E. faecium (1) or Lactobacillus species (1). Misidentification by API20 STREP was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as S. pluranimalium. The isolates of S. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of SmaI-digested genomic DNA. The capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. Demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem tested against prevalent Gram-positive pathogens: results from a global surveillance study (2003-2007).
AB  - Doripenem is a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem recently approved in the United States for treatment of complicated urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections. Although pronounced doripenem antimicrobial activity against various Gram-negative pathogens, including anaerobes, has been confirmed, limited information has been forthcoming on the activity of this agent against leading Gram-positive species. We evaluated the activity of doripenem using reference broth microdilution procedures against a large collection of staphylococci, enterococci, and streptococci collected as part of a global (North America, 43.0%; Latin America, 11.7%; Europe, 31.3%; and Asia-Pacific, 14.0%) Doripenem Surveillance Program for the years 2003 to 2007. Doripenem was confirmed to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (22 389 isolates) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2444 isolates; MIC(90) values, <or=0.06 microg/mL), with no differences noted between geographic regions. Against Enterococcus faecalis (8714 isolates), doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC(50), 4 microg/mL) but was largely inactive against Enterococcus faecium (4233 isolates). Although not currently approved for treatment of respiratory tract infections in the United States, doripenem was highly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae (10 260 isolates; MIC(90), 0.5 microg/mL) and 2-fold more active than either ceftriaxone or cefepime. Doripenem activity was even more noteworthy against beta-hemolytic streptococci (4598 isolates; MIC(90), <or=0.06 microg/mL, similar to that of penicillin) and viridans group streptococci (1887 isolates; MIC(90), 0.25 microg/mL). Doripenem appears broadly active in vitro against Gram-positive pathogens, a potency similar to that of other carbapenems, a distinct advantage that complements other attributes including beta-lactamase and dehydropeptidase stability and activity against emerging multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Spectrum of activity and mode of action of REP3123, a new antibiotic to treat Clostridium difficile infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of REP3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) in development for the treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. METHODS: The spectrum of activity of REP3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of C. difficile and non-target organisms. The mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. RESULTS: REP3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of C. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant BI/NAP1/027 strains (MIC range=0.5-1 mg/L and MIC(90) = 1 mg/L). The spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90)s < 1 mg/L), but REP3123 was not active against most Gram-negative bacteria. REP3123 targeted C. difficile MetRS with a calculated inhibition constant (K(i)) of 0.020 nM, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic MetRS. The specific mode of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by REP3123, and by metS overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in MIC for REP3123. Spontaneous REP3123-resistant mutants of C. difficile (MICs, 4-128 mg/L) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the metS gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. Most of the MetRS substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. CONCLUSIONS: REP3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target C. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.
TI  - Study of microbial diversity in raw milk and fresh curd used for Fontina cheese production by culture-independent methods.
AB  - The bacterial populations of raw milk employed for the production of Fontina cheese in alpine farms located in different valleys and altitudes (from 700 to 2246 m above sea level) were investigated by culture independent techniques. Total microbial DNA was isolated from milk and curd samples and used as template in Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to study the hypervariable V3 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and analyzed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE). Representative bands of DGGE patterns were sequenced for identification purposes. The use of universal primer for PCR-DGGE allowed the description of the bacterial community, not only for the presence of lactic acid bacteria, but also for other adventitious species. DGGE profiles obtained from milk and fresh curd samples were generally different and typical for each farm, although some recurrent bands were observed. Cluster analysis of DGGE profiles did not show high similarity among samples and it was probably dependent on the different geographical areas of pastures. Some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) recurred in many samples (Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc lactis) indicating that alpine milk is a preferential niche for their colonization. The microbiota included not only mesophilic and thermoresistant LAB but also adventitious bacteria (Macrococcus caseolyticus, Rothia spp.) and psychrotrophic bacteria (Chryseobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp.), that were found in almost all samples, but disappeared after the warming up at 47-48 degrees C of coagulated milk. Pantoea spp. was primarily found in curds and only with a low incidence in milk samples, indicating the environmental origin. Finally the sequencing data confirmed the presence of E. faecium, E. faecalis and S. thermophilus as major species present in the curd. These species were found also in raw milk, proving its importance as source of the typical fermenting microflora.
TI  - TR-700 in vitro activity against and resistance mutation frequencies among Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: TR-700, the active component of the oxazolidinone prodrug TR-701, has demonstrated potent activity against numerous Gram-positive species. In this study, single-step mutation frequencies, passaging and the activity of TR-700 were tested against a worldwide collection of linezolid-non-susceptible organisms and matched controls. METHODS: One hundred and twenty linezolid-non-susceptible and 120 controls matched by genus/species, geographic origin, site of infection and time were susceptibility tested by reference broth microdilution methods. Species of isolates were: Enterococcus faecalis (16 linezolid non-susceptible/16 wild-type strains); Enterococcus faecium (55/55), Staphylococcus aureus (8/8); coagulase-negative staphylococci (at least 7 spp., 40/40) and viridans group streptococci (2 spp., 1/1). 23S rRNA target mutations or cfr genes were detected by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: Among linezolid-non-susceptible strains, the resistance mechanisms were G2576T (109), cfr (4) and unknown (7), with strains originating from Europe, Far East and North and South America. Most strains were multidrug-resistant and cfr isolates exhibited co-resistance to phenicols, clindamycin, linezolid, pleuromutilins and streptogramin B. TR-700 MIC values, regardless of species, were 4-32-fold lower than those of linezolid. TR-700 MIC results were < or = 4, < or = 8 or < or = 16 mg/L for 88%, 96% and > 99% of linezolid-non-susceptible strains, respectively. Spontaneous single-step mutations were undetected (<1.1 x 10(-9)) and 14 day passaging studies produced modest TR-700 MIC elevations compared with linezolid controls. CONCLUSIONS: TR-700 exhibited enhanced activity against linezolid-non-susceptible and wild-type control strains of Gram-positive cocci. A significant number (nearly 90%) of linezolid-non-susceptible strains were inhibited by potentially achievable levels (< or = 4 mg/L) of TR-700. All strains with the emerging cfr-mediated resistance determinant had TR-700 MIC results at < or = 8 mg/L.
TI  - Neopyrrolomycins with broad spectrum antibacterial activity.
AB  - Three new antibiotics, neopyrrolomycins B (1), C (2), and D (3), with potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens were discovered. They exhibited MIC values < 1 microg/mL versus a number of resistant strains. The compounds were obtained from the ethyl acetate extracts of a Streptomyces sp. after purification by column chromatography and RP-HPLC. Their structures were elucidated using X-ray crystallography (1) and NMR spectroscopy (2 and 3).
TI  - Tigecycline in combination with other antimicrobials: a review of in vitro, animal and case report studies.
AB  - Tigecycline has been investigated in combination with other antibacterials against a wide range of susceptible and multiresistant Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Combinations have been analysed in vitro, in animal models and in human case reports. In vitro, tigecycline combined with other antimicrobials produces primarily an indifferent response (neither synergy nor antagonism). Nevertheless, synergy occurred when tigecycline was combined with rifampicin against 64-100% of Enterococcus spp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterobacter spp. and Brucella melitensis isolates. Combinations of tigecycline with amikacin also showed synergy for 40-100% of Enterobacter spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus spp. and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolates. Moreover, bactericidal synergisms occurred with tigecycline plus amikacin against problematic Acinetobacter baumannii and Proteus vulgaris, and with colistin against K. pneumoniae. Data from animal experiments and case reports, although limited, displayed consistent beneficial activity of tigecycline in combination with other antibacterials against multiresistant organisms, including vancomycin against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in experimental meningitis, gentamicin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa in experimental pneumonia, daptomycin against Enterococcus faecium endocarditis, and colistin against K. pneumoniae bacteraemia and P. aeruginosa osteomyelitis. Antagonism was extremely rare in vitro and was not reported in vivo. Thus, tigecycline may be combined with a second antimicrobial as part of a combination regimen.
TI  - Monitoring major mastitis pathogens at the population level based on examination  of bulk tank milk samples.
AB  - The objective was to determine the proportions and bacterial counts of major mastitis pathogens in samples of bulk tank milk (BTM), as well as to clarify the relationship between these bacteria counts and bulk tank somatic cell count (BTSCC). The purpose was to judge the importance of the counts of mammary pathogens for BTSCC at the population level. Samples of BTM were collected from 268 randomly selected anonymous dairy herds (with approximately 29 000 dairy cows). Staphylococcus aureus, other coagulase-positive staphylococci, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus dysgalactiae were grouped as contagious pathogens, and Streptococcus uberis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium as environmental pathogens. Based on assessment of the dominant pathogen in each herd, environmental pathogens were found to dominate. Counts of specific mammary pathogens in BTM samples did not exceed a geometric mean of 1000 cfu/ml. Significant differences were documented in BTSCC between BTM samples containing Str. agalactiae, Staph. aureus, and Str. dysgalactiae and BTM samples that were pathogen-free. Geometric means of BTSCC associated with these pathogens were noticeably higher than the overall BTSCC (Str. agalactiae 243 628; Staph. aureus 205 610; Str. dysgalactiae 203 978; overall 173 000 cells/ml). It follows that the somatic cell count (SCC) associated with these pathogens contributed substantially to the overall BTSCC. Environmental pathogens predominated in samples of BTM with SCC <300x103/ml and contagious mastitis pathogens predominated in BTM samples with SCC >300x103/ml. No correlation was detected between bacterial counts of specific pathogens and BTSCC. This study revealed that the assessment of bacterial counts of mammary pathogens in samples of BTM in relation to BTSCC is applicable for the monitoring of changes in the occurrence of major mastitis pathogens in dairy herds at a national level.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - Screening of surface properties and antagonistic substances production by lactic  acid bacteria isolated from the mammary gland of healthy and mastitic cows.
AB  - Bovine mastitis (BM) is a costly disease in dairy cattle production. The prevention and treatment of mastitis is performed by applying antimicrobial products that negatively affect milk quality. In the last years, the use of probiotic microorganisms to prevent infections in humans and animals has being aggressively studied. Samples from teat canal and milk (foremilk and stripping) were taken from healthy and mastitic mammary quarters. A screening of the surface properties and antagonistic substances production of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from the mammary gland was performed to select potential probiotic strains to prevent mastitis. Somatic cell count, physico-chemical and microbiological studies were carried out. Pre-selected microorganisms were genetically identified. Compared with stripping milk, foremilk showed lower levels of fat and higher levels of pH, density, microorganism numbers, lower percentage of strains with mean and high hydrophobicity and mean autoaggregation and higher number of strains able to produce hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. The other parameters analyzed were not statistically significant. One hundred and two LAB strains were isolated. Most of them had low degrees of hydrophobicity and autoaggregation. No correlation between these properties was found. Antagonistic metabolites were mainly produced by strains isolated from healthy quarters. Most of the pre-selected strains were identified as Streptococcus bovis and Weissella paramesenteroides. Three bacteriocin-producers were found and their products partially characterized. The results of this work are the basis for the further design of a specie-specific probiotic product able to prevent BM.
TI  - United States resistance surveillance results for linezolid (LEADER Program for 2007).
AB  - The LEADER Program (2007) monitors for emerging linezolid resistance in sampled US medical centers, initiated in 2004. For the current reported year, the number of sites participating was increased from 50 to 60 institutions representing all 9 US census regions with 100 target organisms per site (6305 isolates, 105.1% compliance to protocol design). The organisms tested by reference broth microdilution methods were Staphylococcus aureus (3318), coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS, 1020), enterococci (705), Streptococcus pneumoniae (622), and viridans group (249) or beta-hemolytic streptococci (391); also, D-test was used to determine inducible clindamycin resistance in S. aureus strains. Linezolid remained very potent against all sampled species with MIC(90) results ranging from 1 microg/mL (streptococci and CoNS) to 2 microg/mL (S. aureus and enterococci). Only 0.44% of sampled strains were nonsusceptible to linezolid, compared with 0.45% in 2006. The nonsusceptible strains (23) were usually staphylococci (20) or Enterococcus faecium (8), each with defined target mutations (G2576T, 24 strains) or a novel mobile cfr element in staphylococci (2 strains). In conclusion, linezolid activity sampled by the 4th year of this LEADER Program showed sustained potency and spectrum (99.56% susceptibility). Although the nonsusceptible strain isolation rates remained stable, a new plasmid-mediated ribosomal-based resistance mechanism emerged in S. aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis strains from Arizona and Ohio. The LEADER Program appears to be an effective and sensitive surveillance tool to detect novel resistance phenotypes and genotypes.
TI  - Highly resistant microorganisms in a teaching hospital: the role of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence density of highly resistant organisms (HROs) and the relative contribution of horizontal spread in a setting of endemicity. METHODS: Prospective surveillance was performed among hospitalized patients during an 18-month period. Enterobacteriaceae, nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium--all considered highly resistant, according to Dutch guidelines--were included. Epidemiological linkage and nosocomial transmission were determined on the basis of molecular typing and hospital admission data. RESULTS: From 119 patients, we recovered a total of 170 unique HRO isolates, as follows: Escherichia coli, 96 isolates; Klebsiella species, 11 isolates; Enterobacter species, 8 isolates; Proteus species, 9 isolates; Citrobacter species, 5 isolates; Pseudomonas species, 5 isolates; Acinetobacter species, 3 isolates; Morganella species, 2 isolates; Salmonella species, 1 isolate; Serratia species, 1 isolate; S. pneumoniae, 20 isolates; and S. aureus, 9 isolates. No vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was found. The incidence density was 4.3 HRO isolates per 10,000 patient-days. The majority of HRO isolates were unique, and nosocomial transmission was observed 4 times for highly resistant gram-negative bacilli (case reproduction rate, 0.05) and 4 times for penicillin-nonsusceptible S. pneumoniae (case reproduction rate, 0.29). A stay on the intensive care unit was the main determinant for the recovery of an HRO. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial transmission of HROs was observed 8 times during the 18-month period. The intensive care unit was identified as the main reservoir of horizontal spread of HROs. This study shows that nosocomial transmission of HROs is largely preventable using transmission precautions.
TI  - Non-susceptibility trends among enterococci and non-pneumococcal streptococci from bacteraemias in the UK and Ireland, 2001-06.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns and trends in antimicrobial susceptibility in enterococci and streptococci (excepting pneumococci) from bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland from 2001 to 2006. METHODS: In each year 2001-06, blood culture isolates were collected by 25 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. In total, there were 1408 isolates of enterococci, 1332 of beta-haemolytic streptococci and 1012 of alpha- and non-haemolytic streptococci. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: The prevalence of reduced susceptibility in streptococci and enterococci did not change significantly for most antibiotics, but trends were noted to increased ampicillin, imipenem and vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium. The prevalence of reduced susceptibility to macrolides and tetracycline in streptococci, to tetracycline and gentamicin (high level) in enterococci and to beta-lactams and glycopeptides in E. faecium were all high, with some differences in the prevalence among species or groups. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents among streptococci and enterococci remains common and continued surveillance is warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive cocci: the first multicentre study in Greece.
AB  - A total of 10420 Gram-positive cocci (including staphylococci, enterococci and various groups of streptococci) collected from clinically significant specimens in ten Greek hospitals during 2006--2007 were tested for their susceptibility to daptomycin. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined by the broth microdilution method. Daptomycin demonstrated very high activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC at which 50% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC50) = 1mg/L and MIC at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) = 1.36 mg/L), Enterococcus faecium (MIC50 = 1.36 mg/L and MIC90 = 1.90 mg/L), Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC50 = 0.12 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.50mg/L), Streptococcus agalactiae (MIC50 = 0.09 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.5 mg/L) and viridans group streptococci (MIC50 = 0.50 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.89 mg/L). Resistance to linezolid and vancomycin for enterococci and to penicillin for streptococci appears to be independent of reduced susceptibility to daptomycin. On the other hand, daptomycin was also active against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC50 = 0.44 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.78 mg/L) and meticillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC50 = 0.24 mg/L and MIC90 = 0.44 mg/L); however, 0.9% of the staphylococci tested had an MIC > 1mg/L, which is the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoint proposed for susceptibility. For all tested organism groups, resistance to daptomycin was not associated with glycopeptide resistance.
TI  - A traditional Sudanese fermented camel's milk product, Gariss, as a habitat of Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius.
AB  - Samples of the traditional Sudanese fermented camel's milk product Gariss representing 9 different regions in Sudan were microbiologically characterized using an integrated approach including phenotypic and genotypic methods. Lactic acid bacteria [log(CFU/g)=7.76-8.66] and yeasts [log(CFU/g)=6.05-7.79] were detected in high numbers. A total of 180 LAB isolates were identified of which 123 isolates were found to belong to the Streptococcus bovis group. Thirteen representative isolates were characterized by PCR amplification and sequencing of the housekeeping genes rpoB and sodA and the streptococcal glucosyltransferase gene (gtf). All thirteen isolates were identified as Streptococcus infantarius subsp. infantarius, a potential human pathogen. The gene encoding the virulence determinant gtf was detected in 10 of the 13 tested strains. The same isolates were able to survive exposure to 0.3% (w/v) oxgall for 4 h and pH=2.7 for 1-4 h. Also Lactobacillus fermentum were detected in high numbers, whereas Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus helveticus were detected more occasionally. The yeast microflora in all Gariss samples consisted of Kluyveromyces marxianus and Issatchenkia orientalis with the former being predominant in 7 out of 9 samples.
TI  - Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) accelerates identification of Gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  - Sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. Rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. To accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) targeting Gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. By combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium/durans. Furthermore, the newly designed FISH probes STREP2, ENCO and GRANU targeted Streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, Enterococcus spp. (except E. faecalis) and Granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. The FISH assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and reliable molecular identification of Gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.
TI  - PCR-based identification of selected pathogens associated with endodontic infections in deciduous and permanent teeth.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the presence of the selected pathogens in samples from deciduous and permanent tooth root canals by using PCR method and to determine the association of these organisms with clinical symptoms. STUDY DESIGN: A total of 145 children, 5 to 13 years old, were involved in this study. The presence of selected pathogens (Actinomyces israelii, Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Streptococcus intermedius, Treponema denticola, Parvimonas micra, Tannerella forsythensis, Enterococcus faecium, Prevotella melaninogenica) in infected root canals was studied using PCR. RESULTS: T. denticola (P = .012, .02) and E. faecalis (P = .012, .04) were highly associated with periapical radiolucency and previous pain, while P. gingivalis was associated with tenderness to percussion in both deciduous and permanent teeth (P = .01, .015). CONCLUSION: The results of the present study confirm that certain species of microorganisms are associated with clinical signs and symptoms of endodontic disease in both deciduous and permanent teeth.
TI  - Ceftobiprole: an extended-spectrum anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To summarize and evaluate the literature concerning ceftobiprole. DATA SOURCES: Literature identification was conducted through MEDLINE (1966-February 2008) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-February 2008) using the terms ceftobiprole, medocaril, BAL 5788, RO-5788, BAL 9141, RO 63-9141, pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, MRSA, complicated skin and skin-structure infections (cSSSIs), community-acquired pneumonia, and nosocomial pneumonia. Additional publications were identified through a review of articles and abstracts from infectious disease meetings. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All articles in English were evaluated and all pertinent information was included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Ceftobiprole medocaril is an extended-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Enterobacteriaceae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Inactivity includes extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecium. Preliminary data suggest that ceftobiprole may be effective with a 1-hour infusion of 500 mg every 12 hours for gram-positive infections and 500 mg every 8 hours with a 2-hour infusion for polymicrobial infections. Two clinical trials support these dosing regimens for cSSSIs. Ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin in suspected gram-positive cSSSIs, with cure rates of 93.3% and 93.5%, respectively. Furthermore, ceftobiprole was noninferior to vancomycin and ceftazidime in polymicrobial cSSSIs (cure rates 90.5% vs 90.2%, respectively). Although the total number of adverse effects was similar to those of the comparator, more patients in the ceftobiprole group experienced nausea, vomiting, and dysgeusia. CONCLUSIONS: The activity of ceftobiprole and limited clinical data suggest that it may be useful as empiric monotherapy for cSSSI and in combination with other antimicrobials in lower respiratory tract infections for which Phase 3 clinical trials are currently exploring. Although not shown in vitro, ceftobiprole may induce resistance due to its broad spectrum of activity. Approval is expected for the treatment of cSSSI.
TI  - In vitro activity of telavancin against recent Gram-positive clinical isolates: results of the 2004-05 Prospective European Surveillance Initiative.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Telavancin is a novel semi-synthetic lipoglycopeptide currently in late-stage clinical development for the treatment of serious infections due to Gram-positive bacteria. The objective of this study was to provide a baseline prospective assessment of its in vitro activity against a large and diverse collection of Gram-positive clinical isolates from Europe and Israel. METHODS: Gram-positive clinical isolates, collected between October 2004 and December 2005 from 36 hospital laboratories in 15 countries, were tested by broth microdilution using CLSI methodology. RESULTS: In total, 3206 isolates were collected. Telavancin had potent activity against Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (MIC range < or =0.015 to 2 mg/L), independent of resistance to methicillin or to multiple drugs. Telavancin had particularly strong activity against streptococcal isolates (MIC range < or =0.001 to 0.5 mg/L), including penicillin-resistant and multiple drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and erythromycin non-susceptible beta-haemolytic and viridans group streptococci. Telavancin also had excellent activity against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L), and although its MICs were elevated against VanA strains (Enterococcus faecalis MIC(90) 8 mg/L and Enterococcus faecium MIC(90) 4 mg/L), its MIC(90) was substantially lower than observed with available glycopeptides. CONCLUSIONS: Telavancin has potent in vitro activity against contemporary Gram-positive clinical isolates from diverse geographic areas in Europe and Israel.
TI  - Diversity of stress responses in dairy thermophilic streptococci.
AB  - Exponential and stationary phase cells of 56 strains of the dairy Streptococcus species S. thermophilus, S. macedonicus and S. salivarius, were exposed to acid, osmotic, oxidative and heat stresses to investigate the diversity of their responses. Three strains of dairy related streptococci, Lactococcus lactis ATCC11454, Enterococcus faecium DSM20477 and Enterococcus faecalis DSM20478, were included for comparison purposes. Acid and heat adaptation and cross-protection to stress were studied in ten strains with different stress response patterns. Cell death and the changes in protein expression were evaluated by plate counts and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrilamide Gel Electrophoresis, respectively. All strains of all species were highly tolerant of osmotic stress. With a few exceptions, acid and oxidative treatments reduced the number of viable cells by >5 log units but responses to heat stress were more variable. For some, but not all strains, stationary phase cells were more resistant to some or all stresses. Matrix cluster analysis was used to group strains on the basis of their pattern of stress response in seven clusters. Significant associations between the sources of strains and stress resistance were found for acid and oxidative stresses. Adaptation to stress during the exponential phase enhanced the survival of acid and heat stressed cells from 1 to 60,000-folds, but a detrimental effect of adaptation on cell viability was evident for oxidative and osmotic stresses for three strains. Adaptation and entry into the stationary phase resulted in significant changes of protein bands whose estimated molecular masses corresponded with those of proteins (DnaK, GprE, GroEL, and GroES) involved in the general stress response but no statistically significant correlation between stress response and band intensity was evident.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ceftobiprole, a novel anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus cephalosporin, tested against contemporary pathogens: results from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program (2005-2006).
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a 1st-in-class anti-methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) extended-spectrum cephalosporin currently in clinical trials for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSIs) and nosocomial pneumonia. This agent is also active against other prominent Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, making it an attractive candidate for broad-spectrum therapy. We evaluated the in vitro potency of ceftobiprole tested against the most commonly occurring bacterial pathogens as part of a global surveillance study for the years 2005 to 2006 (>60 medical centers in North America, Latin America, and Europe). All isolates (40 675) were susceptibility tested using reference broth microdilution methods. Ceftobiprole inhibited 100% and >99% of tested S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at < or =4 and < or =8 microg/mL, respectively, although MIC90 values for oxacillin-resistant strains were 4-fold and 8-fold higher than oxacillin-susceptible isolates for the 2 groups. Ceftobiprole was also broadly active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic and viridans group streptococci, inhibiting >98% of isolates at < or =0.5 microg/mL. Although ceftobiprole was generally inactive against Enterococcus faecium, the majority of Enterococcus faecalis strains (95.7%) were inhibited at < or =4 microg/mL. This agent was similar in potency to the "3rd- and 4th-generation" cephems (MIC50 values, < or =0.06 microg/mL) for all tested Enterobacteriaceae. Although cefepime provided enhanced coverage against Klebsiella spp. (86.5% at < or =8 microg/mL versus 76.9-81.7% for ceftobiprole and ceftazidime), ceftobiprole and cefepime were superior to ceftazidime against Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter spp. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ceftobiprole was equal in potency to ceftazidime (MIC50, 2 microg/mL) and 2-fold more potent than cefepime. None of these agents inhibited >45% of Acinetobacter spp. at 8 mug/mL. Ceftobiprole is a new anti-MRSA beta-lactam with recognized activity against the most commonly occurring Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa, similar to that of extended-spectrum cephems. These characteristics warrant continued evaluation of the agent as empiric therapy for cSSSIs, and in pneumonia, especially in those institutions/regions where MRSA and P. aeruginosa may be prevalent.
TI  - [Antibiotics susceptibility of Streptococcus and Enterococcus: data of Onerba network].
AB  - This work was aimed to analyze trends in susceptibility to antibiotics among the  main species of beta-hemolytic streptococci involved in community-acquired infections in human (Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae), or in animals (Streptococcus suis and Streptococcus uberis) and also among the main enterocci species, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Data were recorded since 1996 through the Onerba networks. S. pyogenes, as the other beta-hemolytic streptococci studied remained fully susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, susceptibility to macrolides is clearly decreasing in S. pyogenes. In 2002, only 62 to 65% of the strains according to the network considered, were susceptible to erythromycin. A similar trend was observed for S. agalactiae with only 75% of erythromycin susceptibility in 2002, and for both species isolated from animals S. suis and S. uberis, with respectively 35 and 76% of strains susceptible to erythromycin. In enterococci, susceptibility to beta-lactams remained stable between 2000 and 2004. Indeed, the susceptibility to aminopenicillins remained high in E. faecalis (about 98%), whereas the proportion of E. faecium isolates susceptible to these antibiotics were lower than 60%. From 1999 to 2004, various studies conducted in French hospitals showed that the vancomycin resistance among enterococci accounted for less than 2%. However, the recent emergence of glycopeptide resistant enterococci clusters in French hospitals is a matter of concern and emphasizes the need for an ongoing surveillance. Such trend in macrolide resistance among S. pyogenes or S. agalactiae should consequently lead to propose other alternatives in case of beta-lactam allergy, and for pharyngitis, to rethink the place of the culture for susceptibility testing.
TI  - Emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Development of multiple resistances to antibiotics in staphylococci, enterococci  and pneumococci became a health threat during the past 20 years, not only with respect to nosocomial infections. This resistance development is based on acquisition of resistance genes by predominant epidemic subpopulations (clonal complexes). Although emergence and spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is associated with a limited number of epidemic clones which have been widely disseminated, acquisition of SCCmec elements by susceptible ancestors has taken place at different times and at different locations. Among Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium, one clonal complex, which had acquired resistance genes at several occasions, is widely disseminated in hospitals. Also in Streptococcus pneumoniae, antibiotic resistance is preferentially associated with clonal lineages which have a capacity for spreading. They became, however, more rare after introduction of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of heyneanol A extracted from the root of Taiwanese wild grape.
AB  - AIMS: To search for antimicrobial compounds against pathogenic bacteria from grape vines (Vitis spp.). To investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of active compounds towards methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS AND RESULTS: The root extracts of taiwanese wild grape (Vitis thunbergii var. taiwaniana) showed marked activities against Gram-positive bacteria using the disc diffusion method. After purification, the active compound 1 was confirmed as heyneanol A by mass spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Heyneanol A showed an minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 2 microg ml(-1) towards MRSA and a value of 2 to 4 microg ml(-1) for Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae and Streptococcus pyogenes. In addition, the contents of heyneanol A were determined as 36 mg g(-1) in roots of taiwanese wild grape. CONCLUSIONS: The root extracts of grapevines have good antimicrobial activities towards some strains of Gram-positive pathogens. Heyneanol A, the major antimicrobial compound, is especially active towards MRSA. In addition, the abundances of heyneanol A and other stilbenes in the roots of grapevines make it possible to produce natural antimicrobial compounds from this plant species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study reports for the first time the antimicrobial compounds in the root extracts of grapevines. The results will have clinical significance owing to their activities against MRSA.
TI  - Prevalence of the erm(T) gene in clinical isolates of erythromycin-resistant group D Streptococcus and Enterococcus.
AB  - Among 48 erythromycin-resistant group D streptococci (GDS), 36 had the erm(T) resistance gene. erm(T) was also found in 4 of 31 erythromycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium isolates. This is the first report of the erm(T) gene in U.S. GDS isolates and the first report of the erm(T) gene in enterococci.
TI  - Terpenoids Produced by Actinomycetes: Napyradiomycins from Streptomyces antimycoticus NT17.
AB  - Napyradiomycin SR ( 1), 16-dechloro-16-hydroxynapyradiomycin C2 ( 2), 18-hydroxynapyradiomycin A1 ( 3), 18-oxonapyradiomycin A1 ( 4), 16-oxonapyradiomycin A2 ( 5), 7-demethyl SF2415A3 ( 6), 7-demethyl A80915B ( 7), and ( R)-3-chloro-6-hydroxy-8-methoxy-alpha-lapachone ( 8) were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces antimycoticus NT17. These compounds are derivatives of the napyradiomycins isolated previously from Chainia rubra or Streptomyces aculeolatus. The structures of the new compounds, some of which exhibit antibacterial activities, were established by comparing their NMR data with data of related known compounds. The unique structure of 1, containing a highly strained ring, was established by NMR and was confirmed by X-ray analysis. Two of the compounds are C-16 stereoisomers of napyradiomycin A2 and are named napyradiomycins A2a ( 9a) and A2b ( 9b).
TI  - [Identification and characterization of a novel antigenic protein of Streptococcus suis type 2].
AB  - An immunogenic protein, named HM3, of Streptococcus suis type 2 HA9801 was identified by using immunoproteomic assay. Some characters of this protein were analyzed by several online bioinformatical tools, including BLAST, SinglP, HMMTOP and PSORTb. The most homologous sequence of HM3 was extracellular solute-binding protein (gi/69246104) of Enterococcus faecium. The predictions results showed that HM3 contained Signal peptide and one transmembrane region, and Non-Cytoplasmic Localization were also predicted. Partial gene of this protein were amplified from the genome of HA9801 by PCR and inserted into expression plasmid pET-32a (+) after double digested by BamH I and Sal I, then transformed into BL21 (DE3) where they were induced to express by IPTG. After induced, there was specific proteins band of approximately 45kDa on the SDS-PAGE gel. Western-blotting showed that recombinant protein could react with immune serum of HA9801 of SPF (Specefic pathogen Free) mini-swine. This protein could be taken as vaccine candidate of SS2.
TI  - The effect of probiotics on Helicobacter pylori eradication.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Conflicting results have been reported on the effect of a variety of probiotic strains on Helicobacter pylori (HP) eradication. In this study, we evaluated the outcome of a probiotic strain composed of bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecium on HP eradication. METHODOLOGY: We recruited 352 HP infected patients who were randomized into a triple-plus-probiotics group or a triple-only group; the participants received 1 week of PPI-based triple therapy with or without probiotics supplements. For the triple-plus-probiotics group, probiotics was continued for 8 weeks. All patients in the two groups were evaluated for 4 weeks after completion of therapy. RESULTS: Using the intention to treat analysis, evaluation of the triple-plus-probiotics group showed a higher eradication rate than the triple-only group (83.5% vs. 73.3%, p=0.027). Diarrhea and overall side effects were more common in the triple-only group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with probiotic strains, composed of Bacillus subtilis and Streptococcus faecium, were shown to improve drug compliance, reduce side effects and enhance the intention-to-treat eradication rate of HP.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of DX-619, a novel Des-F (6)-quinolone against clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate in vitro antibacterial activity and bactericidal effect of DX-619 and other nine comparators against 1,101 recently collected clinical bacterial isolates in China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antimicrobials were determined by a CLSI recommended standard agar dilution method and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were examined by the broth dilution method. Time-kill curves against representative isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, and Klebsiellia pneumoniae were also conducted. DX-619 exhibited excellent antibacterial activity against 1,101 clinical isolates, especially to multi-drug resistant Gram-positive cocci. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 were < or =0.016 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus, 0.062 and 0.125 mg/L against methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. epidermidis, respectively, which were 8-512 and 64-128 fold lower than those of comparative fluoroquinolones. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 for penicillin-sensitive and -non-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were 0.016, 0.062, 0.25 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. The MIC(90)s of DX-619 against Enterobacteriaceae (except for Escherichia coli) and glucose-nonfermenting bacilli were < or =4 mg/L, which were comparable to other comparators. MBCs and time-kill curves showed that DX-619 was a potent bactericidal agent. There was no significant inoculum effect on MICs. But the activities of DX-619 against S. aureus, K. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were decreased by acidic pH and human serum. DX-619 was a potent antibacterial compound against multi-drug resistant bacteria including Gram-positive cocci, such as S. aureus and enterococci, which may warrant further exploration.
TI  - Decontamination effects of low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge.  Part II: new insights.
AB  - The second part of our paper presents the results of experiments with the decontamination of surfaces by low-temperature plasma generated by corona discharge in air at atmospheric pressure. A simple device is described and the effects of the corona discharge on model microorganisms, viz. the yeast Candida albicans, Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Neisseria sicca, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Gram-positive bacteria Deinococcus radiodurans, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and vegetative and spore forms of Geobacillus stearothermophilus are discussed. A similar microbicidal effect after about one-minute exposure was observed in all vegetative forms of the microorganisms. Measurement in growth inhibition zones on a semisolid medium was used to determine the dependence of the microbicidal effect on exposure time and the distance between electrodes. Counting of colonies served to assess the microbicidal effect of the discharge on contaminated inert surfaces observable after more than 1 min exposure. Geobacillus stearothermophilus spores were found to have several times lower susceptibility to the action of the discharge and the microbicidal effect was observed only after an 8 min exposure. Reaction with the iodide reagent did not unambiguously demonstrate the difference between ozone and singlet oxygen as presumed active components of the corona. The area distribution of reactive oxygen species was determined; it was found to differ from the Wartburg law depending on exposure time. Qualitative evidence was obtained on the penetration of the reactive oxygen species into the semisolid medium.
TI  - Linezolid in children: recent patents and advances.
AB  - Linezolid is the first approved member of a new generation of antibiotics, the synthetic oxazolidinones, to become available, with a broad spectrum of in vitro activity against Gram-positive organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. It has an excellent bioavailability both intravenously and orally and a very good safety profile both in adults and in children. With regards to its antimicrobial action, linezolid has a predominantly bacteriostatic action, rather than a bacteriocidal effect and is active against Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. Linezolid is currently showing great promise for the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-positive infections, both in the community and in a hospital setting. Clinical indications so far include skin and soft tissue infections, community-acquired or nosocomial pneumonia due to MRSA, VRE bacteremia and community-acquired pneumonia due to penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. We anticipate that this new generation of antimicrobial agents will provide adequate cover in the future for infections that cause significant treatment failures so far, such as VRE- associated endocarditis, bone and joint multi-drug resistant infections and possibly central nervous system infections, both in adult and children populations. Some patents on linezolid are also discussed in this review.
TI  - Screening of the enterocin genes and antimicrobial activity against pathogenic bacteria in Enterococcus strains obtained from different origins.
AB  - Antimicrobial activities of 139 Enterococcus isolates (48 E. faecium and 91 E. faecalis) obtained from canine feces, boiler meat samples, swine feces, wild waterfowl feces, and human feces were examined against respective bacteria, including Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella Enteritidis, and Escherichia coli. Bacteriocin (BAC) production assay revealed that the antimicrobial activity against at least one of 6 indicator strains (BAC+ phenotype) was found in 51 (37%) isolates (29 E. faecium and 22 E. faecalis). Twenty-four of 46 isolates positive for at least one of the enterocin structural genes (entA, entB, entL50AB, and cylL) showed a BAC+ phenotype. The existence of other enterocins or nonenterocin factors was implied because the BAC+ phenotype was detected in a total of 27 Enterococcus isolates that had none of the enterocin genes tested. The antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative strains (Salmonella Enteritidis and E. coli) was detected in the 6 Enterococcus isolates that had either the entA, entB, entL50AB or cylL genes. Moreover, the proportion of the antimicrobial activity against L. monocytogenes among the cylL-positive E. faecalis isolates showing beta-hemolysis (10/16) was significantly (p<0.01) higher than among those lacking beta-hemolysis (2/15). The results suggested that certain characteristics are likely to be associated with the antimicrobial activity against specific organisms.
TI  - A class IIa peptide from Enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  - Peptide ST4SA, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA, inhibits the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. The peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to S. pneumoniae 40, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and E. faecium HKLHS. Low concentrations of peptide ST4SA (51200 arbitrary units (AU)/mL) caused DNA and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400AU/mL caused cell lysis. No decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. Peptide ST4SA revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. Peptide ST4SA dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. Analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. METHODS: The species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the Severance Hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. Blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. Identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. Among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of patients with Enterococcus faecium and K. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. Enterococcus, S. aureus and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. E. coli, Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae and S. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii increased. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and S. aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and K. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. The bacteremia due to Enterococcus, K. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
TI  - [Influence of probiotic enterococci on the growth of Streptococcus agalactiae].
AB  - Individual features of sensitivity of some strains of group B streptococci (GBS)  to influence of 2 probiotic cultures of Enterococcus faecium (SF68 and L3) have been studied by double agar test. E. faecium L3 strain had higher antagonistic activity to GBS. Two genes encoding enterocins A and B as well as genes responsible for the expression of the former two genes were found in the genome of this strain. The supernatant and peptide extract of E. faecium L3 contained thermostable low molecular weight peptides which inhibited growth of listeria and GBS but at lesser extent compared with native enterococci. Obtained data allow to suggest that antagonistic activity of enterococci against GBS may be affiliated with production of enterocins A and B and can be increased by the presence of other metabolites.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in 11 hospitals in Puerto Rico: results of an antimicrobial resistance management (ARM) program.
AB  - PURPOSE: The Antimicrobial Resistance Management Program (ARMP) was established in 1997 at the University of Florida as an ongoing project to document trends in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns in inpatient/outpatient isolates and track resistance that may occur with specific antibiotic use. METHODS: Institutions are enrolled at no charge and provide a minimum of 3 years of antibiogram/sensitivity report data, which are reviewed to create a customized analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility trends benchmarked against national/regional comparators. The data, in a HIPAA-compliant non-identifying format, comprise a national aggregate database of 28.4 million isolates from 358 institutions. This database was interrogated to determine resistance rates for eleven hospitals in Puerto Rico from 1998-2003 and, as comparators, those in the database from the State of Florida and all U.S. institutions. RESULTS: Between 1996-2003, data on 328,837 isolates collected from 11 hospitals throughout Puerto Rico, 5,388,897 isolates from 46 institutions in Florida, and 24,951,098 isolates from 358 U.S. institutions for the following organisms (number of antibiotics tested against) were reviewed for susceptibility: coagulase-negative staphylococci (14)/Staphylococcus epidermidis (18), Enterococcus faecalis (7), Enterococcus faecium (5), Enterococcus species (4), Escherichia coli (24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (24), Proteus mirabilis (22), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14), Serratia marcescens (22), Staphylococcus aureus (23), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9). Antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico varied organism to organism from that observed in Florida and nationally. CONCLUSIONS: This first broad analysis of antimicrobial resistance in Puerto Rico provides important baseline data, both for sentinel surveillance programs and for determining strategies for intervention.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of potent heterocyclic oxazolidinones and the identification of RBx 8700.
AB  - Several potent oxazolidinone antibacterial agents were obtained by systematic modification of the linker between the five-membered heterocycle and the piperazinyl ring of RBx 7644 (Ranbezolid, 1) and its thienyl analogue 2, leading to the identification of an expanded spectrum compound RBx 8700 (6b).
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Redox potential to discriminate among species of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: To verify to what degree reducing capacity is a characterizing parameter of a species, and of the strains themselves within a given species, of lactic acid bacteria. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eighty-eight strains belonging to 10 species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from traditional Italian cheeses were studied for their reduction activity: Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis, Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, Lactobacillus helveticus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. It was observed that the lactococci reached minimum redox potential before the lactobacilli. The reduction rate of Enterococcus spp. and L. lactis ssp. lactis was higher than that of the streptococci and Lactobacillus spp. All the P. pentosaceus strains had poor reduction activity compared with the other species. CONCLUSIONS: The evolution of the redox potential in milk over a time span of 24 h has been found to be a parameter that characterizes a species: the different courses corresponding to the species in question are clearly evident, and interesting differences can also be noted within the same species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The reduction aptitude of strains might be used to select and adapt appropriate strains for use as starters for dairy products.
TI  - Distribution of resistant gram-positive organisms across the census regions of the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-positive isolates were collected from 76 medical centers within  the 9 census regions across the United States. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: Vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium isolates varied from 45.5% (New England) to 85.3% (East South Central). The lowest concentrations at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90) were for tigecycline (0.06-0.12 microg/mL) and for linezolid (2-4 microg/mL). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) varied from 27.4% (New England) to 62.4% (East South Central). All MRSA were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. Penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 23.3% in the Pacific region to 54.5% in the East South Central region. Tigecycline, imipenem, levofloxacin, linezolid, and vancomycin all maintained MIC90 of < or =1 microg/mL against penicillin-nonsusceptible S pneumoniae in vitro, irrespective of region. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the variable rate of antimicrobial-resistant gram-positive organisms in the United States. Tigecycline may make a useful addition to the antimicrobial armamentarium.
TI  - In vitro activity of novel rifamycins against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - We describe novel rifamycins that have improved activity, compared with rifampin, against clinical isolates of staphylococci and streptococci, with MIC(90)s of 0.008 and 0.0005 microg/ml, respectively. This enhanced antibacterial activity, along with their potential lack of drug-drug interactions, are considerations that suggest the potential of these novel rifamycins in combination therapy to treat serious Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program Results for 2006: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from 16 countries.
AB  - The Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program has completed its fifth year of monitoring for emerging resistance to linezolid and other Gram-positive active agents on the continents of Europe, Asia, Australia, and Latin America. In 2006, 4216 Gram-positive isolates from 16 nations were submitted for analysis from 6 organism groups including Staphylococcus aureus (54.0%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (14.6%), enterococci (10.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.4%), viridans group streptococci (5.0%), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (7.0%). Linezolid retained potent activity against S. aureus (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 2 microg/mL; 39.8% methicillin resistant) and CoNS (MIC(50) and MIC(90), 1 microg/mL; 74.3% methicillin resistant). Despite endemicity of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (up to 30.0%) in several nations, linezolid inhibited >99% of strains at </=2 microg/mL (modal MIC, 1 microg/mL). Among streptococci, all linezolid MIC values were </=2 microg/mL. Rare instances of linezolid-resistance were detected in enterococci (2 isolates, China and Germany) and CoNS (3 isolates, Italy and Brazil); 2 CoNS and 1 Enterococcus faecium had documented G2576T mutations. Overall, linezolid remained active against 99.88% of tested strains from this global collection.
TI  - Variability of bacterial biofilms of the "tina" wood vats used in the ragusano cheese-making process.
AB  - Ragusano cheese is a "protected denomination of origin" cheese made in the Hyblean region of Sicily from raw milk using traditional wooden tools, without starter. To explore the Ragusano bacterial ecosystem, molecular fingerprinting was conducted at different times during the ripening and biofilms from the wooden vats called "tinas" were investigated. Raw milks collected at two farm sites, one on the mountain and one at sea level, were processed to produce Ragusano cheese. Raw milk, curd before and after cooking, curd at stretching time (cheese 0 time), and cheese samples (4 and 7 months) were analyzed by PCR-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (PCR-TTGE) and by classical enumeration microbiology. With the use of universal primers, PCR-TTGE revealed many differences between the raw milk profiles, but also notable common bands identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus lactis, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, and Enterococcus faecium. After the stretching, TTGE profiles revealed three to five dominant species only through the entire process of ripening. In the biofilms of the two tinas used, one to five species were detected, S. thermophilus being predominant in both. Biofilms from five other tinas were also analyzed by PCR-TTGE, PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis, specific PCR tests, and sequencing, confirming the predominance of lactic acid bacteria (S. thermophilus, L. lactis, and L. delbrueckii subsp. lactis) and the presence of a few high-GC-content species, like coryneform bacteria. The spontaneous acidification of raw milks before and after contact with the five tinas was followed in two independent experiments. The lag period before acidification can be up to 5 h, depending on the raw milk and the specific tina, highlighting the complexity of this natural inoculation system.
TI  - LEADER surveillance program results for 2006: an activity and spectrum analysis of linezolid using clinical isolates from the United States (50 medical centers).
AB  - Surveillance for emerging linezolid resistance among commonly occurring Gram-positive pathogens in the United States began with the 2002 ZAAPS program and more recently (2004) expanded as the LEADER program. The 2006 LEADER program processed 5374 strains from 50 medical centers (100 per site) located within the 9 US census regions; species and number tested by broth microdilution (% linezolid susceptible) included Staphylococcus aureus (2913, >99.9), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNSs) (808, 98.4), enterococci (547, 97.4), Streptococcus pneumoniae (546, 100.0), viridans group streptococci (189, 100.0), and beta-hemolytic streptococci (371, 100.0). In addition to 1 linezolid-nonsusceptible S. aureus, 3 strains were daptomycin-nonsusceptible, 4 were quinupristin/dalfopristin-intermediate, 2 were vancomycin-intermediate (vancomycin MIC values, 4 mug/mL), and all were methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Among the linezolid-resistant isolates (1 S. aureus, 13 CoNSs, 3 Enterococcus faecalis, and 10 Enterococcus faecium isolates), all but 3 Staphylococcus epidermidis isolates had the G2567T mutation. Overall, 99.55% of the tested 2006 LEADER program isolates remained susceptible to linezolid at current Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints.
TI  - Probiotics for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children: randomised clinical trial of five different preparations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to  parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. Design Randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. INTERVENTION: Children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG; Saccharomyces boulardii; Bacillus clausii; mix of L delbrueckii var bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum; or Enterococcus faecium SF68. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. Secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. Safety and tolerance were also recorded. RESULTS: 571 children were allocated to intervention. Median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). One day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. The remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective in children with acute diarrhoea. Paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN56067537 [controlled-trials.com].
TI  - Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients treated in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz, Poland, 2000-2001.
AB  - Background. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the occurrence of Gram-positive microorganisms isolated from patients hospitalized in the Department and Clinic of Rehabilitation at the Rydygier Medical University in Bydgoszcz. Materials and methods. The material analyzed consisted of 533 clinical samples collected from patients hospitalized in 2000-2001. The study included 485 Gram-positive bacterial strains isolated from clinical material. Morphological characteristics provided the basis for the identification of bacteria. The species were identified by using API 20 STREP and API STAPH tests (bioMerieux). The isolates were screened for antimicrobial susceptibility by the disk-diffusion method. Results. The most often isolated bacteria were Enterococcus spp. (46,8%) and Staphylococcus spp. (31,5%), followed by Corynebacterium spp. (9,1%) and Streptococcus spp. (6,6%). The most frequently identified Enterococcus species were E. faecalis (92,9%) and E. faecium (7,1%). All the Enterococcus strains were susceptible to glycopeptides. More than 90% of the Enterococus isolates were sensitive to nitrofurantoine, about 44% to high concentrations of gentamycin, 17,9% to ciprofloxacin. During this period, and S. simulans, and 21 strains of S. auerus (46,7%). 92% of all the tested CNS strains (80%) than in the S. aureus isolates (10%). Conclusions. The most frequently observed bacterium was E. faecalis, which showed significant resistance to quinolones and to high level aminoglycosides. The CNS strains showed a high level of resistance to methicilline. All these strains were susceptible to glycopeptides.
TI  - Enterococci and streptococci.
AB  - Besides Staphylococcus aureus, other Gram-positive bacteria have become multidrug-resistant and cause therapeutic problems, particularly amongst hospitalised patients. The acquisition of vancomycin resistance by strains of Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis is of particular concern and has resulted in treatment failures. Some of the infections caused by these bacteria do respond to treatment with new antibiotics that have been released in the last few years, however more options are required as not all enterococci are inherently susceptible and resistance is beginning to emerge amongst those that were susceptible. Resistance to commonly used antibiotics is also emerging in Streptococcus spp., particularly to the tetracyclines and macrolides. In both genera, multiresistant strains spread between patients and between hospitals. In the laboratory, these bacteria show considerable susceptibility to tigecycline, with little propensity to develop resistance, indicating that tigecycline could assume an important role in controlling infections caused by these Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Lactic acidosis after treatment with linezolid.
AB  - Linezolid is currently indicated to treat vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections, nosocomial pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pneumoniae, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, and community-acquired pneumonia. We report a case of linezolid-induced lactic acidosis during treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia after mitral valve replacement and permanent pacemaker implantation. We also review the current literature describing other cases of linezolid-associated hyperlactatemia.
TI  - Evaluation of the in vitro activity of tigecycline against multiresistant Gram-positive cocci containing tetracycline resistance determinants.
AB  - This study was undertaken to test the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 117 clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens and to correlate this activity with their resistance gene content. Overall, tigecycline showed a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 0.015-0.5mg/L, able to inhibit potently all multiresistant streptococci, enterococci and MR staphylococci. Tigecycline was active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and enterococci, with MICs for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90)) of 0.25 mg/L and 0.12 mg/L, respectively, being more active than linezolid (MIC(90)=2 mg/L) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90)=0.5 and 2-4 mg/L, respectively). Molecular characterisation of resistance determinants demonstrated the concomitant presence of different classes of genes: in particular, tet(M), erm(B) and erm(C) in Streptococcus agalactiae; tet(O), variably associated with different erm genes, in Streptococcus pyogenes; vanA, tet(M) and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecalis, and vanA and erm(B) in Enterococcus faecium. All the MRSA strains harboured SCCmec and erm genes and 50% possessed tet(K) with tet(M) genes. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains were only resistant to erythromycin. These results clearly demonstrate that tigecycline has a MIC(90) range of 0.015-0.5 mg/L both against tetracycline-susceptible and -resistant isolates carrying other resistance determinants, suggesting that this drug could play an important role in the treatment of infections caused by these multiresistant Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) against bacteria with defined resistance mechanisms and phenotypes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftaroline (PPI-0903M, T-91825) is a novel cephalosporin, administered as an N-phosphono prodrug. We investigated its in vitro activity and resistance selection potential. METHODS: MICs were determined by CLSI agar dilution, but with varied inocula. Mutant selection was investigated in single- and multi-step procedures. RESULTS: MICs for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 0.5-2 mg/L, compared with 0.12-0.25 mg/L for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus; corresponding values for coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.25-2 and 0.06-0.12 mg/L, respectively. Even with 2% NaCl added, all MRSA were susceptible at 2 mg/L. MICs for Enterococcus faecalis were from 0.25 to 8 mg/L; E. faecium was resistant. MICs for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Morganella morganii and Proteeae without acquired resistance were 0.06-0.5 mg/L versus 0.12-1 mg/L for Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacter spp. and 2-8 mg/L for Acinetobacter spp. MICs rose to 1-2 mg/L for many Enterobacteriaceae with classical TEM beta-lactamases, and were much higher for those with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), hyperproduced AmpC or K1 enzymes. MICs for strains with classical TEM/SHV beta-lactamases rose if the inoculum was increased to 10(6) cfu/spot; this effect was even more marked for those with ESBLs. Resistance due to Class A beta-lactamases was reversed by clavulanate. Geometric mean MICs were 0.005, 0.05 and 0.09 mg/L for penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, respectively-lower than for any comparator beta-lactam. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were very susceptible, although with marginally raised MICs for beta-lactamase-positive Moraxella strains and for haemophili with chromosomal ampicillin resistance. Ceftaroline selected AmpC-derepressed Enterobacter mutants similarly to cefotaxime in single-step experiments; in multi-step procedures it selected ESBL variants of blaTEM in E. coli. Resistance selection was not seen with S. aureus, H. influenzae or pneumococci. CONCLUSIONS: Ceftaroline has impressive anti-MRSA and anti-pneumococcal activity. Slight lability to classical TEM and SHV beta-lactamases is exceptional for an oxyimino-cephalosporin, but was reversible with clavulanate, as was the greater resistance mediated by ESBLs. Resistance selection occurred with Enterobacteriaceae, not MRSA.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of oleanolic acid from Salvia officinalis and related compounds on vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE).
AB  - An extract from Salvia officinalis (Sage) leaves showed antimicrobial activity against vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). We isolated the effective compound and identified it as oleanolic acid, a triterpenoid. We also tested antimicrobial activity of similar triterpenoids, ursolic acid, uvaol, betulinic acid and betulin. We found that ursolic acid also showed antimicrobial activity against VRE. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were 8 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. These two compounds also showed antimicrobial activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). These compounds showed bactericidal activity against VRE at least for 48 h when added at concentrations that were two-times higher than their MICs.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of Gram-positive bacterial isolates from the Asia-Pacific region and an in vitro evaluation of the bactericidal activity of daptomycin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin: a SENTRY Program Report (2003-2004).
AB  - Medical centres in eight countries in the Asia-Pacific region provided 2391 isolates for the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program during 2003-2004 to determine their susceptibility to several antimicrobial classes, including daptomycin. Daptomycin, vancomycin and teicoplanin minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were determined for 120 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, which included wild-type (WT) methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and strains with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin (hetero-vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA)). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were much less susceptible to the other tested agents compared with oxacillin-susceptible strains. Vancomycin resistance was higher among Enterococcus faecium (10.3%) than Enterococcus faecalis (0.4%), and macrolide resistance was high both for beta-haemolytic (17.7%) and viridans group (48.7%) streptococci. Daptomycin (MIC for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=0.5-1mg/L) was two-fold more potent than vancomycin, with >99% susceptibility when tested against staphylococci. All tested isolates of E. faecalis (MIC(90)=2mg/L) and beta-haemolytic streptococci (MIC(90)=0.5mg/L) were susceptible to daptomycin. Daptomycin MIC and MBC values were slightly higher for the hVISA isolates compared with WT-MRSA, with MBC/MIC ratios of only 1-2 for both groups. The MBC/MIC ratio for vancomycin was often greater when tested against these strains, particularly hVISA. In contrast, teicoplanin MBC/MIC ratios were significantly higher, with many of the strains showing values consistent with tolerance (>or=32). Daptomycin was demonstrated to have excellent in vitro activity when tested against Gram-positive isolates collected from Asia-Pacific countries, including hVISA strains.
TI  - Drug susceptibility testing of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci  by the Phoenix automated microbiology system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug resistance is an emerging problem among streptococcal and enterococcal species. Automated diagnostic systems for species identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) have become recently available. We evaluated drug susceptibility of clinical isolates of streptococci and enterococci using the recent Phoenix system (BD, Sparks, MD). Diagnostic tools included the new SMIC/ID-2 panel for streptococci, and the PMIC/ID-14 for enterococci. Two-hundred and fifty isolates have been investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 65), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 50), viridans group streptococci (n = 32), Enterococcus faecium (n = 40), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 43), other catalase-negative cocci (n = 20). When needed, species ID was determined using molecular methods. Test bacterial strains were chosen among those carrying clinically-relevant resistance determinants (penicillin, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, glycopeptides). AST results of the Phoenix system were compared to minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values measured by the Etest method (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). RESULTS: Streptococci: essential agreement (EA) and categorical agreement (CA) were 91.9% and 98.8%, respectively. Major (ME) and minor errors (mE) accounted for 0.1% and 1.1% of isolates, respectively. No very major errors (VME) were produced. Enterococci: EA was 97%, CA 96%. Small numbers of VME (0.9%), ME (1.4%) and mE (2.8%) were obtained. Overall, EA and CA rates for most drugs were above 90% for both genera. A few VME were found: a) teicoplanin and high-level streptomycin for E. faecalis, b) high-level gentamicin for E. faecium. The mean time to results (+/- SD) was 11.8 +/- 0.9 h, with minor differences between streptococci and enterococci. CONCLUSION: The Phoenix system emerged as an effective tool for quantitative AST. Panels based on dilution tests provided rapid and accurate MIC values with regard to clinically-relevant streptococcal and enterococcal species.
TI  - In-vitro profile of a new beta-lactam, ceftobiprole, with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Ceftobiprole is a novel, broad-spectrum cephalosporin with in-vitro activity against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. It forms a stable inhibitory complex with Staphylococcus aureus penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2' (2a), resulting in enhanced activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). In recent studies of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, the ceftobiprole MIC(90) value was most frequently < or =1.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.25-1.0 mg/L). For MRSA, MIC(90) values were generally 2.0 mg/L (MIC range < or =0.06-4.0 mg/L). MICs for all streptococcal species, except penicillin-resistant Streptococcus viridans but including penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ranged from < or =0.008 to 2.0 mg/L. Ceftobiprole is active against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC(90) = 4 mg/L), but not generally active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(90) > 16 mg/L). Ceftobiprole displayed bactericidal activity against Gram-negative pathogens comparable to that of cefepime, ceftazidime or piperacillin-tazobactam in early studies. However, recent data show activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa similar to that of cefepime but less than that of ceftazidime. Ceftobiprole, like cefepime, is stable in the presence of most class A non-extended spectrum beta-lactamases and inducible class C beta-lactamases. Ceftobiprole is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamase and a poor substrate for hydrolysis by AmpC beta-lactamase. Studies of ceftobiprole in several animal models have demonstrated potent in-vivo efficacy against infections caused by MRSA, including strains intermediately resistant to vancomycin. It was also efficacious in murine infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria with MIC values < or =2 mg/L. The broad spectrum of activity demonstrated by ceftobiprole in vitro and in vivo suggests that it may have potential for empirical treatment of suspected Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections, including those caused by MRSA.
TI  - Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of substituted phenyl-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinones against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - With the incidence of linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Staphylococcus aureus, modification of linezolid at the 5- and/or 3-positions led to the development of a series of 3-(methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl-phenyl oxazolidinone analogues. These compounds were tested in vitro against six gram-positive standard organisms (S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. pneumoniae, S. albus, Streptococcus enteridis and S. nonhemolyticus). 5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinones bearing fluorine at 3'-position of phenyl ring showed activities against several gram-positive bacteria (MIC: 3.13-6.25 mug/mL). The position of methoxyl group on the phenyl ring of piperazine group affected antibacterial spectrum. 3-(4'- (para-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active against 5 gram-positive organisms except S. nonhemolyticus, whereas 3-(4'-(ortho-methoxyl-phenyl)-piperazinyl)-(3'-fluoro)-phenyl-5-acetylaminomethyl oxazolidinone was found active only against 2 gram-positive organisms, namely S. albus, S. enteridis.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - In vitro effect of the presence of human albumin or human serum on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin against strains with the main resistance phenotypes in Gram-positives.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Bactericidal activity depends on antibiotic-bacteria couples, resistance phenotype and theoretically on protein binding. This work explores the influence of protein binding on the bactericidal activity of two antibiotics, daptomycin versus vancomycin, that exhibit, respectively, different C(max) (56 versus 25.5 mg/L), protein binding (91.7% versus 36.9%) and thus theoretical free-drug fractions (4.7 versus 16.1 mg/L). METHODS: The effect of the presence of physiological concentrations of human albumin (4 g/dL) or human serum (90%) on the bactericidal activity of daptomycin was studied against Gram-positive isolates with troublesome resistance phenotypes [multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MDRSP), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate MRSA (MRSA-hVI) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium]. Killing curves (final inocula of approximately 10(7) cfu/mL) were performed using daptomycin and vancomycin concentrations similar to the C(max) obtained in serum. RESULTS: Daptomycin was rapidly bactericidal (> or =3 log(10) initial inocula reduction) against S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, regardless of the strain tested or the presence of albumin or human serum (that slightly delayed bactericidal activity). Against vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant enterococci, daptomycin exhibited rapid bactericidal activity, delayed to 8 and 24 h, respectively, by human albumin. Vancomycin exhibited much slower bactericidal activity against MDRSP and methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus, but was never bactericidal against MRSA-hVI and vancomycin-susceptible or -resistant E. faecium. CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin exhibited rapid bactericidal activity against the strains of the three Gram-positive species tested, regardless of resistance phenotype or the presence of physiological concentrations of albumin.
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria associated with fish and the fish farm environment, established by amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis.
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria have become a major source of concern for aquaculture in recent decades. In addition to true pathogenic species of worldwide significance, such as Streptococcus iniae and Lactococcus garvieae, several species have been reported to produce occasional fish mortalities in limited geographic areas, and many unidentifiable or ill-defined isolates are regularly isolated from fish or fish products. To clarify the nature and prevalence of different fish-associated bacteria belonging to the lactic acid bacterium group, a collection of 57 isolates of different origins was studied and compared with a set of 22 type strains, using amplified rRNA gene restriction analysis (ARDRA). Twelve distinct clusters were delineated on the basis of ARDRA profiles and were confirmed by sequencing of sodA and 16S rRNA genes. These clusters included the following: Lactococcus raffinolactis, L. garvieae, Lactococcus l., S. iniae, S. dysgalactiae, S. parauberis, S. agalactiae, Carnobacterium spp., the Enterococcus "faecium" group, a heterogeneous Enterococcus-like cluster comprising indiscernible representatives of Vagococcus fluvialis or the recently recognized V. carniphilus, V. salmoninarum, and Aerococcus spp. Interestingly, the L. lactis and L. raffinolactis clusters appeared to include many commensals of fish, so opportunistic infections caused by these species cannot be disregarded. The significance for fish populations and fish food processing of three or four genetic clusters of uncertain or complex definition, namely, Aerococcus and Enterococcus clusters, should be established more accurately.
TI  - Characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci from Colombian hospitals: a countrywide surveillance.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The characterization of macrolide resistance in Gram-positive cocci recovered from Colombian hospitals. METHODS: The resistance profiles and mechanism of macrolide resistance were investigated in isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (1679), Staphylococcus aureus (348), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (175), and Enterococcus spp (123). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for erythromycin (ERY) and clindamycin (CLI), detection of macrolide resistance genes, phenotypic characterization, and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) of macrolide-resistant pneumococci were performed. RESULTS: Resistance to ERY and CLI was 3.3% and 2.3% for S. pneumoniae, 58% and 57% for S. aureus (94% for both compounds in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)), and 78.6% and 60.7% in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively. ERY resistance was 62% in Enterococcus faecalis and 82% in Enterococcus faecium. The MLS(B)-type accounted for 71% of S. pneumoniae and 100% of MRSA. The erm(A) gene was prevalent in MRSA, erm(B) in S. pneumoniae and enterococci, and erm(C) in CoNS isolates. Efflux pump genes (mef(A) genes) were mostly identified in S. pneumoniae (24%). The most common genotype amongst ERY-resistant pneumococci was the Spain(6B)-2 clone. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of macrolide resistance is low in Colombian pneumococci and high in MRSA (cMLS(B)-type).
TI  - [Etiology of pulmonary diseases in children in Khabarovsk Region].
AB  - Microflora of upper respiratory tract in 658 children aged 1 month - 17 years hospitalized with acute pneumonia (AP), acute bronchitis (AB), recurrent obstructive bronchitis (ROB), malformation of lungs (ML) and broncho-alveolar dysplasia (BALD) were studied. Carriage rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (up to 95%) and Haemophilus influenzae (up to 89%) in 240 children attending daycare centers and schools were determined. Etiology of infectious process was ascertained in 40% of cases. S. pneumoniae was isolated in 45% of acute cases (AP and AB) and in 25% of chronic cases (BALD). H. influenzae was isolated in 8 - 12% of acute cases and in 32% of chronic cases. In 23 - 29% of all cases of pulmonary pathology in children persistence of Enterococcus faecium was determined. There were 13 different serotypes among isolated pneumococci. In patients with pneumonia the rate of detection of S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae DNA fragments by PCR was significantly higher compared with rate of their isolation from sputum.
TI  - [Reversion of antibiotic-sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria in grafted cultures  of lymphoblastoid human cells].
AB  - The reversion of the antibiotic sensitivity of lactic acid bacteria: Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus plantarum have been studied. The phenomenon of the reversion has been fists studied in lactic acid bacteria of different taxonomic groups at their interactions with lymphoblastoid human cells. It is shown that resistance of lactobacteria to antibiotics can change depending on the terms of cultivation, genus and strain specificity. Most often the reversion of antibiotic sensitivity was observed with respect to fuzidin (26%) and cefepim (23%), most rarely--with respect to cephazolin, erithromicin, cefamandol, tobramicin and oxacillin.
TI  - A review of the current place of glycopeptides in turkish medical practice.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Glycopeptide antibiotics are considered by many investigators to be the last resort in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial infections. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review was to assess the place of glycopeptides in the treatment of common gram-positive bacteria in accordance with the current epidemiologic data in Turkey. METHODS: A search of both the English- and Turkish-language literature indexed on MEDLINE, Ulakbim (Turkey), and Pleksus (Turkey) was performed using the terms: vancomycin, teicoplanin, and glycopeptides, or their Turkish-language counterparts. The complete texts of the articles found in these databases were obtained from the electronic library of Gulhane Medical Academy, Ankara, Turkey. Articles from regional journals, without the support of an electronic format, were obtained by direct communication. Articles of interest were those based on studies occurring in Turkish populations, with special consideration given to publications in press after 2002. RESULTS: Staphylococci were the most frequent gram-positive pathogens encountered in Turkish hospitals. Studies have found that approximately 74% of strains were Staphylococcus aureus and the remaining strains were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Overall methicillin resistance in staphylococci was reported as approximately 60%. In Turkey, S aureus was one of the most common infectious agents found inside hospitals and is deemed a growing threat in the community. While the rate of methicillin resistance in community-acquired isolates is approximately 4%, the data from hospitals suggest that reduced resistance comprises most of the isolates. In the studies reviewed, older quinolones like ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin seem to be ineffective in nearly half of the S aureus isolates. Alternatives like rifampicin, gentamicin, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), clindamycin, and erythromycin have had substantial resistance profiles in >50% of the strains. In recent Turkish studies, in vitro profiles of linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin (QD), and daptomycin have had positive results. As in the S aureus isolates, resistance trends have been observed in the CoNS group of pathogens. The possible use of beta-lactams seems restricted, and alternative approaches have become necessary. Quinolones, gentamicin, tetracycline, TMP/SMX, clindamycin, and erythromycin have resistance profiles of >50%. Although glycopeptide resistance was not detected, the frequency of heterogenous vancomycin-intermediate S aureus, a precursor to future resistance, was 13% in 1 study. Current studies in Turkey have found that Enterococcus faecalis comprises three quarters of enterococci while the rest are comprised of Enterococcus faecium. Initial studies performed with linezolid, QD, and daptomycin suggest that these drugs might be effective alternatives for future enterococcal infections that may have high glycopeptide resistance. Approximately 8% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains had high-level resistance in Turkey. However, 10 million units of crystallized penicillin or 3 g of oral amoxicillin maintains the optimum treatment of pneumococcal infections outside the central nervous system (CNS). Resistance profiles in third-generation cephalosporins in Turkey range between 2% and 2.5%. CONCLUSIONS: In Turkey, a review of the existing literature found that the current use of glycopeptides in pneumococcal infections is restricted to CNS infections facing therapeutic failure in due course. However, the belief that these drugs are the last resort, either in staphylococcal or enterococcal infections, is no longer valid. If a patient has a critical status due to probable gram-positive microorganisms, clinicians should consider the empiric use of glycopeptides. However, new molecules such as linezolid, QD, and daptomycin, offered for use in the treatment of gram-positive bacterial diseases, should be reserved for the future, when glycopeptides eventually become obsolete.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Comparison of BACTEC PLUS blood culture media to BacT/Alert FA blood culture media for detection of bacterial pathogens in samples containing therapeutic levels of antibiotics.
AB  - Blood culture bottles with antimicrobial removal systems are recommended for patients who develop fever while on antibiotics. This study compared the ability of Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD) BACTEC PLUS bottles and bioMerieux (Durham, NC) BacT/Alert FA bottles to effectively remove vancomycin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin, oxacillin, gentamicin, and a combination of gentamicin/penicillin, thus allowing bacterial pathogens to grow. Each bottle was spiked with 10 ml of human blood, antibiotic, and strains of organisms susceptible to the antibiotic evaluated. The organisms used were type strains and clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin susceptible and resistant), Streptococcus pneumoniae, a viridans streptococcus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Testing was completed in triplicate, using 10 to 100 CFU/ml of organisms with various concentrations of each antibiotic. Two rounds of testing were completed per antibiotic/organism combination. Bottles were mixed and loaded onto their respective instruments as per the manufacturer's instructions. Antimicrobial removal was evaluated on the basis of time to detection of organism growth, for up to 5 days of incubation. Overall, the BacT/Alert FA system recovered 25.1% of strains from test bottles and 96.9% of strains from growth control bottles (no antibiotic added), and the BACTEC PLUS system recovered 95.1% of strains from test bottles and 100% of strains from growth control bottles. Both systems performed well in the detection of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the presence of gentamicin. In the presence of ceftriaxone, neither system was able to recover Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ability to remove vancomycin and cefoxitin was also determined by measuring antibiotic levels remaining in bottles after 1 h of incubation. The results demonstrated remaining levels of 72 to 90% of vancomycin and 71 to 72% of cefoxitin in the BacT/Alert system. For the BACTEC system, remaining levels were 0 to 30% of vancomycin and 0% of cefoxitin. Under these simulated conditions, the BACTEC PLUS system was superior to the BacT/Alert FA system in recovering gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens in the presence of beta-lactam antibiotics, gentamicin/penicillin, and vancomycin.
TI  - Antimicrobial therapy of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance among pneumococci, enterococci, and staphylococci has become increasingly important in recent decades. Clinicians should be familiar with the nuances of antibiotic susceptibility testing and interpretation in selecting antibiotics for these infections. The clinical significance of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, macrolide-resistant S pneumoniae, and multidrug-resistant S pneumoniae is discussed. The clinical spectrum and therapeutic approach to Enterococcus faecalis (i.e., vancomycin-sensitive enterococci) and E faecium (i.e., vancomycin-resistant enterococci) are discussed. Differences in therapeutic approach between methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) infections are reviewed. Differences between in vitro susceptibility testing and in vivo effectiveness of antibiotics for hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) are described. Finally, the clinical features of infection and therapy of HA-MRSA and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections are compared.
TI  - High prevalence of ceftazidime-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and increase of imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. in Korea: a KONSAR program in 2004.
AB  - A nationwide antimicrobial resistance surveillance has been conducted since 1997  in Korea. In this study, susceptibility test data generated in 2004 by KONSAR group hospitals were analyzed and compared to those at a commercial laboratory. In hospitals, the rank orders of organisms in 2004 were identical to those in 2003. The most prevalent species was Staphylococcus aureus (20.2%) in hospitals, but Escherichia coli (29.7%) in the commercial laboratory. The proportions of Enterococcus faecium to all isolates of Enterococcus faecalis plus E. faecium were 47.2% in hospitals and 24.9% in the commercial laboratory. The mean resistance rates of significant antimicrobial-organism combinations in hospitals were: oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (68%), oxacillin-resistant (penicillin- nonsusceptible) Streptococcus pneumoniae (68%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (25%), cefotaxime-resistant E. coli (14%), ceftazidime- and cefoxitin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (34% and 32%, respectively), and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17% and 24%, respectively). In conclusion, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa were prevalent in 2004. Increasing trends were observed for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, cefoxitin- resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. Certain antimicrobial- organism combinations were also prevalent among the commercial laboratory-tested strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in the southeastern Mediterranean--preliminary results from the ARMed project.
AB  - Sporadic reports from centres in the south and east of the Mediterranean have suggested that the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in this region appears to be considerable, yet pan-regional studies using comparable methodology have been lacking in the past. Susceptibility test results from invasive isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium and faecalis routinely recovered from clinical samples of blood and cerebrospinal fluid within participating laboratories situated in Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Tunisia and Turkey were collected as part of the ARMed project. Preliminary data from the first two years of the project showed the prevalence of penicillin non-susceptibility in S. pneumoniae to range from 0% (Malta) to 36% (Algeria) [median: 29%] whilst methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus varied from 10% in Lebanon to 65% in Jordan [median: 43%]. Significant country specific resistance in E. coli was also seen, with 72% of isolates from Egyptian hospitals reported to be resistant to third generation cephalosporins and 40% non-susceptible to fluoroquinolones in Turkey. Vancomycin non-susceptibility was only reported in 0.9% of E. faecalis isolates from Turkey and in 3.8% of E. faecium isolates from Cyprus. The preliminary results from the ARMed project appear to support previous sporadic reports suggesting high antibiotic resistance in the Mediterranean region. They suggest that this is particularly the case in the eastern Mediterranean region where resistance in S. aureus and E. coli seems to be higher than that reported in the other countries of the Mediterranean.
TI  - Use of the Phoenix automated system for identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus spp.
AB  - The Phoenix system (Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems, Sparks, MD) was evaluated for identification (ID) to the species level of streptococci and enterococci. Two hundred clinical isolates were investigated: beta-hemolytic streptococci (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae organisms (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 31), Enterococcus faecium (n = 36), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 25), and other catalase-negative cocci (n = 12). The API system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France) was used as a comparator. Molecular methods (sequencing of 16S rRNA and zwf and gki genes and ddl gene amplification) were used to investigate discordant results. Upon resolution of discrepancies, correct species ID was achieved by the Phoenix system for 121/129 (93.8%) streptococci and 63/70 (90.0%) enterococci. Excellent results were obtained for S. pneumoniae (45/45) and beta-hemolytic streptococci (49/50). With regard to viridans streptococci, the accuracy of the Phoenix system was 83.9%. Among the latter organisms, the best performance was obtained with isolates of the Streptococcus sanguinis group and Streptococcus anginosus group; problems were instead encountered with the Streptococcus mitis group. Four E. faecium and three E. faecalis isolates were misidentified as Enterococcus casseliflavus/Enterococcus gallinarum or Enterococcus durans. Thus, these isolates were identified only at the genus level. Compared with commercially available systems, the Phoenix system appears a reliable diagnostic tool for identifying clinically relevant streptococci and enterococci. The SMIC/ID-2 panel proved particularly effective for beta-hemolytic streptococci and pneumococci.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Gram-positive bacteria are common causes of bloodstream and other infections in hospitalized patients in the United States, and the percentage of nosocomial bloodstream infections caused by antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria is increasing. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) are of particular concern. In the United States, approximately 60% of staphylococcal infections in the intensive care unit are now caused by MRSA, and percentages continue to rise. Outbreaks of hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) are typically the result of clonal spread by MRSA being transferred from patient to patient, frequently using healthcare personnel as intermediaries. HA-MRSA strains are generally multidrug resistant. Vancomycin is the standard treatment for serious MRSA infections, but a few cases of vancomycin-resistant S aureus (VRSA) have recently emerged in the United States. Community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) is also increasing. Soft tissue infections are the most frequent presentations of CA-MRSA, but life-threatening invasive infections occur as well, including necrotizing pneumonia. The mechanisms of methicillin resistance are the same for CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA, but susceptibilities to non-a-lactam antibiotics often differ. CA-MRSA exhibits broader antibiotic susceptibility than does HA-MRSA. The proportion of enterococci resistant to vancomycin continues to rise in the hospital setting, with the overwhelming majority of infections due to Enterococcus faecium. Clonal spread of VRE has been documented, but polyclonal outbreaks associated with antimicrobial use are also common. The relations between antibiotic use and VRE colonization are complex and related to the antienterococcal activity, biliary excretion, and antianaerobic activity of the antibiotic. Recent results show a decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) since the introduction of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, and suggest that, where available, vaccines may be useful in the battle to slow the spread of resistant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [The effects of probiotics on symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome].
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal  (GI) tract disorder that has heterogeneous clinical presentations such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal distension. It is known that several mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of IBS. Probiotics may target one or more pathophysiologic pathways in IBS and may improve the symptoms of IBS. However, the results of studies about probiotics on IBS are controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of probiotics on GI symptoms and intestinal gas volume changes in patients with IBS. METHODS: Forty patients were randomly allocated to be treated with Medilac DS (Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus faecium) (n=20) or placebo (n=20) in a double-blind, prospective manner. The change in intestinal gas volume and symptom scores after 4-week treatment were evaluated for the efficacy. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in bloating, frequency of gas expulsion, frequency of defecation, and hardness of stool before and after the treatment. However, the severity of abdominal pain and the frequency of abdominal pain decreased significantly in Medilac DS group (2.4+/-1.3 cm/day --> 1.6+/-1.6 cm/day, 1.7+/-1.3/day --> 1.0+/-1.0/day) (p=0.044, p=0.038), but not in placebo group (2.1+/-2.0 cm/day --> 1.8+/-2.1 cm/day, 1.3+/-1.2/day --> 1.4+/-1.9/day). In both groups, intestinal gas volume at baseline, after 2-week treatment, and after 4-week treatment did not show significant change. Medilac DS was well tolerated without adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Medilac DS is a safe and useful probiotic agent for the treatment of abdominal pain in patients with IBS.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - Performance accuracy of antibacterial and antifungal susceptibility test methods: report from the College of American Pathologists Microbiology Surveys Program (2001-2003).
AB  - CONTEXT: The College of American Pathologists Microbiology Surveys Program provides external proficiency samples that monitor the performance of nearly 3000 laboratories that perform and report antimicrobial susceptibility tests. OBJECTIVE: To summarize results obtained with bacterial and yeast challenge samples (2001 through 2003). DESIGN: One organism every 4 months was tested by surveys participants against antibacterials/antifungals by routinely used methods. Reports were graded by interpretive category (susceptible, intermediate, resistant) based on an 80% consensus of referees/participants. RESULTS: The most common antibacterial test methods/systems were Vitek (38%-43%), MicroScan (39%-43%), and the disk diffusion test (14%-15%), although Etest was most used for fastidious species. YeastOne was the dominant antifungal test (50%-55%). Antifungal results demonstrated continuous, improved accuracy (83%-88%), highest for YeastOne (96%) and broth microdilution (95%) methods. Antibacterial test accuracy was consistently greater than 97% against gram-positive organism challenges and greater than 98% against gram-negative challenges. For gram-negative strains with well-characterized resistance mechanisms, the accuracy by method was disk diffusion greater than broth microdilution greater than automated systems. Major problems identified were (1) Haemophilus influenzae control ranges require re-evaluation, (2) overuse of beta-lactamase tests, (3) errors among Enterococcus faecium against penicillins (Vitek 2, MicroScan), (4) false-susceptible results with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole against coagulase-negative staphylococci (MicroScan), (5) macrolide false-susceptibility for beta-hemolytic streptococcus (MicroScan), (6) flawed reporting for antimicrobials not active at the infection site, (7) use of outdated interpretive criteria, and (8) failure to follow Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute testing/reporting recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Susceptibility tests were generally performing satisfactorily as measured by the surveys, but serious errors were identified with some drug/organism combinations that may require action by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute and/or the Food and Drug Administration.
TI  - DNA microarray for detection of macrolide resistance genes.
AB  - A DNA microarray was developed to detect bacterial genes conferring resistance to macrolides and related antibiotics. A database containing 65 nonredundant genes selected from publicly available DNA sequences was constructed and used to design 100 oligonucleotide probes that could specifically detect and discriminate all 65 genes. Probes were spotted on a glass slide, and the array was reacted with DNA templates extracted from 20 reference strains of eight different bacterial species (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Escherichia coli, and Bacteroides fragilis) known to harbor 29 different macrolide resistance genes. Hybridization results showed that probes reacted with, and only with, the expected DNA templates and allowed discovery of three unexpected genes, including msr(SA) in B. fragilis, an efflux gene that has not yet been described for gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Isolation and identification of mixed linked beta -glucan degrading bacteria in the intestine of broiler chickens and partial characterization of respective 1,3-1,4-beta -glucanase activities.
AB  - Media with 1,3-1,4-beta -glucans as selective markers were used for isolation of  non-starch-polysaccharide (NSP) degrading bacteria from the intestinal tract of broiler chicken. Formerly unknown 1,3-1,4-beta endoglucanase activities in various bacterial species were identified in this study. E. faecium , Streptococcus , Bacteroides and Clostridium strains seem to be responsible for degradation of mixed linked beta -glucans in the small intestine and in the hind gut of chickens. Strict anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides ovatus , B. uniformis , presumably B. capillosus and Clostridium perfringens ) as well as an unidentified bacterium with 98% 16S rDNA homology to an uncultered chicken cecum bacterium were isolated. Additionally, Streptococcus bovis with 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity was also detected. Different 1,3-1,4-beta -endoglucanase activity profiles were observed in SDS/PAGE zymograms.
TI  - [Antibiotic-resistance in Italy: activity of the first year of the surveillance project AR-ISS].
AB  - The antibiotic resistance surveillance project AR-ISS, started in 2001, is based  on a network of 62 sentinel microbiological laboratories throughout the country. The laboratories collect and transmit data to the Istituto Superiore di Sanita on the antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream isolates of 7 species: Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis/faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca ed Escherichia coli. They also send selected bacterial strains for further characterization. Results of the first year of surveillance are presented and are compared with data from the previous study EARSS-Italia and from other European countries. Oxacillin resistance in S. aureus appears to be stable, however, it remains one of the highest in Europe (41,5%). No strain with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to vancomycin has been isolated. In S. pneumoniae, the level of penicillin resistance is moderate (10,8%), but macrolide resistance has increased greatly (37,6% versus 28,6% of the previous study), following a tendency common to several European countries. Unexpectedly, vancomycin resistance in E. faecium was found to be 18%, the highest in Europe. Presumptive ESBL production in Gram-negative organisms can be estimated at 20% in Klebsiella and 1% in E. coli. Ampicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in E. coli (respectively 50% and 18%) are among the highest in Europe. In conclusion, the rate of antibiotic resistance in the species studied is worrisome and requires continuing monitoring. Although some activities of AR-ISS need improvements, the surveillance has the potentiality to produce relevant and representative data about antibiotic resistance in Italy that can be used for comparison at the European level.
TI  - The effect of temperature on the antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS.
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the survival of different bacteria inoculated in Optisol-GS at refrigerated storage temperature (6 degrees C) and after subsequent warming to room temperature (19-22 degrees C). METHODS: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were chosen from stock clinical isolates for inclusion in the study. The first group consisted of 12 Optisol-GS vials. The second group consisted of 12 Optisol-GS vials containing corneas inappropriate for transplantation according to the Eye Bank Association of America (EBAA) protocols. Each group was inoculated with 3 concentrations of approximately 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL of each bacterial species and then refrigerated per EBAA protocol. After 48 hours of refrigeration, all vials were placed at room temperature (RT) and counts were performed at 48, 50 (2 hour RT), 54 (6 hour RT), 60 (12 hour RT), 72 (24 hour RT), and 96 (48 hour RT) hours. At 96 hours, the corneal tissue from 10 and 10 inocula were cultured. All samples underwent serial dilution, spiral plating on blood agar plates, and incubation at 35 degrees C. Viable colony counts were determined at 24 hours. RESULTS: Except for the 10 CFU/mL inocula of P. aeruginosa, all isolates were viable after 48 hours of refrigeration. Rapid bactericidal activity was observed against P. aeruginosa after 2 hours at RT, with complete sterilization by 6 hours. The rate and extent of killing against S. aureus were influenced by the initial inoculum. Bactericidal activity was achieved after 2 hours at RT with 10 CFU/mL of S. aureus versus 24 hours with the 10 inoculum. Of note, bactericidal activity was not observed against S. pneumoniae and E. faecium following 24 hours of storage at RT. The presence of corneal tissue did not affect viable counts, with counts from corneal tissue cultures reflecting the counts seen from Optisol-GS after 48 hours at RT. CONCLUSIONS: The antimicrobial activity of Optisol-GS was reduced at refrigerated temperature and enhanced at RT. Bactericidal activity was not observed against E. faecium at either refrigerated temperature or RT.
TI  - Universal primers for detection of common bacterial pathogens causing prosthetic  joint infection.
AB  - The diagnosis of low grade prosthetic joint infection is difficult and time consuming. Nested-PCR for universal bacterial DNA segments detection of "orthopaedic" bacteria was tested in a laboratory setting. This method is based on amplification of the 16S bacterial ribosomal RNA coding sequences. 11 species of the most frequent bacterial pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens) involved in prosthetic joint infections were studied. All could be detected rapidly and sensitively by this method.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, LBM415, tested against respiratory tract and cutaneous infection pathogens: a global surveillance report (2003-2004).
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the spectrum of activity and potency of LBM415, the first of the peptide deformylase inhibitor (PDFI) class to be developed for treatment of community-acquired respiratory tract infections and uncomplicated skin and soft tissue infections (uSSTI), against a large, contemporary international collection of targeted pathogens collected during 2003-2004. METHODS: A total of 21,636 isolates were tested by reference broth microdilution methods as part of a longitudinal international antimicrobial resistance surveillance study. Characteristics of the organism collection included resistance to oxacillin among 35.0% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76.0% of coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS); resistance to penicillin (MIC > or = 2 mg/L) among 18.0% of Streptococcus pneumoniae; vancomycin resistance among 20.0% of Enterococcus spp. and ampicillin resistance among 22.0% of Haemophilus influenzae. RESULTS: LBM415 displayed potent activity against staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus faecium and Moraxella catarrhalis, with > or = 99.0% of strains being inhibited at < or = 4 mg/L; 97.0% of Enterococcus faecalis isolates and 92.0% of H. influenzae isolates were also inhibited at this concentration. Seventy-seven percent of Burkholderia cepacia and 82.0% of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were inhibited at < or = 8 mg/L. No differences in LBM415 activity against S. aureus, CoNS, S. pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp. and H. influenzae were detected for subsets susceptible or resistant to antimicrobials such as oxacillin, penicillin, ampicillin, macrolides, vancomycin and fluoroquinolones. While regional differences were apparent with some comparator agents, sensitivity to LBM415 did not vary significantly among strains from the various geographic areas sampled. One isolate of S. aureus displayed high-level resistance to LBM415 owing to multiple sequence changes in resistance phenotype genes (defB and fmt), despite the absence of the compound in clinical practice. This isolate remained susceptible to all other antimicrobials tested except for penicillin. CONCLUSIONS: With few differences detected among strains from various geographic regions, the first PDFI class agent to enter clinical development has consistently demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity against commonly isolated pathogens associated with uncomplicated respiratory and cutaneous infections. These compounds represent a significant therapeutic advance owing to their novel mechanism of action and antibacterial spectrum, including activity against resistant organisms, should pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters support their continued development. Given the detection of a pre-existing PDFI-resistant isolate of S. aureus as demonstrated here, surveillance for resistance among the PDFI-targeted pathogens following introduction of this class of agent into clinical usage will be an important component of future studies.
TI  - Susceptibility studies of piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate potential spectrum of action for piperazinyl-cross-linked fluoroquinolone dimers against test strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) and to evaluate dimers against fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci. Individual dimers displayed equivalent or lowered MIC values compared with parent fluoroquinolone monomers against test strains of S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, E. coli, and VRE. Raised MIC values were observed for all dimers in comparison to monomers against test strains of P. aeruginosa and E. coli. In comparison to parent fluoroquinolones, all dimers displayed decreased percent inhibition of growth against M. tuberculosis. Structural requirements for activity of dimers and partial dimers against all organisms, including lower MICs against certain fluoroquinolone-resistant and fluoroquinolone-susceptible strains of streptococci, were consistent with requirements previously observed for dimers against fluoroquinolone-susceptible and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus. In contrast, the 10- to 100-fold lowering of MICs against wild-type and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of S. aureus previously observed for individual cross-linked dimers was not observed with test strains of the various organisms used here.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in organ transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab: no evidence of occurrence of organisms typically associated with profound T cell depletion.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alemtuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52, a cell surface antigen expressed on B and T lymphocytes, monocytes and NK cells. Its use results in a profound decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. Alemtuzumab is used as induction immunosuppression and therapy for rejection in organ transplant recipients in some centers. We followed a cohort of 449 consecutive transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab to determine the occurrence of bloodstream infections, particularly those previously associated with decrease in CD4 positive T lymphocytes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen percent (69/449) patients had at least one episode of bloodstream infection. However, no patient had bacteremia with Streptococcus pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, non-typhoidal Salmonella or Mycobacterium avium complex. Fungaemia was rare, occurring in 1.5% of patients. The most common organisms isolated from the blood were Staphylococcus aureus (21 episodes), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (14 episodes), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (11 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 episodes), Enterococcus faecalis (9 episodes) and Escherichia coli (7 episodes). DISCUSSION: We conclude that although alemtuzumab use is associated with profound CD4 positive T lymphocyte depletion, alemtuzumab does not seem to be associated with an increased risk of bloodstream infection with pathogens typically seen in other disorders of CD4 cell depletion, such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
TI  - Activity of a new oral streptogramin, XRP2868, against gram-positive cocci harboring various mechanisms of resistance to streptogramins.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of XRP2868, a new oral streptogramin composed of a combination of RPR132552 (streptogramin A) and RPR202868 (streptogramin B), was evaluated against a collection of clinical gram-positive isolates with characterized phenotypes and genotypes of streptogramin resistance. The effects of genes for resistance to streptogramin A or B on the activity of XRP2868 and its components were also tested by cloning these genes individually or in various combinations in gram-positive recipient strains susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. The species tested included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other species of streptococci. XRP2868 was generally fourfold more potent than quinupristin-dalfopristin against S. aureus, E. faecium, and streptococci and had activity against E. faecalis (MICs = 0.25 to 1 microg/ml). XRP2868 appeared to be affected by the same mechanisms of resistance as those to quinupristin-dalfopristin. Nevertheless, the strong activity of factor A of the oral streptogramin enabled the combination to be very potent against streptogramin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci, and E. faecium (MICs = 0.03 to 0.25 microg/ml) and to retain low MICs against the strains harboring a mechanism of resistance to factor A or factor B of the streptogramin. However, the combination of mechanisms of resistance to factors A and B caused an increase in the MICs of XRP2868, which reached 1 to 4 mug/ml. As with the other streptogramins, there was a reduction in the bactericidal effect of XRPR2868 when the staphylococcal strains acquired a constitutively expressed erm gene.
TI  - Acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of diverse cat populations.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the resident intestinal microbiota of cats and to identify significant differences between various cat populations. Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and Streptococcus canis were isolated as faecal indicator bacteria from rectal swabs of 47 individually owned cats, 47 cattery cats and 18 hospitalised cats, and submitted through antimicrobial sensitivity tests. The results revealed that bacteria isolated from hospitalised and/or cattery cats were more frequently resistant than those from individually owned cats. E. coli isolates from hospitalised cats were particularly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and sulfonamide. Both enterococci and streptococci showed high resistance to tetracycline and in somewhat lesser extent to erythromycin and tylosin. Most E. faecium isolates were resistant to lincomycin and penicillin. One E. faecalis as well as one E. faecium isolate from hospitalised cats showed 'high-level resistance' (MIC > 500 microg/ml) against gentamicin, a commonly used antimicrobial agent in case of human enterococcal infections. The results of this research demonstrate that the extent of acquired antimicrobial resistance in the intestinal microbiota of cats depends on the social environment of the investigated population. It is obvious that the flora of healthy cats may act as a reservoir of resistance genes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of doripenem (S-4661): a global surveillance report (2003).
AB  - The spectrum of activity and potency of doripenem, a broad-spectrum parenteral carbapenem currently in clinical development, was evaluated using 16 008 clinical bacterial isolates collected as part of an international surveillance project during 2003. Using reference broth microdilution methods, doripenem was found to be highly active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (2705 and 297 isolates, respectively; MIC90s 0.06 mg/L), with a potency greater than that of other carbapenem antibiotics. Against enterococci (1474 isolates), with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, doripenem displayed modest activity (MIC50 4). Doripenem was among the most potent agents tested against Streptococcus pneumoniae, viridans group streptococci and beta-haemolytic streptococci (885, 140 and 397 isolates; MIC(90)s 0.5, 0.5 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). For Enterobacteriaceae (> 6200 isolates), doripenem was four- to 32-fold more active than imipenem against wild-type isolates (MIC90s 0.03-0.5 mg/L). MIC90s for confirmed extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (121 and 155 isolates; 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L, respectively) were two-fold higher than for wild-type isolates. Doripenem was also active against Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. (MIC90s 0.06-0.25 mg/L), including ceftazidime-resistant isolates. Doripenem and meropenem were the most active agents among all beta-lactams against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (829 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/8 and 0.5/16 mg/L, respectively), whereas doripenem and imipenem were the most active agents against Acinetobacter spp. (155 isolates; MIC50/90s 0.5/4 and <or= 0.5/2 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem was slightly more potent (MIC50 2 mg/L) than ertapenem and imipenem (MIC50 4 mg/L), and had a potency similar to that of meropenem (MIC50 2 mg/L), against Burkholderia cepacia (20 isolates). Both Haemophilus influenzae (1824 isolates) and Moraxella catarrhalis (108 isolates), including beta-lactamase-positive isolates, were susceptible to doripenem (MIC90s 0.25 and 0.03 mg/L, respectively). Doripenem displays the favourable characteristics of other carbapenems, and appears to offer certain advantages in terms of potency, spectrum and beta-lactamase stability when compared with some carbapenems used currently to treat nosocomial infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against key gram-positive organisms isolated in the united states: results of the LEADER 2004 surveillance program.
AB  - Since the approval of linezolid in 2000, sporadic reports of resistance have been given and a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of resistance has been gained. However, since these developments, an updated status of the in vitro activity of linezolid against gram-positive organisms from the United States has not been reported. The LEADER 2004 surveillance initiative was undertaken to obtain current and representative data on the activity of linezolid against key species, including isolates with significant resistance phenotypes. Organisms were isolated during 2004 and included 2,872 Staphylococcus aureus, 496 coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS), 428 Enterococcus faecalis, 196 Enterococcus faecium, and 422 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates. All S. aureus isolates (54.2% oxacillin resistant) were susceptible to linezolid (MIC90 = 2 microg/ml); MIC distributions were consistent, regardless of oxacillin or multidrug resistance status. For CNS, one nonsusceptible isolate was encountered (Staphylococcus epidermidis; MIC = 32 microg/ml), but overall, the MIC(90) (1 microg/ml) was lower than that obtained with S. aureus. For E. faecalis and E. faecium, 99.5% and 96.4% of isolates, respectively, were linezolid susceptible. Both species had an MIC90 of 2 microg/ml, and MIC distributions did not vary with the vancomycin susceptibility status of the populations analyzed. Linezolid nonsusceptibility was not encountered among the S. pneumoniae isolates. These findings indicate that linezolid nonsusceptibility has remained rare among staphylococci and uncommon and sporadic among enterococci. Nonetheless, careful and ongoing monitoring of the in vitro effectiveness of linezolid will be needed so that any changes to the current status may be detected as soon as possible.
TI  - Dutch guideline for preventing nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (HRMO).
AB  - Hospitals are faced with the increasingly rapid emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms. US and European guidelines on the prevention of antimicrobial resistance in hospitals were, until recently, mainly directed at methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In 2004, the Dutch Working Party on Infection Prevention issued a guideline on the prevention of nosocomial transmission of highly resistant microorganisms (HRMO), in order to fulfill the growing need for additional guidance on the control of other pathogens with acquired resistance and the potential to spread within hospitals (such as glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, extendedspectrum beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae, and other (multi)drug-resistant gram-negatives). In addition to providing criteria for defining HRMO, the Dutch guideline provides recommendations on isolation of patients, active surveillance, and contact tracing. The guideline will enable the comparison of HRMO rates between hospitals, and may be used to evaluate the efficacy of programs to control antibiotic use and/or nosocomial transmission of resistant pathogens. The eventual success of nationwide implementation of this guideline remains to be established in the coming years.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - Monitoring the lactic acid bacterial diversity during shochu fermentation by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The presence of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) during shochu fermentation was monitored by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and by bacteriological culturing. No LAB were detected from fermented mashes by PCR-DGGE using a universal bacterial PCR primer set. However, PCR-DGGE using a new primer specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Tetragenococcus, Enterococcus, and Vagococcus and two primers specific for the 16S rDNA of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, and Weissella revealed that Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus nagelii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Weissella cibaria inhabited in shochu mashes. It was also found that the LAB community composition during shochu fermentation changed after the main ingredient and water were added during the fermentation process. Therefore, we confirmed that PCR-DGGE using all three primers specific for groups of LAB together was well suited to the study of the LAB diversity in shochu mashes. The results of DGGE profiles were similar to the results of bacteriological culturing. In conclusion, LAB are present during shochu fermentation but not dominant.
TI  - [Elucidation of the taxonomic status of industrial strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes].
AB  - Phenotypic characteristics and results of PCR tests for the presence of species-specific genes indicate that a number of strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria previously considered as belonging to Streptococcus thermophilus are actually closely related to enterococci. In the present study, partial (over 500 nucleotides) sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from 12 strains of thermophilic lactic acid bacteria used as starters for manufacturing sour milk products on the territory of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has been performed. According to the results of the sequencing, seven of the strains have been classified with Enterococcus durans. The earlier classification (based on PCR tests) of two of the strains as S. thermophilus and three of the strains as E. faecium has been confirmed. The data obtained demonstrate that the enterococci E. durans and E. faecium are widely used as thermophilic starters for manufacturing sour milk products on the territory of the CIS.
TI  - Macrolide and lincosamide resistance genes of environmental streptococci from bovine milk.
AB  - Environmental streptococcus isolates from bovine milk were identified to the species and strain level and screened for resistance to macrolide and lincosamide antibiotics by phenotypic and genotypic methods. Isolates were tested for resistance to erythromycin and pirlimycin by broth microdilution assays. Presence of ribosomal methylase genes (ermA, ermB, ermC) and efflux pump genes (mefA/E, msrA/C) was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Resistance to pirlimycin (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 8microg/ml) was detected in 6 of 13 Enterococcus isolates that were identified as E. faecium by API20Strep typing. msrC was detected in 10 enterococcal isolates but the detection of msrC was not associated with phenotypic resistance. msrC negative isolates were reclassified as Enterococcus mundtii based on sequencing of housekeeping genes. Resistance to erythromycin and pirlimycin (MIC > 16microg/ml) was detected in 4 of 4 Streptococcus dysgalactiae and 12 of 20 Streptococcus uberis isolates and was encoded by ermB. All Streptococcus isolates tested negative for ermA, ermC, mefA/E and msrA/C. Among ermB positive streptococci, three alleles were identified based on a 527 bp gene fragment. Each allele was detected in at least two herds. The same alleles have also been detected in other bacterial species from bovine and non-bovine hosts and farm soil, suggesting a theoretical potential for horizontal transfer of macrolide resistance genes on dairy farms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of SM-216601, a new broad-spectrum  parenteral carbapenem.
AB  - SM-216601 is a novel parenteral 1beta-methylcarbapenem. In agar dilution susceptibility testing, the MIC of SM-216601 for 90% of the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains tested (MIC(90)) was 2 microg/ml, which was comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid. SM-216601 was also very potent against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(90) = 8 microg/ml). SM-216601 exhibited potent activity against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus mirabilis, with MIC(90)s of less than 0.5 microg/ml, and intermediate activity against Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The therapeutic efficacy of SM-216601 against experimentally induced infections in mice caused by S. aureus, E. faecium, E. coli, and P. aeruginosa reflected its in vitro activity and plasma level. Thus, SM-216601 is a promising candidate for nosocomial bacterial infections caused by a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including multiresistant pathogens.
TI  - Isolation of commensal bacteria from umbilical cord blood of healthy neonates born by cesarean section.
AB  - In a previous study, lactic acid bacteria were isolated from meconium obtained from healthy neonates born by cesarean section. Such a finding suggested that term fetuses are not completely sterile, and that a mother-to-child efflux of commensal bacteria may exist. Therefore, presence of such bacteria in umbilical cord blood of healthy neonates born by elective cesarean section was investigated. The blood samples were submitted to an enrichment step and then inoculated onto agar plates. All the identified isolates belonged to the genus Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, or Propionibacterium. Later, a group of pregnant mice were orally inoculated with a genetically labeled E. faecium strain previously isolated from breast milk of a healthy woman. The labeled strain could be isolated and polymerase chain reaction detected from the amniotic fluid of the inoculated animals. In contrast, it could not be detected in the samples obtained from a noninoculated control group.
TI  - Biodiversity of lactic acid bacteria in Moroccan soft white cheese (Jben).
AB  - The bacterial diversity occurring in traditional Moroccan soft white cheese, produced in eight different regions in Morocco, was studied. A total of 164 lactic acid bacteria were isolated, purified and identified by whole-cell protein fingerprinting and rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting. The majority of the strains belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc and Enterococcus. Sixteen species were identified: Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus buchneri, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Lactococcus raffinolactis, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc citreum, Eterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus saccharominimus and Streptococcus sp.
TI  - Enumeration and speciation of enterococci found in marine and intertidal sediments and coastal water in southern California.
AB  - AIMS: To determine the levels and species distribution of enterococci in intertidal and marine sediments and coastal waters at two beaches frequently in violation of bacterial water standards. METHODS AND RESULTS: Faecal indicator bacteria were extracted from sediment and enumerated using membrane filtration. High levels of enterococci were detected in intertidal sediments in a seasonal river and near a storm drain outlet. Low levels were found in marine sediments at 10 m depths and in surf zone sand. Bacterial isolates presumptively identified as Enterococcus on mEI media were speciated. The predominant species found in both water and sediment included Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus mundtii. A number of isolates (11-26%) from regulatory water samples presumptively identified as enterococci on mEI media were subsequently identified as species other than Enterococcus. At both study sites, the distribution of species present in water was comparable with those in sediments and the distribution of species was similar in water samples passing and exceeding bacterial indicator standards. CONCLUSIONS: High levels of Enterococcus in intertidal sediments indicate retention and possible regrowth in this environment. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Resuspension of enterococci that are persistent in sediments may cause beach water quality failures and calls into question the specificity of this indicator for determining recent faecal contamination.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against 6792 Gram-negative and Gram-positive clinical isolates from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program, 2004).
AB  - Tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antibiotic, has shown promising in vitro activity against many common pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains. To determine the activity of tigecycline against a broad range of pathogens from diverse populations and geographic areas, the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST Program) commenced in 2003. This study evaluated the activity of tigecycline and commonly used antimicrobials against 6792 clinical isolates from 40 study centers in 11 countries. Tigecycline was the most active agent tested against Gram-positive facultative species including multidrug-resistant strains. MIC90 results (microg/mL) for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 0.12, 0.12, 0.25, and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Tigecycline was active against Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC90 of 1 microg/mL. Haemophilus influenzae was very susceptible to tigecycline with an MIC90 of only 0.25 microg/mL. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the least susceptible organism tested against tigecycline. Tigecycline appears to be a promising new glycylcycline agent for the treatment of many types of pathogens with varying resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of seven novel tetramethylpiperidine-substituted phenazines against multiple-drug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A dramatic increase in multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) Gram-positive pathogens has occurred in recent times, leading to increased rates or morbidity and mortality and also associated with high costs for the treatment of these infections. It is clear that there is an urgent need for the development of effective antimicrobial agents. The anti-bacterial activity of seven 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TMP)-substituted phenazines, compared to clofazimine (B663), were tested against 70 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, MDR Streptococcus pneumoniae and resistant Enterococcus sp. METHODS: Standard minimum inhibitory concentration agar dilution susceptibility tests were done on all isolates, including ATCC control strains. RESULTS: All the TMP-substituted phenazines were more active than clofazimine against all isolates tested. Compound B4125 was the most active by inhibiting all growth of the organisms tested, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. CONCLUSION: Clofazimine has been shown to have anti-staphylococcal activity. We demonstrate enhanced anti-bacterial activity of TMP-substituted phenazines against drug-resistant Gram-positive organisms compared to clofazimine.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria isolated from spoiled black olives.
AB  - Bacteriocin-producing strains of Lactobacillus plantarum ST23LD and ST341LD, Enterococcus faecium ST311LD and Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides ST33LD were isolated from the brine of spoiled black olives. The bacteriocins produced by all four strains inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria (E. faecalis, L. casei and Streptococcus pneumoniae), but also Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Strain ST23LD produced two bacteriocins (ST23LDa and ST23LDb of approximately 3.0 and 14.0 kDa, respectively), with a combined maximum level of activity of 25,600 AU/ml after 18 h of growth. The same level of activity was recorded for bacteriocin ST341LD (approximately 3.0 kDa), but after 16 h. Bacteriocins ST311LD (ca. 2.3 kDa) and ST33LD (ca. 2.7 kDa) were produced at much lower levels (6400 AU/ml), and only after 20 h of growth. Bacteriocin activity was destroyed after treatment with proteolytic enzymes and Triton X, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea and EDTA, or when heated for 20 min at 121 degrees C. Addition of bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST311LD to cells of Lactobacillus casei LHS in logarithmic phase resulted in growth inhibition for one hour, followed by a slight increase in optical density over the next seven hours. Bacteriocin ST33LD also inhibited the growth of strain LHS, but to a lesser extent. Bacteriocins ST23LD, ST341LD and ST33LD remained at the same level of activity for 6 h at pH<4.0. However, the activity of bacteriocin ST311LD decreased by 50% within 2 h at pH 4.4. The possibility of the bacteriocin adsorbing to the producer cell and proteolytic degradation is unlikely.
TI  - Evaluation of negative results of BacT/Alert 3D automated blood culture system.
AB  - Although automated continuous-monitoring blood culture systems are both rapid and sensitive, false-positive and false-negative results still occur. The objective of this study, then, was to evaluate negative results occurring with BacT/Alert 3D blood culture systems. A total of 1032 samples were cultured with the BacT/Alert 3D automated blood culture system, using both aerobic (FA) and anaerobic (FN) [corrected] media, and 128 of these samples yielded positive results. A total of 904 negative blood samples were then subcultured in 5% sheep blood agar, eosin methylene blue, chocolate agar, and sabouraud-dextrose agar. Organisms growing on these subcultures were subsequently identified using both Vitek32 (bioMerieux, Durham, NC) and conventional methods. Twenty four (2.6%) of the 904 subcultures grew on the subculture media. The majority (83.3%) of these were determined to be gram-positive microorganisms. Fourteen (58.3%) were coagulase-negative staphylococci, two (8.3%) were Bacillus spp., one (4.2%) was Staphylococcus aureus, and one (4.2%) was identified as Enterococcus faecium. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria spp. were isolated together in two (8.3%) vials. Gram-negative microorganisms comprised 12.5% of the subcultures, of which two (8.3%) were found to be Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and one (4.2%) was Pseudomonas fluorescens. The other isolate (4.2%) was identified as Candida albicans. We conclude that the subculture of negative results is valuable in the BacT/Alert 3D system, especially in situations in which only one set of blood cultures is taken.
TI  - The streptogramin antibiotics: update on their mechanism of action.
AB  - Antibiotics of the streptogramin class are an association of two types of chemically different compounds, group A molecules and group B molecules, acting in synergy. The combination of these molecules generally inhibits bacterial growth at a lower concentration than does either the group A or group B molecule alone and is often bactericidal against strains of bacteria for which each type of molecule alone is only bacteriostatic. The semisynthetic streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500), the first water-soluble member of this class, is under development for the treatment of severe infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and other organisms. The streptogramins block the translation of mRNA into protein. Both group A and group B molecules bind to the peptidyl-transferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. The group B molecule stimulates the dissociation of peptidyl-tRNA from the ribosome and may interfere with the passage of the completed polypeptide away from the peptidyl-transferase centre. The group A molecule inhibits the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing both the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomal A site and the formation of the peptide bond. When the two types of molecule are used in combination, the binding of the group A molecule alters the conformation of the ribosome such that the affinity of the ribosome for the B molecule is increased. This accounts, in part or entirely, for the observed synergy. This synergy is unaffected by ribosomal modifications conferring resistance to the macrolides, lincosamides, and group B molecules alone.
TI  - Binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Protein(s) reactive with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. The molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions. The N-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found to react with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from different Gram-negative bacteria such as Esherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Salmonella abortus equi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexeneri, and Serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (LTA) from Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus sanguis, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus. The purified protein also reacted with E. coli O26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated Gram-positive bacteria such as S. aureus, B. cereus, B. subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, and Corynebacterum bovis. On the other hand, porcine IgG isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these LPS, LTA, and heat-treated bacterial cells. From the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with GlcNAc is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with Gram-positive and -negative bacteria.
TI  - [Analysis of microorganisms isolated from febrile neutropenic children with neoplastic disease].
AB  - The microbiological evaluation of the blood was carried out as a continued monitoring of the microorganism culture using the colourmetric system VITAL 200 (bio-Merieux). There have been analysed 4660 bacteriological research results of the peripheral blood, blood from Broviac and from Broviac liquid of the children suffering from cancer treated in the years 1997-2000 in the Pediatric, Hematology and Oncology Clinique of the State Clinical Hospital in Bydgoszcz. There have been gained 1032 positive cultures from KZZ, KZB, PZB. There have been recognized 259 bacteremia and 22 fungemia by the children with fever in the neutropenia period. In the analysed four years in the blood dominated Gram-positive bacteria. Among Gram-positive bacteria there were mostly Staphylococcus spp. (42.5%), mostly CNS, fewer numerous were Streptococcus spp. (14.5%) and Corynebacterium spp. (5.9%). Among Gram-negative bacteria mostly were isolated Acinetobacter spp. (25.6%), Pseudomonas spp. (9.7%), E. coli (13.8%), Enterobacter spp. (13.9%), Klebsiella spp. (9.2%). There were observed few infections by strains resistant to many antibiotics, S. maltophilia, B. cepacia, E. faecium, S. haemolyticus. All strains Staphylococcus spp. were sensitive to vancomycin. There have not been found Enterococcus spp. resistant to glycopeptides. Most active against Gram-positive rods were carbapenems and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Linezolid for the treatment of a heteroresistant Staphylococcus aureus shunt infection.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria as the cause of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections is a disconcerting phenomenon that often requires the use of alternative antimicrobials due to resistance against commonly used agents. The following is a case report describing the successful treatment of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt infection caused by a heteroresistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus with linezolid. Linezolid may have utility in treating pediatric CNS infections due to its tolerability, excellent blood-brain barrier penetration, and activity against multiple resistant Gram-positive organisms such as S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - Analysis of the prevalence of tetracycline resistance genes in clinical isolates  of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in a Japanese hospital.
AB  - Prevalence of seven tetracycline resistance (TC(R)) genes--tet(L), tet(M), tet(K), tet(O), tet(S), tet(T), and tet(U)--which are known to be distributed to gram-positive cocci was analyzed for 224 Enterococcus faecalis and 46 Enterococcus faecium clinical isolates obtained in a Japanese hospital. Any of the TC(R) genes was detected in 75.9% of all the enterococcal strains. The tet(M) was detected at highest rates in both E. faecalis (75.0%) and E. faecium (69.6%), followed by tet(L), which was harbored in 6.7% of E. faecalis isolates and 30.4% of E. faecium isolates. The tet(O), tet(S), and tet(T) were detected in E. faecalis at low frequencies mostly associated with tet(M), while tet(K) and tet(U) were not detected. Nucleotide sequences of tet(S) from E. faecalis strains were identical to that reported in Listeria monocytogenes. Sequences of tet(O) from two E. faecalis strains were almost identical to each other and also to those from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus mutans, Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli, although minor sequence divergence was observed. The tet(T), which had been reported only in Streptococcus pyogenes, was found in five E. faecalis strains. Sequence of the enterococcal tet(T) differed from that of S. pyogenes by only four nucleotides (four amino acids) and showed high sequence identity (99.8%, amino acid level). Enterococcal strains with any one TC(R) gene or those with two TC(R) genes showed generally similar MICs of tetracyclines, and no evident difference in resistance level was observed.
TI  - Rapid identification of dairy lactic acid bacteria by M13-generated, RAPD-PCR fingerprint databases.
AB  - About a thousand lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from dairy products, especially cheeses, were identified and typed by species-specific PCR and RAPD-PCR, respectively. RAPD-PCR profiles, which were obtained by using the M13 sequence as a primer, allowed us to implement a large database of different fingerprints, which were analysed by BioNumerics software. Cluster analysis of the combined RAPD-PCR fingerprinting profiles enabled us to implement a library, which is a collection of library units, which in turn is a selection of representative database entries. A library unit, in this case, can be considered to be a definable taxon. The strains belonged to 11 main RAPD-PCR fingerprinting library units identified as Lactobacillus casei/paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactococcus lactis. The possibility to routinely identify newly typed, bacterial isolates by consulting the library of the software was valued. The proposed method could be suggested to refine previous strain identifications, eliminate redundancy and dispose of a technologically useful LAB strain collection. The same approach could also be applied to identify LAB strains isolated from other food ecosystems.
TI  - Trends in linezolid susceptibility patterns in 2002: report from the worldwide Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Program.
AB  - Oxazolidinones have become reliable clinical and candidate antimicrobial agents to be utilized for infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive cocci, especially vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. However, mutational resistance of the ribosomal target has been described for several species. Longitudinal surveillance remains necessary to monitor for this evolving linezolid resistance pattern. A survey of linezolid and several comparison Gram-positive focused agents was initiated in 2002 (7971 strains, >99.0% compliance) for 54 participating sites in the United States, Canada, Europe (6 nations), Latin America (2 nations), and the Asia Pacific (2 nations). The 5 and 25 sites in Canada and the United States, respectively, submitted 200 strains each to a central laboratory for organism identification/confirmation and reference MIC processing. The 10 remaining nations had 200 strain samples from 1 to 4 separate institutions. Linezolid resistance (MIC >/= 8 microg/mL) was confirmed by alternative susceptibility testing methods (Etest, AB BIO Disk, Solna, Sweden; disk diffusion method) and target mutation characterization by PCR and sequence analysis. Linezolid activity against the 6 major organism groups did not vary between geographic areas. A total of 98.1% of linezolid MIC values were between 0.5 and 2 microg/mL, and only 0.5% of results were at 4 microg/mL, which included 32 Staphylococcus aureus (0.9%) and 5 (0.5%) enterococcal isolates. Linezolid resistance was detected in only 4 isolates (0.05%): 1 each Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecium, and a viridans group Streptococcus. All 4 isolates had a G2576U mutation in the 23S rRNA target. Linezolid activity as outlined by these Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum (ZAAPS) Program results demonstrate sustained, near complete activity against contemporary Gram-positive isolates on 4 monitored continents and in centers utilizing oxazolidinones. Rare linezolid-resistant strains were identified in the United States only (0.05% resistance overall).
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium GM-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  - AIM: To partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the GM-1 strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: E. faecium GM-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin P. This bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Human defensins.
AB  - Antimicrobial peptides are small, cationic, amphiphilic peptides of 12-50 amino acids with microbicidal activity against both bacteria and fungi. The eukaryotic antimicrobial peptides may be divided into four distinct groups according to their structural features: cysteine-free alpha-helices, extended cysteine-free alpha-helices with a predominance of one or two amino acids, loop structures with one intramolecular disulfide bond, and beta-sheet structures which are stabilised by two or three intramolecular disulfide bonds. Mammalian defensins are part of the last-mentioned group. The mammalian defensins can be subdivided into three main classes according to their structural differences: the alpha-defensins, beta-defensins and the recently described theta-defensins. Mammalian alpha-defensins are predominantly found in neutrophils and in small intestinal Paneth cells, whereas mammalian beta-defensins have been isolated from both leukocytes and epithelial cells. Recently, two novel human beta-defensins, human beta-defensin-3 (HBD-3), and human beta-defensin-4 (HBD-4) have been discovered. Similar to HBD-1 and HBD-2, HBD-3 has microbicidal activity towards the Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli) and the yeasts Candida albicans and Malassezia furfur. In addition, HBD-3 kills Gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes or Staphylococcus aureus, including multi-resistant S. aureus strains, and even vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. In contrast to HBD-1 and HBD-2, significant expression of HBD-3 has been demonstrated in non-epithelial tissues, such as leukocytes, heart and skeletal muscle. HBD-4 is expressed in certain epithelia and in neutrophils. Its bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa is stronger than that of the other known beta-defensins. Here we present an overview of human antimicrobial peptides with some emphasis on their antifungal properties.
TI  - Production of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12 by murine colonic dendritic cells in  response to microbial stimuli.
AB  - Intestinal dendritic cells (DC) are likely to regulate immunity to gut microflora, but little is known about their responses to bacterial antigens. Therefore, DC from normal murine colon were characterized and their cytokine responses to components of Gram-negative and/or Gram-positive bacteria assessed. Cells were obtained by digestion of colonic tissue and contained DC that were identified by flow cytometry as CD11c(+) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II(+) cells. Purified DC were obtained by immunomagnetic separation plus cell sorting. DC had the morphology of immature myeloid cells, were endocytically active, expressed low levels of co-stimulatory molecules and stimulated a weak allogeneic mixed leucocyte reaction. Analysis of flow cytometry data by a sensitive subtraction method allowed measurement of production of interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10 by small numbers of gut DC by intracellular staining. Fewer than 5% of unstimulated DC produced either IL-10 or IL-12. IL-10 production was significantly up-regulated following stimulation with Bifidobacteria longum, but not after exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or Streptococcus faecium. In contrast, colonic DC produced IL-12 in response to both LPS and B.longum. Thus, colonic DC can produce both IL-12 and IL-10 following bacterial stimulation. Cell wall components from different bacteria stimulate distinct responses and may direct immune responses differentially in the gut.
TI  - Surveillance of linezolid resistance in Germany, 2001-2002.
AB  - A surveillance study was performed throughout Germany from November 2001 to June  2002 to assess the prevalence of linezolid-resistant isolates among Gram-positive bacteria from routine susceptibility data and to compare the in-vitro activity of linezolid to that of other antibacterial agents. Each of 86 laboratories provided routine susceptibility data for 100 consecutive isolates. Most laboratories (c. 60%) used the disk diffusion test. Laboratories were also requested to send a representative sample of their isolates, as well as all isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid, to a reference laboratory for MIC determination. Susceptibility data for 8594 isolates were evaluated. Sites of infection were skin and soft tissue (29.9%), upper and lower respiratory tract (19.1%), foreign body or catheter (10.5%), or urinary tract (9.8%). Routine linezolid susceptibility data were reported for 6433 isolates. The prevalence of linezolid resistance, as reported to the clinician, was 0.4% in Staphylococcus aureus, 0.3% in Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2.9% in Enterococcus faecalis, 2.3% in Enterococcus faecium, 1.4% in Streptococcus pyogenes and 2.9% in Streptococcus agalactiae. Linezolid resistance was not detected in Streptococcus pneumoniae or in viridans group streptococci. Sixty-nine of 115 isolates reported as intermediate or resistant to linezolid were retested, but none was resistant to linezolid. Linezolid exhibited excellent in-vitro activity against representative isolates of the six most frequently encountered species (MIC90, 1-2 mg/L). The prevalence of resistance to linezolid was very low in Germany. Organisms reported as linezolid-resistant should be retested, either in the same laboratory with an alternative method or in a reference laboratory.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline against clinical isolates from Shanghai, China.
AB  - To evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline, the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of tigecycline against 1,201 strains of recent clinical isolates from 10 hospitals in Shanghai, China were determined and compared with selected comparators. Results showed that tigecycline had broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. It was highly active against Gram-positive cocci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp., penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Tigecycline also had good activity against most strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. However, it was poorly active against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Tigecycline was highly active against anaerobic Gram-positive cocci such as Peptococcus spp. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was significantly better than that of minocycline and tetracycline. It was as active as or slightly more active than vancomycin and teicoplanin in the activity against resistant aerobic Gram-positive cocci. Tigecycline was bactericidal against all Gram-positive cocci tested except Enterococcus spp. Inoculum size but not pH of medium or concentration of human serum in broth had significant effect on the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Aged media (48-72 hours after preparation) used in the test and specific resistance problem in China may have some effects on MIC values of tigecycline.
TI  - Potent antibacterial activity of halogenated compounds against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Common Gram-positive clinical pathogens are showing an increasing trend for resistance to conventional antimicrobial agents. New drugs with potent antibacterial activities are urgently needed to remediate this problem. Halogenated compounds isolated from several species of the red algae genus Laurencia were examined for their antibacterial activity against 22 strains of human pathogenic bacteria, 7 strains of which were antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Four phenolic sesquiterpenes and a polybrominated indole showed wide spectra of antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (VRE). In addition, laurinterol and allolaurinterol displayed potent bactericidal activity against three strains of MRSA at 3.13 microg mL(-1), and three strains of vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus, at 3.13 microg mL(-1) and 6.25 microg mL(-1), respectively.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of daptomycin against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive strains collected worldwide.
AB  - Daptomycin is a cyclic lipopeptide recently released for clinical use in the treatment of serious Gram-positive infections in hospitalized patients. We evaluated the in vitro activity of daptomycin tested against recently isolated multidrug-resistant Gram-positive clinical strains. A total of 386 isolates were selected from a large collection of strains from more than 70 centers located in Europe, North America, and South America. The strains were tested by reference broth microdilution methods in Mueller-Hinton broth with 50 mg/L Ca++ against daptomycin. Daptomycin was the most potent compound tested against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae with MIC50/90 values at < or =0.12 and 0.25 microg/mL, respectively. Daptomycin was also highly active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and staphylococcal strains with various resistance patterns. Enterococcus faecium showed higher daptomycin MIC values (MIC90, 4 microg/mL) when compared to E. faecalis (MIC90, 1 microg/mL). In summary, resistance to vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, or penicillin among the Gram-positive isolates did not adversely influence daptomycin activity. Daptomycin showed a significant potency and spectrum against Gram-positive species, including multidrug-resistant strains, and may represent a reasonable therapeutic option for infections caused by these important pathogens.
TI  - A new phenotype of resistance to lincosamide and streptogramin A-type antibiotics in Streptococcus agalactiae in New Zealand.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize a new type of resistance to clindamycin in Streptococcus agalactiae. METHODS: Nineteen erythromycin-susceptible, clindamycin-resistant S. agalactiae isolates from New Zealand were studied. MICs of macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin antibiotics were determined. Clindamycin and streptogramin resistance genes were searched for by PCR. Isolates were compared by serotyping and by DNA macrorestriction patterns determined by PFGE. Conjugative transfer of resistance traits to recipient strains of S. agalactiae and Enterococcus faecium was assayed. RESULTS: The 19 S. agalactiae isolates were intermediate or resistant to clindamycin (MIC range: 0.5-2 mg/L) and lincomycin (MIC range: 1-8 mg/L) and had high MICs of dalfopristin (4-32 mg/L), a streptogramin A-type antibiotic, compared with controls. By contrast, the strains were susceptible to macrolides and quinupristin, a streptogramin B-type antibiotic. This new phenotype was called LSA (lincosamide-streptogramin A). Clindamycin resistance could not be transferred to recipient strains. Thirteen isolates belonged to serotype III and to a single PFGE genotype A, and five isolates belonged to serotype I and to genotype B. One isolate was non-typeable and belonged to a distinct genotype C. CONCLUSIONS: We have characterized a new LSA phenotype in S. agalactiae. Analysis of restriction patterns of S. agalactiae chromosomal DNA showed that the resistance was spread in a minimum of three bacterial clones. The genetic and biochemical basis for the resistance remains unknown.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Alkali-resistant bacteria in root canal systems.
AB  - The aim of this study was to isolate and identify alkali-resistant bacteria from  the dentin of infected root canals. Bacteria from homogenized dentin powder made up from infected root canal walls from human teeth were cultured on buffer-enriched Brain Heart Infusion agar supplemented with 4% sheep blood (BHI-blood agar), adjusted to pH 7.0, 9.0 or 10.0. Incubation took place for 7 days at 37 degrees C in an anaerobic glove box. Bacterial strains selected according to colony and morphology were subcultured in buffer-enriched BHI broth adjusted to pH 9.0, 10.0 or 11.0 to confirm their growth as alkali-resistant bacteria. Polymerase chain reaction amplification using specific primer sets and 16S rDNA sequence analysis was performed for identification of alkali-resistant isolates. In the present study, 37 teeth extracted from 37 patients were used for preparation of the dentin powder samples. Bacteria were detected in 25 samples when standard BHI-blood agars (pH 7.0) were used. Of these, 29 strains from 15 samples were alkali resistant, 25 strains growing at pH 9.0 and 4 at pH 10.0. The alkali-resistant strains included Enterococcus faecium (10 strains) and Enterococcus faecalis (2 strains), Enterobacter cancerogenus (1 strains), Fusobacterium nucleatum (1 strains), Klebsiella ornithinolytica (2 strains), Lactobacillus rhamnosus (2 strains), Streptococcus anginosus (2 strains), Streptococcus constellatus (3 strains), and Streptococcus mitis (2 strains). Three strains were also identified as bacteria of genus Firmicutes or Staphylococcus at the genus level. The present study showed that many bacterial species in infected root canal dentin were alkali-resistant at pH 9.0 and/or pH 10.0, and belonged mainly to the genus Enterococcus.
TI  - Antimicrobial evaluation of nocathiacins, a thiazole peptide class of antibiotics.
AB  - Nocathiacins are cyclic thiazolyl peptides with inhibitory activity against gram-positive bacteria. BMS-249524 (nocathiacin I), identified from screening a library of compounds against a multiply antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecium strain, was used as a lead chemotype to obtain additional structurally related compounds. The MIC assay results of BMS-249524 and two more water-soluble derivatives, BMS-411886 and BMS-461996, revealed potent in vitro activities against a variety of gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin intermediate-resistant S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium. Analysis of killing kinetics revealed that these compounds are bactericidal for S. aureus with at least a 3-log(10) reduction of bacterial growth within 6 h of exposure to four times the MICs. Nocathiacin-resistant mutants were characterized by DNA sequence analyses. The mutations mapped to the rplK gene encoding the L11 ribosomal protein in the 50S subunit in a region previously shown to be involved in the binding of related thiazolyl peptide antibiotics. These compounds demonstrated potential for further development as a new class of antibacterial agents with activity against key antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacterial pathogens.
TI  - Bacteriology and somatic cell counts in milk samples from ewes on a Scottish farm.
AB  - Milk samples from 50 sheep on a single Scottish research farm were collected weekly for 10 wk postpartum. Samples were analyzed for somatic cell counts (SCC) each week and bacteriologic culture was done for 7 of the 10 wk. A total of 492 udder half samples were cultured, of which 467 had corresponding cell count data. Statistical analysis on complete SCC and culture data showed no association between SCC and bacterial isolation, even when more than 10 colonies of a single bacterial species were present. Only 3.6% of the samples were simultaneously positive for high count (> 10 colonies from 0.01 mL of milk) of any one bacterial species and high SCC (> 1 x 10(6)/mL). The bacteria recovered were: Staphylococcus equorum (19 times), S. xylosus (7 times), S. simulans (6 times), Streptococcus uberis (3 times) and other streptococci (4 times), Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica (2 times), Staphylococcus aureus (1 time), S. capitis (1 time), and Enterococcus faecium (1 time). There was an association between the test day and SCC, with higher SCC values in the first 2 wk. In addition, significantly higher SCC values were found in the oldest animals compared to the other age groups.
TI  - Emerging resistance among bacterial pathogens in the intensive care unit--a European and North American Surveillance study (2000-2002).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally ICUs are encountering emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and for some pathogens there are few therapeutic options available. METHODS: Antibiotic in vitro susceptibility data of predominant ICU pathogens during 2000-2 were analyzed using data from The Surveillance Network (TSN) Databases in Europe (France, Germany and Italy), Canada, and the United States (US). RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance rates among Staphylococcus aureus isolates ranged from 19.7% to 59.4%. Penicillin resistance rates among Streptococcus pneumoniae varied from 2.0% in Germany to as high as 20.2% in the US; however, ceftriaxone resistance rates were comparably lower, ranging from 0% in Germany to 3.4% in Italy. Vancomycin resistance rates among Enterococcus faecalis were < or = 4.5%; however, among Enterococcus faecium vancomycin resistance rates were more frequent ranging from 0.8% in France to 76.3% in the United States. Putative rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production among Enterobacteriaceae were low, <6% among Escherichia coli in the five countries studied. Ceftriaxone resistance rates were generally lower than or similar to piperacillin-tazobactam for most of the Enterobacteriaceae species examined. Fluoroquinolone resistance rates were generally higher for E. coli (6.5% - 13.9%), Proteus mirabilis (0-34.7%), and Morganella morganii (1.6-20.7%) than other Enterobacteriaceae spp (1.5-21.3%). P. aeruginosa demonstrated marked variation in beta-lactam resistance rates among countries. Imipenem was the most active compound tested against Acinetobacter spp., based on resistance rates. CONCLUSION: There was a wide distribution in resistance patterns among the five countries. Compared with other countries, Italy showed the highest resistance rates to all the organisms with the exception of Enterococcus spp., which were highest in the US. This data highlights the differences in resistance encountered in intensive care units in Europe and North America and the need to determine current local resistance patterns by which to guide empiric antimicrobial therapy for intensive care infections.
TI  - Evaluation of the Hyplex BloodScreen Multiplex PCR-Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system for direct identification of gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures.
AB  - We evaluated the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system (BAG, Lich, Germany), a new diagnostic test for the direct identification of gram-negative bacilli and gram-positive cocci from positive blood cultures, with 482 positive BACTEC 9240 blood culture bottles. The test involves amplification of the bacterial DNA by multiplex PCR and subsequent hybridization of the PCR product to specific oligonucleotide probes in an ELISA-based format. The available probes allow the separate detection of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus pneumoniae and the staphylococcal mecA gene. The Hyplex BloodScreen test showed an overall sensitivity of 100% for the identification of gram-negative bacilli and 96.6 to 100% for the identification of gram-positive cocci (S. aureus, 100%; S. epidermidis, 97.2%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 96.6%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100%). The specificities of the test modules ranged from 92.5 to 100% for gram-negative bacilli and 97.7 to 100% for gram-positive cocci (Escherichia coli, 92.5%; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 98.5%; Klebsiella spp., 100%; Enterobacter aerogenes, 100%; S. aureus, 100%, S. epidermidis, 97.7%; Enterococcus faecalis/Enterococcus faecium, 99.6%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 100%; and Streptococcus pneumoniae, 99.3%). The result of the mecA gene detection module correlated with the result of the phenotypic oxacillin resistance testing in all 38 isolates of Staphylococcus aureus investigated. In conclusion, the Hyplex BloodScreen PCR-ELISA system is well suited for the direct and specific identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria and the direct detection of the mecA gene of Staphylococcus aureus in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Daptomycin in vitro susceptibility in European Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the activity of daptomycin, a novel  lipopeptide, against European Gram-positive isolates (n = 1539). The MIC(90)-values of daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus isolates was 0.25 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecalis 4 mg/L, against Enterococcus faecium 8 mg/L, 0.25 mg/L against Staphylococcus epidermidis, and 0.25mg/L against Streptococcus pneumoniae. Daptomycin was equally potent against antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains within a particular species. Based on a breakpoint of 1 mg/L for S. aureus and group A streptococci, all isolates tested were susceptible to daptomycin. Based on a breakpoint of 4 mg/L for vancomcyin-susceptible E. faecalis 99.7% of these isolates were susceptible to daptomycin.
TI  - Antigenotoxicity of probiotics and prebiotics on faecal water-induced DNA damage  in human colon adenocarcinoma cells.
AB  - Six strains of lactic acid producing bacteria (LAB) were incubated (1 x 10(8)cfu/ml) with genotoxic faecal water from a human subject. HT29 human adenocarcinoma cells were then challenged with the resultant samples and DNA damage measured using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. The LAB strains investigated were Bifidobacterium sp. 420, Bifidobacterium Bb12, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Enterococcus faecium. DNA damage was significantly decreased by all bacteria used with the exception of Strep. thermophilus. Bif. Bb12 and Lact. plantarum showed the greatest protective effect against DNA damage. Incubation of faecal water with different concentrations of Bif. Bb12 and Lact. plantarum revealed that the decrease in genotoxicity was related to cell density. Non-viable (heat treated) probiotic cells had no effect on faecal water genotoxicity. In a second study, HT29 cells were cultured in the presence of supernatants of incubations of probiotics with various carbohydrates including known prebiotics; the HT29 cells were then exposed to faecal water. Overall, incubations involving Lact. plantarum with the fructooligosaccharide (FOS)-based prebiotics Inulin, Raftiline, Raftilose and Actilight were the most effective in increasing the cellular resistance to faecal water genotoxicity, whereas fermentations with Elixor (a galactooligosaccharide) and Fibersol (a maltodextrin) were less effective. Substantial reductions in faecal water-induced DNA damage were also seen with supernatants from incubation of prebiotics with Bif. Bb12. The supernatant of fermentations involving Ent. faecium and Bif. sp. 420 generally had less potent effects on genotoxicity although some reductions with Raftiline and Elixor fermentations were apparent.
TI  - Results of a multicenter, randomized, open-label efficacy and safety study of two doses of tigecycline for complicated skin and skin-structure infections in hospitalized patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum glycylcycline antibiotic being investigated for the treatment of serious infections in hospitalized patients. Tigecycline has been shown to be efficacious against serious infections in animals, and preliminary studies in healthy adults have shown that tigecycline has an acceptable tolerability profile. OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and microbiological efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, and tolerability of 2 doses of tigecycline in hospitalized patients with a complicated skin and skin-structure infection (cSSSI). METHODS: This Phase II, randomized, open-label study was conducted between September 1999 and March 2001 at 14 investigative centers across the United States. Patients were randomized to receive tigecycline 25 or 50 mg IV q12h for 7 to 14 days. The primary efficacy end point was the clinically observed cure rate among clinically evaluable (CE) patients at the test-of-cure visit. Secondary end points were the clinical cure rate at the end of treatment and bacteriologic response in microbiologically evaluable (ME) patients. Also, in vitro tests of susceptibility to tigecycline were performed for selected pathogens known to cause skin infections, including methicillin-resistant and methicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. Tolerability assessments also were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 160 patients received > or =1 dose of tigecycline; 109 patients were CE, and 91 were ME. The majority of patients (74%) were men, and the mean (SD) age was 49.0 (14.8) years. At the test-of-cure visit, the clinical cure rate in the 25-mg group was 67% (95% CI, 53.3%-79.3%) and in the 50-mg group was 74% (95% CI, 60.3%-85.0%). In the 25-mg group, 56% of the patients had eradication (95% CI, 40.0%-70.4%) of the pathogens compared with 69% (95% CI, 54.2%-82.3%) in the 50-mg group. Values for the minimum concentration of tigecycline that is inhibitory for 90% of all isolates ranged from 0.06 to 0.50 microg/mL for the selected pathogens. Both tigecycline doses were generally well tolerated. Nausea and vomiting were the most common adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, tigecycline appeared efficacious and showed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile and an acceptable safety profile in the treatment of hospitalized patients with cSSSI. In patients who received 50-mg doses of tigecycline q12h, the clinical cure rates and microbial eradication rates were 74% and 70%, respectively, and were 67% and 56% in patients who received 25-mg doses.

TI  - [Analysis of monosaccharides of bacterial glycocalix of Bacillus-Lactobacillus-Streptococcus group by gas-chromatography].
AB  - The glycocalix of some bacteria of the Bacillus--Lactobacillus--Streptococcus (Bacillus subtilis 3, B. subtilis 668, B. licheniformis 31, Lactobacillus plantarum 11/16, Enterococcus faecium K-50) group were isolated and composition of neutral monosaccharides was investigated. Such sugars as rhamnose, ribose, fucose, arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose, and glucose were found in the investigated representatives of genus Bacillus--Lactobacillus--Streptococcus. Presence of significant quantity of glucose and galactose did not depend on cultivation conditions. This fact testifies to its conservatism and a possibility to use it as phylogenetic marker.
TI  - Susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway.
AB  - A total of 839 clinical isolates of Gram-positive cocci from Norway including Staphylococcus aureus (n = 214), coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp. (n = 100), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 99), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 80), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 127), Streptococcus spp. viridans group (n = 70), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 75), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 74), were tested by E-test for susceptibility to a range of antimicrobials including the novel antibiotics quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid. Subgroups of oxacillin resistant S. aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus spp., penicillin non-susceptible S. pneumoniae and vancomycin resistant Enterococcus spp. were specifically included as they are the intended targets for these new drugs. All isolates were susceptible to linezolid (MIC5o and MIC9o 0.25-2.0 mg/l, MIC range 0.12-2 mg/l). Staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates were also susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin except for some intermediately susceptible viridans group isolates (MIC54, and MIC90 0.25-2 mg/l, MIC range 0.125-2 mg/l). Enterococcus faecium (MIC90 = 4.0 mg/l) and Enterococcus faecalis (MIC50 = 8.0 mg/l, MIC90 > or = 32 mg/l) were less susceptible to this substance. There was no linkage between reduced susceptibility to linezolid or quinupristin-dalfopristin and resistance to other classes of antimicrobials. The study demonstrated a high prevalence of in vitro susceptibility to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin, which is necessary for their use in the treatment of infections with resistant Gram-positive pathogens. The results were used to evaluate the appropriateness of breakpoints and to define a baseline for monitoring possible future emergence of resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid in Norway.
TI  - Diversity of lactic acid bacteria isolated from AOC Salers cheese.
AB  - The objective of this work was to describe the diversity of lactic acid bacteria  in traditional raw milk Salers cheeses at the species and strain levels. The characterization of 381 strains isolated during ripening and various strain collections was investigated using physiological analysis and molecular techniques: Rep-PCR, species and genus specific amplifications and the sequence analysis of 16S rDNA for strain typing and taxonomic identification. The strains belonged to Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garviae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus millieri, Streptococcus macedonicus and Pediococcus pentosaceus. A wide phenotypic and genomic heterogeneity was observed within the different species (Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides) according to the origin and the time of ripening. The natural microflora was different from strain collection and each method must be combined to identify and characterize natural microflora. This study revealed the low selectivity of selective media used for the isolation of different groups of lactic acid bacteria except the Facultatively Heterofermentative lactobacilli medium selecting mesophile lactobacilli and SB medium selective for Enterococcus. The study reveals, for the first time, the microbial lactic acid bacteria community of Salers cheese and its diversity. A better knowledge of microbial flora will be useful to improve understanding of sensory quality of cheeses.
TI  - Identification and characterization of the novel LysM domain-containing surface protein Sep from Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 and its use as a peptide fusion partner in Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.
AB  - Examination of supernatant fractions from broth cultures of Lactobacillus fermentum BR11 revealed the presence of a number of proteins, including a 27-kDa protein termed Sep. The amino-terminal sequence of Sep was determined, and the gene encoding it was cloned and sequenced. Sep is a 205-amino-acid protein and contains a 30-amino-acid secretion signal and has overall homology (between 39 and 92% identity) with similarly sized proteins of Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Lactobacillus plantarum. The carboxy-terminal 81 amino acids of Sep also have strong homology (86% identity) to the carboxy termini of the aggregation-promoting factor (APF) surface proteins of Lactobacillus gasseri and Lactobacillus johnsonii. The mature amino terminus of Sep contains a putative peptidoglycan-binding LysM domain, thereby making it distinct from APF proteins. We have identified a common motif within LysM domains that is shared with carbohydrate binding YG motifs which are found in streptococcal glucan-binding proteins and glucosyltransferases. Sep was investigated as a heterologous peptide expression vector in L. fermentum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactococcus lactis MG1363. Modified Sep containing an amino-terminal six-histidine epitope was found associated with the cells but was largely present in the supernatant in the L. fermentum, L. rhamnosus, and L. lactis hosts. Sep as well as the previously described surface protein BspA were used to express and secrete in L. fermentum or L. rhamnosus a fragment of human E-cadherin, which contains the receptor region for Listeria monocytogenes. This study demonstrates that Sep has potential for heterologous protein expression and export in lactic acid bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of bacteria isolated from blood cultures of hospitalized patients in the United States in 2002.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections are associated with significant patient morbidity and mortality. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns should guide the choice of empiric antimicrobial regimens for patients with bacteremia. METHODS: From January to December of 2002, 82,569 bacterial blood culture isolates were reported to The Surveillance Network (TSN) Database-USA by 268 laboratories. Susceptibility to relevant antibiotic compounds was analyzed using National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. RESULTS: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (42.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.5%), Enterococcus faecalis (8.3%), Escherichia coli (7.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (3.6%), and Enterococcus faecium (3.5%) were the most frequently isolated bacteria from blood cultures, collectively accounting for >80% of isolates. In vitro susceptibility to expanded-spectrum beta-lactams such as ceftriaxone were high for oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (98.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (99.8%), E. coli (97.3%), K. pneumoniae (93.3%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (97.2%). Susceptibilities to fluoroquinolones were variable for K. pneumoniae (90.3-91.4%), E. coli (86.0-86.7%), oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (84.0-89.4%), oxacillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (72.7-82.7%), E. faecalis (52.1%), and E. faecium (11.3%). Combinations of antimicrobials are often prescribed as empiric therapy for bacteremia. Susceptibilities of all blood culture isolates to one or both agents in combinations of ceftriaxone, ceftazdime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam or ciprofloxacin plus gentamicin were consistent (range, 74.8-76.3%) but lower than similar beta-lactam or ciprofloxacin combinations with vancomycin (range, 93.5-96.6%). CONCLUSION: Ongoing surveillance for antimicrobial susceptibility remains essential, and will enhance efforts to identify resistance and attempt to limit its spread.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland 2001-2002: the BSAC Bacteraemia Resistance Surveillance Programme.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the current patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the major pathogens of bacteraemia in the UK and Ireland, to highlight any unexpected resistance patterns and to act as a reference baseline for future studies. METHODS: In 2001 and 2002, 5092 blood culture isolates were collected by 29 laboratories distributed across the UK and Ireland. A single central laboratory re-identified the isolates and measured MICs by the BSAC agar dilution method. RESULTS: Oxacillin resistance was found in 42% of Staphylococcus aureus and 76% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Streptococci were generally susceptible to beta-lactams, but tetracycline resistance was common (except in Streptococcus pneumoniae) and particularly common among group B isolates (82% resistant). Nine percent of S. pneumoniae had reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MICs 0.12-1 mg/L), but none required >/=2 mg/L for inhibition. High-level gentamicin resistance was seen in 43% of Enterococcus faecalis, often in combination with raised ciprofloxacin MICs (>/=32 mg/L), but these isolates remained susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem. Only linezolid and tigecycline showed in vitro potency against a large proportion of Enterococcus faecium. Vancomycin resistance was restricted to enterococci (20% of E. faecium, 3% of E. faecalis) and a single isolate of coagulase-negative staphylococci (0.2%, MIC of 8 mg/L). Escherichia coli isolates were commonly resistant to amoxicillin (56%) and tetracycline (88%) but remained susceptible to ceftazidime, piperacillin/tazobactam and imipenem. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected in 2% of E. coli (none in 2001, 3.2% in 2002), 5% of Klebsiella spp. and 8% of Enterobacter spp. Resistance rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, gentamicin, imipenem and piperacillin/tazobactam were between 4% and 7%. Among the newly licensed and developmental agents, there was no resistance to linezolid in Gram-positive organisms. Ertapenem had a wide spectrum, covering Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci and oxacillin-susceptible staphylococci. MICs of tigecycline were low for Gram-positive species and Enterobacteriaceae except Proteeae and Enterobacter spp. CONCLUSION: Antimicrobial resistance among major bloodstream pathogens to those antimicrobials often selected for empirical therapy was relatively uncommon in 2001-2002, usually <10%. An important exception was oxacillin resistance in S. aureus.
TI  - Indigenous raw milk microbiota influences the bacterial development in traditional cheese from an alpine natural park.
AB  - Nostrano di Primiero is a 6-month ripened cheese produced from raw milk collected in the Paneveggio-Pale di San Martino Natural Park area in the Italian Dolomites. In summer, this cheese is made using milk collected from two different areas, Passo Rolle and Vanoi, in the Paneveggio Natural Park. During the experiment, the milk from the two areas was separately processed, and cheeses were made in the same cheese factory using the same technological process. The microbiota of raw milk and cheeses of the two areas was isolated and the dominant population was monitored by RAPD analysis and identified by 16S rRNA sequence. The milk of the Passo Rolle area was mainly composed of mesophilic strains, thermophilic Streptococcus thermophilus, and low amounts of enterococci were also found; the milk of the Vanoi area was dominated by mesophilic microbiota mostly Lactococcus lactis ssp. cremoris and ssp. lactis and Lactobacillus paracasei ssp. paracasei. The plating of the natural starter culture revealed the presence of a relevant community of thermophilic cocci and lower amounts of enterococci. The dynamic population analysis showed the importance of the natural starter culture in the first 2 days of cheese ripening in both cheeses. Moreover, the large biodiversity observed in the raw milks was also detected in the cheeses during ripening. The Vanoi cheese was dominated by Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus macedonicus in the first two days and mesophilic 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei became the most represented population after 15 days of ripening. In the first few days, the Rolle cheese was characterized by being mainly composed of thermophilic S. macedonicus and S. thermophilus and secondarily by mesophilic cocci. During ripening, the microbiota composition changed, and at 15 days, mesophilic lactobacilli were the dominant population, but later, this was mainly composed of mesophilic cocci and lactobacilli. The taxonomical identification by 16S rRNA sequence confirmed a large biodiversity related to raw milk microbiota and only five strains of S. macedonicus, Lactobacillus plantarum, 21 Lb. paracasei ssp. paracasei, Lactobacillus fermentum and E. faecium were detected in both cheeses.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of three new quinolones and azithromycin against  aerobic pathogens causing respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In our study the in vitro susceptibility of common pathogens that cause respiratory tract and abdominal wound infections was tested against two newer fluorquinolones (moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin) as well as levofloxacin and azithromycin. METHODS: 50 isolates each of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae isolated from the respiratory tract and from wounds were tested for their susceptibility to moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, levofloxacin and azithromycin. RESULTS: Moxifloxacin proved to be the most active substance against the tested gram-positive pathogens. Gatifloxacin was the most active against P. aeruginosa. Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin proved to be comparably active against the clinical isolates of E. coli and H. influenzae. CONCLUSIONS: Moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin display excellent activity against respiratory pathogens as well as nosocomial pathogens causing abdominal wound infections. When treating infections caused by P. aeruginosa the earlier fluorquinolones such as ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin are the substances of choice.
TI  - Algorithm for the identification of bacterial pathogens in positive blood cultures by real-time LightCycler polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with sequence-specific probes.
AB  - We developed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for rapid detection of the most common and clinically relevant bacteria in positive blood culture bottles, including Staphylococcus spp., S. epidermidis, S. aureus, Enterococcus spp. (including differentiation of E. faecalis and E. faecium), Streptococcus spp., Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterobacteriaceae, E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., Bacteroides spp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. A total of 507 positive blood cultures were investigated according to a specific PCR algorithm based on the microscopic result of the blood culture, and the PCR results were compared to the culture results. Apart from-cross reactions between E. coli and Chryseomonas luteola and Enterococcus faecium and E. durans, the PCR assay correctly identified all bacteria in the blood cultures and did not show any false-positive results. Regarding blood cultures positive with a single species of bacteria (n = 474), 98.3% of all bacteria were correctly detected by the PCR algorithm within a few hours. However, in mixed infections, the sensitivity was lower. The PCR algorithm is well suited for rapid identification of the most common bacteria in positive blood cultures.
TI  - Comparative study of the in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The in vitro activity of a new fluoroquinolone, ABT-492, was determined. METHODS: MICs were compared with those of two beta-lactams, telithromycin, ciprofloxacin and four later generation fluoroquinolones. The effects of human serum and of inoculum concentration were also investigated. RESULTS: MIC data indicate that ABT-492 has potent activity against Gram-positive organisms with enhanced anti-staphylococcal activity compared with earlier fluoroquinolones, in addition to activity against beta-haemolytic streptococci, pneumococci including penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant strains and vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. ABT-492 was the most active agent tested against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Neisseria meningitidis, fluoroquinolone-susceptible Neisseria gonorrhoeae and anaerobes. Good activity was observed for ABT-492 amongst the Enterobacteriaceae and anaerobes tested, but ciprofloxacin showed superior activity for species of Proteus, Morganella and Providencia, as well as for Pseudomonas spp. In common with the other fluoroquinolones tested, organisms with reduced susceptibility to ciprofloxacin had raised MIC(90)s to ABT-492. The one isolate of H. influenzae tested with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility had an ABT-492 MIC close to that of the population lacking a mechanism of quinolone resistance. ABT-492 was more active than ciprofloxacin against Chlamydia spp. An inoculum effect was observed with a number of isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, E. faecium, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, in addition to moderately raised MICs in the presence of 70% serum protein. The clinical significance of these findings is yet to be determined. CONCLUSIONS: ABT-492 is a new fluoroquinolone with excellent activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, with many potential clinical uses.
TI  - Potential utility of a peptide deformylase inhibitor (NVP PDF-713) against oxazolidinone-resistant or streptogramin-resistant Gram-positive organism isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the potency of a novel peptide deformylase inhibitor, NVP PDF-713, against Gram-positive organisms having resistances to linezolid or quinupristin/dalfopristin. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 45 strains from three genera (six species groups) were tested by reference broth microdilution methods. The mechanism of resistance to the oxazolidinone was determined by sequencing of the gene encoding the ribosomal target. RESULTS: NVP PDF-713 retained activity against linezolid-resistant staphylococci (MIC range 0.25-2 mg/L), Streptococcus oralis (MIC 0.5 mg/L), Enterococcus faecalis (MIC range 2-4 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecium (MIC range 0.5-4 mg/L). Quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant E. faecium (MIC range 1-2 mg/L) and staphylococci (MIC range 0.12-2 mg/L) were also inhibited by NVP PDF-713. Many (10 of 13 strains) of the linezolid-resistant enterococci were resistant to vancomycin and these clinical strains had a G2576U ribosomal target mutation. CONCLUSIONS: NVP PDF-713 appears to be a promising clinical candidate among the peptide deformylase inhibitors for the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive organisms that possess resistances to oxazolidinones or streptogramin combinations.
TI  - An evaluation of nine probiotics available in South Africa, August 2003.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although probiotics are not new, 5 new commercially available products have been launched onto the South African market in the last 2 years. Evaluations of products in the USA and Europe shown poor correlation between label claims and actual contents. We undertook an evaluation of 9 products currently available on the shelves in South Africa. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: An independent laboratory was used. A culture method involving serial dilutions on selective media was used to obtain a colony count per gram for indicated organisma. A non-culture method, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), was used to determined the organisms present in the products. RESULTS: Disturbingly, we found a relatively poor correlation between the advertised and determined bacterial content. Only 3 of the 9 products tested contained the bacteria indicated on the label and 5 products contained sufficient bacteria for a probiotic effect. The Enterococcus faecium, a potential pathogen and Saccharomyces cerevisiae found in 2 of the products are of concern. CONCLUSION: This evaluation confirms that the contents of several probiotics available in South Africa do not correspond to the label claims. This is of concern as clinical efficacy is dependent on strain specificity and organism numbers. Current regulatory requirements do not address this discrepancy. As such, we recommend that commercially available probiotic products be screened annually and the results of such quality control measures be made available to the Medicines Control Council (MCC).
TI  - Activity of linezolid against Gram-positive cocci isolated in French hospitals as determined by three in-vitro susceptibility testing methods.
AB  - In total, 844 strains of Gram-positive cocci were collected from six university hospitals in France between September 1999 and January 2000. MICs of linezolid were determined: (i) for all strains by agar dilution (method A); (ii) by broth microdilution (method B) for staphylococci and enterococci; (iii) by Etest (method E) for beta-haemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Susceptibility to other antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method. MIC50 and MIC90 values were identical (2 mg/L) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (n = 179) by methods A and B. Linezolid was active against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (n = 117), with an MIC90 of 2 mg/L (methods A and B), but with a lower MIC50 of 1 mg/L by method A. Of the 200 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 56.5% were methicillin-resistant and 43.5% were methicillin-susceptible. Linezolid had similar in-vitro activity by methods A and B (MIC50 and MIC90 values of 1-2 mg/L), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility. The MIC90 of linezolid for all enterococci (150 Enterococcus faecalis and 50 Enterococcus faecium) was 2 mg/L by both methods. MICs of linezolid for beta-haemolytic streptococci had a narrow range of 0.5-2 mg/L (method A) and 0.125-2 mg/L (method E). Pneumococci (n = 118), including 67 penicillin G-intermediate and -resistant strains, were all inhibited by linezolid 2 mg/L (MIC90 of 2 mg/L by methods A and E). No strain had an MIC of > 2 mg/L by agar dilution or Etest, or of > 4 mg/L by broth microdilution. Overall, the study confirmed the good in-vitro activity of linezolid and the very narrow range of MICs for Gram-positive cocci susceptible or resistant to other antibiotics, irrespective of the method used.
TI  - [Nationwide sensitivity surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antibiotics against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--the first Ciproxan IV special investigation in 2001].
AB  - The parenteral injection of ciprofloxacin (CPFX), a fluoroquinolone antimicrobial drug, was approved in September 2000 and a re-examination period of 6 years was set at that time. As a special investigation to apply for re-examination of this drug, it has been planned to conduct 3 nationwide surveillances during the re-examination period by collecting clinically isolated bacteria from patients with severe infections, to whom the drug was mainly indicated, and examining drug susceptibilities of the bacteria to various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX. This time, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of various parenteral antimicrobial drugs including CPFX against 1,220 strains isolated from patients with severe infections by the micro-liquid dilution method and compared susceptibilities of various clinically isolated bacteria to CPFX with those to other antimicrobial drugs. Gram-positive bacteria were less susceptible to CPFX than to carbapenems except 2 bacterial species, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium but susceptibilities of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecalis to CPFX were comparable to those to cefozopran. Susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to CPFX did not differ among ampicillin (ABPC)-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: < 0.25 microgram/ml), ABPC-intermediate S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: 0.25-2 micrograms/ml) and ABPC-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC of ABPC: > or = 4 micrograms/ml) MIC90 of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) and a decrease in the antimicrobial activity seen among cephem and carbapenem antimicrobial drugs against penicillin-intermediate strains was not noted with CPFX. Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to CPFX similarly to carbapenems and the MIC90 values of CPFX were in the range from < or = 0.063 to 2 micrograms/ml against strains except Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Burkholderia cepacia. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was most susceptible to CPFX among the antibacterial drugs examined and the MIC90 was 2 micrograms/ml. CPFX also showed the lowest MIC90 value (0.5 microgram/ml) against beta-lactam-resistant P. aeruginosa among the drugs examined. When extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production and class B beta-lactamase production were examined in 439 strains of Enterobacteriaceae and 168 strains of glucose non-fermentative bacteria out of the Gram-negative bacteria collected this time, 3 strains (0.49%) producing ESBL and 7 strains (1.15%) producing class B beta-lactamase were found. The MIC range of CPFX to these 10 strains was between < or = 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml and 5 strains among those showed susceptibilities (MIC of CPFX: 1 microgram/ml) based on the NCCLS breakpoint. CPFX also showed a satisfactory result concerning susceptibilities of major causal bacteria based on the report of the committee of Japan Society of Chemotherapy on the standard method for determination of susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, the breakpoint of pneumonia. Furthermore, susceptibilities of various bacteria isolated clinically from patients with severe infections this time did not differ much from the result of the nationwide surveillance which we conducted in 1997. Thus, it was concluded that the antimicrobial activity of CPFX was maintained in the post-marketing surveillance for its parenteral preparation.
TI  - Daptomycin activity and spectrum: a worldwide sample of 6737 clinical Gram-positive organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens has prompted attempts to develop new antimicrobial agents active against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the in vitro activity of daptomycin against a worldwide collection of clinical bacterial isolates. METHODS: Daptomycin is a novel cyclic lipopeptide recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Daptomycin and selected comparators were tested against 6737 clinical Gram-positive strains from more than 70 centres located in Europe, North America and South America. RESULTS: The overall distribution of daptomycin MIC values were in the range < or = 0.12-8 mg/L and 99.4% of all strains were inhibited at < or = 2 mg/L. Despite resistances to other antimicrobial agents, >99.9% of staphylococcal isolates were inhibited at < or = 1 mg/L of daptomycin (MIC90 0.5 mg/L for staphylococci). Streptococcal isolates were very susceptible to daptomycin independent of their susceptibility to penicillin. MIC50/90 values were < or = 0.12 and 0.25 mg/L, respectively. Enterococci showed the highest daptomycin MIC values, but all isolates tested were inhibited at < or = 4 mg/L (except for one Enterococcus faecium isolate which showed a daptomycin MIC of 8 mg/L). CONCLUSIONS: Daptomycin exhibited excellent in vitro activity against a wide spectrum of Gram-positive organisms and may represent a therapeutic option for infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens worldwide.
TI  - Interactions between penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) and two novel classes of  PBP inhibitors, arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones.
AB  - Several non-beta-lactam compounds were active against various gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. The MICs of arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-ones were lower than those of ampicillin and cefotaxime for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MI339 and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium EF12. Several compounds were found to inhibit the cell wall synthesis of S. aureus and the last two steps of peptidoglycan biosynthesis catalyzed by ether-treated cells of Escherichia coli or cell wall membrane preparations of Bacillus megaterium. The effects of the arylalkylidene rhodanines and arylalkylidene iminothiazolidin-4-one derivatives on E. coli PBP 3 and PBP 5, Streptococcus pneumoniae PBP 2xS (PBP 2x from a penicillin-sensitive strain) and PBP 2xR (PBP 2x from a penicillin-resistant strain), low-affinity PBP 2a of S. aureus, and the Actinomadura sp. strain R39 and Streptomyces sp. strain R61 DD-peptidases were studied. Some of the compounds exhibited inhibitory activities in the 10 to 100 microM concentration range. The inhibition of PBP 2xS by several of them appeared to be noncompetitive. The dissociation constant for the best inhibitor (Ki = 10 microM) was not influenced by the presence of the substrate.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of AC98-6446, a novel semisynthetic glycopeptide  derivative of the natural product mannopeptimycin alpha, and other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - AC98-6446 is a novel semisynthetic cyclic glycopeptide antibiotic related to the  natural product mannopeptimycin alpha (AC98-1). In the present study the activity of AC98-6446 was evaluated against a variety of recent clinical gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains. AC98-6446 demonstrated similar potent activities against methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant staphylococci and glycopeptide-intermediate staphylococcal isolates (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC(90)s], 0.03 to 0.06 microg/ml). AC98-6446 also demonstrated good activities against both vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible strains of enterococci (MIC(90)s, 0.12 and 0.25 microg/ml, respectively) as well as against streptococcal strains (MIC(90)s, <or= 0.008 to 0.03 microg/ml). AC98-6446 demonstrated bactericidal activity in terms of the reduction in the viable counts (>3 log(10) CFU/ml) of staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates and a marked decrease in the viable counts of most enterococcal strains (from 0.2 to 2.5 log(10) CFU/ml). Unlike vancomycin, which demonstrates time-dependent killing, AC98-6446 demonstrated concentration-dependent killing. The potent activity, novel structure, and bactericidal activity demonstrated by AC98-6446 make it an attractive candidate for further development.
TI  - In vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide derivative exhibiting innovative microbiological properties against well-characterised antibiotic resistant pathogens in Italy.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ABT773, a new ketolide, was assessed against a collection (518) of well-characterised Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and compared with that of other appropriate drugs. ABT773 was active (MIC-90=0.03 mg/l) against the staphylococci tested which included macrolide-resistant but clindamycin susceptible organisms. Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and S. agalactiae were also inhibited (MIC-90 range: <0.0075-0.5mg/l) irrespective of their antibiotic resistance phenotype. Enterococcus faecalis was sensitive to ABT773 with the exception of VanA mutants. E. faecium showed poor susceptibility to ABT773. The activity of the new ketolide against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis was comparable with that of the most potent drugs tested. ABT773 displays the characteristics of a promising agent that deserves to be introduced as the empirical therapy of infections caused by the bacterial species tested here, even if they are multiply resistant.
TI  - In vivo pharmacodynamic activity of daptomycin.
AB  - Daptomycin is a lipopeptide antibiotic with activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria. We used the neutropenic murine thigh model to characterize the pharmacodynamics of daptomycin. ICR/Swiss mice were rendered neutropenic with cyclophosphamide; and the thigh muscles of the mice were infected with strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium. Animals were treated by subcutaneous injection of daptomycin at doses of 0.20 to 400 mg/kg of body weight/day divided into one, two, four, or eight doses over 24 h. Daptomycin exhibited linear pharmacokinetics, with an area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) from time zero to infinity/dose of 9.4 and a half-life of 0.9 to 1.4 h. The level of protein binding was 90%. Free daptomycin exhibited concentration-dependent killing and produced in vivo postantibiotic effects (PAEs) of 4.8 to 10.8 h. Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine which pharmacokinetic (PK) or pharmacodynamic (PD) parameter was important for efficacy by using free drug concentrations. The peak concentration/MIC (peak/MIC) ratio and 24-h AUC/MIC ratio were the PK and PD parameters that best correlated with in vivo efficacy (R(2) = 83 to 87% for peak/MIC and R(2) = 86% for the AUC/MIC ratio, whereas R(2) = 47 to 50% for the time that the concentration was greater than the MIC) against standard strains of S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. The peak/MIC ratios required for a bacteriostatic effect ranged from 12 to 36 for S. pneumoniae, 59 to 94 for S. aureus, and 0.14 to 0.25 for E. faecium. The AUC/MIC ratios needed for a bacteriostatic effect ranged from 75 to 237 for S. pneumoniae, 388 to 537 for S. aureus, and 0.94 to 1.67 for E. faecium. The free daptomycin concentrations needed to average from one to two times the MIC over 24 h to produce a bacteriostatic effect and two to four times the MIC over 24 h to produce greater than 99% killing. The long PAE and potent bactericidal activity make daptomycin an attractive option for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activities of the novel cephalosporin LB 11058 against multidrug-resistant Staphylococci and Streptococci.
AB  - LB 11058 is a novel parenteral cephalosporin with a C-3 pyrimidinyl-substituted vinyl sulfide group and a C-7 2-amino-5-chloro-1,3-thiazole group. This study evaluated the in vitro activity and spectrum of LB 11058 against 1,245 recent clinical isolates, including a subset of gram-positive strains with specific resistant phenotypes. LB 11058 was very active against Streptococcus pneumoniae. The novel cephalosporin was 8- to 16-fold more potent than ceftriaxone, cefepime, or amoxicillin-clavulanate against both penicillin-intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae. LB 11058 was also very active against both beta-hemolytic streptococci (MIC at which 90% of isolates were inhibited [MIC(90)], </=0.008 micro g/ml) and viridans group streptococci (MIC(90), 0.03 to 0.5 micro g/ml), including penicillin-resistant strains. Among oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, LB 11058 MIC results varied from 0.06 to 0.25 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 0.12 micro g/ml), while among oxacillin-resistant strains LB 11058 MICs varied from 0.25 to 1 micro g/ml (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml). Coagulase-negative staphylococci showed an LB 11058 susceptibility pattern similar to that of S. aureus, with all isolates being inhibited at </=1 micro g/ml. LB 11058 also showed reasonable in vitro activity against Enterococcus faecalis, including vancomycin-resistant strains (MIC(50), 1 micro g/ml), and Bacillus spp. (MIC(50), 0.25 micro g/ml); however, it was less active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC(50), >64 micro g/ml) and Corynebacterium spp. (MIC(50), 32 micro g/ml). Against gram-negative pathogens, LB 11058 showed activity against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC(90), 0.25 to 0.5 micro g/ml) and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90), 0.25 micro g/ml), with MICs not influenced by beta-lactamase production. In conclusion, LB 11058 demonstrated a broad antibacterial spectrum and was highly active against gram-positive bacteria, particularly against multidrug-resistant staphylococci and streptococci.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial susceptibility for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (2,363 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), Streptococcus milleri group and Peptostreptococcus spp. The antibacterial activity of CZOP either against MSSA or MSSE was preferable (MIC90: 2 or 0.5 micrograms/mL) and comparable to those of other cephems. CZOP was also effective on MRSE (MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) but not on MRSA. CZOP and other cephems had low antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus (MIC90: 64 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than those of other cephems, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (32 vs 1-2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to that of cefpirome (CPR; MIC90: 16 micrograms/mL) and higher than those of other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, like other drugs. The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as those of cefotiam and CPR (MIC90: < or = 0.063 microgram/mL), and, against S. agalactiae, was also preferable (MIC90: 0.125 microgram/mL). CZOP indicated preferable antibacterial activity either against PSSP, PISP, or PRSP (MIC90: 0.25, 1, or 2 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. milleri group was also preferable, but the MIC90 of CZOP in 2001 was higher than those in 1996-2000 (4 vs 0.5 micrograms/mL). The antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than those of cefazolin and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated from breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 95.9% in MRSA, 93.5% in PRSP, 63.3% in PISP, 35.8% in S. haemolyticus, 27.9% in E. faecalis, and 13.3% MRSE. Those resistance ratios were comparable to those for cefepime (CFPM), but E. faecalis showed 91.2% for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against these species. In correlation of drug susceptibility, 40.3% of PRSP was not inhibited at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or CFPM while 69.2% at breakpoint MIC either CZOP or ceftazidime. In conclusion, the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria obtained from the 6-year duration study were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. A decline in the sensitivities of S. saprophyticus, S. milleri group, PISP, and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested.
TI  - [Activities of antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 medical institutions during 2000 in Japan].
AB  - A survey was conducted to determine the antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones and other antimicrobial agents against 8,474 clinical isolates obtained from 37 Japanese medical institutions in 2000. A total of 25 antimicrobial agents were used, comprising 4 fluoroquinolones, 13 beta-lactams, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, azithromycin, gentamicin, amikacin, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, and vancomycin. A high resistance rate of over 85% against fluoroquinolones was exhibited by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus faecium. Isolates showing resistance to fluoroquinolones among methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from UTI accounted for 30-60%. However, many of the common pathogens were still susceptible to fluoroquinolones, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae (including penicillin-resistant isolates), Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative Staphylococci, Moraxella catarrhalis, the Enterobacteriaceae family, and Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant isolates). About 85% of P. aeruginosa isolated from RTI were susceptible to fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, this survey of sensitivity to antimicrobial agents clearly indicated trend for increasing resistance to fluoroquinolones among MRSA, Enterococci, and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI, although fluoroquinolones are still effective against other organisms and P. aeruginosa from RTI as has been demonstrated in previous studies.
TI  - Heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of Lactobacillus crispatus CHCC3692.
AB  - A 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedTn3692, of the gram-positive strain Lactobacillus crispatus CHCC3692 contains an erm(B) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. Loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. Heat shock treatment at 60 degrees C resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin MIC, 0.047 micrograms/ml). The phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb DNA fragment carrying the erm(B) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. In cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. The upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. Significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from L. crispatus CHCC3692 and the erm(B) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, and Lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(B) gene for these species. The transposed DNA element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of CHCC3692, as determining by Southern blotting, PCR analysis, and DNA sequencing. No other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. These observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.
TI  - Bactericidal activity and synergy studies of BAL9141, a novel pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem, tested against streptococci, enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - BAL9141 has been reported to have inhibitory activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), many enterococci, and streptococci with various resistant patterns. BAL9141 potency was assessed by time-kill curves alone or with subinhibitory concentrations of gentamicin (MIC/4). BAL9141 exhibited bactericidal activity alone against all the streptococci and staphylococci. Among ampicillin-susceptible enterococci, BAL9141 was bactericidal against some strains, but no BAL9141 inhibition was observed of ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The activity of BAL9141 with gentamicin was slightly enhanced (not synergy) or indifferent against staphylococci. BAL9141 demonstrated bactericidal action alone against Enterococcus faecalis and some E. faecium strains (-4.8 to -6.0 log10 CFU/mL), but static effects were also noted. Drug interactions with gentamicin showed early synergy (4-8 h) for all enterococci, and indifference or synergy at 24 h (no antagonism). BAL9141 (< or = 8 mg/L) showed promising bactericidal activity alone and synergy with gentamicin against some of the vancomycin-resistant enterococci tested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Leontopodium alpinum (Edelweiss).
AB  - Extracts and individual constituents of Leontopodium alpinum Cass. (Asteraceae) were tested for their antimicrobial activity in two different assays. Extracts were screened in agar diffusion assays, whereas the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of single compounds were determined by the microbroth dilution method according to NCCLS criteria. Significant antimicrobial activities were found against various strains of Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes strains. These results support the ethnomedicinal use of Leontopodium alpinum for the treatment of respiratory and abdominal disorders.
TI  - Molecular structure and evolution of the conjugative multiresistance plasmid pRE25 of Enterococcus faecalis isolated from a raw-fermented sausage.
AB  - Plasmid pRE25 from Enterococcus faecalis transfers resistances against kanamycin, neomycin, streptomycin, clindamycin, lincomycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, roxithromycin, tylosin, chloramphenicol, and nourseothricin sulfate by conjugation in vitro to E. faecalis JH2-2, Lactococcus lactis Bu2, and Listeria innocua L19. Its nucleotide sequence of 50237 base pairs represents the largest, fully sequenced conjugative multiresistance plasmid of enterococci (Plasmid 46 (2001) 170). The gene for chloramphenicol resistance (cat) was identified as an acetyltransferase identical to the one of plasmid pIP501 of Streptococcus agalactiae. Erythromycin resistance is due to a 23S ribosomal RNA methyl transferase, again as found in pIP501 (ermB). The aminoglycoside resistance genes are packed in tandem as in transposon Tn5405 of Staphylococcus aureus: an aminoglycoside 6-adenyltransferase, a streptothricin acetyl transferase, and an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase.). Identical resistance genes are known from pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes, S. agalactiae, S. aureus, Campylobacter coli, Clostridium perfringens, and Clostridium difficile. pRE25 is composed of a 30.5-kbp segment almost identical to pIP501. Of the 15 genes involved in conjugative transfer, 10 codes for putative transmembrane proteins (e.g. trsB, traC, trsF, trsJ, and trsL). The enterococcal part is joined into the pIP501 part by insertion elements IS1216V of E. faecium Tn1545 (three copies), and homologs of IS1062 (E. faecalis) and IS1485 (E. faecium). pRE25 demonstrates that enterococci from fermented food do participate in the molecular communication between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria of the human and animal microflora.
TI  - Differentiation of Enterococcus faecium from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus strains by PCR and dot-blot hybridisation.
AB  - Variations in length and sequence of the 16S/23S spacer region of Enterococcus faecium provided the basis for development of simple PCR and dot-blot hybridisation assays that enabled the differentiation of potentially probiotic Enterococcus faecium strains from Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Such assays may be useful for differentiation of yoghurt starter cultures and enterococcal strains when they are simultaneously present in probiotic food products.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2001--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2001 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. A total of 1,274 strains in 15 species of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium, and Peptostreptococcus spp. CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 6 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with ceftazidime (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 6 years of post marketing.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns of vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus isolated from animal foods and epidemiological typing of resistant S. equinus by microbial uniprimer kit.
AB  - Raw milk samples, and cow and chicken intestines were tested to isolate vancomycin-resistant, gram-positive bacteria. From these samples, we isolated seven vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus, two vancomycin-resistant viridans Streptococcus and two vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The MICs of several antibiotics, including vancomycin, against these strains were tested. Seven isolates of S. equinus showed high level resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin (>100 microg/mL). The cell wall thickness of these strains was compared with that of the sensitive strain by TEM and no differences were obserbed between these strains. We compared the strains of vancomycin-resistant Streptococcus equinus using PCR with Microbial Uniprimer Kit. We concluded that it is necessary to combine other methods in order to cluster and identify all isolates of S. equinus.
TI  - Discovery of a small molecule that inhibits cell division by blocking FtsZ, a novel therapeutic target of antibiotics.
AB  - The emergence of bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major health problem and, therefore, it is critical to develop new antibiotics with novel modes of action. FtsZ, a tubulin-like GTPase, plays an essential role in bacterial cell division, and its homologs are present in almost all eubacteria and archaea. During cell division, FtsZ forms polymers in the presence of GTP that recruit other division proteins to make the cell division apparatus. Therefore, inhibition of FtsZ polymerization will prevent cells from dividing, leading to cell death. Using a fluorescent FtsZ polymerization assay, the screening of >100,000 extracts of microbial fermentation broths and plants followed by fractionation led to the identification of viriditoxin, which blocked FtsZ polymerization with an IC50 of 8.2 microg/ml and concomitant GTPase inhibition with an IC50 of 7.0 microg/ml. That the mode of antibacterial action of viriditoxin is via inhibition of FtsZ was confirmed by the observation of its effects on cell morphology, macromolecular synthesis, DNA-damage response, and increased minimum inhibitory concentration as a result of an increase in the expression of the FtsZ protein. Viriditoxin exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, without affecting the viability of eukaryotic cells.
TI  - Many chemokines including CCL20/MIP-3alpha display antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that beta-defensins exhibit chemotactic activity by sharing the chemokine receptor CCR6 with the CC chemokine ligand CCL20/macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha (MIP-3alpha). Structural analysis of CCL20/MIP-3alpha revealed that most of the positively charged residues are concentrated at one area of its topological surface, a characteristic considered to be important for the antimicrobial activity of defensins. Here, we report that similar to defensins, CCL20/MIP-3alpha has antimicrobial effects on Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans. Additionally, by screening a total of 30 human chemokines, we have identified an additional 17 human chemokines, which exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro. Collectively, about two-thirds of the chemokines investigated so far has the capacity to kill microorganisms in vitro, suggesting that antimicrobial activity may be another host-defense function for certain chemokines. Comparison of the structural characteristics between antimicrobial and nonantimicrobial chemokines suggests that topological formation of a large, positively charged electrostatic patch on the surface of the molecule is likely to be a common structural feature of antimicrobial chemokines.
TI  - An Enterococcus faecium secreted antigen, SagA, exhibits broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix proteins and appears essential for E. faecium growth.
AB  - A gene encoding a major secreted antigen, SagA, was identified in Enterococcus faecium by screening an E. faecium genomic expression library with sera from patients with E. faecium-associated endocarditis. Recombinant SagA protein showed broad-spectrum binding to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, including fibrinogen, collagen type I, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin. A fibrinogen-binding protein, purified from culture supernatants of an E. faecium clinical isolate, was found to match the N-terminal sequence of the predicted SagA protein and to react with the anti-SagA antibody, confirming that it was the SagA protein; this protein appeared as an 80- to 90-kDa smear on a Western blot that was sensitive to proteinase K and resistant to periodate treatment and glycoprotein staining. When overexpressed in E. faecium and Escherichia coli, the native and recombinant SagA proteins formed stable oligomers, apparently via their C-terminal domains. The SagA protein is composed of three domains: (i) a putative coiled-coil N-terminal domain that shows homology to the N-terminal domain of Streptococcus mutans SagA protein (42% similarity), previously shown to be involved in cell wall integrity and cell shape maintenance, and to the P45 protein of Listeria monocytogenes (41% similarity); (ii) a central domain containing direct repeats; and (iii) a C-terminal domain that is similar to that found in various proteins, including P45 (50% similarity) and P60 (52% similarity) of L. monocytogenes. The P45 and P60 proteins both have cell wall hydrolase activity, and the latter has also been shown to be involved in virulence, whereas cell wall hydrolase activity was not detected for SagA protein. The E. faecium sagA gene, like the S. mutans homologue, is located in a cluster of genes encoding proteins that appear to be involved in cell wall metabolism and could not be disrupted unless it was first transcomplemented, suggesting that the sagA gene is essential for E. faecium growth and may be involved in cell wall metabolism. In conclusion, the extracelluar E. faecium SagA protein is apparently essential for growth, shows broad-spectrum binding to ECM proteins, forms oligomers, and is antigenic during infection.
TI  - Transferable vanB2 Tn5382-containing elements in fecal streptococcal strains from veal calves.
AB  - Three vancomycin-resistant veal calf fecal streptococci, identified as Streptococcus gallolyticus (n = 2) and Streptococcus lutetiensis, were shown to harbor vanB2 Tn5382-like elements earlier described in enterococci. One S. gallolyticus strain had a 1,495-bp IS256-related element inserted in vanS(B). The vanB2 Tn5382 element present in the plasmid-free S. lutetiensis strain was transferable to Enterococcus faecium BM4105-RF, Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2, and its recombination-deficient derivative, UV202. The transfer frequencies were comparable between recipient strains (from 1 x 10(-7) to 7 x 10(-6)). All transconjugants acquired a vanB-containing chromosomal insert of approximately 100 kb, apparently by site-specific integration. Secondary transconjugants were not observed in intraspecies retransfer experiments. These observations are consistent with a conjugative, selftransmissible, integrative element that might be involved in the interspecies spread of vanB2 resistance determinants. Two JH2-2-derived transconjugants had also gained additional copies of large vanB-containing chromosomal fragments, a process that involves unexplained mechanisms that seems to require functional host cell-dependent recombination mechanisms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of novel 2-(thiazol-2-ylthio)-1beta-methylcarbapenems with potent activities against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 are new 1beta-methylcarbapenems with a unique 4-substituted thiazol-2-ylthio moiety at the C-2 side chain. In agar dilution susceptibility testing these novel carbapenems were active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) with a MIC(90) of </=4 micro g/ml. Furthermore, SM-232724 showed strong bactericidal activity against MRSA, in contrast to linezolid, which was bacteriostatic up to four times the MIC. SM-232724 showed good therapeutic efficacy comparable to those of vancomycin and linezolid against systemic infections of MRSA in cyclophosphamide-treated mice. The MICs of SM-197436, SM-232721, and SM-232724 for streptococci, including penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, ranged from </=0.063 to 0.5 micro g/ml. These drugs were the most active beta-lactams tested against Enterococcus faecium, and the MIC(90) s for ampicillin-resistant E. faecium ranged between 8 and 16 micro g/ml, which were slightly higher than the value for linezolid. However, time-kill assays revealed the superior bactericidal activity of SM-232724 compared to those of quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid against an E. faecium strain with a 4-log reduction in CFU at four times the MIC after 24 h of exposure to antibiotics. In addition, SM-232724 significantly reduced the numbers of bacteria in a murine abscess model with the E. faecium strain: its efficacy was superior to that of linezolid, although the MICs (2 micro g/ml) of these two agents are the same. Among gram-negative bacteria, these three carbapenems were highly active against Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant strains), Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bacteroides fragilis, and showed antibacterial activity equivalent to that of imipenem for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Proteus spp. Thus, these new carbapenems are promising candidates for agents to treat nosocomial bacterial infections by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, especially multiresistant gram-positive cocci, including MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
TI  - A comparison of the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram-positive cocci isolated from community-private and university-affiliated hospitals from Puerto Rico.
AB  - The antimicrobial resistance patterns of 2,462 selected Gram-positive cocci obtained from three Community-Private Hospitals (CPH) and three University-Affiliated Hospitals (UAH) were evaluated utilizing the institutions' antimicrobial susceptibility reports for the year 2000. The objectives of this study were: 1) to evaluate the in vitro resistance to selected standard antibiotics of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae clinical isolates, and 2) to compare the antimicrobial resistance patterns between community-private (CPH) and university-affiliated hospitals (UAH). Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram-positive isolated organism in CPH (63.3%) followed by E. faecalis (31.0%). In UAH, the most prevalent cocci were E. faecalis (51.7%) followed by S. aureus (43.9%). Enterococcus faecium represented 2.3% and 4.4% of CPH and UAH isolates, respectively. Streptococcus pneumoniae represented 3.4% of the total Gram-positive isolates from CPH, no S. pneumoniae was reported in UAH. The antimicrobial susceptibility results showed that for Staphylococcus aureus there was a statistically significant higher resistance to methicillin and thrimethoprim sulfamethoxazole in UAH, while resistance to erythromycin was significantly higher in CPH. There was no difference in the resistance of S. aureus to other antimicrobial agents between hospitals groups. A statistically significant resistant to vancomycin was found between enterococcal isolates from UAH (43%) and CPH (12.7%). High-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) was observed among UAH enterococcal isolates with E. faecium showing a higher resistance than E. faecalis, no data for HLAR in CPH could be obtained. For pneumococci 46% of CPH isolates were resistant to penicillin. In summary, there are important differences in the prevalence and antimicrobial resistance between the Gram-positive bacteria isolated from community and teaching hospitals.
TI  - Bacterial community dynamics during production of registered designation of origin Salers cheese as evaluated by 16S rRNA gene single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis.
AB  - Microbial dynamics during processing and ripening of traditional cheeses such as  registered designation of origin Salers cheese, an artisanal cheese produced in France, play an important role in the elaboration of sensory qualities. The aim of the present study was to obtain a picture of the dynamics of the microbial ecosystem of RDO Salers cheese by using culture-independent methods. This included DNA extraction, PCR, and single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Bacterial and high-GC% gram-positive bacterial primers were used to amplify V2 or V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. SSCP patterns revealed changes during the manufacturing of the cheese. Patterns of the ecosystems of cheeses that were provided by three farmers were also quite different. Cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed sequences related to lactic acid bacteria (Lactococcus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus pentosus), which were predominant during manufacturing and ripening. Bacteria belonging to the high-GC% gram-positive group (essentially corynebacteria) were found by using specific primers. The present molecular approach can effectively describe the ecosystem of artisanal dairy products.
TI  - [Surveillance on gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients with hospital acquired infections or community acquired infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the drug-resistance rates of gram-positive cocci isolated from patients with hospital acquired infection (HAI) or community acquired infection (CAI) in 34 study wards of 13 hospitals located at different areas in China. METHODS: According to the previous protocol, from July 1(st) 2000 to June 30(th) 2001, a total of 2401 pathogenic strains were isolated from 13 hospitals. Among them, 805 strains of gram-positive cocci were collected for in vitro susceptibility test using international standard plate dilution method. According to the criteria of guidelines of NCCLS (2001), MIC(50) and MIC(90) were detected to represent the antibacterial activity of antimicrobial agents and R%, I%, and S%, were calculated to show the resistant, intermediate and susceptible rates of the bacteria to the compounds tested. RESULTS: The detectable rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 37.4% (89/238) and 33.8% (51/151) respectively. Among a total of 238 strains of S. aureus, 139 were isolated from patients with CAI and 37 were from HAI patients, the rate of MRSA from HAI patients (89.2%, 33/37) was significantly higher than that of MRSA from CAI patients (30.2%, 42/139) (P < 0.01). The total resistant rate of penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was 26.7% (8/30), including a R% of 3.3% (1/30) and an I% of 23.3% (7/30). 331 strains of Enterococcus were isolated, including 178 strains from the study wards and 153 strains from other wards. The ratio of number of strains of E. faecalis to E. faecium was 6.8:1 (286/42). The rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecium (AREF) was 73.8% (31/42), significantly higher than the rate of ampicillin resistant E. faecalis (16.4%, 47/286). Neither strains of S. aureus nor strains of coagulase negative Staphylococcus were found resistant to vancomycin. No strains of Enterococcus were found resistant to vancomycin, the intermediate rates of E. faecalis and E. faecium to vancomycin were 3.5% (10/286) and 9.5% (4/42) respectively. All strains of Enterococcus were found 100% susceptible to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: The resistance patterns of Gram-positive cocci including MRSA, PRSP, and AREF are similar to the results of the 1998 - 1999 surveillance. No strain of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, including VRSA and VISA or vancomycin resistant enterococcus, VRE is found in this study.
TI  - Enterococcus phoeniculicola sp. nov., a novel member of the enterococci isolated  from the uropygial gland of the Red-billed Woodhoopoe, Phoeniculus purpureus.
AB  - A facultatively anaerobic, Gram-positive, coccoid, non-spore-forming, non-motile, catalase-negative bacterium was isolated from the uropygial (preen) gland of wild Red-billed Woodhoopoes (Phoeniculus purpureus) and designated strain JLB-1(T). Physiological and biochemical testing suggested that this homofermentative, lactic-acid-producing bacterium could belong to the genus Enterococcus or the genus Streptococcus. Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain JLB-1(T) with other 16S rDNA sequences in the GenBank database by BLAST analysis showed that its closest relatives are Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus avium and Enterococcus asini. Strain JLB-1(T) may be differentiated from these species by the fact that it does not produce acid from lactose, D-mannitol, D(+)-melezitose or D-sorbitol. Furthermore, it does not hydrolyse arginine or hippurate and cannot grow in the presence of 6.5% NaCl or 40% bile. It differs from the streptococci in that it does not lyse erythrocytes. Strain JLB-1(T) is a novel member of the enterococci, for which the name Enterococcus phoeniculicola sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is JLB-1(T) (=ATCC BAA-412(T) = DSM 14726(T)).
TI  - Linezolid resistance since 2001: SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The oxazolidinone class of antimicrobials has demonstrated remarkable activity against gram-positive cocci. Linezolid has proven to be a first-line therapeutic option for vancomycin-resistant strains. Linezolid clinical trial results and subsequent published case reports cite rare resistance emerging in patients receiving prolonged therapy. OBJECTIVE: To report the initial linezolid-resistant organisms from cases obtained through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, after screening >40,000 gram-positive cocci without resistance between 1998 and 2000. METHODS: During 2001-2002, 8 resistant strains (from 8 different patients) located in 6 states from 7 different participating SENTRY institutions in the US were identified among bloodstream, respiratory, skin and soft tissue, and urinary tract infection isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus oralis. Resistance was detected by reference broth microdilution methods and confirmed by identical results using Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden) and the standardized disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and disk diffusion tests showed elevated MICs (> or =8 microg/mL) and small inhibitory zone diameters (< or =15 mm) for all strains to both linezolid and the investigational oxazolidinone AZD2563. Vancomycin resistance was detected in 2 of the 8 linezolid-resistant strains. All enterococci and the viridans-group streptococcus (S. oralis) strain showed resistance to erythromycin. E. faecium strains were resistant to penicillins, but susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Only 3 of the patients had previously received the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid resistance remains rare, with only 8 isolates among 9833 (0.08%) monitored isolates identified between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2002. Resistance, however, was no longer limited to enterococci. Clinical laboratories should test linezolid more widely to detect emerging resistance, especially for patients receiving oxazolidinone therapy. Longitudinal surveillance programs are warranted to detect a trend in the development of resistance, determine the molecular mechanism of resistance, and recommend alternative therapies or epidemiologic interventions.
TI  - In vitro activities of linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents against Staphylococci, Enterococci, Pneumococci, and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The activities of linezolid, an oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against  gram-positive organisms, alone and in combination with 35 antimicrobial agents were tested in vitro against methicillin-sensitive (n = 1 to 2 strains) and methicillin-resistant (n = 8 to 10) Staphylococcus aureus strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 6) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6 to 8) Enterococcus faecalis strains; vancomycin-sensitive (n = 5) and vancomycin-resistant (n = 6) Enterococcus faecium strains; penicillin-sensitive (n = 2 to 5), penicillin-intermediate (n = 5 to 6), and penicillin-resistant (n = 5 to 6) Streptococcus pneumoniae strains; Escherichia coli (n = 6); and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 6). The fractional inhibitory concentration indices of linezolid in combination with other antimicrobial agents for the organisms tested were generated on checkerboard broth microdilution plates prepared by a semiautomated method. Of 1,380 organism-drug combinations, 1,369 (99.2%) combinations of linezolid with 28 antimicrobial drugs were indifferent, 9 combinations (0.65%) of linezolid with 6 drugs (amoxicillin, erythromycin, imipenem, sparfloxacin, teicoplanin, and tetracycline) were synergistic, and 2 combinations (0.15%) of linezolid with 2 drugs (ofloxacin and sparfloxacin) were antagonistic. Overall, the in vitro data demonstrated that linezolid combined with other antimicrobial agents primarily produces an indifferent response, with infrequent occurrences of synergism and antagonism.
TI  - Nocathiacins, new thiazolyl peptide antibiotics from Nocardia sp. I. Taxonomy, fermentation and biological activities.
AB  - Thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, nocathiacin I, II and III, were identified in a culture of Nocardia sp. WW-12651 (ATCC 202099). They exhibit potent in vitro activity (ng/ml) against a wide spectrum of gram-positive bacteria, including multiple-drug resistant pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multi-drug resistant Enterococcus faecium (MREF) and fully penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), and demonstrate excellent in vivo efficacy in a systemic Staphylococcus aureus infection mice model.
TI  - Novel pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-based inhibitors of Staphlococcus aureus DNA polymerase III: design, synthesis, and biological evaluation.
AB  - 6-Anilinopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones are novel dGTP analogues that inhibit the replication-specific enzyme DNA polymerase III (DNA pol III) of Staphlococcus aureus and other Gram-positive (Gr+) bacteria. To enhance the potential of these inhibitors as antimicrobial agents, a structure-activity relationship was developed involving substitutions at the 2, 4, and pyrazolo NH positions. All of the new inhibitors were tested for their ability to inhibit S. aureus DNA pol III and the growth of several other Gr+ bacteria in culture. 2-Anilino groups with small hydrophobic groups in the meta or para position enhanced both antipolymerase and antimicrobial activity. 2-Benzyl-substituted inhibitors were substantially less active. Substitution in the 4-position by oxygen gave the optimal activity, whereas substitution at the pyrazolo NH was not tolerated. These pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivatives represent a novel class of antimicrobials with promising activities against Gr+ bacteria.
TI  - Baseline study to determine in vitro activities of daptomycin against gram-positive pathogens isolated in the United States in 2000-2001.
AB  - The activity of daptomycin was assessed by using 6,973 gram-positive bacteria isolated at 50 United States hospitals in 2000 and 2001. Among the isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 1,163) collected, the rate of penicillin resistance was 16.1%; rates of oxacillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus isolates (n = 1,018) and vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium isolates (n = 368) were 30.0 and 59.5%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotypes (isolates resistant to three or more different chemical classes of antimicrobial agents) accounted for 14.2% of S. pneumoniae isolates, 27.1% of S. aureus isolates, and 58.4% of E. faecium isolates. For all gram-positive species tested, MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)s) and MIC ranges for directed-spectrum agents (daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, and linezolid) were identical or highly similar for isolates susceptible or resistant to other agents or MDR. Daptomycin had a MIC(90) of 0.12 micro g/ml for both penicillin-susceptible and -resistant isolates of S. pneumoniae. Against oxacillin-resistant S. aureus daptomycin had a MIC(90) of 0.5 micro g/ml, and it had a MIC(90) of 4 micro g/ml against both vancomycin-susceptible and -resistant E. faecium. The MIC(90)s for daptomycin and other directed-spectrum agents were unaffected by the regional or anatomical origin of isolates or patient demographic parameters (patient age, gender, and inpatient or outpatient care). Our results confirm the gram-positive spectrum of activity of daptomycin and that its activity is independent of susceptibility or resistance to commonly prescribed and tested antimicrobial agents. This study may serve as a baseline to monitor future changes in the susceptibility of gram-positive species to daptomycin following its introduction into clinical use.
TI  - Activity of daptomycin against susceptible and multidrug-resistant Gram-positive  pathogens collected in the SECURE study (Europe) during 2000-2001.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance was prevalent in Gram-positive pathogens collected from 40  sites in 15 European countries during 2000-2001. Among Staphylococcus aureus, 27.3% of all isolates submitted were resistant to oxacillin and ranged from 0% of isolates from the Netherlands to 36.9% of isolates from Portugal. The overall prevalence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was 25.1%, with Italy submitting the largest percentage of resistant isolates (60.6%). For Streptococcus pneumoniae, 9.4% of all isolates collected were resistant to penicillin with variation by country from 0% in the Netherlands to 20.7% in Portugal. Multidrug resistance (MDR), defined as concurrent resistance to three or more antimicrobials of different chemical classes, was observed in 24.6% of S. aureus, 19.6% of E. faecium and 3.6% of S. pneumoniae. The directed spectrum agents daptomycin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin were active in vitro against all isolates regardless of their resistance to other agents. Daptomycin and quinupristin-dalfopristin (MIC(90)s 0.5 mg/L) were equally active against oxacillin-resistant S. aureus compared with linezolid (MIC(90) 2 mg/L). The activities of daptomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid were not affected by resistance to vancomycin in E. faecium (MIC(90)s of 4, 2 and 2 mg/L, respectively). Daptomycin was more active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (MIC(90) 0.25 mg/L) than was quinupristin-dalfopristin (MIC(90) 0.5 mg/L) or linezolid (MIC(90) 2 mg/L). Daptomycin was highly active against clinically important Gram-positive pathogens, including those that were multiply resistant to currently available agents. The results of this study provide a benchmark of the activity of daptomycin against contemporary European isolates and will serve as a baseline to monitor future changes in the susceptibility of these organisms to daptomycin.
TI  - Emerging bacterial pathogens: a consensus of the scientific data and the risk for development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance in the hospital setting is continuing to increase, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs) and other areas of the hospital such as oncology units, where the use of empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics is common. The problem of antibiotic resistance is also compounded in the immunocompromised patient. Multi-drug resistance is common among both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, and becoming more prevalent among fungi (yeast). Two major antibiotic-resistant pathogens include extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). When infections occur with ESBL-KP, a carbapenem antibiotic is usually the drug of choice. When infection occurs with VRE, specific therapy is bacteriostatic, and the clinician may have to rely on empirically selected antibiotics or combinations of antibiotics to achieve a positive outcome. Two newly-approved agents, linezolid and quinupristin/dalfopristin can be used to treat infections caused by resistant gram-positive cocci, but the latter is approved for use against VR-E. faecium. Risk factors for the development of ESBL-KP include the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins such as ceftazidime. Risk factors for the development of VRE include inappropriate use of vancomycin, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and antianaerobic drug therapy such as clindamycin. Several institutions have documented a reduction in one or both of these resistant pathogens following a decrease in the use of extended-spectrum cephalosporins combined with the increased use of extended-spectrum penicillins/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, for the empiric therapy of infections. For VRE, a reduction in the inappropriate use of vancomycin is also an important interventional strategy along with improved infection control practice.
TI  - Partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by environmental strain Enterococcus faecium EK13.
AB  - AIMS: The partial characterization of bacteriocins produced by an environmental strain Enterococcus faecium EK13, isolated from cattle dung water. METHODS AND RESULTS: A bacteriocin was partially purified by ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by a SP-Sepharose column, reverse-phase chromatography and N-terminal region sequenced. The anti-microbial substance produced was found to be a heat-stable polypeptide with molecular mass 4.83 kDa, which was determined by N-terminal amino acid sequencing to be enterocin A. A second substance was specified by PCR as enterocin P. Bacteriocins were stable at 4 and -20 degrees C for long storage periods. The optimum of bacteriocin production was observed in the range of pH 5.0-6.5 at 30 and 37 degrees C. The most active substances are produced by strain EK13 in logarithmic growth phase and bacteriocins are produced after 1 h of fermentation. The highest activity detected in fermentation experiments was 51 200 AU ml(-1) and the most sensitive indicator strain was found to be Listeria innocua LMG 13568. Differences in bacteriocin activity against two indicators could be explained by more than one type of enterocin production by strain EK13, or with different mode of action or in different sensitivity of strains. CONCLUSION: Enterococcus faecium strain EK13 isolated from cattle dung water produces two bacteriocins, enterocin A and P, with an inhibitory effect against the strain of the genera Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, Bacillus and Listeria (in different origin). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Enterococcus faecium EK13 environmental strain is a new producer of enterocin A and P. The E. faecium EK13, isolated from cattle dung water, is presented with the further aim to utilize it for waste treatment by biotechnological processes.
TI  - Prospective study using standardized methodology for antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-positive cocci isolated from the Puerto Rico Medical Center.
AB  - The Gram-positive cocci (GPC), Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, have become important causes of community and nosocomial-acquired infections. The prevalence of multiple resistant isolates to standard antimicrobial drugs has significantly increased over the past decades. Few prospective studies have been performed in Puerto Rico (PR) concerning the GPC antimicrobial susceptibilities pattern. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of GPC clinical isolates from PR to selected standard antibiotics and to the new antimicrobial agents, linezolid (LZ), quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and gemifloxacin (GM). The in vitro susceptibility utilizing disk diffusion and Etest methods to selected antibiotics was determined for a total of 429 isolates obtained during a period of 5 months from the Puerto Rico Medical Center Bacteriology Laboratory. The distribution of GPC collected was as follows: 213 S. aureus isolates, 162 E. faecalis, 16 E. faecium and 38 S. pneumoniae. The results of the susceptibility test demonstrated: 1) that in S. aureus, 100% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (VAN), LZ and Q/D; 93% to GM; and 61% to methicillin/oxacillin; 2) in S. pneumoniae, 100% were susceptible to LN and GM; 87% to Q/D; and 53% to penicillin; 3) in E. faecalis, 99% were susceptible to ampicillin; 93% to LZ; 79% to GM; 78.6% to VAN; and 0% to Q/D. Sixty eight and 66% of the E. faecalis isolates were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin respectively; and 4) in E. faecium, 100% were susceptible to LZ; 94% to Q/D; 69% to GM; 37.5% to VAN and 20% to ampicillin. In E. faecium isolates, 50% and 31% were susceptible to gentamicin and streptomycin, respectively. Of the vancomycin resistant enterococci, 88.9% and 21% of E. faecium and faecalis showed VanA phenotypic resistance, respectively. These results show that there is a significant degree of antimicrobial resistance in GPC, including 38% methicillin resistance in S. aureus, a near 50% penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, and a significant resistance of enterococcal species to VAN. The new agents, LZ, Q/D and GM, proved to be effective against both, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae. For E. faecium, both, LZ and Q/D were active, while for E. faecalis, only LZ showed consistent activity.
TI  - Evolution of microbial populations during traditional Feta cheese manufacture and ripening.
AB  - In three different dairies (A, B and C) located in Peloponess region (Southern Greece), traditional Feta cheese trials took place February to March using mixtures of sheep's and goat's milk. Only small variations in the evolution of microbial groups were observed during the whole ripening period. The main groups, such as thermophilic cocci, mesophilic lactococci, thermophilic lactobacilli, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), presumptive Leuconostoc, enterococci and micrococci, reached their highest levels during the first 16 days, and then declined approximately 1-2 log units until the end of ripening. The remaining groups investigated, comprising yeasts, coliforms and Escherichia coli, were highest at day 4. The yeasts remained constant, while coliforms and E. coli decreased sharply and were not detectable after 120 days of ripening. A number of 146 isolates (dairy A) taken from all stages of the manufacturing and ripening process were purified and studied. Lactobacillus plantarum (58/146) and isolates of related species Lactobacillus pentosus and Lactobacillus paraplantarum (16/146) were the most common microorganisms found during cheese ripening. Streptococcus thermophilus (23/146) and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (20/146) were detected in high levels up to 20 days, and then gradually reduced. Enterococcus faecium (29/146) was found in all manufacturing and ripening stages.
TI  - Multicentre evaluation of the in vitro activity of linezolid in the Western Pacific.
AB  - Multiresistance to antimicrobial agents is common in staphylococci and pneumococci isolates in the Western Pacific region. The activity of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone, was evaluated against a spectrum of Gram-positive species collected in the region. Eighteen laboratories from six countries in the Western Pacific examined the linezolid susceptibility of 2143 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) and Enterococcus spp. using broth microdilution or disc diffusion methodology. For Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 351) and other streptococci (n = 83), Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips were used. Results were compared with other common and important antimicrobials. Linezolid-resistant strains were not detected among streptococci or staphylococci, including a significant proportion of S. aureus strains that were multiresistant. Almost all enterococci, including 14 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, were linezolid susceptible. A small proportion of enterococci (0.8%) were intermediate to linezolid, and one strain of Enterococcus faecalis had a zone diameter of 20 mm (resistant). The linezolid MIC ranges (MIC(90)) of those strains tested by broth microdilution or Etest were: 1-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for S. aureus, 0.5-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for CoNS, 0.5-4 mg/L (2 mg/L) for Enterococcus spp., 0.12-2 mg/L (1 mg/L) for S. pneumoniae and 0.25-2 mg/L (1 mg/L) for Streptococcus spp. There was no difference in linezolid susceptibility between countries or between multiresistant and susceptible strains of each species monitored.
TI  - MC21-A, a bactericidal antibiotic produced by a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - We previously reported a new marine bacterium, Pseudoalteromonas phenolica sp. nov. O-BC30(T), which produced a bactericidal antibiotic against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In the present study, we purified an anti-MRSA substance (MC21-A) from the methanol extract of the cells of P. phenolica O-BC30(T) and analyzed its chemical structure. MC21-A was determined to be 3,3',5,5'-tetrabromo-2,2'-biphenyldiol by spectrometric analyses. Its anti-MRSA activity against 10 clinical isolates of MRSA was comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A MICs, 1 to 2 micro g/ml; vancomycin MICs, <0.25 to 2 micro g/ml). This substance was also high active against Enterococcus serolicida, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis but was less active against Streptococcus spp. A time-kill study also demonstrated that MC21-A was bactericidal and that its killing rate was much higher than that of vancomycin. The postantibiotic effect (PAE) of MC21-A against a clinical MRSA isolate, strain E 31243, was also comparable to that of vancomycin (MC21-A PAEs, 1.46 to 1.65 h; vancomycin PAEs, 0.84 to 1.43 h). However, a lysis experiment demonstrated that this substance failed to lyse MRSA cells. This substance also did not lyse human erythrocytes. A SYTOX Green staining experiment implied that this substance permeabilized the cell membrane of MRSA as its mode of action. When its activities against a hypersensitive Escherichia coli mutant (KO 1489) and wild-type strains were tested, MC21-A exhibited higher levels of activity against the former. Furthermore, MC21-A was not cytotoxic to human normal fibroblast, rat pheochromocytoma, and Vero cells at concentrations up to 50 micro g/ml. These results suggest that MC21-A might be useful as a lead compound in the development of new types of anti-MRSA substances with modes of action different from those of vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Multicentre assessment of linezolid antimicrobial activity and spectrum in Europe: report from the Zyvox antimicrobial potency study (ZAPS-Europe).
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the in vitro spectrum and activity of linezolid, a recent  oxazolidinone, according to well-controlled surveillance data from 42 medical centers in 13 countries throughout Europe. METHODS: Participants tested the susceptibility of 125 clinical strains of enterococcal and staphylococcal species against 13 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays or the standardized disk diffusion method of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). Streptococcal species (n = 25 at each center) were tested against six drugs using E test (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). Quality assurance testing was conducted using NCCLS-recommended strains and verification of resistance to linezolid and other selected agents was performed by retesting strains at the regional (Europe) and international (USA) monitor sites. RESULTS: A total of 5598 strains from throughout Europe (91% compliance) were tested. Vancomycin resistance was reported in only 0.6 and 3.0% of Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively. Penicillin resistance occurred in 25.1% of Streptococcus pneumoniae; 4.9% at the high-level (> or =2 mg/L). The MIC90 for linezolid was 1 mg/L for streptococci and 2 mg/L for enterococci and staphylococci. Using the US FDA- and EUCAST-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), > or =8 mg/L]. The distribution of linezolid MIC values was unimodal and varied between 0.25 and 1 mg/L for streptococci (>90% of isolates), and between 1 and 2 mg/L for staphylococci (>90%) and enterococci (>95%). There were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin-, oxacillin-, or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains when compared to susceptible organism populations. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the North American component of this study, there was substantially less vancomycin resistance among E. faecium isolates (Europe 3.0% vs. North America 63.4%). While the occurrence of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae in Europe and North America was similar (25.1% vs. 29.7%), the recovery of high-level penicillin-resistant strains was nearly three-fold higher in North America (4.9% vs. 13.2%). Only linezolid was universally active against all the tested Gram-positive isolates at </=4 mg/L.
TI  - Evaluation of a novel automated chemiluminescent assay system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The newly developed Rapid Lumi Eiken/IS60 (RL/IS60) system automatically determines MICs by detecting chemiluminescence produced in the reaction of a chemiluminescent probe and oxygen metabolites from living microorganisms. The present study evaluated this system for accuracy in antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Chemiluminescence intensities after 4 h of cultivation of clinically important strains were plotted against various concentrations of antimicrobial agents, which resulted in curves reflecting the levels of susceptibility. Sixty-percent inhibitory concentrations based on the susceptibility curves agreed with MICs determined by the reference microdilution method. When the MICs of antimicrobial agents for four quality control (QC) strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were determined by the RL/IS60 system, most (91.1%) of them were within the QC limits proposed by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. The system was further assessed for a total of 162 clinical isolates, including E. coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, P. aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, S. aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Overall, there was 90.6% agreement between the RL/IS60 system and the reference microdilution method. Our results suggest that the RL/IS60 system provides rapid and reliable MICs of a variety of antimicrobial agents for clinical isolates as well as QC strains.
TI  - Synthesis of novel nocathiacin-class antibiotics. Condensation of glycolaldehyde  with primary amides and tandem reductive amination of amadori-rearranged 2-oxoethyl intermediates.
AB  - Nocathiacin I (1) and nocathiacin IV (2) are novel indole-containing thiazolyl peptide antibiotics, which exhibit potent activity against key Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including multi drug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Enterococcus faecium. New nocathiacins 7-12 were prepared from 2 by a condensation with glycolaldehyde followed by tandem reductive amination of the 2-oxoethyl intermediate 4. The latter was formed via Amadori rearrangement from initial 2-hydroxyethylideneamide 3. This transformation readily tolerates the complex architecture of nocathiacins and allows selective incorporation of water solubilizing groups to the primary amide in 2 without protecting group manipulation.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAL9141, a novel parenteral cephalosporin active against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Community-acquired and nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens continue to increase in prevalence and have become a serious problem in many parts of the world. BAL9141 is a member of the class of parenteral pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephalosporins, and has a broad spectrum of activity. In the current study, BAL9141 was tested against a large number (n = 2263) of recent isolates from various international surveillance programmes including 1097 Gram-positive strains. Susceptibility to (S) and activity of (mg/L) to BAL9141, based on proposed breakpoints (MIC50/MIC90/% S) were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (0.5/0.5/100%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (1/2/100%), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (0.12/0.25/100%), methicillin-resistant CoNS (MR-CoNS) (1/2/100%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (< or = 0.015/0.25/100%), viridans group streptococci (0.03/0.5/99%), beta-haemolytic streptococci (< or = 0.015/< or = 0.015/100%), Enterococcus faecalis (0.5/16/90%), Enterococcus faecium (>32/>32/22%), Haemophilus influenzae (0.06/0.06/100%), Moraxella catarrhalis (0.06/0.5/100%), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (0.03/0.06/100%) and Neisseria meningitidis (< or = 0.002/0.004/100%). BAL9141 susceptibility at < pr = 4 mg/L (100% S) surpassed that of ceftriaxone (CRO; 1% S) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q-D; 92% S) against MRSA and MR-CoNS (CRO 0.9% S; Q-D 94% S). All S. pneumoniae were inhibited by BAL9141 at < or = 1 mg/L compared with CRO (90% S) and levofloxacin (LVX; 98% S). Susceptibility rates for viridans group streptococci to BAL9141 (>98%) were also higher than to CRO (86%) and LVX (96%). BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against most species of wild-type enteric bacilli, with > or = 95% of isolates being susceptible; however, only modest activity was observed for BAL9141 against non-fermentative Gram-negative species and ESBL-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae. BAL9141 demonstrated excellent activity against many tested pathogens displaying various resistance phenotypes, and should be particularly valuable in the treatment of MRSA as well as for drug-resistant streptococci, while maintaining a spectrum resembling a 'third-generation' cephalosporin against other clinically important species.
TI  - Different bacteriocin activities of Streptococcus mutans reflect distinct phylogenetic lineages.
AB  - Bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are known as mutacins. In this study 16 broadly active mutacin-producing Streptococcus mutans strains from New Zealand, North America and Europe were classified into four groups (A-D) on the basis of differences in their activity in deferred antagonism tests against either the homologous producer strain (to test for presence of self-immunity) or indicator strains Staphylococcus aureus 46 and Enterococcus faecium TE1. Two of the strains included in the study (UA140 and UA96) were representatives of the group I and II mutacin producer strains previously described by Caufield and co-workers. One of the New Zealand isolates of group A (S. mutans strain N) appeared to produce inhibitory activity similar to that of the group I prototype strain UA140. Four other New Zealand isolates of group B (S. mutans strains M19, M34, B34 and D14) had mutacin II-like activity. The group B mutacin producers differed from the group A mutacin producers in their additional activity against Staph. aureus 46. Seven S. mutans strains (M46, B46, B57, M12, M28, B28 and 13M) were distinguished from the group A and group B mutacin producers in that they inhibited E. faecium TE1. These were called group C mutacin producers. Strains H7 and H23 resembled the group C strains in their action on both indicator strains TE1 and 46. However, these two strains failed to exhibit immunity to their own inhibitory products in the deferred antagonism test and were separately classified as group D mutacin producers. Phylogenetic analysis of the strains by several genotypic and phenotypic characteristics revealed that the mutacin groups were associated with distinct evolutionary lineages of S. mutans.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Inhibition by yeast killer toxin-like antibodies of oral Streptococci adhesion to tooth surfaces in an ex vivo model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (KTmAb) and recombinant (KTscFv) anti-idiotypic antibodies, representing the internal image of a yeast killer toxin, proved to be microbicidal in vitro against important eukaryotic and prokaryotic pathogens such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant strains. KTmAb and KTscFv exerted a strong therapeutic effect in well-established animal models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis. Streptococcus mutans is the most important etiologic agent of dental caries that might result from the metabolic end products of dental plaque. Effective strategies to reduce the disease potential of dental plaque have considered the possibility of using antibiotics or antibodies against oral streptococci in general and S. mutans in particular. In this study, the activity of KTmAb and KTscFv against S. mutans and the inhibition and reduction by KTmAb of dental colonization by S. mutans and other oral streptococci in an ex vivo model of human teeth were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KTscFv and KTmAb were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay against a serotype C strain of S. mutans, and other oral streptococci (S. intermedius, S. mitis, S. oralis, S. salivarius). An ex vivo model of human teeth submerged in saliva was used to establish KTmAb potential of inhibiting or reducing the adhesion to dental surfaces by S. mutans and other oral streptococci. RESULTS: KTmAb and KTscFv kill in vitro S. mutans and other oral streptococci. KTmAb inhibit colonization of dental surfaces by S. mutans and oral streptococci in the ex vivo model. CONCLUSIONS: Killer antibodies with antibiotic activity or their engineered derivatives may have a potential in the prevention of dental caries in vivo.
TI  - Synthesis and utilisation of folate by yoghurt starter cultures and probiotic bacteria.
AB  - Thirty-two bacterial isolates from species commonly used in yoghurts and fermented milks were examined for their ability to synthesise or utilise folate during fermentation of skim milk. The organisms examined included the traditional yoghurt starter cultures, Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, and probiotic lactobacilli, bifidobacteria, and Enterococcus faecium. Folate was synthesised by S. thermophilus, bifidobacteria, and E. faecium. S. thermophilus was the dominant producer, elevating folate levels in skim milk from 11.5 ng g(-1) to between 40 and 50 ng g(-1). Generally, lactobacilli depleted the available folate in the skim milk. Fermentations with mixed cultures showed that folate production and utilisation by the cultures was additive. Fermentations using a combination of Bifidobacterium animalis and S. thermophilus resulted in a six-fold increase in folate concentration. Although increased folate levels in yoghurts and fermented milks are possible through judicious selection of inoculum species, the folate levels remain relatively low in terms of recommended daily allowance.
TI  - Isolation and partial characterization of an antibacterial substance produced by  Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A strain of Enterococcus faecium isolated from Bulgarian yellow cheese "kashkaval" produced a bacteriocin-like substance named enterococcin A 2000. The antibacterial substance had a low molar mass (< 2 kDa), was relatively stable toward heat but was sensitive to selected proteolytic enzymes. It was active against Gram-positive bacteria including enterococci, such as Listeria, Bacillus and Streptococcus, and also against Gram-negative E. coli. Production of enterococcin A 2000 has a maximum near the end of the exponential phase of producer growth. The peptide was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, butanol extraction, followed by cation-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase chromatography. A partial sequence of purified enterococcin A 2000 indicated that this substance does not belong to the class IIa of bacteriocins presenting the consensus anti-Listeria motif YGNGV.
TI  - [Interpretative reading of the antibiogram in gram-positive cocci].
AB  - Resistance to methicillin in Staphylococcus is related to expression of the gene  mecA, and implies resistance to all beta-lactams. Breakpoints for interpretation of this mechanism differ in S. aureus and in coagulase-negative species. In relation to macrolides-lincosamides-streptograminsB, the most frequent mechanism among resistant strains is expression of methylases (erm genes). Topoisomerase changes caused by point mutations and expression of the efflux pump NorA determine resistance to quinolones, but there are great differences on the activity of different compounds, which makes interpretative reading difficult. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA strains) have been recently described. In Spain, there is a high percentage of S. pneumoniae strains intermediate or resistant to penicillin, and a low percentage of strains intermediate or resistant to third generation cephalosporins, because of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins. The most frequent phenotype of resistance to macrolides in this species is caused by methylase production. Resistance to quinolones is still uncommon, and is related to the mechanisms previously indicated for Staphylococcus, but clinical interpretation of the antibiograma for this organism is even more complex. No strains of S. pyogenes resistant to penicillin have yet been described. In Spain the most common phenotype of resistance to macrolides in S. pyogenes is determined by efflux pumps (mef genes), affecting 14- and 15-membered macrolides. E. faecalis is usually susceptible to ampicillin, in contrast to E. faecium. Enterococci show intrinsic resistance to aminoglycosides, but still remain susceptible to the combination of these antimicrobials and cell-wall active agents. Strains expressing different aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes became resistant to the combination. Glycopeptide-resistant strains of enterococci are uncommon in our country, but several genotypes, of which vanA is the most relevant from a clinical point of view, have been described in other regions.
TI  - The antibacterial activity of topical retinoids: the case of retinaldehyde.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinoids such as retinoic acid (RA), retinol (ROL) and retinaldehyde (RAL) are currently used in many formulations and indications ranging form acne to skin aging. Most if not all their pharmacological activities occur through binding to nuclear receptors with subsequent modulation of the activities of several genes. Little attention has been given to the many other potential actions on the surface of the skin. AIM: To analyse the potential anti-infective activities of topical ROL, RAL and RA. METHODS: Microbial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ROL, RAL and RA were determined by a microdilution method on reference strains including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Micrococcus flavus, Propionibacterium acnes, Micrococcus luteus, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus hominis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and 133 clinical strains including methicillin-resistant S. aureus, methicillin-sensitive S. aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Streptococcus group B, Enterococcus faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and Pseudomonas/Klebsiella. In two clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, skin bacterial densities were evaluated in samples obtained with the cylinder scrub method: (1). 2 and 5 h after a single application of 0.05% RAL or vehicle on the forearm and (2). in a single-blind randomized study where 0.05% RAL or vehicle were applied daily for 2 weeks on the forehead of 22 volunteers. Paired results from treated (or vehicle) and untreated areas were analysed. RESULTS: Of the three retinoids tested, only RAL showed a significant in vitro antibacterial activity; this activity was found against reference strains of gram-positive bacteria like S. aeureus, Micrococcus spp. or P. acnes. No activity was found against gram-negative bacteria. These results on reference strains were confirmed on 133 clinical isolates. MIC(50) and MIC(90) values for RAL were 8 and 16 mg/l, respectively, for methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 4 and 8 mg/l for methicillin-resistant S. aureus. The two in vivo studies showed that areas treated with RAL had a significant decrease in the bacterial counts. In the forehead study, the median decrease was 10(2) log/cm(2) for P. acnes and 10(1.8) log/cm(2) for staphylococci. No resistant bacteria were found after 2 weeks of topical use. Preliminary results suggest that the antibacterial effect of RAL is due, in part, to the aldehyde group in the lateral chain, since non-retinoid pseudo-analogues of the chain, like citral and hexenal, showed a similar antibacterial activity. CONCLUSION: We have shown that RAL differs from parent natural retinoids such as ROL and RA in demonstrating significant antibacterial activities upon topical use. This activity is likely due to the aldehyde group in the isoprenoic lateral chain, which illustrates the potential bifunctional properties of some retinoids.
TI  - Effect of medium composition on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to mercuric chloride.
AB  - Although there is considerable interest in identifying mercury-resistant bacteria, no standardized assay exists for this purpose. In this study, the effect of the composition of the medium on the susceptibility of oral streptococci to HgCl(2) was investigated. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of HgCl(2) for 52 streptococcal strains and the reproducibility of MIC values for Hg-sensitive and Hg-resistant strains was determined with 11 different media. Addition of blood increased the MIC values, and some media (tryptone soya agar, with or without blood) could not discriminate between Hg-sensitive and Hg-resistant strains. The proportion of streptococci that appeared to be resistant to Hg was very high (>70%) on some media (mitis-salivarius, tryptone soya, Columbia), but not on others (Mueller-Hinton, Brain Heart Infusion, Isosensitest). The MICs of the control strains varied considerably on different testing occasions for tryptone soya agar (with and without blood), Isosensitest agar, and Columbia agar (with blood). Mueller-Hinton (without blood) appeared to be the most suitable medium for isolating Hg-resistant oral streptococci.
TI  - Effects of bacterial direct-fed microbials on ruminal fermentation, blood variables, and the microbial populations of feedlot cattle.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether bacterial direct-fed microbials (DFM)  could be used to minimize the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle receiving high concentrate diets. Six ruminally cannulated steers, previously adapted to a high concentrate diet, were used in a double 3 x 3 Latin square to study the effects of DFM on feed intake, ruminal pH, and ruminal and blood characteristics. Steers were provided ad libitum access to a diet containing steam-rolled barley, barley silage, and a protein-mineral supplement at 87, 9, and 4% (DM basis), respectively. Treatments were as follows: control, Propionibacterium P15 (P15), and Propionibacterium P15 and Enterococcus faecium EF212 (PE). The bacterial treatments (10(9) cfu/g) plus whey powder carrier, or whey powder alone for control, were top-dressed once daily at the time of feeding (10 g/[steer/d]). Periods consisted of 2 wk of adaptation and 1 wk of measurements. Ruminal pH was continuously measured for 6 d using indwelling electrodes. Dry matter intake and ruminal pH (mean, minimum, hours, and area pH < 5.8 or < 5.5) were not affected by treatment (P > 0.05). However, supplementation with P15 increased protozoal numbers (P < 0.05) with a concomitant increase in ruminal NH3 concentration (P < 0.01) and a decrease in the number of amylolytic bacteria (P < 0.05) compared with the control. Streptococcus bovis, enumerated using a selective medium, was numerically reduced with supplementation of PE. Although blood pH and blood glucose were not affected by DFM supplementation, steers fed PE had numerically lower concentrations of blood CO2 than control steers, which is consistent with a reduced risk of metabolic acidosis. Although the bacterial DFM used in this study did not induce changes in DMI or ruminal and blood pH, some rumen and blood variables indicated that the bacterial DFM used in this study may decrease the risk of acidosis in feedlot cattle.
TI  - In vitro activity of AZD2563, a novel oxazolidinone, against European Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - AZD2563 is a new oxazolidinone that has targeted activity against Gram-positive bacteria. The in vitro activity of AZD2563 and nine comparators against 1543 European enterococcal, staphylococcal and streptococcal isolates was determined. The compound is a potent oxazolidinone, with no isolate tested displaying an MIC > 4 mg/L and 94.4% having an MIC < or =2 mg/L. Compared with linezolid, the distribution of MICs for all species of bacteria tested, with the exception of Enterococcus faecium, was shifted by one or two dilution steps to lower values for AZD2563. Thus, this oxazolidinone is a promising new antibiotic for the treatment of infections with Gram-positive cocci.
TI  - Multicenter assessment of the linezolid spectrum and activity using the disk diffusion and Etest methods: report of the Zyvox(R) antimicrobial potency study in Latin America (LA-ZAPS).
AB  - Linezolid was the first clinically applied member of the new antimicrobial class  called the oxazolidinones. These agents have a powerful spectrum of activity focussed against Gram-positive organisms including strains with documented resistances to other antimicrobial classes. We conducted a multicenter surveillance (Zyvox Antimicrobial Potency Study; ZAPS) trial of qualifying Gram-positive isolates from 24 medical centers in eight countries in Latin America. The activity and spectrum of linezolid was compared to numerous agents including glycopeptides, quinupristin/dalfopristin, beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones when testing 2,640 strains by the standardized disk diffusion method or Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). The linezolid spectrum was complete against staphylococci (median zone diameter, 29 - 32 mm), as was the spectrum of vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Among the enterococci, no linezolid resistance was detected, and the susceptibility rate was 93.1 - 96.4%. Only the vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains remained susceptible (92.8%) to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Marked differences in the glycopeptide resistance patterns (van A versus van B) were noted for the 22 isolates of VRE, thus requiring local susceptibility testing to direct therapy. Streptococcus pneumoniae and other species were very susceptible (100.0%) to linezolid, MIC(90) at 0.75 microg/ml. Penicillin non-susceptible rate was 27.7% and erythromycin resistance was at 17.4%. Other streptococci were also completely susceptible to linezolid (MIC(90), 1 microg/ml). These results provide the initial benchmark of potency and spectrum for linezolid in Latin American medical centers. Future comparisons should recognize that the oxazolidinones possess essentially a complete spectrum coverage of the monitored staphylococci, enterococci and streptococcal isolates in 2000-2001. This positions linezolid as the widest spectrum empiric choice against multi-resistant Gram-positive cocci, a spectrum of activity greater than available glycopeptides and the streptogramin combination.
TI  - Detection and characterization of erythromycin-resistant methylase genes in Gram-positive bacteria isolated from poultry litter.
AB  - The epidemiology of four erythromycin-resistant methylase ( erm) genes, ermA, ermB, ermC and msrA, was determined in erythromycin-resistant staphylococci, enterococci and streptococci isolated from poultry litter. All isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Southern hybridization indicated that 4 of the 20 staphylococci contained the ermC gene on plasmids: on a 2.2 kb plasmid in Staphylococcus hominis and S. sciuri, on a 6.0 kb plasmid in S. xylosus, and on a 7.0 kb plasmid in S. lentus. In 16 of the 20 staphylococci, the ermA gene was harbored exclusively on the chromosome, as a double chromosomal insert on 8.0 and 6.2 kb EcoRI fragments. None of the staphylococci harbored the msrA gene. Dot-blot analysis indicated that all enterococci and streptococci hybridized with a biotinylated ermB gene probe. Southern hybridization indicated that only 2 of the 19 erythromycin-resistant enterococci contained the ermB gene on plasmids. The gene was localized on 4.0 kb and 5.9 kb plasmids, respectively, in two Enterococcus faecium isolates. Results from our studies indicate that the patterns of occurrence of erm genes, the sizes of the plasmids and the copy numbers of the inserts were different from the existing information on the presence of erm genes in clinical strains of Staphylococcus spp.
TI  - In vitro activity of a novel oxazolidinone, AZD2563, against randomly selected and multiresistant Gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of AZD2563, a novel oxazolidinone, was assessed against 595 Gram-positive cocci, comprising recent surveillance isolates and a collection of resistant (including multiresistant), epidemiologically diverse isolates. The MICs of AZD2563 for staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci had narrow ranges, 0.25-2 mg/L, with modal MICs of 1 mg/L for staphylococci and pneumococci, and 1-2 mg/L for enterococci. AZD2563 was equally active against the surveillance isolates and those that had been selected for their multiresistance to other agents. The MICs of AZD2563 were either the same as those of linezolid or two-fold lower.

AB  - Enterococci are widely distributed in raw-milk cheeses and are generally thought  to positively affect flavor development. Their natural habitats are the human and animal intestinal tracts, but they are also found in soil, on plants, and in the intestines of insects and birds. The source of enterococci in raw-milk cheese is unknown. In the present study, an epidemiological approach with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to type 646 Enterococcus strains which were isolated from a Cheddar-type cheese, the milk it was made from, the feces of cows and humans associated with the cheese-making unit, and the environment, including the milking equipment, the water used on the farm, and the cows' teats. Nine different PFGE patterns, three of Enterococcus casseliflavus, five of Enterococcus faecalis, and one of Enterococcus durans, were found. The same three clones, one of E. faecalis and two of E. casseliflavus, dominated almost all of the milk, cheese, and human fecal samples. The two E. casseliflavus clones were also found in the bulk tank and the milking machine even after chlorination, suggesting that a niche where enterococci could grow was present and that contamination with enterococci begins with the milking equipment. It is likely but unproven that the enterococci present in the human feces are due to consumption of the cheese. Cow feces were not considered the source of enterococci in the cheese, as Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus bovis, which largely dominated the cows' intestinal tracts, were not found in either the milk or the cheese.
TI  - [Yearly changes in antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates between 1996 and 2000--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems,  against various clinical isolates obtained between 1996 and 2000 were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, and penicillins. Fifteen species, 1,062 strains, of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from January to December, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 127), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 123), Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 104), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 58), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 100), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 50), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 125), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 150), Enterococcus faecium (n = 50), Enterococcus avium (n = 50), and Peptostreptococcus spp. (P. anaerobius, P. asaccharolyticus, P. magnus, P. micros, P. prevotii; n = 125). CZOP possessed stable antibacterial activities against all strains tested throughout 5 years. The MIC90 of CZOP against MRSA and S. haemolyticus tended to decrease while against S. pneumoniae and Peptostreptococcus spp., tended to increase year by year. However, the MIC90 just changed a little and were consistent with the results from the studies performed until the new drug application approval. Increases in the MIC90 against S. pneumoniae were also observed with cefpirome (CPR), cefepime (CFPM), flomoxef (FMOX), sulbactam/cefoperazone (SBT/CPZ), and imipenem (IPM). Increases in the MIC90 against Peptostreptococcus spp. were also observed with ceftazidime (CAZ), CPR, CFPM, FMOX, SBT/CPZ, and IPM. The decreases in the sensitivities were not always considered to depend upon generation of resistant bacteria because the annual MIC range of each antibacterial agent was almost generally wide every year and the annual sensitivity of each strain to the agents extremely varied. In conclusion, the annual antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria did not considerably change. It, therefore, was suggested that CZOP had maintained high antibacterial activity during 5 years of post-marketing.
TI  - A multicenter evaluation of linezolid antimicrobial activity in North America.
AB  - Overall, 141 centers in North America enrolled in this international surveillance study designed to evaluate the in vitro antimicrobial activity and spectrum of linezolid, a new oxazolidinone. Each participant tested the susceptibility of clinical isolates of staphylococcal species (n = 85) against 12 drugs, and enterococcal species (n = 40) against 6 drugs using reference broth microdilution trays; and of streptococcal species (n = 25) against 6 drugs using Etests (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). Quality control testing was conducted using recommended strains, and verification of resistance to linezolid and select other agents was performed by a regional monitor. Of the 20,161 isolates collected from sites across the United States (US; n = 132) and Canada (n = 9), 18,307 were included in this analysis. Oxacillin resistance occurred in 38.7 and 70.6% of Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal (CoNS) isolates, respectively. Vancomycin resistance was reported in 65.9 and 2.6% of Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, respectively. Penicillin resistance occurred in 37.2% of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 17.5% constituting high-level resistance (MIC, > or =2 microg/ml). The MIC(90) for linezolid was 1 microg/ml for streptococci, 2 microg/ml for enterococci and CoNS isolates, and 4 microg/ml for S. aureus. Using the US FDA-recommended susceptible breakpoints for linezolid, there were no confirmed reports of linezolid resistance (i.e., MIC > or =8 microg/ml). The occurrence of linezolid MICs was unimodal and generally varied between, 1-4 microg/ml for staphylococci (94% of recorded results), 1-2 microg/ml for enterococci (93%), and 0.5-1 microg/ml for streptococci (85%). Susceptibility to linezolid was not influenced by susceptibility to other antiicrobials such as vancomycin, beta-lactams or macrolides. Only linezolid was universally active against essentially all tested Gram-positive specimens. The unimodal susceptibility pattern is indicative of excellent and near complete activity against key Gram-positive pathogens including multiply resistant strains, but surveillance for emerging resistances (rare) and the performance of routine susceptibility tests to guide patient therapy seems prudent.
TI  - In vitro activity of a new cephalosporin, RWJ-54428, against streptococci, enterococci and staphylococci, including glycopeptide-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - The need for new antimicrobial agents with activity against Gram-positive organisms has become increasingly important because of emerging resistance. We compared the activity of a new b-lactam antimicrobial agent, RWJ-54428 (MC-02 479), with representatives of other classes of antimicrobial agents against 76 Staphylococcus aureus (including four glycopeptide- intermediate strains), 50 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 20 Enterococcus faecalis, 20 Enterococcus faecium, 10 Enterococcus gallinarum/Enterococcus casseliflavus, 54 Streptococcus pneumoniae and 22 viridans streptococcal isolates. The MIC(90) of RWJ-54,428 was < or = 2 mg/L for all groups of bacteria tested except E. faecium. The activity against four strains of glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus was similar to that for other methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates (range 0.5-2.0 mg/L).
TI  - Evaluation of the VITEK 2 system for identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - A study was conducted to evaluate the new VITEK 2 system (bioMerieux) for identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gram-positive cocci. Clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (n = 100), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (n = 100), Enterococcus spp. (n = 89), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 29), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 66) were examined with the ID-GPC identification card and with the AST-P515 (for staphylococci), AST-P516 (for enterococci and S. agalactiae) and AST-P506 (for pneumococci) susceptibility cards. The identification comparison methods were the API Staph for staphylococci and the API 20 Strep for streptococci and enterococci; for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, the agar dilution method according to the procedure of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) was used. The VITEK 2 system correctly identified to the species level (only one choice or after simple supplementary tests) 99% of S. aureus, 96.5% of S. agalactiae, 96.9% of S. pneumoniae, 92.7% of Enterococcus faecalis, 91.3% of Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and 88% of Staphylococcus epidermidis but was least able to identify Enterococcus faecium (71.4% correct). More than 90% of gram-positive cocci were identified within 3 h. According to the NCCLS breakpoints, antimicrobial susceptibility testing with the VITEK 2 system gave 96% correct category agreement, 0.82% very major errors, 0.17% major errors, and 2.7% minor errors. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed category agreement from 94 to 100% for S. aureus, from 90 to 100% for CNS, from 91 to 100% for enterococci, from 96 to 100% for S. agalactiae, and from 91 to 100% for S. pneumoniae. Microorganism-antibiotic combinations that gave very major errors were CNS-erythromycin, CNS-oxacillin, enterococci-teicoplanin, and enterococci-high-concentration gentamicin. Major errors were observed for CNS-oxacillin and S. agalactiae-tetracycline combinations. In conclusion the results of this study indicate that the VITEK 2 system represents an accurate and acceptable means for performing identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests with medically relevant gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Therapeutic impact of streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in hematology patients].
AB  - From January 1999 to May 2000 (17 months), 21 strains of streptococci and four strains of enterococci have been isolated from 74 blood cultures in 25 infectious episodes in hematologic patients. They concerned 21 patients, of 21 to 77 years old. These patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). Seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. During 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. In six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). Most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten Streptococcus mitis, five S. oralis, two S. sanguis, three S. pneumoniae). A single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. The enterococci were one strain of Enterococcus faecalis and three E. faecium. Ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L of penicillin G, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = MIC < 32 mg/L), and a strain was resistant (MIC = 32 mg/L). Eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. For three strains, the MICs of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/L and 8-32 mg/L, respectively) were higher. Levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. All species were susceptible to glycopeptides. Three patients were transferred in intensive care unit for respiratory distress or shock syndrome. Their evolution has remained severe under antibiotherapy comprising beta-lactam or vancomycin associated with an aminoside. This results demonstrate the interest of species identification to adapt the antibiotic treatment and confirms the frequency of oral streptococci in severe bacteremia in neutropenic patients.
TI  - [Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].
AB  - As a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was also preferable. CZOP and other cephems also had a preferable antibacterial activity against S. milleri group that was most sensitive to benzylpenicillin. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against Peptostreptococcus spp. was preferable but weaker than that of cefazolin, CTM and cefmetazole. The resistance ratio estimated with breakpoint MIC of CZOP was 96.5% in MRSA, 93.1% in PRSP, 60.0% in PISP, 40.3% in S. haemolyticus, 22.3% in E. faecalis, and 15.9% in MRSE. Those resistance ratios were similar to those for CFPM, but E. faecalis showed 90.8% resistance for CFPM. The difference in the resistance ratio of E. faecalis demonstrated that CZOP successfully maintained its antibacterial activity against this species. In conclusion, no remarkable annual change in the antibacterial activities of CZOP against the Gram-positive bacteria was observed. The sensitivities of PISP and PRSP to CZOP, however, was suggested to be decreasing.
TI  - Antimicrobial use and antimicrobial resistance: a population perspective.
AB  - The need to stem the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has prompted multiple, sometimes conflicting, calls for changes in the use of antimicrobial agents. One source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. For infections like tuberculosis, in which resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. By contrast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resistance in the treated host is a relatively rare event. For these organisms, indirect, population-level mechanisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. These mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host's colonization with resistant organisms.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activities of a novel cephalosporin, BMS-247243, against organisms other than staphylococci.
AB  - BMS-247243, a novel cephalosporin inhibitory for methicillin-resistant staphylococci, primarily has activity against gram-positive bacteria. The activities of BMS-247243, cefotaxime, and ceftriaxone against streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were similar. BMS-247243 inhibits Enterococcus faecalis but not Enterococcus faecium. BMS-247243 also inhibits many inherently vancomycin-resistant species (Leuconstoc, Lactobacillus, Pediococcus) and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3004, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pharmacodynamic properties of the novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide) antibiotic, HMR 3004, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect. METHODS: The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The postantibiotic effects of HMR 3004 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. RESULTS: The time kill-kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3004 is inoculum dependent and predominantly bacteriostatic being only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3004 exhibited a significant postantibiotic effect with all strains studied, ranging from 1.9--6.2 h at 10 x MIC. CONCLUSIONS: The bacteriostatic activity and significant postantibiotic effect demonstrated by HMR 3004 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in Italy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in Italy. METHODS: Susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS-guided MIC methodology. Pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 Streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 Streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 Streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 Enterococcal isolates, 40 Haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 Moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 Gram-positive and 25 Gram-negative anaerobes. RESULTS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited Staphylococcus aureus and other Staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. Similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. Enterococcus faecalis was not included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. Respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all Gram-negative anaerobes tested. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. This drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.
TI  - A protocol for polymerase chain reaction detection of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from the root canal.
AB  - AIM: The present study was set up to develop a protocol for detection of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium from the root canal. METHODOLOGY: A collection of type strains and clinical isolates ol E. faecalis and faecium was used. Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers targeted against the 16S/23S rDNA intergenic region were used and PCR reactions were set up. PCR products were run on TBE-agarose gel and analysed. The sensitivity of the PCR systems was studied using serial dilutions of (i) bacterial DNA and (ii) bacterial cells from E. faecalis. The specificity of the identification was tested against closely related species. RESULTS: All strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium produced identical amplicon profiles composed of two major bands corresponding to sizes of 320 and 420 bp. When amplifying DNA of higher purity, a third band of 600 bp became evident as well. Closely related species demonstrated single bands of various sizes and were easily distinguished from enterococci. The detection level of DNA from serial dilutions of DNA was 10(-13) g. The DNA extraction protocol from bacterial cell suspensions resulted in a detection level of 10 bacterial cells per sample. CONCLUSIONS The present study demonstrated a good potential for using PCR technology in the detection of F. faecalis and E. faecium from root canal samples. With a high specificity the methodology was able to detect 10 cells of E. faecalis.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activities of DQ-113, a potent quinolone, against clinical isolates.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of DQ-113, formerly D61-1113, was compared with those  of antibacterial agents currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested are inhibited (MIC90s) of DQ-113 against clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci were 0.03, 0.008, 0.03, and 0.06 microg/ml, respectively. Moreover, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against ofloxacin-resistant and methicillin-resistant S. aureus, with a MIC90 of 0.25microg/ml. DQ-113 inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains, and Streptococcus pyogenes at 0.06 microg/ml, and DQ-113 was more active than the other quinolones tested against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium with MIC90s of 0.25 and 2 microg/ml, respectively. Against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, DQ-113 showed the highest activity among the reference compounds, with a MIC range from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml. DQ-113 also showed a potent activity against Haemophilus influenzae, including ampicillin-resistant strains (MIC90, 0.015 microg/ml), and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.03 microg/ml). The activity of DQ-113 was roughly comparable to that of levofloxacin against all species of ENTEROBACTERIACEAE: The MICs of DQ-113 against ofloxacin-susceptible Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranged from 0.25 to 2 microg/ml, which were four times higher than those of ciprofloxacin. From these results, DQ-113 showed the most potent activity against gram-positive pathogens among antibacterial agents tested.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline (GAR-936) against recently isolated clinical bacteria in Spain.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of tigecycline (GAR-936) were compared with those of other agents against 1,087 strains recently isolated in 12 Spanish medical centers. Tigecycline showed activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Composition of enterococcal and streptococcal flora from pigeon intestines.
AB  - AIMS: To identify the streptococcal and enterococcal components of the microflora from pigeon intestines to species level by tDNA-intergenic polymerase chain reaction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Gram-positive coccal strains were isolated from the intestines or faeces of 50 different pigeons, all from different lofts, on Columbia CNA blood agar. Sodium azide-sensitive enterococci were found to constitute the major coccal members of the intestinal flora of pigeons. Forty-two of 69 isolates were identified as Enterococcus columbae (84% of animals tested positive), while E. cecorum was encountered in 28% of all animals (14 isolates). Minor species (less than 10% of pigeons positive) were E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, Streptococcus alactolyticus and Strep. gallolyticus. Contrary to the species description of E. columbae and E. cecorum, some of the strains were found to be motile. Certain other minor differences with the species description of E. columbae are also indicated. CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus columbae is the major Gram-positive facultatively anaerobic component of the pigeon intestinal flora. Certain phenotypic characteristics differ from the original species description. The potentially pathogenic Strep. gallolyticus is a minor component of the microflora. Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis are rare in pigeons. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The enterococcal and streptococcal flora of pigeons is composed of mainly host-specific bacteria. These are not likely to act as zoonotic pathogens nor as carriers of antibiotic resistance determinants possibly spreading to humans.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against clinical isolates of Enterococcus spp., Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp. tested by Etest.
AB  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of everninomicin, a novel oligosaccharide antibiotic, was tested against clinical isolates of 11 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) strains, 11 methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains, 22 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecalis strains, 23 Enterococcus faecium strains, 23 Enterococcus avium strains, 27 Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, 22 Streptococcus pyogenes strains, and 20 Streptococcus agalactiae strains. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of everninomicin were determined by Etest and compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline. The Etest showed that everninomicin exhibited excellent activity (MIC, <0.016 to 1.5 microg/ml) against the gram-positive cocci tested. The antimicrobial activity of everninomicin against S. aureus and S. epidermidis was stronger than that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and minocycline, in particular against MRSA, with an MIC50 of 0.38 microg/ml and an MIC90 of 0.5 microg/ml. Against strains of enterococci and streptococci, everninomicin was more active than vancomycin, but as active as teicoplanin.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - Extracellular arginine aminopeptidase from Streptococcus gordonii FSS2.
AB  - Streptococcus gordonii is a primary etiological agent in the development of subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE), producing thrombus formation and tissue damage on the surfaces of heart valves. This is ironic, considering its normal role as a benign inhabitant of the oral microflora. However, strain FSS2 of S. gordonii has been found to produce several extracellular aminopeptidase- and fibrinogen-degrading activities during growth in a pH-controlled batch culture. In this report, we describe the purification, characterization, and partial cloning of a predicted serine class arginine aminopeptidase (RAP) with some cysteine class characteristics. Isolation of this enzyme by anion-exchange, gel filtration, and isoelectric focusing chromatography yielded a protein monomer of approximately 70 kDa, as shown by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization, gel filtration, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. Nested-PCR cloning enabled the isolation of a 324-bp-long DNA fragment encoding the 108-amino-acid N terminus of RAP. Culture activity profiles and N-terminal sequence analysis indicated the export of this protein from the cell surface. Homology was found with a putative dipeptidase from Streptococcus pyogenes and nonspecific dipeptidases from Lactobacillus helveticus and Lactococcus lactis. We believe that RAP may serve as a critical factor for arginine acquisition during nutrient stress in vivo and also in the proteolysis of host proteins and peptides during SBE pathology.
TI  - In vitro activity of cephalosporin RWJ-54428 (MC-02479) against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02479) is a novel cephalosporin that binds to penicillin-binding protein (PBP) PBP 2' (PBP 2a) of methicillin-resistant staphylococci. Its in vitro activity was assessed against 472 gram-positive cocci, largely selected as epidemiologically unrelated isolates with multidrug resistance. The MIC at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)) and MIC(90) of RWJ-54428 for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were 1 and 2 microg/ml, respectively, whereas they were 0.5 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) were 1 and 4 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS), whereas they were 0.25 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, for methicillin-susceptible isolates. The highest MICs for MRSA and MRCoNS isolates were 2 and 4 microg/ml, respectively. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of RWJ-54428 for Enterococcus faecalis were 0.5 and 1 microg/ml, respectively, but they were 4 and 8 microg/ml, respectively, for Enterococcus faecium. For penicillin-susceptible, -intermediate, and -resistant pneumococci, the MIC(90)s of RWJ-54428 were 0.03, 0.25, and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively, with the highest MIC for a pneumococcus being 1 microg/ml, recorded for a strain for which penicillin and cefotaxime MICs were 8 and 4 microg/ml. MICs for Lancefield group A, B, C, and G streptococci were < or =0.008 microg/ml; those for viridans group streptococci, including isolates not susceptible to penicillin, were from 0.015 to 0.5 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 did not select resistant mutants of MRSA or enterococci in challenge experiments and has the potential to be useful for the treatment of infections caused by gram-positive cocci.
TI  - [Utilization of exogenous siderophores by enterococci].
AB  - The study was undertaken to investigate the ability of enterococci to assimilate  iron via siderophores of bacteria living in the same habitats in the human organism. The potential recipients of exogenous siderophores were six Enterococcus faecalis and six Enterococcus faecium strains, isolated from clinical materials of human origin. The donors of siderophores were Gram-negative rods (various species of the Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter) and Gram-positive cocci (various species of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus). All of the investigated E. faecium and only two E. faecalis strains demonstrated the ability to utilize the siderophores of the aforementioned bacterial groups, predominantly the chelators of Gram-negative rods, those of Gram-positive cocci were utilized to a smaller extent. Four recipient strains from E. faecalis species did not demonstrate the ability to utilize siderophores synthesized by all of 40 investigated donor strains.
TI  - The in vitro activity of BMS-284756, a new des-fluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The in vitro activity of BMS-284756 (previously T-3811ME), a des-fluoro(6) quinolone, was investigated and compared with those of six other antimicrobial agents. Susceptibility tests were performed on 919 Gram-positive, Gram-negative (including nine quinolone-resistant Escherichia coli) and anaerobic bacteria, three Chlamydia isolates and four Mycobacteria spp. BMS-284756 was marginally less active against the Enterobacteriaceae, but was the most active quinolone against staphylococci, enterococci and peptostreptococci. Against Streptococcus pneumoniae, BMS-284756 and gemifloxacin were more active than other quinolones. The MIC(90) of BMS-284756 was > or = 2 mg/L for the following bacteria: E. coli (MIC(90) 16 mg/L), Acinetobacter spp. (8 mg/L), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (64 mg/L) and Enterococcus faecium (4 mg/L). The MIC of BMS-284756 for Mycobacterium spp. was within one dilution of the MIC of ciprofloxacin. BMS-284756 was markedly more active than ciprofloxacin against the Chlamydia isolates tested.
TI  - Enterococcal endocarditis in Sweden, 1995-1999: can shorter therapy with aminoglycosides be used?
AB  - A 5-year nationwide prospective study in Sweden during 1995-1999 identified 881 definite episodes of infective endocarditis. Definite enterococcal endocarditis was diagnosed in 93 episodes (11%), the largest series of enterococcal endocarditis so far presented. Mortality during treatment was 16%, the relapse rate was 3%, and clinical cure was achieved in the remaining 81% of the episodes. Clinical cure was achieved with a median duration of cell wall-active antimicrobial therapy of 42 days combined with an aminoglycoside (median treatment time, 15 days). International guidelines generally recommend a 4-6-week combined synergistic treatment course with a cell wall-active antibiotic and an aminoglycoside. Treatment regimens in Sweden often include a shortened aminoglycoside treatment course in order to minimize adverse effects in older patients. Fatal outcome seemed not to be due to the shortened aminoglycoside therapy course. In many enterococcal endocarditis episodes, duration of aminoglycoside therapy could probably be shortened to 2-3 weeks.
TI  - In vitro activities of a new ketolide, ABT-773, against multidrug-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ABT-773 were evaluated against 324 strains of gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and Enterococcus spp. ABT-773 had lower MIC ranges, MICs at which 50% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(50)s), and MIC(90)s than erythromycin or clindamycin for almost all isolates tested. The MICs of ABT-773 were also lower than those of quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D) for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Rhodococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp., while the MICs of Q-D were lower than those of ABT-773 for methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-resistant isolates.
TI  - Prevalence and mechanisms of macrolide resistance in invasive and noninvasive group B streptococcus isolates from Ontario, Canada.
AB  - Macrolide resistance has been demonstrated in group B streptococcus (GBS), but there is limited information regarding mechanisms of resistance and their prevalence. We determined these in GBS obtained from neonatal blood cultures and vaginal swabs from pregnant women. Of 178 isolates from cases of neonatal GBS sepsis collected from 1995 to 1998, 8 and 4.5% were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively, and one isolate showed intermediate penicillin resistance (MIC, 0.25 microg/ml). Of 101 consecutive vaginal or rectal/vaginal isolates collected in 1999, 18 and 8% were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, respectively. Tetracycline resistance was high (>80%) among both groups of isolates. Of 32 erythromycin-resistant isolates, 28 possessed the erm methylase gene (7 ermB and 21 ermTR/ermA) and 4 harbored the mefA gene; one isolate harbored both genes. One isolate which was susceptible to erythromycin but resistant to clindamycin (MIC, 4 microg/ml) was found to have the linB gene, previously identified only in Enterococcus faecium. The mreA gene was found in all the erythromycin-resistant strains as well as in 10 erythromycin-susceptible strains. The rate of erythromycin resistance increased from 5% in 1995-96 to 13% in 1998-99, which coincided with an increase in macrolide usage during that time.
TI  - Synthesis and antibacterial activity of acylides (3-O-acyl-erythromycin derivatives): a novel class of macrolide antibiotics.
AB  - Introduction of an acyl group to the 3-O-position of erythromycin A derivatives instead of L-cladinose led to a novel class of macrolide antibiotics that we named "acylides". The 3-O-nitrophenylacetyl derivative TEA0777 showed significantly potent activity against not only erythromycin-susceptible Gram-positive pathogens but also inducibly macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin B (MLS(B))-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and efflux-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. These results indicated that acylides have potential as next-generation macrolide antibiotics.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of chloroxylenol and chlorhexidine in the treatment of infected root canals.
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the antimicrobial efficacy of a chlorhexidine gluconate (2.0%) and of an ethanolic chloroxylenol solution (10%) as a temporary root canal dressing against selected test microorganisms (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Extracted single-rooted human teeth were instrumented up to size 40. After removal of the smear layer suspensions of the test microorganisms were inserted into the root canals. After incubation for 48 hrs each suspension of the test organisms was removed and the root canals were filled with one of the two different disinfectants. The teeth were then incubated for 48 hrs. Twelve teeth and three controls were used for each of the four test organisms and each of the two regimens. After incubation, each root canal was instrumented and the removed canal wall dentin was examined microbiologically. RESULTS: With a contact time of 48 hrs between the two disinfectants and the four bacterial suspensions the medications led to a total killing of microorganisms in 82% of a total of 96 contaminated teeth. In the dentin layer situated 50 microm from the root canal, both medications achieved bacterial killing in a range from 99.9% to 99.99%, depending on the test organism. There were no significant differences (P> 0.1) between the relative antimicrobial activity of the two root canal dressings.
TI  - Linezolid: pharmacokinetic characteristics and clinical studies.
AB  - Linezolid is an oxazolidinone indicated in the treatment of nosocomial and community-acquired pneumonia, complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus infections. The drug is also approved for use in complicated skin infections and nosocomial pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, concurrent bacteremia associated with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and concurrent bacteremia associated with community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae.
TI  - The DUEL study: a multi-center in vitro evaluation of linezolid compared with other antibiotics in the Netherlands.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate bacterial susceptibility to linezolid in the Netherlands in comparison with other antibiotics. METHODS: Bacterial strains were isolated between September 1999 and January 2000 from patients presumed to require antibiotic treatment. The in vitro activity of 1226 strains from 34 participating laboratories was tested against linezolid, vancomycin, teicoplanin, oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and other antibiotics against enterococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were obtained with the E test on Mueller-Hinton agar: every laboratory included control strains. For vancomycin and teicoplanin only, brain-heart infusion agar and an inoculum of 2.0 McFarland was used for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococci to support a better growth and clear recognition of hetero-resistant colonies. RESULTS: The values of MIC90 for linezolid were 1.5, 0.75, 0.75 and 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci, respectively. Six enterococcal strains with decreased susceptibility against vancomycin or teicoplanin were identified as Enterococcus faecium, E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus (two strains each) and they were found to harbor vanA, vanC1 and vanC2/3 genes, respectively. Nine per cent of Streptococcus pneumoniae (an increase from 1% 4 years ago) showed decreased susceptibility to erythromycin, of both the ermB and mefE type; there was no cross-resistance with linezolid. Twelve coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains were resistant to teicoplanin. CONCLUSION: Linezolid is a promising drug in the treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive cocci. Cross-resistance with other antibiotics tested was not found.
TI  - In vitro activity of linezolid against Gram-positive uropathogens of hospitalized patients with complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of linezolid, a recently developed antibiotic agent active against Gram-positive bacteria, was tested against pathogens from three different collections. (1) Uropathogens from hospitalized urological patients (1990/1991) with complicated and/or hospital-acquired UTIs; Urologic Clinic, Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. (2) Uropathogens from a multi-centre study (1995/1996) comprising 37 urological centres throughout Germany. (3) MRSA isolates of patients and staff (1999/2000) within the Hospital St. Elisabeth, Straubing. Genotyping of the latter isolates was performed by pulsed-field-electrophoresis. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of linezolid determined by an agar (Isosensitest) dilution method using a multipoint inoculator and an inoculum of 10(4) cfu per point ranged for methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n=27) between 2 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (n=35) between 1 and 2 mg/l, for methicillin susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) (MSSE) (n=67) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for methicillin resistant CNS (MRSE) (n=19) between 0.25 and 2 mg/l, for Enterococcus. faecalis (n=184) between 0.5 and 4 mg/l, for E. faecium (n=3) 2 mg/l and for Streptococcus spp. (n=4) between 0.25 and 1 mg/l, indicating that all strains were susceptible. According to the in vitro activity, linezolid may be considered a promising antibacterial agent for the treatment of complicated UTI caused by Gram-positive uropathogens. Thus, linezolid should be evaluated in a clinical study.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - [Utility of prolonged incubation and terminal subcultures of blood cultures from  immunocompromised patients].
AB  - The value of blind terminal subcultures (7 and 30 days) and prolonged incubation  (30 days) of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients was analyzed in the Fundacion Favaloro, the Fundacion para la Lucha contra las Enfermedades Neurologicas de la Infancia and the Hospital de Ninos Ricardo Gutierrez. A total of 2707 blood cultures and 369 patients were included (transplantation of solid organs 154, oncohematologic disorders 106 and solid tumors 109). Bact-Alert bottles were incubated at 35 degrees C for 30 days in the Bact-Alert System. Bottles with positive signals were routinely removed, and aliquots of the broth were Gram stained and subcultured aerobically in chocolate agar and Sabouraud agar. A total of 136 bacteremic episodes were obtained. The positivization time of blood cultures was 81.6% at 24 h, 93.3% at 48 h, 94.5% at 72 h and 97.7% within 7 days. Only 3 (2.2%) episodes were positive by blind terminal subcultures and 1 (0.75%) by prolonged incubation (14 days). The median time and range of positivization in hours were 13.8 and 2.2-168, respectively. The microorganisms isolated were coagulase negative staphylococci (n = 24), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 22), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 21), Escherichia coli (n = 18), Acinetobacter spp (n = 9), Candida spp (n = 8), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 6), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 5), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5), Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella spp and Capnocytophaga sputigena (n = 2), Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterococcus faecium, Citrobacter diversus, Candida albicans, Klebsiella oxytoca, Chryseomonas luteola, Serratia marcescens, Abiotrophia spp, Campylobacter jejuni, Moraxella catarrhalis, Moraxella urethralis, Neisseria sicca, beta hemolytic group G streptococci, Rhodococcus equi, Micrococcus spp, Cryptococcus neoformans and Streptococcus mitis (n = 1). In our experience, blind terminal subcultures and prolonged incubation of blood cultures from immunosuppressed patients are unnecessary and cost expensive.
TI  - Activity of daptomycin against Gram-positive pathogens: a comparison with other agents and the determination of a tentative breakpoint.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was studied in comparison with other agents active against 328 recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive pathogens. MIC data showed that the addition of calcium ions to a final concentration of 50 mg/L enhanced the activity of daptomycin generally by eight- to 16-fold. In the presence of calcium ions daptomycin was uniformly active against the strains of Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. studied with a MIC90 of < or = 1 mg/L. Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium were slightly less susceptible (MIC90 2 mg/L). Vancomycin-, fluoroquinolone- and quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant strains were all susceptible to daptomycin. The presence of serum reduced the apparent activity of daptomycin to only a moderate extent. Employing the BSAC methodologies, a tentative breakpoint of 2 mg/L for daptomycin is proposed.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of vancomycin dimers with potent activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria: target-accelerated combinatorial synthesis.
AB  - Based on the notion that dimerization and/or variation of amino acid 1 of vancomycin could potentially enhance biological activity, a series of synthetic and chemical biology studies were undertaken in order to discover potent antibacterial agents. Herein we describe two ligation methods (disulfide formation and olefin metathesis) for dimerizing vancomycin derivatives and applications of target-accelerated combinatorial synthesis (e.g. combinatorial synthesis in the presence of vancomycin's target Ac2-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) to generate libraries of vancomycin dimers. Screening of these compound libraries led to the identification of a number of highly potent antibiotics effective against vancomycin-suspectible, vancomycin-intermediate resistant and, most significantly, vancomycin-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Solid- and solution-phase synthesis of vancomycin and vancomycin analogues with activity against vancomycin-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Vancomycin, the prototypical member of the glycopeptide family of antibiotics, is a clinically used antibiotic employed against a variety of drug-resistant bacterial strains including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The recent emergence of vancomycin resistance, viewed as a growing threat to public health, prompted us to initiate a program aimed at restoring the potency of this important antibiotic through chemical manipulation of the vancomycin structure. Herein, we describe the development of synthetic technology based on the design of a novel selenium safety catch linker, application of this technology to a solid-phase semisynthesis of vancomycin, and the solid- and solution-phase synthesis of vancomycin libraries. Biological evaluation of these compound libraries led to the identification of a number of in vitro highly potent antibacterial agents effective against vancomycin-resistant bacteria. In addition to aiding these investigations, the solid-phase chemistry described herein is expected to enhance the power of combinatorial chemistry and facilitate chemical biology and medicinal chemistry studies.
TI  - An in vitro study of antibacterial properties of the cervical mucus plug in pregnancy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether cervical mucus plugs are antibacterial in vitro. STUDY DESIGN: Cervical mucus plugs from 56 healthy women in labor were studied by 2 different antimicrobial assays: (1) analysis of the inhibition by the cervical mucus plug of several gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria by overlaying the cervical mucus plug onto an agar plate with imbedded bacteria, and (2) determination of the antibacterial property of the cervical mucus plug material by radial diffusion assay with group B Streptococcus and Escherichia coli. RESULTS: In the agar overlay assay, there was complete inhibition of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus saprophyticus, E coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and patient-variable partial-to-complete inhibition of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus agalactiae. In the radial diffusion assay, cervical mucus plugs had activity toward group B Streptococcus equivalent to 0.075 microg/mL of gentamicin and toward E coli equivalent to 0.5 microg/mL of gentamicin. CONCLUSION: A low-molecular substance with antibacterial activity in the cervical mucus plug may protect the fetus against ascending infections.
TI  - A simple model host for identifying Gram-positive virulence factors.
AB  - We demonstrate the use of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a facile and inexpensive model host for several Gram-positive human bacterial pathogens. Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus, but not Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecium, or Streptococcus pyogenes, kill adult C. elegans. Focusing our studies on the enterococcal species, we found that both E. faecalis and E. faecium kill C. elegans eggs and hatchlings, although only E. faecalis kills the adults. In the case of adults, a low inoculum of E. faecalis grows to a high titer in the C. elegans intestine, resulting in a persistent infection that cannot be eradicated by prolonged feeding on E. faecium. Interestingly, a high titer of E. faecium also accumulates in the nematode gut, but does not affect the longevity of the worms. Two E. faecalis virulence-related factors that play an important role in mammalian models of infection, fsr, a putative quorum-sensing system, and cytolysin, are also important for nematode killing. We exploit the apparent parallels between Gram-positive infection in simple and more complex organisms by using the nematode to identify an E. faecalis virulence factor, ScrB, which is relevant to mammalian pathogenesis.
TI  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 514 Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin was assessed in comparison with that of vancomycin and penicillin against a wide range of Gram-positive aerobic clinical isolates. MICs were determined by an agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar (NCCLS/EUCAST) and on Isotonic agar adjusted to contain 50 mg/L free calcium (BSAC). Both media were enriched with 5% horse blood for fastidious organisms. Daptomycin MICs for all 172 staphylococci, including methicillin-susceptible and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were 0.03-0.5 mg/L. For 99 of the 100 enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, n = 50; Enterococcus faecium, n = 50), including 37 vancomycin-resistant isolates, they were 0.25-2 mg/L. For all 108 beta-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae, daptomycin MICs were 0.016- 0.25 mg/L; for 101 alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae and 'viridans' streptococci, they were 0.016-2 mg/L. For miscellaneous vancomycin-resistant isolates including Lactobacillus spp., Lactococcus spp., Leuconostoc spp., Pediococcus spp. and isolates of Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum, daptomycin MICs were 0.03-2 mg/L; MICs for the seven isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were 0.25-4 mg/L. There was little difference between the results on Mueller-Hinton agar and on supplemented Isotonic agar The discrepant results occasionally obtained tended to be one dilution higher on supplemented Isotonic agar. Daptomycin was active (MICs < or = 2 mg/L) against all the isolates tested with the exception of one isolate each of E. faecium and L. monocytogenes (MICs = 4 mg/L). Our results indicate that daptomycin MICs are independent of methicillin and vancomycin MICs.
TI  - Cholesterol embolism causing delayed healing of a foot ulcer.
AB  - A cholesterol embolism presents with various systemic and local manifestations giving rise to a diagnostic dilemma. We report a case of cholesterol embolism of the leg that delayed the healing of a foot ulcer, necessitating a toe amputation. This report points to the potential of cholesterol emboli to cause a significant compromise in the vascular supply.
TI  - Multi-laboratory assessment of the linezolid spectrum of activity using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method: Report of the Zyvox Antimicrobial Potency Study (ZAPS) in the United States.
AB  - The in vitro activity of linezolid against common Gram-positive pathogens was compared to that of penicillin or ampicillin or oxacillin (depending upon genus), cefazolin, erythromycin, clindamycin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, levofloxacin, nitrofurantoin and vancomycin by disk diffusion methods. One hundred and six centers (31 states in US) tested recent clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and other streptococci. Testing was conducted using the standardized disk diffusion method and concurrent quality control testing was performed. Strains with linezolid zone diameters of < or = 20 mm were requested for referral to the microbiology monitor for confirmation. A total of 3,100 isolates (97% compliance) were tested. Susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 21 mm) of staphylococci and streptococci to linezolid was reported in 100% and 99.4% of staphylococci and streptococci, respectively. Susceptibility (zone diameters, > or = 23 mm) of enterococci to linezolid was 96.0% with only three isolates (0.4%) reported as resistant (zone diameters, < or = 20 mm; unconfirmed). Among a total of nine isolates (0.3%) reported to have zone diameters 20 mm, six were not submitted for further testing, two were contaminated with Gram-negative bacilli and one was determined to be linezolid-susceptible. There were no differences in linezolid susceptibility in the vancomycin- or oxacillin- or penicillin-resistant subsets of strains. This susceptibility pattern for US medical centers is indicative of the excellent and nearly complete in vitro activity against the key Gram-positive pathogens for which linezolid has received US Food and Drug Administration indications for clinical use.
TI  - Post-antibiotic growth suppression of linezolid against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro post-antibiotic effects (PAEs) of eight different concentrations of  linezolid against Gram-positive cocci were investigated and the results analysed using the sigmoid E(max) model for mathematically modelling the PAE. Mean maximal linezolid PAEs against strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 2.2, 1.8, 2.8, 2.0 and 3.0 h, respectively. Resistance to methicillin (for the staphylococci), vancomycin (for the enterococci) and penicillin (for the pneumococci) had no effect on the duration of the PAE. Results of PAE testing support twice-daily dosing of linezolid in humans.
TI  - Resistance studies with daptomycin.
AB  - We studied the in vitro emergence of resistance to daptomycin using three methods: spontaneous resistance incidence, serial passage in the presence of increasing drug concentrations, and chemical mutagenesis. No spontaneously resistant mutants were obtained for any organism tested (<10(-10) for Staphylococcus aureus, <10(-9) for Staphylococcus epidermidis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecalis, <10(-9) for Enterococcus faecium, <10(-8) for Streptococcus pneumoniae). Population analysis demonstrated that bacterial susceptibility to daptomycin is heterogeneous. Assay results were sensitive to calcium concentration and culture density, both of which can affect apparent resistance rates. Stable S. aureus mutants were isolated by both serial passage in liquid media and chemical mutagenesis. The daptomycin MICs for these isolates were 8- to 32-fold higher than for the parental strain. Many mutants with high MICs (>12.5 microg/ml) had significant growth defects but did not display phenotypes typical of S. aureus small colony variants. The voltage component (Delta psi) of the bacterial membrane potential was increased in three independent resistant isolates. In vivo data showed that some daptomycin-resistant mutants had lost significant virulence. For other mutants, the degree of in vitro resistance was greater than the change in in vivo susceptibility. These results suggest that infection with some daptomycin-resistant organisms may still be easily treatable.
TI  - Linezolid for the treatment of resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide a comprehensive review of linezolid, the first of a new class of antibiotics, the oxazolidinones. Therapeutic issues regarding the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and a brief history of the oxazolidinones are also discussed. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1966-March 2001) was conducted to identify pertinent literature, including preclinical trials, clinical trials, and reviews. Unpublished clinical data, adverse effects, and dosing information were abstracted from product labeling. STUDY SELECTION: Clinical efficacy data were extracted from clinical trials, case reports, and abstracts that mentioned linezolid. Additional information concerning antibiotic resistance, the oxazolidinones, in vitro susceptibility and the pharmacokinetic profile of linezolid also was reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Linezolid exhibits activity against many gram-positive organisms, including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. Linezolid inhibits bacterial protein synthesis at an early step in translation and is rapidly and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract following oral administration. Efficacy has been demonstrated in a number of unpublished clinical trials in adults with pneumonia, skin and skin structure infections, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium infections. The adverse effect profile is similar to that of comparator agents (beta-lactams, clarithrornycin, vancomycin). CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid is the first oral antimicrobial agent approved for the treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Since the oxazoildinones have a unique mechanism of action and expanded spectrum of activity against virulent and highly resistant gram positive pathogens, linezolid is a valuable alternative to currently available treatment options. Clinical trials evaluating linezolid and other oxazolidinones for antibiotic-resistant gram-positive infections, as well as comparator studies comparing linezolid with other candidate drugs, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin and choramphenicol, will further define the role of linezolid.
TI  - Linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. It has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including Clostridium perfringens, C. difficile, Peptostreptococcus spp. and Bacteroidesfragilis. In controlled phase III studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. Further phase III studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (SSTIs). In these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated SSTIs. Oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated SSTIs or community-acquired pneumonia. Linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. The most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. Thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of S. aureus (including GISA), Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis (including VRE). In controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by VRE. As the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among S. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
TI  - Comparison of statistical methods for identification of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium from randomly amplified polymorphic DNA patterns.
AB  - Thermophilic streptococci play an important role in the manufacture of many European cheeses, and a rapid and reliable method for their identification is needed. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) PCR (RAPD-PCR) with two different primers coupled to hierarchical cluster analysis has proven to be a powerful tool for the classification and typing of Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis (G. Moschetti, G. Blaiotta, M. Aponte, P. Catzeddu, F. Villani, P. Deiana, and S. Coppola, J. Appl. Microbiol. 85:25-36, 1998). In order to develop a fast and inexpensive method for the identification of thermophilic streptococci, RAPD-PCR patterns were generated with a single primer (XD9), and the results were analyzed using artificial neural networks (Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Basis Function network, and Bayesian network) and multivariate statistical techniques (cluster analysis, linear discriminant analysis, and classification trees). Cluster analysis allowed the identification of S. thermophilus but not of enterococci. A Bayesian network proved to be more effective than a Multilayer Perceptron or a Radial Basis Function network for the identification of S. thermophilus, E. faecium, and E. faecalis using simplified RAPD-PCR patterns (obtained by summing the bands in selected areas of the patterns). The Bayesian network also significantly outperformed two multivariate statistical techniques (linear discriminant analysis and classification trees) and proved to be less sensitive to the size of the training set and more robust in the response to patterns belonging to unknown species.
TI  - Linezolid: an oxazolidinone antimicrobial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Linezolid is the first oxazolidinone anti-infective agent marketed in the United States. It is indicated for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other susceptible organisms, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. It also is indicated for the treatment of uncomplicated skin and skin-structure infections caused by methicillin-sensitive S. aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and community-acquired pneumonia caused by penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of linezolid. METHODS: Using the terms linezolid, PNU-100766, and oxazolidinone, we performed a literature search of the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 to September 2000), HealthSTAR (1993 to September 2000), Iowa Drug Information Service (1966 to September 2000), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970 to September 2000), PharmaProjects (January 2000 version), and meeting abstracts of the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (1996 to 2000). RESULTS: Linezolid has a unique structure and mechanism of action, which targets protein synthesis at an exceedingly early stage. Consequently, cross-resistance with other commercially available antimicrobial agents is unlikely. It is primarily effective against gram-positive bacteria. To date, resistance to linezolid has been reported in patients infected with enterococci. The pharmacokinetic parameters of linezolid in adults are not altered by hepatic or renal function, age, or sex to an extent requiring dose adjustment. Linezolid is metabolized via morpholine ring oxidation, which is independent of the cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzyme system; as a result, linezolid is unlikely to interact with medications that stimulate or inhibit CYP450 enzymes. Compassionate-use trials and other clinical studies involving mainly adult hospitalized patients with gram-positive infections have shown that linezolid administered intravenously or orally is effective in a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections, including those caused by resistant gram-positive organisms. Reported adverse effects include thrombocytopenia. diarrhea, headache, nausea, vomiting, insomnia, constipation, rash, and dizziness. Preliminary pharmacoeconomic data indicate that a significantly higher percentage of patients receiving linezolid therapy versus comparator could be discharged from the hospital by day 7 (P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Linezolid appears to be effective while maintaining an acceptable tolerability profile. Due to the risk of bacterial resistance, linezolid should be reserved for the treatment of documented serious vancomycin-resistant enterococcal infections.
TI  - In vitro activities of RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) against multiresistant gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - RWJ-54428 (MC-02,479) is a new cephalosporin with a high level of activity against gram-positive bacteria. In a broth microdilution susceptibility test against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), RWJ-54428 was as active as vancomycin, with an MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC(90)) of 2 microg/ml. For coagulase-negative staphylococci, RWJ-54428 was 32 times more active than imipenem, with an MIC(90) of 2 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was active against S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates with reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides (RWJ-54428 MIC range, < or = 0.0625 to 1 microg/ml). RWJ-54428 was eight times more potent than methicillin and cefotaxime against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MIC(90), 0.5 microg/ml). For ampicillin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant and high-level aminoglycoside-resistant strains), RWJ-54428 had an MIC(90) of 0.125 microg/ml. RWJ-54428 was also active against Enterococcus faecium, including vancomycin-, gentamicin-, and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains. The potency against enterococci correlated with ampicillin susceptibility; RWJ-54428 MICs ranged between < or = 0.0625 and 1 microg/ml for ampicillin-susceptible strains and 0.125 and 8 microg/ml for ampicillin-resistant strains. RWJ-54428 was more active than penicillin G and cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant, -intermediate, and -susceptible strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90)s, 0.25, 0.125, and < or = 0.0625 microg/ml, respectively). RWJ-54428 was only marginally active against most gram-negative bacteria; however, significant activity was observed against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC(90)s, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively). This survey of the susceptibilities of more than 1,000 multidrug-resistant gram-positive isolates to RWJ-54428 indicates that this new cephalosporin has the potential to be useful in the treatment of infections due to gram-positive bacteria, including strains resistant to currently available antimicrobials.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of quinupristin/dalfopristin tested against gram-positive cocci from Latin America: results from the global SMART (GSMART) surveillance study.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci are important causes of both nosocomial and community-acquired infections, and antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens has become an important problem worldwide. Since resistance among these organisms can vary substantially by geographic location, we conducted a multicenter surveillance study with isolates from five Latin American countries (15 medical centers). Quinupristin/dalfopristin (formerly RP-59500) is a novel streptogramin combination with focused activity against Gram-positive cocci, many exhibiting emerging resistance. The in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and 12 other antimicrobial agents were evaluated against 1,948 strains including Staphylococcus aureus (747 strains), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS;446 strains), enterococci (429 strains), and various Streptococcus spp. (326 strains). Oxacillin resistance was observed in 41% of S. aureus (MIC, <e; 2 microg/ml or >e; 13 mm) and 40% of CoNS (MIC, <e; 0.25 microg/ml or >e; 18 mm). Vancomycin, teicoplanin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90), 0.25 - 1 mg/ml) remained effective against all strains, but cross-resistance was high among other tested drugs. The quinupristin/dalfopristin MIC(50) for Streptococcus pneumoniae and other streptococci was only 0.5 mg/ml (13% to 28% were penicillin-resistant; 12% to 22% were macrolide-resistant). Enterococci demonstrated variable inhibition by quinupristin/dalfopristin depending upon identification and the susceptibility testing method used. The demonstrated quinupristin/dalfopristin activity against Enterococcus faecium was confirmed, but potential species identification errors with various commercial systems continue to confuse susceptibility statistics, even though some strains of E. faecium confirmed by PCR-based or other molecular identification techniques did have quinupristin/dalfopristin MICs of >e; 4 microg/ml. Most important, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci are rapidly emerging in Latin America, and quinupristin/dalfopristin appears active against many of these isolates as well as having potency against nearly all staphylococci and streptococci tested at <e; 2 microg/ml or having a zone diameter of >e; 16 mm. Comparisons to GSMART results from other continents show nearly identical quinupristin/dalfopristin activity for each Gram-positive species tested. These results define the role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in Latin American medical centers and provide a benchmark for future in vitro comparisons.
TI  - Linezolid Pharmacia Corp.
AB  - Linezolid is an oxazolidinone developed by Pharmacia (formerly Pharmacia & Upjohn) for the treatment of multi-resistant Gram-positive infections [187765,317456]. It binds to ribosomal 50S subunits, most likely within domain V within the 23S rRNA peptidyl transferase and a secondary interaction with the 30S subunit. This results in inhibition of the initiation of protein translation at an early point, which is probably N-formylmethionyl-tRNA [335843]. No direct action on DNA or RNA synthesis has been observed [220169]. Linezolid resistance due to a 23S rRNA mutation may emerge in Enterococci during therapy with this antimicrobial, and may be associated with clinical failure [368652]. Following FDA approval, linezolid was launched in May 2000 [368526,368652]. In April 2000, the FDA approved linezolid injection, tablets and oral suspension for the treatment of patients with infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. It is indicated for adults in the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), complicated and uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), VRE faecium and penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae [363503]. The FDA, however, did not grant Pharmacia indications for linezolid in the treatment of CAP due to either penicillin-resistant S aureus (PRSA) or MRSA. In May 2000, Merrill Lynch predicted sales for 2000 to be US $50 million, rising to US $760 million in 2004 [366910]. In February 2000, P&U predicted that peak sales of the drug had the potential to reach in excess of US $750 million [358429]. In February 1999, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter predicted sales of US $40 million in 2000 rising to US $275 million in 2005 [319855]. In December 1998, Deutsche Bank predicted sales of US $100 million in 2000 rising to US $300 million in 2002 [316769].
TI  - In vitro and in vivo properties of Ro 63-9141, a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
AB  - Ro 63-9141 is a new member of the pyrrolidinone-3-ylidenemethyl cephem series of  cephalosporins. Its antibacterial spectrum was evaluated against significant gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens in comparison with those of reference drugs, including cefotaxime, cefepime, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. Ro 63-9141 showed high antibacterial in vitro activity against gram-positive bacteria except ampicillin-resistant enterococci, particularly vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium. Its MIC at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited (MIC(90)) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was 4 microg/ml. Ro 63-9141 was bactericidal against MRSA. Development of resistance to the new compound in MRSA was not observed. Ro 63-9141 was more potent than cefotaxime against penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC(90) = 2 microg/ml). It was active against ceftazidime-susceptible strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against Enterobacteriaceae except Proteus vulgaris and some isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. The basis for the antibacterial spectrum of Ro 63-9141 lies in its affinity to essential penicillin-binding proteins, including PBP 2' of MRSA, and its stability towards beta-lactamases. The in vivo findings were in accordance with the in vitro susceptibilities of the pathogens. These data suggest the potential utility of Ro 63-9141 for the therapy of infections caused by susceptible pathogens, including MRSA. Since insufficient solubility of Ro 63-9141 itself precludes parenteral administration in humans, a water-soluble prodrug, Ro 65-5788, is considered for development.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance: proficiency  testing and quality control results from the World Health Organization's external quality assurance system for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.
AB  - The accuracy of antimicrobial susceptibility data submitted by microbiology laboratories to national and international surveillance systems has been debated for a number of years. To assess the accuracy of data submitted to the World Health Organization by users of the WHONET software, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed six bacterial isolates representing key antimicrobial-resistance phenotypes to approximately 130 laboratories, all but one of which were outside of the United States, for antimicrobial susceptibility testing as part of the World Health Organization's External Quality Assurance System for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. Each laboratory also was asked to submit 10 consecutive quality control values for several key organism-drug combinations. Most laboratories were able to detect methicillin (oxacillin) resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, high-level vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins in Klebsiella pneumoniae. Many laboratories, particularly those using disk diffusion tests, had difficulty in recognizing reduced susceptibility to penicillin in an isolate of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The most difficult phenotype for laboratories to detect was reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in an isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis. The proficiency testing challenge also included a request for biochemical identification of a gram-negative bacillus, which most laboratories recognized as Enterobacter cloacae. Although only a small subset of laboratories have submitted their quality control data, it is clear that many of these laboratories generate disk diffusion results for oxacillin when testing S. aureus ATCC 25923 and S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 that are outside of the acceptable quality control range. The narrow quality control range for vancomycin also proved to be a challenge for many of the laboratories submitting data; approximately 27% of results were out of range. Thus, it is important to establish the proficiency of laboratories submitting data to surveillance systems in which the organisms are tested locally, particularly for penicillin resistance in pneumococci and glycopeptide resistance in staphylococci.
TI  - Use of preclinical data for selection of a phase II/III dose for evernimicin and  identification of a preclinical MIC breakpoint.
AB  - One of the most challenging issues in the design of phase II/III clinical trials  of antimicrobial agents is dose selection. The choice is often based on preclinical data from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies with animals and healthy volunteers but is rarely linked directly to the target organisms except by the MIC, an in vitro measure of antimicrobial activity with many limitations. It is the thesis of this paper that rational dose-selection decisions can be made on the basis of the pharmacodynamics (PDs) of the test agent predicted by a mathematical model which uses four data sets: (i) the distribution of MICs for clinical isolates, (ii) the distribution of the values of the PK parameters for the test drug in the population, (iii) the PD target(s) developed from animal models of infection, and (iv) the protein binding characteristics of the test drug. In performing this study with the new anti-infective agent evernimicin, we collected a large number (n = 4,543) of recent clinical isolates of gram-positive pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, and Staphylococcus aureus) and determined the MICs using E-test methods (AB Biodisk, Stockholm, Sweden) for susceptibility to evernimicin. Population PK data were collected from healthy volunteers (n = 40) and patients with hypoalbuminemia (n = 12), and the data were analyzed by using NPEM III. PD targets were developed with a neutropenic murine thigh infection model with three target pathogens: S. pneumoniae (n = 5), E. faecalis (n = 2), and S. aureus (n = 4). Drug exposure or the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve/MIC (AUC/MIC) was found to be the best predictor of microbiological efficacy. There were three possible microbiological results: stasis of the initial inoculum at 24 h (10(7) CFU), log killing (pathogen dependent, ranging from 1 to 3 log(10)), or 90% maximal killing effect (90% E(max)). The levels of protein binding in humans and mice were similar. The PK and PD of 6 and 9 mg of evernimicin per kg of body weight were compared; the population values for the model parameters and population covariance matrix were used to generate five Monte Carlo simulations with 200 subjects each. The fractional probability of attaining the three PD targets was calculated for each dose and for each of the three pathogens. All differences in the fractional probability of attaining the target AUC/MIC in this PD model were significant. For S. pneumoniae, the probability of attaining all three PD targets was high for both doses. For S. aureus and enterococci, there were increasing differences between the 6- and 9-mg/kg evernimicin doses for reaching the 2 log killing (S. aureus), 1 log killing (enterococci), or 90% E(max) AUC/MIC targets. This same approach may also be used to set preliminary in vitro MIC breakpoints.
TI  - Susceptibility of gram-positive cocci from 25 UK hospitals to antimicrobial agents including linezolid. The Linezolid Study Group.
AB  - The prevalence of antibiotic resistance amongst Gram-positive cocci from 25 UK hospitals was studied over an 8 month period in 1999. A total of 3770 isolates were tested by the sentinel laboratories using the Etest; these bacteria comprised 1000 pneumococci, 1005 Staphylococcus aureus, 769 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) and 996 enterococci. To ensure quality, 10% of the isolates were retested centrally, as were any found to express unusual resistance patterns. The prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) varied widely amongst the sentinel laboratories. The resistance rates to methicillin among S. aureus and CNS were 19.2 and 38.9%, respectively, with MRSA rates in individual sentinel sites ranging from 0 to 43%. No glycopeptide resistance was seen in S. aureus, but 6.5% of CNS isolates were teicoplanin resistant and 0.5% were vancomycin resistant. Vancomycin resistance was much more frequent among Enterococcus faecium (24.1%) than E. faecalis (0.5%) (P<0.05), with most resistant isolates carrying vanA. The rate of penicillin resistance in pneumococci was 8.9%, and this resistance was predominantly intermediate (7.9%), with only six hospitals reporting isolates with high level resistance. The prevalence of erythromycin resistance among pneumococci was 12.3%, with the majority of resistant isolates having the macrolide efflux mechanism mediated by mefE. All the organisms tested were susceptible to linezolid with MICs in the range 0.12-4 mg/L. The modal MICs of linezolid were 1 mg/L for CNS and pneumococci, and 2 mg/L for S. aureus and enterococci. Linezolid was the most potent agent tested against Gram-positive cocci, including multiresistant strains, and as such may prove a valuable therapeutic option for the management of Gram-positive infections in hospitals.
TI  - Evidence for horizontal gene transfer in evolution of elongation factor Tu in enterococci.
AB  - The elongation factor Tu, encoded by tuf genes, is a GTP binding protein that plays a central role in protein synthesis. One to three tuf genes per genome are present, depending on the bacterial species. Most low-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria carry only one tuf gene. We have designed degenerate PCR primers derived from consensus sequences of the tuf gene to amplify partial tuf sequences from 17 enterococcal species and other phylogenetically related species. The amplified DNA fragments were sequenced either by direct sequencing or by sequencing cloned inserts containing putative amplicons. Two different tuf genes (tufA and tufB) were found in 11 enterococcal species, including Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus pseudoavium, and Enterococcus raffinosus. For the other six enterococcal species (Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus columbae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus sulfureus, Enterococcus saccharolyticus, and Enterococcus solitarius), only the tufA gene was present. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the 11 species having two tuf genes all have a common ancestor, while the six species having only one copy diverged from the enterococcal lineage before that common ancestor. The presence of one or two copies of the tuf gene in enterococci was confirmed by Southern hybridization. Phylogenetic analysis of tuf sequences demonstrated that the enterococcal tufA gene branches with the Bacillus, Listeria, and Staphylococcus genera, while the enterococcal tufB gene clusters with the genera Streptococcus and Lactococcus. Primary structure analysis showed that four amino acid residues encoded within the sequenced regions are conserved and unique to the enterococcal tufB genes and the tuf genes of streptococci and Lactococcus lactis. The data suggest that an ancestral streptococcus or a streptococcus-related species may have horizontally transferred a tuf gene to the common ancestor of the 11 enterococcal species which now carry two tuf genes.
TI  - Comparative In vitro activities of daptomycin and vancomycin against resistant gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The in vitro activity of daptomycin against 224 current gram-positive clinical isolates including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRSS), and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) was evaluated. The MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited for daptomycin and vancomycin, respectively, were as follows: MRSA, 1 and 2 microg/ml; MRSS, 1 and 4 microg/ml; PRSP, 1 and 0.5 microg/ml; and VREF, 2 and >64 microg/ml. Daptomycin was bactericidal against 82% of 17 VREF isolates. The antibacterial activity of daptomycin was strongly dependent on the calcium concentration of the medium. Daptomycin was active against all gram-positive cocci tested.
TI  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan.
AB  - To understand quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance among clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria in Taiwan, where this agent is not yet available for clinical use, we evaluated 1,287 nonduplicate isolates recovered from January 1996 to December 1999 for in vitro susceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin and other newer antimicrobial agents. All methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates were susceptible to quinupristin-dalfopristin. High rates of nonsusceptibility to quinupristin-dalfopristin (MICs, >/=2 microg/ml) were demonstrated for the following organisms: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (31%), coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) (16%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (8%), viridans group streptococci (51%), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (85%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (100%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (66%), Leuconostoc spp. (100%), Lactobacillus spp. (50%), and Pediococcus spp. (87%). All isolates of MSSA, MRSA, S. pneumoniae, and viridans group streptococci were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. The rates of nonsusceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin were 5 and 7%, respectively, for CoNS, ranging from 12 and 18% for S. simulans to 0 and 0% for S. cohnii and S. auricularis. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin had good activities against these isolates except for ciprofloxacin-resistant vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci. In Taiwan, virginiamycin has been used in animal husbandry for more than 20 years, which may contribute to the high rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance.
TI  - A novel IS-like element frequently inserted in a putative virulence regulator in  bovine mastitis isolates of Streptococcus dysgalactiae.
AB  - Streptococcus dysgalactiae, a Lancefield group C streptococcus, is commonly isolated from bovine mastitis. We recently identified a putative regulon in two S. dysgalactiae strains, 8215 and Epi9, consisting of two consecutive genes, dmg and dem, coding for a possible regulatory protein and an M-like protein with fibrinogen- and IgG-binding-properties, respectively. During these studies a short sequence homologous to an IS element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene of strain 8215. The present investigation describes the complete sequence of this IS-like element, named ISSdy1, which consists of 1218 bp and contains two ORFs, flanked by imperfect repeats. The nucleotide sequence of the IS-like element shows 82% identity to the previously reported sequence of IS199 from Streptococcus mutans V403. The deduced amino acid sequences of the ORFs also revealed high homology to transposases from IS elements in Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, and Shigella dysenteriae, all belonging to the IS3 family. We studied the distribution of ISSdy1 in 57 S. dysgalactiae isolates using PCR analysis with specific primers derived from the IS element. Ninety-eight percent of the isolates contained the ISSdy1 element. Surprisingly, in the majority of studied strains a copy of the IS-like element was found to be inserted in the dmg gene, a putative virulence regulator.
TI  - Identification of Enterococcus species and phenotypically similar Lactococcus and Vagococcus species by reverse checkerboard hybridization to chaperonin 60 gene sequences.
AB  - Data from four recent studies (S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 36:2164-2166, 1998; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 34:818-823, 1996; S. H. Goh et al., J. Clin. Microbiol. 35:3116-3121, 1997; A. Y. C. Kwok et al., Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 49:1181-1192, 1999) suggest that an approximately 600-bp region of the chaperonin 60 (Cpn60) gene, amplified by PCR with a single pair of degenerate primers, has utility as a potentially universal target for bacterial identification (ID). This Cpn60 gene ID method correctly identified isolates representative of numerous staphylococcal species and Streptococcus iniae, a human and animal pathogen. We report herein that this method enabled us to distinguish clearly between 17 Enterococcus species (Enterococcus asini, Enterococcus rattus, Enterococcus dispar, Enterococcus gallinarum, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus cecorum, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus mundtii, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus malodoratus, Enterococcus raffinosus, Enterococcus avium, Enterococcus pseudoavium, Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam, and Enterococcus saccharolyticus), and Vagococcus fluvialis, Lactococcus lactis, and Lactococcus garvieae. From 123 blind-tested samples, only two discrepancies were observed between the Facklam and Collins phenotyping method (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) and the Cpn60 ID method. In each case, the discrepancies were resolved in favor of the Cpn60 ID method. The species distributions of the 123 blind-tested isolates were Enterococcus new sp. strain Facklam (ATCC 700913), 3; E. asini, 1; E. rattus, 4; E. dispar, 2; E. gallinarum, 20; E. hirae, 9; E. durans, 9; E. faecalis, 12; E. mundtii, 3; E. casseliflavus, 8; E. faecium, 25; E. malodoratus, 3; E. raffinosus, 8; E. avium, 4; E. pseudoavium, 1; an unknown Enterococcus clinical isolate, sp. strain R871; Vagococcus fluvialis, 4; Lactococcus garvieae, 3; Lactococcus lactis, 3; Leuconostoc sp., 1; and Pediococcus sp., 1. The Cpn60 gene ID method, coupled with reverse checkerboard hybridization, is an effective method for the identification of Enterococcus and related organisms.
TI  - Ability of laboratories to detect emerging antimicrobial resistance in nosocomial pathogens: a survey of project ICARE laboratories.
AB  - A proficiency testing project was conducted among 48 microbiology laboratories participating in Project ICARE (Intensive Care Antimicrobial Resistance Epidemiology). All laboratories correctly identified the Staphylococcus aureus challenge strain as oxacillin- resistant and an Enterococcus faecium strain as vancomycin-resistant. Thirty-one (97%) of 32 laboratories correctly reported the Streptococcus pneumoniae strain as erythromycin-resistant. All laboratories testing the Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain against ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin correctly reported the organism as resistant. Of 40 laboratories, 30 (75%) correctly reported resistant MICs or zone sizes for the imipenem- and meropenem-resistant Serratia marcescens. For the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 18 (42%) of 43 laboratories testing ceftazidime correctly reported ceftazidime MICs in the resistant range. These results suggest that current testing generally produces accurate results, although some laboratories have difficulty detecting resistance to carbapenems and extended-spectrum cephalosporins. This highlights the need for monitoring how well susceptibility test systems in clinical laboratories detect emerging resistance.
TI  - In vitro activity of monoclonal and recombinant yeast killer toxin-like antibodies against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive cocci.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Monoclonal (mAbKT) and recombinant single-chain (scFvKT) anti-idiotypic antibodies were produced to represent the internal image of a yeast killer toxin (KT) characterized by a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity, including gram-positive cocci. Pathogenic eukaryotic and prokaryotic microorganisms, such as Candida albicans, Pneumocystis carinii, and a multidrug-resistant strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, presenting specific, although yet undefined, KT-cell wall receptors (KTR), have proven to be killed in vitro by mAbKT and scFvKT. mAbKT and scFvKT exert a therapeutic effect in vivo in experimental models of candidiasis and pneumocystosis by mimicking the functional activity of protective antibodies naturally produced in humans against KTR of infecting microorganisms. The swelling tide of concern over increasing bacterial resistance to antibiotic drugs gives the impetus to develop new therapeutic compounds against microbial threat. Thus, the in vitro bactericidal activity of mAbKT and scFvKT against gram-positive, drug-resistant cocci of major epidemiological interest was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: mAbKT and scFvKT generated by hybridoma and DNA recombinant technology from the spleen lymphocytes of mice immunized with a KT-neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb KT4) were used in a conventional colony forming unit (CFU) assay to determine, from a qualitative point of view, their bactericidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, S. haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. These bacterial strains are characterized by different patterns of resistance to antibiotics, including methicillin, vancomycin, and penicillin. RESULTS: According to the experimental conditions adopted, no bacterial isolate proved to be resistant to the activity of mAbKT and scFvKT. CONCLUSIONS: scFvKT exerted a microbicidal activity against multidrug resistant bacteria, which may represent the basis for the drug modeling of new antibiotics with broad antibacterial spectra to tackle the emergence of microbial resistance.
TI  - Effect of probiotic bacteria on prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses in vitro.
AB  - The proliferation of yeasts in the mixed bacterial and fungal biofilms colonising silicone rubber voice prostheses in laryngectomised patients is the main cause of malfunctioning of the valve mechanism on the oesophageal side of the prostheses. Indwelling voice prostheses usually have to be replaced every 3-4 months. The consumption of probiotic bacteria is largely motivated by health claims related to the urogenital and lower digestive tract, but not to the upper digestive tract. The present study examined the influence of probiotic bacteria on the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses, as formed in a modified Robbins device. Exposure of oropharyngeal biofilms on voice prostheses to suspensions of Bifidobacterium infantis 420 or Enterococcus faecium 603 did not significantly reduce the number of yeasts in the biofilm. However, suspensions of Lactobacillus fermentum B54, L. rhamnosus 744 or L. lactis cremoris SK11 led to a reduction in the number of yeasts harvested from the voice prostheses. Suspensions of L. casei Shirota and Streptococcus thermophilus B significantly reduced the number of yeasts in the biofilm to 39% and 33%, respectively. The reduction brought about in yeast prevalence in the mixed biofilm was greatest by exposure to a suspension of L. lactis 53, with yeast prevalence only 4% of the control. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the prevalence of yeasts in oropharyngeal biofilms on silicone rubber voice prostheses might be controlled by consumption of probiotic bacteria.
TI  - Evaluation of gemifloxacin (SB-265805, LB20304a): in vitro activity against over  6000 gram-positive pathogens from diverse geographic areas.
AB  - Gemifloxacin (GEMI), formerly SB-265805 and LB20304, is a newer fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum activity against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens. The present investigation extended earlier observations by sampling an additional 6790 gram-positive organisms from more than 50 medical centres on three continents. The reference broth microdilution method with recommended medium supplements was used throughout. Selected results (number strains tested; MIC90 for GEMI/trovafloxacin in mg/l; % < or = 1 mg/l for GEMI/trovafloxacin) were: Staphylococcus aureus (3672; 2/2; 86/85), S. epidermidis (404; 1/>4; 92/71), Enterococcus faecalis (630; 4/>4; 76/66), E. faecium (216; > 4/>4; 15/11), Streptococcus pneumoniae (300; 0.06/0.25; 100/97), beta-haemolytic streptococci (150; 0.06/0.25; 100/100) and viridans group streptococci (150; 0.12/0.25; 99/97). Gemifloxacin appeared equal or superior to trovafloxacin in its overall gram-positive spectrum of activity pending a choice of the susceptible breakpoint concentration. Continued in vitro, pharmacodynamic and clinical investigations of gemifloxacin appear warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis in Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, resistance of Gram-positive cocci to common antibiotics has steadily increased. New antibacterial agents that are active against multidrug-resistant pathogens are urgently needed for the treatment of these pathogens. We conducted an in vitro study on the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and other antibiotics against common clinical isolates of the gram-positive cocci, Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis. METHODS: The agar dilution method described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of bacterial isolates from clinical specimens obtained from patients in a medical center. RESULTS: All Staphylococcus aureus isolates were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin (< or = 2 micrograms/ml). The MIC90s were 1 mg/ml for both methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S aureus. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibited streptococci at a concentration of 1 microgram/ml or less. The MIC90s were 1 microgram/ml for Streptococcus pneumoniae, S pyogenes and viridans streptococci. Ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. H influenzae was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 8 micrograms/ml, with an MIC90 of 4 micrograms/ml. B catarrhalis was inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin at 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml, with an MIC90 of 1 microgram/ml. CONCLUSIONS: We found that quinupristin/dalfopristin showed good in vitro activity against staphylococci, streptococci and B catarrhalis but less in vitro activity against H influenzae.
TI  - A new rapid automated method for the detection of Listeria from environmental swabs and sponges.
AB  - Many food and meat processors test environmental swabs and sponges to confirm the absence of Listeria spp. Spectral pattern changes in a liquid growth medium, resulting from esculin hydrolysis by Listeria in contaminated swabs and sponges, were automatically monitored by the BioSys instrument in a semifluid layer (SFL). The blackening of SFL in modified MOX broth resulted in sharply declining curves, which were easily detected by the instrument. The instrument detected all nine strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested. None of the gram negative organisms (Proteus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter and Yersinia) were detected by the system, nor were most gram positive organisms, including Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus strains, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis, which hydrolyze esculin, produced black colonies on PALCAM and Oxford media and were also detected in the system. A total of 122 sponges and swabs collected at food processing plants were evaluated by this method. Of these, 99 were negative, and 11 were positive. L. innocua was the dominant Listeria species in these environmental samples. Good correlation was obtained between numbers of Listeria and detection times of esculin hydrolysis: 1000 CFU/swab were detected in 10-13 h, whereas 1-10 CFU/swab were detected in less than 22 h. The total assay time was 26 h.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - Activity of macrolides, lincosamines, streptogramins and fluoroquinolones against streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci isolates from the western hemisphere: example of international surveillance (SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program )in the development of new drugs.
AB  - Resistance among commonly isolated Gram-positive cocci have compromised the available therapeutic regimens and require structured monitoring at the local, regional, national, and international levels. Two popular treatment classes of antimicrobials (macrolides-lincosamines-streptogramins [MLS], fluoroquinolones) have been tested against 3, 049 isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci from the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance program. The strains were obtained from clinical cases in hospitals in the United States, Canada, and six nations (10 medical centers )in Latin America. MLS and fluoroquinolone compounds had moderate activity against vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis only (gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin MIC(50), 0.5 microg/ml), and quinupristin/dalfopristin was potent only against E.faecium isolates (MIC(90), 1 microg/ml(-2) microg/ml). When tested against pneumococci, gatifloxacin, trovafloxacin, sparfloxacin, and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC(90), < or = 1 microg/ml)were most active among the newer drugs, but vancomycin and clindamycinn inhibited > or =99.8% and 84.7% to 99.1% of strains, respectively. These results from a global resistance monitoring program should encourage rapid drug development. Based on in vitro sensitivity testing, they indicate a promising role for the treatment of emerging resistant Gram-positive cocci. The clinical role for each new agent will depend on safety profiles, rates of administration, and other issues identified during development in the clinical trials process.
TI  - In vitro activities of LY333328 and comparative agents against nosocomial gram-positive pathogens collected in a 1997 global surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY333328 was evaluated for 1,479 nosocomial gram-positive pathogens isolated in 12 countries during 1997. LY333328 MICs at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited for Enterococcus faecalis (n = 351), Enterococcus faecium (n = 100), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 593), coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (n = 325), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 110) were 1, 1, 2, 2, and 0.015 microg/ml, respectively. LY333328 demonstrated potent activity against isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci, oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - Effect of 8 week intake of probiotic milk products on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture CAUSIDO(R) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. DESIGN: An 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. SUBJECTS: Seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<BMI<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into five groups. INTERVENTION: Four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. Group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus (StLa). Group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (PY). Group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (StLr). Group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus (CAUSIDO(R) culture), GAIO(R) (G). The dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. The fifth group was given two placebo pills (PP) daily. RESULTS: When comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the G-group on low density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol (P=0.29). After adjustment for small changes in body weight, LDL-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; P<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; P<0.05) after 8 weeks in the G-group. This was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (P<0.05). After 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the StLa and G-group compared to StLr. No other differences were found. CONCLUSION: The CAUSIDO(R) culture reduced LDL-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. The effect on LDL-cholesterol confirms previous studies. An immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain the effect on fibrinogen in the G-group.

TI  - [The role of the carbohydrate composition of the glycocalyx in some species of lactobacilli in the manifestation of their adhesive properties].
AB  - Availability of certain monosaccharides in the composition of glycocalyx of lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum--strains 337D and 11/16; Streptococcus thermophilus--strains S1 (nonmucous race) and S5 (mucous race), Enterococcus faecium (K-50) has been investigated with the help of plant lectins with certain carbohydrate specificity labelled by colloid gold. All the microorganisms under investigation were characterized by the presence of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in rather insignificant amounts. Glycocalyx of lactic acid bacteria was also characterized by availability of essential amount of L-fructose and low amount of sialic acid (except for S. thermophilus S5 (mucous race). Presence of alpha-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, alpha-D, beta-D-galactose, alpha-D-glucose, alpha-D-mannose in the composition of the lactic acid bacteria glycocalyx composition evidences for the additional role of these monosaccharides in the process of the microorganism adhesion on the human and animal intestine mucosa. It has been confirmed that availability of certain monosaccharides in the composition of surface glycopolymers of lactic acid bacteria was connected with adhesive properties of cells and their existence conditions.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of mefloquine and a series of related compounds.
AB  - Mefloquine was found to have bactericidal activity against methicillin- and fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis and gentamicin- and vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. The MICs were 16 microg/ml, and the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) were 16 to 32 microg/ml. These concentrations cannot be achieved in serum. Mefloquine was active at a more achievable concentration against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with MICs of 0.2 to 1.5 microg/ml. Mefloquine was not active against gram-negative bacteria and yeasts. In an attempt to find more active derivatives, 400 mefloquine-related compounds were selected from the chemical inventory of The Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. We identified a series of compounds containing a piperidine methanol group attached to pyridine, quinoline, and benzylquinoline ring systems. These had activities similar to that of mefloquine against S. pneumoniae but were far more active against other gram-positive bacteria (MICs for staphylococci, 0.8 to 6.3 microg/ml). They had activities similar to that of amphotericin B against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus neoformans. Combinations of the compounds with gentamicin and vancomycin were additive against staphylococci and pneumococci. The MIC and MBC of gentamicin were decreased by four- to eightfold when this drug was combined with limiting dilutions of the compounds. There was no antagonism with other antimicrobial drugs. The compounds were rapidly bactericidal. They appear to act by disrupting cell membranes. Combinations of the compounds with aminoglycoside antibiotics may have potential for therapeutic use.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility and frequency of occurrence of clinical blood isolates in Europe from the SENTRY antimicrobial surveillance program, 1997 and 1998.
AB  - As part of the European arm of the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program, 25  European university hospitals referred 9613 blood isolates for in vitro testing against >20 antimicrobial agents. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the 5 most frequent isolates and accounted for two-thirds of all referrals, with minor regional variation. Of these, approximately 0.36% of E. coli and 16.7% of K. pneumoniae isolates proved to be potential extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers, and their incidence clearly varied regionally. Quinolone resistance was detected among gram-negative species; in particular, P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Considerable regional variation was observed in the incidences of methicillin resistance in S. aureus and penicillin resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. The incidence of vancomycin resistance in enterococci was relatively low overall and primarily associated with Enterococcus faecium. However, extrapolation of these data to smaller and nonteaching hospitals should be undertaken with caution, since resistance rates may be lower in these facilities.
TI  - A comparison of antimicrobial resistance rates in Gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK from October 1996 to January 1997 and October 1997 to January 1998.
AB  - Rates of resistance for two consecutive years for 28 centres (10 Teaching, nine Associate Teaching and nine District General hospitals) in the UK were compared. Combined rates of resistance for each of the hospital types of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin revealed an increase in the rate of resistance in Teaching hospitals (12.5% year 1, 23.5% year 2), but, for Associate Teaching and District General hospitals rates fell (Associate Teaching 19.1% year 1, 11.9% year 2; District General 16.5% year 1 and 11.3% year 2). Using conventional methodology to determine MICs, no strain was considered to have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Among coagulase-negative staphylococci, increased resistance was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis to rifampicin, for Staphylococcus haemolyticus to clindamycin, for Staphylococcus saprophyticus to penicillin and for Staphylococcus spp. to clindamycin, methicillin and rifampicin. For Streptococcus pneumoniae an upward trend in low-level resistance to penicillin was observed (18 of the 28 centres), however, for high-level resistance the trend was in the opposite direction (only four centres showed an increase). For Enterococcus faecalis there was a trend to a fall in levels of resistance, the only exception being an increase in high-level gentamicin resistance (10.5% year 1, 15.1% year 2, P = 0.0388). For Enterococcus faecium rates of resistance were not significantly different except for increases in resistance to nitrofurantoin and rifampicin.
TI  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is the first parenteral streptogramin antibacterial agent, and is a 30:70 (w/w) ratio of 2 semisynthetic pristinamycin derivatives. The combination has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF), drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci, Clostridium perfringens and Peptostreptococcus spp. The combination also has good activity against selected gram-negative respiratory tract pathogens including Moraxella catarrhalis, Legioniella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Quinupristin/dalfopristin has poor activity against E. faecalis. The combination is bactericidal against staphylococci and streptococci, although constitutive erythromycin resistance can affect its activity. As for many other agents, quinupristin/dalfopristin is generally bacteriostatic against E. faecium. In patients with methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or VREF infections participating in prospective emergency-use trials, quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg every 8 or 12 hours achieved clinical or bacteriological success in > or =64% of patients. Emergence of resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was uncommon (4% of patients) in those with VREF infections. Quinupristin/dalfopristin 7.5 mg/kg 8- or 12-hourly also achieved similar clinical success rates to comparator agents in patients with presumed gram-positive complicated skin and skin structure infections or nosocomial pneumonia (administered in combination with aztreoman) in 3 large multicentre randomised trials. Systemic adverse events associated with quinupristin/dalfopristin include gastrointestinal events (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), rash and pruritus. Myalgias and arthralgias also occur at an overall incidence of 1.3%, although higher rates (2.5 to 31%) have been reported in patients with multiple comorbidities. Venous events are common if the drug is administered via a peripheral line; however, several management options (e.g. use of central venous access, increased infusion volume) may help to minimise their occurrence. Hyperbilirubinaemia has been documented in 3.1% of quinupristin/dalfopristin recipients versus 1.3% of recipients of comparator agents. Quinupristin/dalfopristin inhibits cytochrome P450 3A4 and therefore has the potential to increase the plasma concentrations of substrates of this enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first parenteral streptogramin, offers a unique spectrum of activity against multidrug-resistant gram-positive bacteria. In serious gram-positive infections for which there are other treatment options available, the spectrum of activity and efficacy of quinupristin/ dalfopristin should be weighed against its tolerability and drug interaction profile. However, in VREF or unresponsive MRSA infections, where few proven treatment options exist, quinupristin/dalfopristin should be considered as a treatment of choice for these seriously ill patients.
TI  - Bacteraemia and antibiotic resistance of its pathogens reported in England and Wales between 1990 and 1998: trend analysis.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determination of causes, trends, and antibiotic resistance in reports of bacterial pathogens isolated from blood in England and Wales from 1990 to 1998. DESIGN: Description of bacterial isolates from blood, judged to be clinically significant by microbiology staff, reported to the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. SETTING: Microbiology laboratories in England and Wales. SUBJECTS: Patients yielding clinically significant isolates from blood. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency and Poisson regression analyses for trend of reported causes of bacteraemia and proportions of antibiotic resistant isolates. RESULTS: There was an upward trend in total numbers of reports of bacteraemia. The five most cited organisms accounted for over 60% of reports each year. There was a substantial increase in the proportion of reports of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin and erythromycin, and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium resistance to vancomycin. No increase was seen in resistance of Escherichia coli to gentamicin. CONCLUSIONS: Reports from laboratories provide valuable information on trends and antibiotic resistance in bacteraemia and show a worrying increase in resistance to important antibiotics.

TI  - The effect of a probiotic milk product on plasma cholesterol: a meta-analysis of  short-term intervention studies.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Certain fermented dairy milk products may have beneficial effects on plasma cholesterol levels. However, a number of studies have produced conflicting results as to whether dietary supplementation by a probiotic dairy product containing the bacteria culture Causido(R) reduces plasma cholesterol. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of intervention studies to evaluate the effect of the Causido(R) culture on plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. THE PROBIOTIC MILK PRODUCT: The yoghurt product Gaio(R) is fermented with Causido(R), composed of one strain of Enterococcus faecium (human species) with the proposed cholesterol-lowering effect, and two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. STUDY INCLUSION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Six studies were identified from a literature search and from the yoghurt producer. All studies met the inclusion criteria. Summary data for plasma concentrations of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were extracted from the original publications or by personal request to the authors. Data from 4-8 weeks of treatment duration was used. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: We performed a traditional meta-analysis where mean differences between intervention and control of the pre-post changes in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were calculated, as well as 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: In the six studies included in the meta-analysis, the Gaio(R) interventions produced changes in total cholesterol above those of the control groups ranging from -0.02 to -1.02 mmol/l and in LDL-cholesterol ranging from -0.02 to -1.15 mmol/l. After inclusion of an open-label study, the meta-analysis of the double-blind studies showed that Gaio(R) as compared to the control group changed total cholesterol by -0.22 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.35 to -0.08, P<0.01) and LDL-cholesterol by -0.20 mmol/l (95% CI: -0.33 to -0.06, P<0.005). The outcome was essentially the same if all studies were included. CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis of controlled short-term intervention studies shows that the fermented yoghurt product produced a 4% decrease in total cholesterol and a 5% decrease in LDL-cholesterol when the open-label study is excluded. To demonstrate sustained effects on blood lipids, long-term studies are required. SPONSORSHIP: MD Foods A/S, Denmark.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against Gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 Gram-positive microorganisms. The MIC(90) (mg/L) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus anginosus and Actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for Streptococcus sanguis and Listeria monocytogenes, 2 for Corynebacterium jekeium and Bifidobacterium bivius. Over 50% of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, quinolone-resistant staphylococci, Nocardia steroides and Clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/L moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards Gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against Gram-positive bacilli.
TI  - On the microbiological profile of traditional Portuguese sourdough.
AB  - Traditional manufacture of bread from maize has been noted to play important roles from both economic and social standpoints; however, enforcement of increasingly strict hygiene standards requires thorough knowledge of the adventitious microbiota of the departing dough. To this goal, sourdough as well as maize and rye flours from several geographic locations and in two different periods within the agricultural year were assayed for their microbiota in sequential steps of quantification and identification. More than 400 strains were isolated and taxonomic differentiation between them was via Biomerieux API galleries (375 of which were successfully identified) following preliminary biochemical and morphological screening. The dominant groups were yeasts and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). The most frequently isolated yeasts were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida pelliculosa. The most frequently isolated LAB were (heterofermentative) Leuconostoc spp. and (homofermentative) Lactobacillus spp.; L. brevis, L. curvatus, and L. lactis ssp. lactis were the dominant species for the Lactobacillus genera; Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis for lactococci; Enterococcus casseliflavus, E. durans, and E. faecium for enterococci; and Streptococcus constellantus and S. equinus for streptococci.
TI  - Activity of newer fluoroquinolones in vitro against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Several newer fluoroquinolones, which have been recently introduced or are under  investigation, display substantially greater potency against gram-positive organisms than the older generation agents of this class. Nevertheless, for problem organisms including methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and many Enterococcus faecium, concentrations of newer antimicrobials required to inhibit 90% of organisms in the collections studied remain above those that are projected to be achievable with clinical use. Nevertheless, enhanced potency of several newer quinolones may result in a favourable pharmacodynamic profile leading to improved outcomes against gram-positive infections and possibly to the delayed or diminished emergence of resistance to these agents.
TI  - Characterization of 'faecal streptococci' as indicators of faecal pollution and distribution in the environment.
AB  - The recent revision of the taxonomy of 'faecal streptococci' prompted us to verify the importance of identifying the species of this group of cocci. During a study carried out to assess the hygienic quality of environmental samples from a variety of sources, we isolated 198 strains named faecal streptococci on the basis of conventional international tests (EVA broth multiple tube test) used for Public Health purposes. The predominant species were Enterococcus faecalis (39%) and Ent. faecium (29%), followed by Ent. durans/hirae, Ent. casseliflavus/gallinarum, Ent. raffinosus, with a different prevalence of the species depending on the source. Eighty-four per cent of isolates were true faecal species. Only one isolate was identified as belonging to the Streptococcus genus. The authors stress the opportunity to identify the species. This may help to clarify the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of intestinal enterococci and streptococci in the environment, in drinking and recreational waters and their meaning as indicators of faecal pollution. All isolates were tested for their susceptibility to some antimicrobial agents widely used in medical therapy and the pattern was compared with the pattern of isolates from clinical specimens.

TI  - In vitro activity of levofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin was investigated against 256 clinical strains of four gram-positive genera (Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Listeria). Ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were used as comparators. Uniform susceptibility to levofloxacin was recorded among methicillin-susceptible staphylococci, streptococci other than Streptococcus agalactiae, regardless of their being susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to penicillin (S. pneumoniae) or erythromycin (S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae), in enterococci other than Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, and in Listeria monocytogenes isolates. Moreover, 1 of 22 S. agalactiae isolates and 1 of 19 E. faecium isolates was resistant, and 2 of 19 were intermediate. Resistances to levofloxacin with MIC90s in the resistance range were only observed in methicillin-resistant staphylococci and E. faecalis isolates. In any case, the MICs of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were usually 2-4 times higher than those of levofloxacin. In time-kill assays using three test strains (a methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolate, a penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae isolate, and an E. faecalis isolate), the bactericidal activity of levofloxacin was greater than that of ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin with a wide Gram-positive spectrum.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid) is a new injectable streptogramin antibiotic proposed for the treatment of severe antimicrobial infections, that has been shown to be active against Gram-positive, multi-resistant cocci. We compared the in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin with that of amoxycillin, ampicillin, penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, clindamycin, erythromycin, imipenem, meropenem, oxacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, teicoplanin and vancomycin. The susceptibility of 37 Staphylococcus aureus (14 MS, 23 MR), 26 Staphylococcus epidermidis (16 MS, 10 MR), 20 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Group A Streptococcus pyogenes, 15 Streptococcus agalactiae, 10 Enterococcus faecalis (1 vancomycin-resistant), 15 Enterococcus faecium (9 van A) was evaluated. Quinupristin/dalfopristin was active against all Gram-positive species tested, including met-R S. aureus (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), met-R S. epidermidis (MIC < or = 2 mg/l), S. pneumoniae (MIC < or = 1 mg/l), ery-R and ery-S streptococci (MIC < or = 1 mg/l). The strains of E. faecalis were generally less susceptible. Time-kill studies confirmed that quinupristin/dalfopristin at 4 x MIC concentration showed a complete bactericidal effect (3 log reduction) in about 4 6 h against all strains tested. A post-antibiotic effect (PAE) of 3.9-5.2 h was observed at 4 x MIC concentration of quinupristin/dalfopristin against staphylococci. A prolonged PAE was obtained for S. pneumoniae (8 h), S. pyogenes (9 h) and S. agalactiae (7 h), while the shortest PAE was seen for E. faecalis and E. faecium (about 4 h).
TI  - Interspecies recombination between enterococci: genetic and phenotypic diversity  of vancomycin-resistant transconjugants.
AB  - Handwerger and colleagues demonstrated that a particular clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium, designated GUC, and here redesignated as GUCR, can conjugatively transfer vancomycin resistance. The vancomycin resistance is encoded by a chromosomally born linked set of genes in the donor, designated the vanA cluster, to the chromosome of an E. faecalis recipient, JH2-2. Here it is reported that an earlier isolate of E. faecium from the same patient who later harbored the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium GUCR lacks the vanA gene cluster but is otherwise similar (by SmaI chromosomal fingerprint and metabolic fingerprinting) to the vancomycin-resistant GUCR. Therefore, "GUCS" is a strong suspect as the base strain for the clinical acquisition of the vanA cluster present in GUCR. Thirteen laboratory-generated vanA transconjugants derived from conjugation between GUCR and JH2-2 were subjected to further analysis, allowing a comparison between transfer in the laboratory and transfer that occurred in the clinical setting. Surprisingly, each JH2-2 transconjugant had a unique constellation of abilities to oxidize various members of a panel of potential carbon sources. This pattern was stable for each transconjugant, and it was not changed by growing the strains with or without vancomycin. Transconjugants had pulsed-field gel electrophoretic (PFGE) patterns largely consistent with that of JH2-2, the recipient in conjugation experiments. However, PFGE analysis showed that a large but variable amount of DNA, between 145 kb and 277 kb, was transferred into different transconjugants. The mechanism appears to be conjugative transposition in which new DNA is added to the pre-existing genome rather than substituting for a segment in the recipient. Mapping and hybridization studies of several transconjugants showed that each received similar, but not exactly the same, DNA fragment of at least 30 kb from the donor. Sequencing of 16S ribosomal genes was used to confirm that the recipient and donor strains used in transconjugation experiments were different species. Sequence analysis was also used to consider the possibility that rRNA operons might be mobilized in conjugation, but no evidence for the transfer of rDNA operons was found. An apparent insertion sequence in E. faecium almost identical to IS 1485 and 57% sequence identity to IS 199 of Streptococcus mutans was found in the region of DNA transferred. The results imply new consequences of conjugative transfer and interspecies recombination.
TI  - Cloning of insertion sequence IS1485 from Enterococcus species.
AB  - We have cloned and identified an insertion sequence, IS1485, that was present in  several members of the genus Enterococcus. IS1485 exists in varying copy numbers with at least 12 copies in E. durans (ATCC 11576), 3 copies in E. faecium (ATCC 19434), and one copy each in E. faecalis (ATCC 19433) and E. avium (ATCC 14024). It was also detected in clinical strains of E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, and E. saccharolyticus. IS1485 is 1366 bp in length, it has imperfect terminal inverted repeats with 25 of the terminal 39 residues matched, and it contains three open reading frames exceeding 50 codons, designated orfA, orfB, and orfC. The largest, orfB, was located 36 bp downstream and in the -1 reading frame relative to orfA; orfC is oriented in the opposite direction and overlaps orfA. The genetic organization of IS1485 resembles that of members of the IS3 family of transposable elements. Sequence homology exists with several members of the IS3 family especially with IS199 from Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Prevalence of resistance to MLS antibiotics in 20 European university hospitals participating in the European SENTRY surveillance programme. Sentry Participants Group.
AB  - Macrolide, lincosamide and streptogramin (MLS) antibiotics are chemically distinct inhibitors of bacterial protein synthesis. Resistance to MLS antibiotics may be constitutive or inducible. The purpose of this study is to update our understanding of the prevalence of different forms of MLS resistance in Europe. The analysis of 3653 clinical pneumococcal, staphylococcal and enterococcal isolates exhibited an average percentage of 21.3% and 6.2% intermediate and high-level penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 21.8% methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 11% vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Geographical differences in erythromycin and clindamycin resistance in isolates of S. pneumoniae and S. aureus strongly reflect geographical variations in susceptibility to penicillin and methicillin, respectively. A very narrow range of MICs was obtained with quinupristin/dalfopristin, with no S. pneumoniae, S. aureus and E. faecium isolate having an MIC of > 4 mg/L, indicating a possible role of quinupristin/dalfopristin in the treatment of infections by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of Enterococcus faecium, PRSP and MRSA to RP59500 and their correlations with those to other drugs].
AB  - Investigations on emergence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) which has recently been attracting attention, especially in the Western countries, have been conducted in Japan. A total of 1,239 isolates of E. faecium were collected from 19 institutions during the period of April 1995 and June 1996, in the purpose of evaluating susceptibilities to variety of antimicrobial agents, including RP59500 and vancomycin (VCM), and detecting vancomycin-resistant genes (van genes). Susceptibilities of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were also studied. As a result, 2 isolates of E. faecium were found to be moderately resistant to VCM showing MIC of 8 micrograms/ml though the final identification in species level and the detection of van genes by PCR method have not been completed. On the other hand there detected no MRSA nor PRSP showing moderately resistant or resistant to VCM. It was concluded that RP59500 and VCM possessed favorable activity against clinically isolated E. faecium, PRSP and MRSA. Among other species of enterococci, moderately resistant strains to VCM showing MIC of 8 micrograms/ml were detected; 10 isolates of E. gallinarum, 4 of E. casseliflavus and 2 of E. flavescens. In those isolates, vanC1 and vanC2 were detected by PCR, and vanB was also detected in a isolates of E. gallinarum simultaneously.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens isolated in the UK between October 1996 and January 1997.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in gram-positive pathogens from 30 centres in the UK (ten Teaching, ten Associate Teaching and ten District General Hospitals) was studied over a 4 month period between October 1996 and January 1997. High-level resistance (HLR) and low-level resistance (LLR) to penicillin amongst pneumococci was 3.3% and 3.4%, respectively. However, considerable variation in resistance rates was observed depending on geographical location (LLR range 0-15.4% and HLR range 0-30.8%). Considerable variation in resistance rates was also observed for Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, with rates ranging from 0% to 56.7% depending on locality. Using conventional MIC methodology, none of the isolates of S. aureus was considered as having reduced sensitivity to vancomycin. However, eight isolates grew on Brain Heart Infusion Agar containing vancomycin (4 mg/L) after prolonged incubation and are therefore worthy of further investigation by electron microscopy. With Enterococcus faecalis, resistance rates were similar between the three types of hospital and only four isolates were considered resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics (one vanA and three vanB phenotype).
TI  - Susceptibility testing of linezolid by two standard methods.
AB  - To determine to what extent methodological differences affect susceptibility testing parameters for linezolid, MICs and disk inhibition zones were compared using the methods described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy for 198 strains of gram-positive cocci. Zones were 4-5 mm larger by the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method, but MICs did not differ, except for pneumococci, which were more sensitive when the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy method was used. This is because incubation in CO2 depresses the activity of linezolid against this species only. Breakpoints for linezolid may need adjusting when testing is by other than National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards methods.
TI  - [In vitro activities of 23 antimicrobial agents against 4,993 gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains isolated from multicenter of Japan during 1994--in vitro susceptibility surveillance.Levofloxacin-Surveillance Group].
AB  - In a surveillance study conducted during 1994 at 24 medical institutes from different geographical areas of Japan, the susceptibility of clinical isolates to twenty three comparative agents, such as ofloxacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, ampicillin, clavulanic acid/amoxicillin, oxacillin, piperacillin, cefaclor, cefotiam, cefdinir, cefclidin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, imipenem, aztreonam, vancomycin, minocycline, chloramphenicol, clarithromycin, sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, amikacin, and gentamicin, were tested by the standard broth micro-dilution method. A total of 4,993 isolates tested in this study included Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), coagllase negative streptococci (CNS), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterobactericeae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients with urinary tract infections or respiratory tract infections, and Haemophilus influenzae. For MSSA, S. pneumoniae, Enterobacteriaceae, and H. influenzae, more than 70% of the isolates was susceptible to fluoloquinolones. However, resistance occurred in more than 50% of MRSA and P. aeruginosa isolated from UTI. Fluoroquinolones were found to be effective against high level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, the third generation cephem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae.
TI  - Recent developments in streptogramin research.
AB  - The streptogramins are a class of antibiotics remarkable for their antibacterial  activity and their unique mechanism of action. These antibiotics are produced naturally, but the therapeutic use of the natural compounds is limited because they do not dissolve in water. New semisynthetic derivatives, in particular the injectable streptogramin quinupristin/dalfopristin, offer promise for treating the rising number of infections that are caused by multiply resistant bacteria. The streptogramins consist of two structurally unrelated compounds, group A and group B. The group A compounds are polyunsaturated macrolactones: the group B compounds are cyclic hexadepsipeptides. Modifications of the group B components have been mainly performed on the 3-hydroxypicolinoyl, the 4-dimethylaminophenylalanine and the 4-oxo pipecolinic residues. Semi-synthesis on this third residue led to the water-soluble derivative quinupristin. Water-soluble group A derivatives were obtained by Michael addition of aminothiols to the dehydroproline ring of pristinamycin IIA. Followed by oxidation of the intermediate sulfide into the sulfone derivatives (i.e., dalfopristin). Water-soluble derivatives (both group A and group B) can now be obtained at the industrial scale. Modified group B compounds are now also being produced by mutasynthesis, via disruption of the papA gene. Mutasynthesis has proved particularly useful for producing PIB, the group B component of the oral streptogramin RPR 106972. The streptogramins inhibit bacterial growth by disrupting the translation of mRNA into protein. Both the group A and group B compounds bind to the peptidyltransferase domain of the bacterial ribosome. The group A compounds interfere with the elongation of the polypeptide chain by preventing the binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosome and the formation of peptide bonds, while the B compounds stimulate the dissociation of the peptidyl-tRNA and may also interfere with the release of the completed polypeptide by blocking its access to the channel through which it normally leaves the ribosome. The synergy between the group A and group B compounds appears to result from an enhanced affinity of the group B compounds for the ribosome. Apparently, the group A compound induces a conformational change such that B compound binds with greater affinity. The natural streptogramins are produced as mixtures of the group A and B compounds, the combination of which is a more potent antibacterial agent than either type of compound alone. Whereas the type A or type B compound alone has, in vitro and in animal models of infection, a moderate bacteriostatic activity, the combination of the two has strong bacteriostatic activity and often bactericidal activity. Minimal inhibitory concentrations of quinupristin/dalfopristin range from 0.20 to 1 mg/l for Streptococcus pneumonae, from 0.25 to 2 mg/l for Staphylococcus aureus and from 0.50 to 4 for Enterococcus faecium, the principal target organisms of this drug. Quinupristin/dalfopristin also has activity against mycoplasmas, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenz, Legionella spp. and Moraxella catarrhalis. Bacteria develop resistance to the streptogramms by ribosomal modification, by producing inactivating enzymes, or by causing an efflux of the antibiotic. Dimethylation of an adenine residue in rRNA, a reaction that is catalyzed by a methylase encoded by the erm gene class, affects the binding of group B compounds (as well as the macrolides and lincosamides; hence, MLSB resistance), but group A and B compounds usually maintain their synergy and their bactericidal effect against MLSB-resistant strains. erm genes are widespread both geographically and throughout numerous bacterial genera. Several types of enzymes (acetyltransferases, hydrolases) have been identified that inactivate the group A or the group B compounds. Genes involved in streptogramin efflux have so far been found only in staphylococci, particularly in coagulase-negative species
TI  - In vitro activities of two ketolides, HMR 3647 and HMR 3004, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two new ketolides, HMR 3647 and HMR 3004, were tested  by the agar dilution method against 280 strains of gram-positive bacteria with different antibiotic susceptibility profiles, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus spp. (group A streptococci, group B streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and alpha-hemolytic streptococci). Seventeen erythromycin-susceptible (EMs), methicillin-susceptible S. aureus strains were found to have HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 MICs 4- to 16-fold lower than those of erythromycin (MIC at which 50% of isolates were inhibited [MIC50] [HMR 3647 and HMR 3004], 0.03 microgram/ml; range, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml; MIC50 [erythromycin], 0.25 microgram/ml; range, 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml). All methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains tested were resistant to erythromycin and had HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 MICs of > 64 micrograms/ml. The ketolides were slightly more active against E. faecalis than against E. faecium, and MICs for individual strains varied with erythromycin susceptibility. The MIC50s of HMR 3647 and HMR 3004 against Ems enterococci (MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and those enterococcal isolates with erythromycin MICs of 1 to 16 micrograms/ml were 0.015 microgram/ml. E. faecalis strains that had erythromycin MICs of 128 to > 512 micrograms/ml showed HMR 3647 MICs in the range of 0.03 to 16 micrograms/ml and HMR 3004 MICs in the range of 0.03 to 64 micrograms/ml. In the group of E. faecium strains for which MICs of erythromycin were > or = 512 micrograms/ml, MICs of both ketolides were in the range of 1 to 64 micrograms/ml, with almost all isolates showing ketolide MICs of < or = 16 micrograms/ml. The ketolides were also more active than erythromycin against group A streptococci, group B streptococci, S. pneumoniae, rhodococci, leuconostocs, pediococci, lactobacilli, and diphtheroids. Time-kill studies showed bactericidal activity against one strain of S. aureus among the four strains tested. The increased activity of ketolides against gram-positive bacteria suggests that further study of these agents for possible efficacy against infections caused by these bacteria is warranted.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial properties of pexiganan, an analog of magainin.
AB  - Pexiganan, a 22-amino-acid antimicrobial peptide, is an analog of the magainin peptides isolated from the skin of the African clawed frog. Pexiganan exhibited in vitro broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when it was tested against 3,109 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The pexiganan MIC at which 90% of isolates are inhibited (MIC90) was 32 micrograms/ml or less for Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecium, Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., certain species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium spp. Comparison of the MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of pexiganan for 143 isolates representing 32 species demonstrated that for 92% of the isolates tested, MBCs were the same or within 1 twofold difference of the MICs, consistent with a bactericidal mechanism of action. Killing curve analysis showed that pexiganan killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly, with 10(6) organisms/ml eliminated within 20 min of treatment with 16 micrograms of pexiganan per ml. No evidence of cross-resistance to a number of other antibiotic classes was observed, as determined by the equivalence of the MIC50s and the MIC90s of pexiganan for strains resistant to oxacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clindamicin versus those for strains susceptible to these antimicrobial agents. Attempts to generate resistance in several bacterial species through repeated passage with subinhibitory concentrations of pexiganan were unsuccessful. In conclusion, pexiganan exhibits properties in vitro which make it an attractive candidate for development as a topical antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Epidemiologic trends in nosocomial and community-acquired infections due to antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria: the role of streptogramins and other newer compounds.
AB  - The Gram-positive cocci have clearly re-emerged as important pathogens world-wide in the past two decades. Staphylococci, including the coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus, and the enterococci account for approximately one-third of all blood stream infections and as much as 50% of nosocomial blood stream infections. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae is often considered a community-acquired pathogen, it is also an important cause of nosocomial infection. The hallmark of these Gram-positive pathogens is increasing resistance to available antimicrobial agents. Of particular note is resistance to glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin), aminoglycosides (high-level), and penicillins among the enterococci (especially E. faecium), resistance to penicillinase-resistant penicillins (oxacillin and methicillin) and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin) among staphylococci, and resistance to penicillin, other beta-lactams and macrolides among the pneumococci. The recent detection of decreased susceptibility to vancomycin among S. aureus is also quite ominous. In many instances the ability of the clinical laboratory to accurately characterize these resistant isolates is suboptimal, further compounding the problem. Increased understanding of resistance mechanisms and correlations of resistance genes with the phenotypic expression of resistance has allowed for modifications and improvements of reference susceptibility tests and interpretive breakpoints. New compounds for effective therapy of infection with multi-resistant Gram-positive species are clearly needed. To this end, the streptogramin combination, quinupristin/dalfopristin, has demonstrated significant activity against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant streptococci, and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium. Other candidate drugs including Gram-positive active fluoroquinolones (clinafloxacin, grepafloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and trovafloxacin) and novel compounds such as the everninomicin derivatives (SCH27899), ketolides, and oxazolidinones (linezolid) have been shown to be active against these organisms and are under rapid clinical development.
TI  - Evaluation of the oxolinic acid--esculin--azide medium for the isolation and enumeration of faecal streptococci in a routine monitoring programme for bathing waters.
AB  - m-Enterococcus agar (m-Ent) has been generally considered the reference medium for faecal streptococci in bathing waters. However, it shows several shortcomings, and therefore it is important to test newly developed media that can guarantee more precise results. In this sense, the recently described oxolinic acid--esculin--azide agar medium (OAA) and m-enterococcus agar (m-Ent) were comparatively evaluated for the detection of faecal streptococci from seawater and fresh water. The OAA medium showed a significantly higher relative recovery percentage and specificity for both types of water than m-Ent. A similar spectrum of species was recorded from both media, Enterococcus faecium being predominant in fresh water and Enterococcus faecalis, in seawater. The superior performance of the OAA medium in both types of bathing waters, added to the fact that it does not require the use of complementary confirmative tests, makes this medium an excellent candidate to be employed for monitoring programmes.
TI  - A bacteriocin-mediated antagonism by Enterococcus faecium BC25 against ruminal Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - A bacteriocin-like activity produced by Enterococcus faecium BC25, isolated from  the the rumen of a cow, was partially purified and characterized. The active substance was prepared by ammonium sulfate and chloroform/methanol precipitation of culture supernatant. The bacteriocin was a protein of molecular mass 17.5 kDa. Activity was inactivated by trypsin and proteinase K. The bacteriocin BC25 inhibited growth of amylolytic ruminal strains of Streptococcus bovis, including S. bovis AO 24/85. Results showed that bacteriocine substance BC25 has a bacteriostatic effect when present in concentrations exceeding 125 AU/ml. Agar overlays and batch culture growth experiments proved that E. faecium BC25 was producing bacteriocin that inhibited the growth of S. bovis.
TI  - Bacterial resistance to ultrasonic waves under pressure at nonlethal (manosonication) and lethal (manothermosonication) temperatures.
AB  - The decimal reduction times of Streptococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enteritidis, and Aeromonas hydrophila corresponding to heat treatment at 62 degrees C were 7.1, 0.34, 0.024, and 0.0096 min, and those corresponding to manosonication treatment (40 degrees C, 200 kPa, 117 microm) were 4.0, 1.5, 0.86, and 0.90 min, respectively. The manosonication decimal reduction times of the four species investigated decreased sixfold when the amplitude was increased from 62 to 150 microm and fivefold when the relative pressure was raised from 0 to 400 kPa. In L. monocytogenes, S. enteritidis, and A. hydrophila, the lethal effect of manothermosonication was the result of the addition of the lethal effects of heat and manosonication, whereas in S. faecium it was a synergistic effect.
TI  - Infection-derived Enterococcus faecalis strains are enriched in esp, a gene encoding a novel surface protein.
AB  - We report the identification of a new cell wall-associated protein of Enterococcus faecalis. Studies on the distribution of the gene encoding this novel surface protein, Esp, reveal a significant (P < 0.001) enrichment in infection-derived E. faecalis isolates. Interestingly, the esp gene was not identified in any of 34 clinical E. faecium isolates or in 4 other less pathogenic enterococcal species tested. Analysis of the structural gene among various E. faecalis isolates reveals the existence of alternate forms of expression of the Esp protein. The deduced primary structure of the Esp protein from strain MMH594, inferred to be 1,873 amino acids (aa) with a predicted mass of approximately 202 kDa, reveals a core region consisting of repeat units that make up 50% of the protein. Esp bears global organizational similarity to the Rib and C alpha proteins of group B streptococci. Identity among Esp, Rib, and C alpha proteins is strikingly localized to a stretch of 13 aa within repeats of similar length. The high degree of conservation of this 13-residue sequence suggests that it plays an important role in the natural selection for this trait among infection-derived E. faecalis and group B streptococcal isolates.
TI  - European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey of gram-positive bacteria for 1995. European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey Study Group.
AB  - In the European Glycopeptide Susceptibility Survey 7078 Gram-positive isolates collected in 1995 from 70 centers in 9 countries of Western Europe were examined, using a standardized, quantitative susceptibility testing method. Of the 7078 isolates, 6824 (96.4%) were tested by the national coordinating centers. Teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.5 microgram/mL) was generally twice as active as vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL) against Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2852). All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin (MIC < or = 4 micrograms/mL) and all but four to teicoplanin (MIC < or = 8 micrograms/mL); these four isolates were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL). With coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 1444), the distribution of MIC of teicoplanin was wider than for vancomycin. Two and two-tenths percent of coagulase-negative staphylococci excluding Staphylococcus haemolyticus required 16 micrograms/mL teicoplanin for inhibition (intermediate) and 0.4% > or = 32 micrograms/mL (resistant). Among isolates of S. haemolyticus, 4.4% were of intermediate susceptibility (MIC 16 micrograms/mL) and 3.3% were resistant (MIC > or = 32 micrograms/mL) to teicoplanin. However, this species represented only 6.3% of the isolates of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. Generally, teicoplanin (mode MIC < or = 0.12 microgram/mL) was four to eight times more active than vancomycin (mode MIC < or = 0.5 microgram/mL) against the 770 streptococcal isolates. Glycopeptide-susceptible Enterococcus spp. (n = 1695) were generally four times more susceptible to teicoplanin (mode MIC 0.25 microgram/mL) than to vancomycin (mode MIC 1 microgram/mL). Combined vancomycin and teicoplanin (VanA phenotype) resistance was observed more frequently (9.3%) in isolates of Enterococcus faecium than in Enterococcus faecalis (0.8%). Four isolates of unspeciated enterococci (1.4%) also expressed this resistance phenotype. Four isolates of E. faecium and four of E. faecalis expressed the VanB-type (low-level, vancomycin only) resistance. Spain was the only country not to submit resistant E. faecium strains while resistant E. faecalis isolates came only from Spain and Italy.
TI  - In vivo testing of an Enterococcus faecalis efaA mutant and use of efaA homologs  for species identification.
AB  - Disruption of the previously described efaA (from Enterococcus faecalis antigen A) gene was generated in E. faecalis strain OG1RF and loss of an 37-kDa immunoreactive band from the mutant was demonstrated in Western blots. In a mouse peritonitis model, mice infected with the efaAfs (fs=from Enterococcus faecalis) mutant showed more prolonged survival than mice infected with the parent strain OG1RF. These results suggest that efaAfs encodes a function important for infection of mice by enterococci. An efaA-like gene was also identified in E. faecium DNA libraries and its deduced amino acid sequence showed 73% similarity to EfaA of E. faecalis and 42-63% similarities to a group of streptococcal virulence and adhesion associated proteins that are components of ATP-binding cassette transport systems. Intragenic probes representing efaAfs, recAfs, efaAfm (fm=from E. faecium) and gyrAfm were tested for their ability to identify E. faecalis and E. faecium using colony lysates of 133 enterococci and one Streptococcus sp. Probes of E. faecium and E. faecalis origin hybridized to all isolates of E. faecium and E. faecalis, respectively, regardless of their clinical source but not to any of 29 other enterococci. These results suggest that the use of gene probes may prove helpful in identification of isolates of E. faecium and E. faecalis.
TI  - Evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic and Salmonella typhimurium-Specific antibodies on the colonization of Salmonella typhimurium in broilers.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes food-borne illness in humans. Reduction of S. typhimurium colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic and S. typhimurium-specific antibodies on the colonization of S. typhimurium in broilers and on body weights. Broiler chicks were spray-vaccinated at the hatchery with the commercial product. Avian Pac Plus, which contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, ad S. typhimurium-specific antibodies. At placement, these chicks were administered Avian Pac plus in the water. Six hours postplacement, chicks were orally challenged with 1.8 x 10 (7) CFU of S. typhimurium. Chicks were administered Avian Pac Plus for two additional days postchallenge. Chicks were evaluated for S. typhimurium colonization and shedding every 3 to 4 days for the first 2 weeks and every 7 days for 6 weeks. The mean cecal and colonic concentration of S. typhimurium from the Avian Pac Plus-treated group was significantly lower at day 31 (P = 0.0001), day 38 (P = 0.0005), and day 43 (P = 0.0001) than the nontreated control group. These results indicated that a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, and S typhimurium-specific antibodies have a beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of S. typhimurium in market-aged broilers.
TI  - Detection of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia using 16S rRNA gene amplification by polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Episodes of fever and neutropenia are common complications of treatment for cancer. The use of prophylactic and early empirical antibiotics has reduced mortality but decreases the sensitivity of diagnostic tests based on culture. The aim of this study was to determine the potential of a broad diagnostic approach (eubacterial) based on 16S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing to augment cultural methods of diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients with fever and neutropenia in a regional paediatric oncology centre. One hundred eleven patient-episodes of fever and neutropenia were evaluated during the study period, 17 of which were associated with positive blood cultures, as follows: Staphylococcus epidermidis (n = 6 episodes), Enterococcus faecium (n = 2), Streptococcus sanguis (n = 3), Streptococcus mitis (n = 3), Staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), Micrococcus spp. (n = 1), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 1). Eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected bacterial DNA in nine of 11 blood culture-positive episodes for which a sample was available for PCR; the species identified by sequence analysis were identical to those derived from the conventional identification of the cultured isolates. Bacterial DNA was detected in 20 episodes (21 bacterial sequences) associated with negative blood cultures, 18 of which occurred in patients who were receiving antibiotics at the time of sample collection. The species presumptively identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing were as follows: Pseudomonas spp. (n = 6 episodes), Acinetobacter spp. (n =5 ); Escherichia spp. (n = 3); Moraxella spp. (n = 3); Staphylococcus spp. (n = 2); Neisseria spp. (n = 1); and Bacillus spp. (n = 1). The results of this study suggest that molecular techniques can augment cultural methods in the diagnosis of bacteraemia in patients who have been treated with antibiotics.
TI  - Evaluation of in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin and comparator antimicrobial agents against worldwide clinical trial and other laboratory isolates.
AB  - This report summarizes the activities of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) and appropriate comparator antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, rifampin, teicoplanin, and vancomycin, against selected gram-positive pathogens, including Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pyogenes. The study pathogens were obtained from 2 sources: (1) clinical isolates taken from patients participating in Q/D worldwide Phase III comparative and noncomparative (emergency-use program) clinical trials; and (2) other isolates collected from the laboratories of 45 geographically distinct medical centers around the world. Q/D was highly active, with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) < or = 1.0 microg/mL against most isolates, including those known to be resistant to methicillin, vancomycin, or erythromycin. Q/D was active (MICs < or = 1 microg/mL) against 95% of the vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, for example, whereas ciprofloxacin was active against 6%. Q/D was equally active against methicillin-susceptible or -resistant S. aureus strains (MIC90=1 microg/mL), as was vancomycin (MIC90=2 microg/mL), whereas ciprofloxacin was much less active against methicillin-resistant strains than against methicillin-susceptible strains (MIC90=32 vs 1 microg/mL). Given its spectrum of activity, Q/D may provide a viable option for the treatment of severe respiratory and skin and skin-structure infections caused by gram-positive bacteria, especially when strains with known or suspected resistance to other commonly used antibiotics are present.
TI  - Favorable prognosis of purulent meningitis in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
AB  - We prospectively reviewed all cases of purulent meningitis among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1-infected patients > 14 years old that occurred at the Hospital General Vall d'Hebron (Barcelona) during the period 1 January 1985 through 31 March 1997. There were 12 episodes of purulent meningitis in nine of 2,150 HIV-1-infected patients. The annual rate of purulent meningitis was 0.465 cases per 1,000 patients, a rate that is 150 times higher than that for the general population. During 10 episodes, CD4+ lymphocyte counts were < 200/mm3. The etiologic organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae in nine episodes (seven episodes occurred in four splenectomized patients), and Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Enterococcus faecium each caused one episode. Clinical features and cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities were similar to those observed among patients without HIV-1 infection. All patients had bacteremia. The overall mortality was 8.3%. We conclude that purulent meningitis, particularly pneumococcal meningitis, is more frequent among HIV-1-infected patients than in the general population. The prognosis for HIV-1-infected patients is better than for HIV-1-negative patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500, Synercid) tested against over 28,000 recent clinical isolates from 200 medical centers in the United States and Canada.
AB  - A total of 200 medical center laboratories in the USA and Canada contributed results of testing quinupristin-dalfopristin, a streptogramin combination (formerly RP 59500 or Synercid), against 28,029 Gram-positive cocci. Standardized tests [disk diffusion, broth microdilution, Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden)] were utilized and validated by concurrent quality control tests. Remarkable agreement was obtained between test method results for characterizing the collection by the important emerging resistances: 1) oxacillin resistance among Staphylococcus aureus (41.0 to 43.7%); 2) vancomycin resistance among Enterococcus faecium (50.0 to 52.0%); and 3) the penicillin nonsusceptible rate for pneumococci (31.1% overall, with 10.6% at MICs of > or = 2 micrograms/mL). The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 for oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant S. aureus was 0.5 microgram/mL and 1 microgram/mL, respectively. The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 for vancomycin-resistant E. faecium was 1 microgram/mL, and only 0.2% of isolates were resistant. Other Enterococcus species were generally not susceptible to the streptogramin combination but were usually inhibited by ampicillin (86 to 97% susceptible; MIC50, 1.0 microgram/mL) or vancomycin (86 to 95%; MIC50, 1.0 microgram/mL). Among all tested enterococci, the rate of vancomycin resistance was 16.2%. The quinupristin-dalfopristin MIC90 (0.75 microgram/mL) for 4,626 tested Streptococcus pneumoniae strains was not influenced by the penicillin or macrolide susceptibility patterns. When five regions in the USA and Canada were analyzed for significant streptogramin and other antimicrobial spectrum differences, only the Farwest region had lower numbers of streptogramin-susceptible E. faecium. Canadian strains were generally more susceptible to all drugs except chloramphenicol and doxycycline when tested against E. faecalis (73% and 89% susceptible, respectively). The U.S. Southeast region had S. pneumoniae strains less susceptible to macrolides (73%) but had more susceptibility among E. faecium isolates tested against vancomycin and ampicillin. The Northeast region of the USA had the greatest rate of vancomycin resistance among enterococci. Strains retested by the monitor because of quinupristin-dalfopristin resistance (MICs, > or = 4 micrograms/mL) were generally not confirmed (2.2% validation), and only 0.2% of E. faecium isolates were identified as truly resistant. The most common errors were: 1) species misidentification (28.0%); 2) incorrect susceptibility results (65.6%); and 3) mixed cultures (4.3%) tested by participants. Overall, quinupristin-dalfopristin was consistently active (> or = 90% susceptible) against major Gram-positive pathogens in North America, regardless of resistance patterns to other drug classes and geographic location of their isolation.
TI  - Resistant penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Low-affinity penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which participate in the beta-lactam resistance of several pathogenic bacteria, have different origins. Natural transformation and recombination events with DNA acquired from neighbouring intrinsically resistant organisms are responsible for the appearance of mosaic genes encoding two or three low-affinity PBPs in highly resistant strains of transformable microorganisms such as Neisseria and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal strains possess the mecA determinant gene, which probably evolved within the Staphylococcus genus from a closely related and physiologically functional gene that was modified by point mutations. The expression of mecA is either inducible or constitutive. A stable high-level resistant phenotype requires the synthesis of a normally constituted peptidoglycan. Enterococci have a natural low susceptibility to beta-lactams related to the presence of an intrinsic low-affinity PBP. Highly resistant enterococcal strains overexpress this PBP and/or reduce its affinity.

AB  
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms with quinolones and beta-lactam antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The in vitro activity of trovafloxacin against 721 Gram-negative and 498 Gram-positive organisms was determined by the standard microdilution broth method using commercially prepared frozen microtiter plates. The activity of trovafloxacin was compared to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ampicillin/sulbactam (1:1), piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and imipenem. Trovafloxacin had equal or greater activity compared with the other agents tested against Citrobacter diversus, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Serratia marcescens, staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus viridans, group G streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, and E. faecium. The reliability of the commercially prepared plates for testing the in vitro activity of the quinolones was evaluated by comparing identical isolates also tested by broth microdilution using laboratory prepared plates. The commercially prepared plates generally correlated, within one- to twofold dilutions, with the laboratory prepared plates. There was, however, a large discrepancy obtained when testing Enterobacter agglomerans and E. cloacae, where the commercially prepared plates yielded a significantly higher MIC90 value.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of nisin against multidrug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens.
AB  - The rapid spread of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens necessitates the search for alternative antibacterial agents. We examined the efficacy of the antibiotic nisin against 56 multidrug-resistant isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 33 Staphylococcus aureus and 29 vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis isolates. The test strains represented a large variety of clonal types (as determined by a combination of DNA fingerprints) isolated from a variety of geographic sources, and included some of the major internationally-spread multiresistant epidemic clones of S. pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), MRSA strains resistant to over 16 generically distinct antibacterial agents, and enterococcal strains resistant to all currently available chemotherapeutic agents including glycopeptides. In the overwhelming majority of cases, treatment of growing cultures with nisin at 1 mg/L (S. pneumoniae) or 10-20 mg/L (in MRSA and enterococci) caused extensive (10(3)- to 10(4)-fold) loss of viable titre accompanied by various degrees of loss in the optical density of the cultures, which was most extensive in pneumococci (>90%) and least extensive (40-50%) in enterococci. Nevertheless, extensive variation in rates of nisin-induced autolysis was observed in each bacterial species. Serial exposure of a penicillin-susceptible strain of S. pneumoniae to nisin (1 mg/L) in liquid culture resulted in the rapid appearance of stable nisin-resistant mutants in which the MIC increased from 0.4 to 6.4 mg/L and the resistance trait was transferable by genetic transformation.
TI  - Inhibition effect of enterocin CCM 4231 in the rumen fluid environment.
AB  - Enterocin CCM 4231 is a bacteriocin with a broad antimicrobial spectrum produced  by the ruminal strain Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231. Its inhibitory effect towards enterococci, Ent. faecium EF 26/42, staphylococci, Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Escherichia coli, as well as towards Listeria monocytogenes OHIO strain, in the rumen fluid environment was studied during culture at 37 and 30 degrees C for 24 h and 20 days. Enterocin CCM 4231 was added to the samples at a concentration of 3200 AU ml-1. The best inhibitory effect was noted against enterococci at both cultivation temperatures. A decrease in total cell count from 10(8) cfu ml-1/or 10(4) cfu ml-1 and from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 was detected. Addition of enterocin to the rumen fluid also inhibited staphylococci (from 10(5) cfu ml-1 to 10(4) cfu ml-1 and/or 10(3) cfu ml-1). Gram-negative E. coli cells were inhibited at both cultivation temperatures (decrease from 10(6) cfu ml-1 to 10(1) cfu ml-1 at 37 degrees C, and from 10(7) cfu ml-1 to 10(5) cfu ml-1 at 30 degrees C). Enterococcus faecium EF 26/42 and Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85, the strains growing in the rumen fluid, were the most sensitive to the addition of enterocin during the first 24 h of fermentation (decrease from 10(10) cfu ml-1 and 10(8) cfu ml-1 to 10(6) cfu ml-1 and 10(4) cfu ml-1). An antilisterial effect of the bacteriocin was also confirmed. Further application of bacteriocin in ruminal ecology was indicated.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY333328 against vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - We report the activity of LY333328 against 35 clinical isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including organisms carrying the vanA, vanB, vanC-1, and vanC-2/3 genes, as determined by PCR), 33 clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and 29 clinical isolates of high-level penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae. All isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were inhibited by 2 micrograms/mL LY333328, and 8 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all isolates tested. All isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were inhibited by 1 microgram/mL LY333328, and 4 micrograms/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates tested. All isolates of penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were inhibited by < 0.125 microgram/mL LY333328, and 0.25 microgram/mL LY333328 was bactericidal against all S. pneumoniae isolates tested. LY333328 is a promising new glycopeptide antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Pharmacodynamic properties of HMR 3647, a novel ketolide, on respiratory pathogens, enterococci and Bacteroides fragilis demonstrated by studies of time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect.
AB  - The pharmacodynamic properties of a novel ketolide (a new class of macrolide), HMR 3647, were investigated by studying time-kill kinetics and postantibiotic effect (PAE). The time-kill kinetics were studied at two inocula against three strains each of Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Bacteroides fragilis. The PAEs of HMR 3647 were also investigated on these organisms at concentrations equivalent to 1, 4 and 10 x MIC. The time-kill kinetic data demonstrated that HMR 3647 is predominantly bacteriostatic and only slowly bactericidal at higher concentrations. HMR 3647 exhibited a significant PAE with all strains studied, ranging from 1.2 h to 8.2 h at 10 x MIC. The bacteriostatic activity and significant PAE demonstrated by HMR 3647 are similar to those previously obtained with other macrolides.
TI  - Evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic to reduce the colonization and shedding of Campylobacter jejuni in broilers.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni has often been responsible for human gastroenteritis. Poultry have often been implicated as a source for these human infections. Intestinal colonization of C. jejuni in the chicken plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. Thus, reducing C. jejuni colonization in chickens can potentially reduce the incidence of C. jejuni infections in humans. The use of probiotics to competitively exclude the colonization of intestinal pathogens has been proposed for poultry. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an avian-specific probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecium for reducing the shedding and colonization of C. jejuni in the chicken intestinal tract. Day-old chicks were randomly allocated into either a probiotic-treated group or a control group. The treated group was given probiotic from day 1 to day 3, and the control group was not given any probiotic. Six hours after the first oral administration of probiotics (treatment) or double distilled water (control), these chicks were challenged with C. jejuni. The frequency of the C. jejuni shedding was monitored until market age. Intestinal colonization was determined for the two experimental groups at slaughter. Results indicated that chickens given probiotics from day 1 to day 3 had a 70% reduction in the frequency of C. jejuni shedding in colonized chicks (P = 0.0001) and a 27% reduction in jejunal colonization in colonized chicks (P = 0.0001) at slaughter when compared with the control group. Thus, the use of the avian-specific probiotic containing L. acidophilus and S. faecium can reduce the colonization and frequency of fecal shedding of C. jejuni in market-aged broilers.
TI  - Emerging antibiotic resistance.
AB  
TI  - [Comparative antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 (quinupristin-dalfopristin), the first semisynthetic injectable streptgramin, against gram-positive cocci and other recent clinical pathogens].
AB  - RP 59,500 (Quinupristin-Dalfopristin) is the first semisynthetic injectable streptogramin antimicrobial agent, which is a combination of quinupristin and dalfopristin in a 30:70 ratio. The components of RP 59,500 act synergically to provide bactericidal activity through action at different sites on bacterial ribosomes. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of RP 59,500 was compared with those of four macrolides (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin, roxithromycin). Susceptibility testing was carried out by microdilution method on 303 strains of 10 species, especially antibiotic-resistant Gram-positive cocci. RP 59,500 was active against a wide range of Gram-positive cocci including methicillin-resistant Staphylococci and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis were both 0.25 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. The MICs90 of RP 59,500 against penicillin-sensitive, -intermediate and -resistant S. pneumoniae were all 0.5 microgram/ml, although those of four macrolides against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae were higher than 32 micrograms/ml. RP 59,500 also exhibited equivalent activities to the four macrolides against strains of Streptococcus pyogenes. Streptococcus agalactiae and Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59,500 exhibited the highest activities against Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium strains which are intrinsically resistant to most antimicrobial agents. No cross-resistance was observed between RP 59,500 and the four macrolides, which will merit attention in future clinical trials of the agent. The effect of human serum on the MIC of RP 59,500 was studied with strains of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. faecalis. The presence of 20% (V/V) serum had little or no effect on the MIC, although 50% (V/V) serum increased MICs by 4-8 folds. Laboratory-induced resistance to RP 59,500 occurred in a stepwise fashion in broth cultures of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and E. facalis strains and the induction rate was slow and no more than four fold increases were observed. Population analysis was performed on RP 59,500 and the reference macrolides against S. aureus ATCC 25,923 strain. Although low frequencies (less than 0.01%) of resistant sub-population were detected with EM, CAM, AZM and RXM, no RP 59,500-resistant sub-population was detected in this study.
TI  - [The role of carbapenems in the treatment of nosocomial infection].
AB  - Carbapenems are active beta-lactam antibiotics versus most of the gram positive and gram negative microorganisms and anaerobes although their activity is lacking in the case of Staphylococcus sp. resistant to methicillin, Enterococcus faecium and Streptococcus pneumoniae with high resistance to penicillin and some gram negative bacilli which naturally produce an methaloenzyme able to hydrolyze them such as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Imipenem, the first synthetized carbapenem requires administration with cilastatin to avoid inactivation by renal dehydropeptidase 1. Meropenem does not require being taken with the renal enzyme inhibitor, with its activity being similar to that of imipenem. In abdominal infection the carbapenems have shown to be the authentic monotherapy in this type of infections being as effective as the different schedules of antibiotic associations normally used. Treatment with carbapenems in bacterial meningitis should be currently limited to the cases produced by gram negative bacilli producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamases (WSBL), cases of meningitis by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or gram negative bacilli producers of inducible cephalosporinase. Meropenem is the carbapenem of choice probably in these cases because the carbapenems are often the only active antibiotics and meropenem, specifically, does not have the risk of convulsions observed with imipenem-cilastatin. The carbapenems have shown to be useful in skin and soft tissue infections as well as in obstetric and gynecologic infections as monotherapy similar to the schedules of the currently used antibiotic associations. In the case of nosocomial pneumonias, all the studies have evaluated the carbapenems in monotherapy as useful and effective, specially in the case of pneumonia by gram negative bacilli. Finally, in non filiated nosocomial sepsis and specially in the case of neutropenic patients, the use of carbapenems is particularly attractive in gram negative sepsis in intensive care units. The appearance in the last few years of strains of gram negative bacilli, producers of wide spectrum beta-lactamase or stable repressed hyperproducers of class I chromosomic cephalosporinase, as well as other multiresistant gram negative bacilli, such as Acinetobacter baumanii make the carbapenems, in many cases, the only effective antibiotic in this type of infections.
TI  - [Meropenem: microbiologic perspective].
AB  - Meropenem is a beta-lactamic carbapenem derived from thienamycin and is structurally characterized by the presence of a beta-methyl group in position C1 which confers stability to the molecule versus renal dehydropeptidase 1 (DHP-1), thereby making the coadministration of an enzyme inhibitor unnecessary. Its esterochemical configuration of the lateral chain in C2 (dimethyl carbomoilpyrrolidenethium) increases the activity versus gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria and pseudomonas) and moreover, may explain the reduction in the proconvulsive effect observed in imipenem/cilastatin. Meropenem has great bactericide power and has a very wide spectrum of activity depending on it low molecular weight and zwiterionic structure, stability versus almost all the clinically important beta-lactamases and high affinity for the PBPs. It covers gram positive aerobes (Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, streptococci including Streptococcus pneumoniae resistant to penicillin, Enterococcus faecalis, Rhodococcus equi, Listeria monocytogenes) and gram negative bacteria (enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas, Vibrio, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria, Moraxella) and anaerobes (Bacteroides, Prevotella, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Propionibacterium acnes), being more active than imipenem versus gram negatives: P. aeruginosa (2-4-fold), enterobacteria (2-32-fold) and H. influenzae (4-8-fold) and less active versus the gram positives (enterococci, streptococci and staphylococci). Meropenem has no activity on Enterococcus faecium, S. aureus resistant to methycillin, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and other genera producers of chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases (carbapenemases). Resistance may be due to impermeability given the loss of the OprD porin (OprD2 in enterobacteria and P. aeruginosa) loss of different membrane proteins (Proteus mirabilis, Proteus rettgeri, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), modifications of the PBPs (gram positive) and the production of carbapenemases (chromosomic methalo-beta-lactamases).
TI  - Successful single-dose teicoplanin prophylaxis against experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal aortic valve endocarditis.
AB  - Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is administered both intramuscularly and intravenously. It has a prolonged half-life and a less toxic profile in comparison to those of vancomycin. The efficacy of a single dose of teicoplanin (18 mg/kg of body weight given intramuscularly) for the prevention of endocarditis due to Streptococcus oralis, Enterococcus faecium, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was evaluated after applying the rabbit model. Vancomycin at a single dose of 30 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to MRSA and E. faecium, while ampicillin at a single dose of 40 mg/kg given intravenously was used as the comparative agent for the prevention of endocarditis due to S. oralis. Rabbits in the teicoplanin group were infected at 1 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) CFU of each strain. Rabbits in the other groups were infected at 0.5 h postdosing with approximately 10(7) CFU of S. oralis (ampicillin group) or E. faecium and MRSA (vancomycin group). All rabbits were sacrificed 5 days later. Teicoplanin and vancomycin protected the animals challenged with E. faecium by 87.5 and 50%, respectively, and protected the animals challenged with MRSA by 100 and 92%, respectively. Teicoplanin and ampicillin protected the animals challenged with S. oralis by 100 and 77%, respectively. Prevention of endocarditis by teicoplanin was likely to be due to a prolonged inhibition of bacterial growth by the sustained supra-MICs. It is concluded that teicoplanin is very effective in preventing experimental streptococcal, enterococcal, and staphylococcal endocarditis and may be an attractive alternative antibiotic in patients allergic to beta-lactams, especially in the outpatient setting.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of quinupristin-dalfopristin against Gram-positive bloodstream isolates.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was compared with those of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clarithromycin, rifampicin, imipenem, meropenem, ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against 414 bloodstream isolates of Gram-positive cocci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin inhibited strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus agalactiae at 0.12 mg/L, methicillin- and/or erythromycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at 0.5 mg/L, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus bovis, Streptococcus sanguis and Streptococcus anginosus at 1 mg/L and Enterococcus faecalis at 8 mg/L.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity and MIC quality control guidelines of RPR 106972  (RPR 112808/RPR106950): a novel orally administered streptogramin combination. The Quality Control Study Group.
AB  - RPR 106972 is a novel oral streptogramin combination with reported therapeutic potency against Gram-positive and certain respiratory tract pathogens. MICs for RPR 106972, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and seven comparison drugs were determined by the reference methods against 337 strains selected to define spectrum and potency. RPR 106972 demonstrated antimicrobial activity against oxacillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC ranges of 0.12 to 2 micrograms/ml and 0.5 to 2 micrograms/ml, respectively), and coagulase-negative staphylococci were also inhibited by RPR 106972 (MIC90, < or = 0.5 microgram/ml) and quinupristin/dalfopristin (MIC90, < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). Against all streptococcal strains tested (including penicillin-resistant pneumococcus), RPR 106972 was highly active with MIC results at < or = 1 microgram/ml. RPR 106972 inhibited Corynebacterium jeikeium (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml). Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), and some Haemophilus influenzae (MIC50, 2 micrograms/ml). RPR 106972 and quinupristin/dalfopristin demonstrated little activity against Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90s, 4 to 32 micrograms/ml) as compared to Enterococcus faecium (MIC90s, 0.5 to 1 microgram/ml) and other Enterococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 1 microgram/ml). Studies to establish MIC quality-control guidelines indicated the following ranges: for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 0.5 to 4 micrograms/ml; for S. aureus ATCC 29213, 0.25 to 1 microgram/ml; and for Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 49619, 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml. The results of this study indicate that the in vitro activity of RPR 106972 against Gram-positive bacteria and selected Gram-negative respiratory organisms is promising and warrants additional studies of pharmacokinetics, and in vivo infection model dynamics.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of RU-59863, a C-7 catechol substituted cephalosporin.
AB  - The in vitro activity of RU-59863, a so-called "fifth generation" catechol cephalosporin, was evaluated against 606 bacterial isolates and compared with the activities of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, and cefpirome. RU-59863 demonstrated a broad spectrum of inhibition and superior overall activity than comparators when tested against Enterobacteriaciae (MIC90s, 0.015 to 2 micrograms/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml), Acinetobacter ssp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus ssp. (MIC90s, 0.5 to 8 micrograms/ml). Potent RU-59863 activity was also observed against beta-haemolytic and viridans gr. streptococci (MIC90s, 0.12-0.5 microgram/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90s, 0.03 to 0.5 microgram/ml), Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 0.06 microgram/ml), and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). RU-59863 demonstrated marginal potency against Enterococcus faecalis (MICs 2 to 16 micrograms/ml) and was inactive against Enterococcus faecium (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml). Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were not inhibited by RU-59863 (MIC90s, 32 to 128 micrograms/ml). Among the cephalosporins tested, RU-59863 performed best versus ceftazidime-resistant Bush group 1 isolates and strains producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. RU-59863 was also effective against many fluoroquinolone-, aminoglycoside-, and imipenem-resistant isolates. RU-59863 seems to be a significant advance in cephalosporin chemistry and activity, especially against Gram-negative pathogens resistant to current beta-lactam therapeutic agents. Further studies of human pharmacokinetics and against clinical infections are encouraged.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, against Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of trovafloxacin, a new quinolone, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, various beta-lactam antibiotics and, where appropriate, clindamycin and vancomycin against a range of Gram-positive bacteria including staphylococci (n = 201), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 83), beta-haemolytic streptococci (n = 46), viridans group streptococci (n = 100), Streptococcus milleri (n = 18) and enterococci (n = 161) by an agar dilution technique. In addition, time-kill studies were performed to estimate the bactericidal activity of trovafloxacin against S. milleri and viridans group streptococci. Trovafloxacin was the most active agent tested against staphylococci. It also showed good activity, at least four-fold and usually eight- to 16-fold that of ciprofloxacin, against all the streptococci. Trovafloxacin showed good activity against vancomycin-sensitive Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, but was less active against the 11 isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Trovafloxacin showed comparable or superior bactericidal activity to amoxycillin against the S. milleri and viridans group streptococci tested.
TI  - Detection of the phosphorylcholine epitope in streptococci, Haemophilus and pathogenic Neisseriae by immunoblotting.
AB  - The phosphorylcholine (PC) determinant in Streptococcus pneumoniae is known to be linked to the cell wall polysaccharides (C-Ps) and to the lipoteichoic acid (LTA) (Forssman antigen) of the plasma membrane. Western blotting with two PC specific murine monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) designated 145,F-2 (IgM) and 147,A-1 (IgA) showed a similar ladder-like pattern for all examined strains of S. pneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis. Purified antigens run in parallel indicated that this ladder pattern is due to the PC of LTA. Unlike other techniques, Western blotting thus enables the identification of only one of the streptococcal structures carrying the PC epitope. Gram-negative organisms were also examined, and six of 11 Haemophilus influenzae strains reacted with the MAbs. For this species, unlike the streptococci, only one fast moving band was detected. Analyses by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) detected the PC epitope in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) fraction from H. influenzae. Some strains of the Neisseriaceae family were also positive by Western blotting, but TLC and immunostaining did not detect the PC determinant in LPS.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of novel oral carbapenem DZ-2640.
AB  - The in vitro antibacterial activity of DU-6681a, a parent compound of DZ-2640, against gram-positive and -negative bacteria was compared with those of penems and cephalosporins currently available. MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90s) of the compound for clinical isolates of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains, were 0.10, 25, and 12.5 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a inhibited the growth of all strains of Streptococcus pyogenes and of penicillin-susceptible and -insusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae at 0.006, 0.025, and 0.20 microg/ml, respectively, and MIC90s of the compound were 6.25 and >100 microg/ml for Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium, respectively. MIC90s of DU-6681a were 0.20, 0.10, and 0.025 microg/ml for Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, respectively. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC50 and MIC90 of DU-6681a were 25 and 50 microg/ml, respectively. DU-6681a activity was not affected by different media, varied inoculum size (10(4) to 10(7) CFU), or the addition of human serum but was decreased under acidic conditions against gram-negative bacteria, under alkaline conditions against gram-positive bacteria, and in human urine, as was the activity of the other antibiotics tested. The frequency of spontaneous resistance to DU-6681a was less than or equal to those of the reference compounds. Time-kill curve studies demonstrated the bactericidal action of DU-6681a against S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and H. influenzae.
TI  - Activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against gram-positive bacteria: clinical applications and therapeutic potential.
AB  - In recent years there has been a dramatic worldwide increase in the prevalence of multiple drug-resistant strains of common Gram-positive bacteria. This highlights the need for a new class of antibiotic with activity against these organisms. Quinupristin/dalfopristin, the first injectable streptogramin antibiotic, has a unique spectrum of activity, encompassing most Gram-positive cocci (including multi-drug-resistant strains), respiratory pathogens and anaerobes, Gram-positive, and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect. Quinupristin/ dalfopristin is active in vitro against multi-drug-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. Clinical case reports have shown that the combination is active against intra-abdominal, aortic graft, bacteraemia and hydrocephalus shunt infections caused by multi-drug-resistant enterococci, particularly E. faecium. In almost all of these clinical situations the enterococcal infection had displayed resistance to all other antimicrobial therapies. Preliminary clinical data have demonstrated the activity of quinupristin/ dalfopristin against S. aureus bacteraemia, and quinupristin/dalfopristin may also prove useful in the treatment of pneumococcal infections. Thus, possible future applications of the combination include the treatment of multi-drug-resistant strains of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci. Quinupristin/dalfopristin may prove useful in the treatment of staphylococcal infections in children, invasive systemic pneumococcal infections, and nosocomial and community-acquired Gram-positive infections in patients unable to tolerate beta-lactam antimicrobial agents or glycopeptide antibiotics.
TI  - Development of provisional disc diffusion breakpoints for testing quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is an injectable streptogramin with broad activity against many Gram-positive bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Although a number of studies have reported the MICs of this compound against a variety of bacteria, there are no published reports of disc diffusion testing. We tested total disc masses of 7.5 and 15 micrograms with varying ratios of the component compounds, quinupristin and dalfopristin, combined in the following quinupristin: dalfopristin ratios (in microgram): 7.5:0, 0:7.5, 10:5, 5:10, 5:2.5 and 2.5:5. Zone diameters and MICs were determined in parallel for 44 isolates of staphylococci, 47 isolates pneumococci and 64 isolates of enterococci. Control strains were included for each species tested, including a strain of Enterococcus faecalis with known resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Using tentative definitions for quinupristin/dalfopristin of < or = 2 mg/L as susceptible and > or = 4 mg/L as resistant, each of the four discs containing ratios of both component compounds separated presumptive susceptible organisms from resistant ones better than either quinupristin or dalfopristin alone. The best correlation of zone sizes and MICs for predicting susceptibility to quinupristin/dalfopristin at an MIC of < or = 2 mg/L was achieved with the 5 micrograms:10 micrograms disc and a zone diameter of > or = 18 mm. These criteria may be useful for identifying organisms that are presumptively susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin.
TI  - In-vitro and in-vivo antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new water-soluble streptogramin antimicrobial agent comprising quinupristin and dalfopristin in a ratio of 30:70. The in-vitro spectrum of activity includes most multi-resistant Gram-positive aerobes, important Gram-negative aerobes, Gram-positive anaerobes and intracellular bacteria that are causal agents of respiratory, blood and cutaneous infections. Of particular note, quinupristin/dalfopristin is active against multidrug-resistant isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium, and against penicillin-resistant and/or erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The combination is also active against staphylococci showing both constitutive and inducible erythromycin resistance. Bactericidal activity and a prolonged post-antibiotic effect have also been noted for quinupristin/dalfopristin against Gram-positive cocci. Gram-negative bacteria susceptible to quinupristin/dalfopristin include Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella spp. and Mycoplasma spp. Overall, the spectrum of antibacterial activity indicates a potential role for this combination in the treatment of difficult-to-treat Gram-positive infections, including those caused by multidrug-resistant organisms. Since this activity extends to Gram-negative respiratory bacteria, quinupristin/dalfopristin may also find a role in the treatment of atypical, as well as typical, pneumonia.
TI  - Pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  - Pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. The overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. Anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. Gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,Clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. Vaginitis has been experimentally studied using L. acidophilus and L. casei GG. The efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. Requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.
TI  - Antimicrobial characteristics of quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid at 30:70 ratio) compared to alternative ratios for in vitro testing.
AB  - Quinupristin/dalfopristin is a new streptogramin combination that occurs at a natural ratio and formulation of 30:70. Rapid metabolism of the dalfopristin component to RP 12536 in vivo puts in question the validity of in vitro test of spectrum with the parent combination. In studies of quinupristin with both dalfopristin and RP 12536, a wide range of ratios (30:70, 50:50, 70:30) were tested by reference MIC and MBC tests. No significant potency differences were observed between combination ratios or metabolic components when testing 256 bacterial strains. Quinupristin/dalfopristin or quinupristin/RP 12536 remained active, by bactericidal action against many staphylococci and Streptococcus ssp. Enterococcus faecium strains were susceptible (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml; static effect only) to the streptogramin, but E. faecalis, Pasteurella multocida, Pediococcus ssp., Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis were generally less susceptible (MIC90, > or = 8 micrograms/ml). The log phase inoculum was preferred for MBC and kill-curve tests with this combination. The 30:70 ratio in vitro susceptibility test of quinupristin/dalfopristin as used to date, seems to predict the potency and spectrum of this streptogramin accurately and all clinically important in vivo ratios of the injectable form or its major metabolites. Quinupristin/dalfopristin should be further investigated for clinical use against emerging resistant Gram-positive infections, especially penicillin-resistant streptococci and glycopeptide-resistant E. faecium that exhibit susceptibility in this investigation.
TI  - Primary and secondary structures of rRNA spacer regions in enterococci.
AB  - The 16S-23S and 23S-5S rRNA spacer DNA regions (spacer regions 1 and 2, respectively) from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Enterococcus durans and Enterococcus mundtii were amplified by PCR. Their nucleotide sequences were established and a secondary structure model showing the interaction between the two spacer regions was built. Whereas lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto are characterized by a single type of spacer region 1, the enterococci show a high degree of variability in this region; thus the spacer regions 1 with and without tRNA(Ala) were characterized. However, as shown for lactococci and Streptococcus sensu stricto, the tRNA(Ala) gene does not encode the 3'-terminal CCA trinucleotide. A putative antitermination signal is found downstream from the tRNA(Ala) gene. Based on comparison with Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus thermophilus, a double-stranded processing stem is proposed. In E, hirae, one of the three different types of spacer region 1 contains no tRNA(Ala), but displays a 107 nt insertion that forms a long stem-loop structure. A similar insertion (115 nt in length) was found in E. faecium and base compensatory mutations preserve the ability to form the long stem-loop structure. Such insertions may correspond to mobile intervening sequences, as found in the 23S rRNA coding sequences of some Gram-negative bacteria. The spacer regions 1 and 2 from the three subgroups of streptococci were compared, and except for the tRNA(Ala) gene and the double-stranded processing sites, little similarity was found, which opens large possibilities for future development of DNA-based typing methods.
TI  - [Evaluation of a rapid method for the identification of the Enterococcus genus].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The evaluation of the reliability of a group of three tests: pyrrolidonil-arilamidase, rapid test in NaCl esculin broth and group D antistreptococci agglutination for the rapid identification of the Enterococcus genus were performed. METHODS: One hundred fifty-eight strains of streptococci: 110 strains of Enterococcus faecalis, 8 E. faecium, 3 E. avium, 16 Streptococcus intermedius, 7 S. salivarius, 4 S. bovis, 4 S. constellatus, 2 S. sanguis and 1 strain of S. equinus, S. mitis, S. uberis and S. mutans were studied. The tests used were: rapid test in NaCl- esculin broth, pyrrolidonyl-arilamidase and antigroup D streptococcus agglutination (Patho Dx Strep D/PYR; Diagnostic Product Corporation). All catalase-negative gram-positive cocci or coccibacilli which were positive in the three tests were considered to belong to the Enterococcus genus. The usefulness of Gram staining in culture in thioglycolate broth was also studied comparing it with the results obtained with solid medium. RESULTS: The results of the proposed identification scheme were evaluated calculating different parameters: sensitivity 98%, specificity 100%, positive predictive value, 100%, and negative predictive value 94%. No significant differences were observed between the results obtained with Gram staining with thioglycolate broth and those obtained with solid medium except in the case of the Streptococcus mutans strain. CONCLUSIONS: The application of a combination of tests: pyrroidonyl-arilamidase, antistreptococci group D agglutination and rapid test in NaCl-esculin broth to catalase-negative gram-positive cocci and coccobacilli allows reliable identification in a maximum of three hours of strains belonging to the Enterococcus genus.
TI  - In vitro activity and spectrum of LY333328, a novel glycopeptide derivative.
AB  - Reference methods were used to determine the potency of LY333328, a semisynthetic glycopeptide derivative with a key N-alkylation substitution, against 833 strains (393 gram-positive strains and representative gram-negative bacilli) with various defined resistance mechanisms. The MICs at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited (MIC90S) (in micrograms per milliliter) of LY333328 and the percentages of strains at < or = 8 micrograms/ml were as follows: for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 2 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 100%; for oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermis, 4 and 100%, and for oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 8 and 96%; for Streptococcus serogroups A, B, C, and G, 0.25 to 1 and 100%; for Streptococcus pneumoniae < or = 0.015 to 0.06 and 100%; for Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 100%; and for vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium, 0.25 and 100%, and for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, 4 and 100%. LY333328 was not active (MIC50, > or = 16 micrograms/ml) against more than 400 representative strains of Enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonads, Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, pathogenic Neisseria spp., and anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Gram-positive anaerobes were LY333328 susceptible (MICs, < or = 2 micrograms/ml). Test methods and conditions may have affected MICs of LY333328, with most (species variation) agar dilution MICs being greater than the broth microdilution MICs.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of a novel ketolide antimicrobial agent, RU-64004.
AB  - Ketolides, a novel macrolide subclass, possess a mode of action that is similar to that of structurally related macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin (MLS) compounds. By using reference in vitro tests, the in vitro activity of RU-64004 was compared to those of six other MLS compounds against more than 800 clinical pathogens, including 356 gram-positive organisms. The spectrum of activity of the ketolide was most similar to that of clindamycin versus staphylococci and streptococci and superior to those of all macrolides tested against oxacillin-resistant staphylococci and vancomycin-resistant (vanA, vanB, and vanC) enterococcal isolates. The activity of the ketolide was greater than those of the macrolides, azalides, or clindamycin tested against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (MICs at which 90% of isolates are inhibited [MIC90S], 0.25 to 4 micrograms/ml), penicillin-resistant pneumococci (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml), and most beta-hemolytic streptococci. All Streptococcus pneumoniae and beta-hemolytic streptococcus strain were inhibited by ketolide concentrations of < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against 165 erythromycin-resistant strains, RU-64004 inhibited (MICs, < or = 0.5 micrograms/ml) approximately one-third of staphylococci, all streptococci, and slightly more than one-half of the enterococci. Quinupristin-dalfopristin (a streptogramin combination) was active against all tested isolates with the exception of non-Enterococcus faecium enterococci, against which the ketolide exhibited greater potency (MIC50S, 0.03 to 2 micrograms/ml). The ketolide was also active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Moraxella catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.12 micrograms/ml), pathogenic Neisseria spp. (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml), and many gram-positive anaerobes (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). RU-64004 may enhance the role of macrolide drugs in the treatment of some serious infections caused by MLS-resistant gram-positive organisms.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. An update on current microbiological patterns.
AB  - Although resistance has developed among Gram-positive pathogens to penicillins, cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, quinolones and macrolides, the glycopeptides seem to remain largely unaffected. However, the recent emergence and range of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci, well documented in the USA but not in the rest of the world, have prompted this European surveillance study. The European Glycopeptide Resistance Survey was undertaken in 1995 in 9 countries and involved 70 microbiological centres. The primary aims of the survey were as follows: (i) to perform a microbiological quality assurance assessment to evaluate the ability of participating laboratories to correctly identify the strains and assess their glycopeptide susceptibility; and (ii) to accurately determine the level of glycopeptide resistance among staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci in European hospitals. The in vitro activity of several other antibiotics was assessed on strains isolated from the Italian centres. In total, 7078 Gram-positive isolates were collected in Europe, and national coordinators used the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) agar dilution reference method to successfully retest 96% of these. According to mode minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), teicoplanin activity was similar to that of vancomycin against Staphylococcus aureus. In general, the range of MICs for teicoplanin was wider than that for vancomycin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. Against Enterococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp., teicoplanin was 4 times more active than vancomycin. The greatest number of glycopeptide refractory organisms was evident among enterococci; resistance was observed to be approximately 10 times more frequent in Enterococcus faecium than in E. faecalis. The results from the Italian isolates were similar to those from the overall study. In particular, teicoplanin was 2- to 8-fold more active than vancomycin against the majority of the enterococci. The incidence of enterococcal resistance was lower in Italy (0.6% for teicoplanin and 0.9% for vancomycin) than in Europe (1.7% for teicoplanin and 2.3% for vancomycin). This extensive survey confirms that teicoplanin is more active than vancomycin against enterococci and streptococci, and that both display similar potency against staphylococci.
TI  - Glucose starvation response in Enterococcus faecalis JH2-2: survival and protein  analysis.
AB  - We investigated the survival of Enterococcus faecalis following starvation provoked by energy source glucose exhaustion. Inhibition of protein synthesis by chloramphenicol before 3 h of starvation resulted in a dramatic decrease in viable bacteria. Antibiotic treatment of cells after 3 or 6 h of starvation had a progressively lesser influence on bacterial survival. During the first 24 h of deprivation, a total of 42 proteins were identified as glucose-starvation-inducible; 4 temporal classes of proteins (A, B, C and D) were defined in relation to their enhanced synthesis after glucose exhaustion. Our results show that proteins from the two early classes (A and B) seem to be the most important for long-term survival in E. faecalis. One protein of each of these classes was analysed at the molecular level. The N-terminal sequence of one of them, belonging to class A, showed strong homology with the N-terminal sequence of carbamate kinase from Streptococcus faecium. This enzyme could be implicated in the development of alternative metabolic pathways of energy production and could be compared to the Cst proteins of Escherichia coli.

TI  - In-vitro pharmacodynamic studies of piperacillin/tazobactam with gentamicin and ciprofloxacin.
AB  - Six isolates each of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus  epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Citrobacter spp., Serratia spp., Acinetobacter spp. and Enterobacter spp. (total 60 strains) were studied against the combination of piperacillin/tazobactam plus gentamicin or ciprofloxacin at physiological concentrations by the microtitre chequerboard method incorporating simultaneous time-kill curves. Tazobactam was fixed at 4 mg/L. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam was a synergic combination against 28 strains at 2 h, 51 at 5 h and 54 at 24 h as assessed by time-kill curves and synergic or additive (FBC index < or = 1) against all 60 strains at 24 h by chequerboards. The corresponding figures for ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam were seven, 26, 52 and 58 respectively. Antagonism (FBC index > or = 4) was demonstrated for one strain to each combination at 24 h. There were no significant differences between FIC indices and FBC indices for each antibiotic combination. Gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 47 strains by 2 h, 56 by 5 h and 59 by 24 h. Ciprofloxacin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave > or = 3 log kill for 22 strains by 2 h, 36 by 5 h and 56 by 24 h. In conclusion both antibiotic combinations at physiological concentrations were synergic or additive at 24 h for the majority of strains tested although notably gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam gave faster kill. Antagonism was rarely seen. Both combinations are likely to prove beneficial for treatment of serious infections.
TI  - Approaches to limiting emergence of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria in human populations.
AB  - Infectious diseases continue to be major threats to human health around the world. Within the past few years, several divergent groups of organisms have emerged as significant causes of morbidity and mortality. Included among these are bacteria that are refractory to therapy because of the development of resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents. Multidrug resistance in strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhi, and Enterococcus faecium has been reported. Surveillance of resistant microorganisms in the United States and abroad is fragmentary and targets relatively few organisms. Surveillance is further hampered by the fact that detection of some novel resistance mechanisms is difficult by means of current laboratory methods. Both clinicians and public health officials are likely to continue to face a variety of challenges regarding surveillance, treatment, prevention, and control of drug-resistant infections.
TI  - Emergence of vancomycin resistance in the genus Streptococcus: characterization of a vanB transferable determinant in Streptococcus bovis.
AB  - Streptococcus bovis NEM760 was isolated from a stool swab collected on admission  from a patient as surveillance for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Strain NEM760 was identified as S. bovis by conventional biochemical methods and partial sequence analysis of its 16S rRNA. This strain was resistant to a low level of vancomycin (MIC, 64 micrograms/ml) but was susceptible to teicoplanin (MIC, 1 micrograms/ml), and vancomycin induced resistance to both glycopeptides. The presence of a vanB-related gene in NEM760 was demonstrated in a PCR assay which enabled specific amplification of a 635-hp internal segment of vanB. Sequence analysis of the corresponding PCR product revealed that it was highly homologous (96% identity) to the prototype vanB sequence of Enterococcus faecalis V583. The VanB resistance of determinant of S. bovis NEM760 was transferred by conjugation to E. faecalis and Enterococcus faecium at a similar frequency of 2 x 10(-5) per donor. SmaI-digested genomic DNAs of independently obtained transconjugants of E. faecalis and E. faecium were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization with a vanB DNA probe. The electrophoretic and hybridization patterns obtained with all transconjugants of the same species were indistinguishable and revealed vanB-containing chromosomal insertions of approximately 100 kb. These results suggest that the genes mediating VanB-type resistance in S. bovis NEM760 are part of large transferable genetic elements. The results presented in the report demonstrate for the first time the role of streptococci in the dissemination of vancomycin resistance among gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Long-term (6 months) effect of a new fermented milk product on the level of plasma lipoproteins--a placebo-controlled and double blind study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We have recently demonstrated a short-term hypocholesterolemic effect  (reduction of 8-10%) of a new fermented milk product taken for 6 weeks (Agerbaek et al, 1995; Richelsen et al, 1993). The present study was undertaken to investigate the more long-term (6 months) effect of this fermented product on the level of lipoproteins. DESIGN: The study was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, and performed for a period of six months. SUBJECTS: Eighty-seven non-obese and normocholesterolemic females and males, aged 50-70 y old, were included in the study. INTERVENTION: 200 ml of either the fermented milk product or placebo (chemically fermented) were given daily. The test product was fermented with a bacteria culture containing Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Streptococcus termophilus. RESULTS: After one month the total- and LDL-cholesterol were significantly reduced in the fermented milk group as compared to placebo, LDL was reduced by 0.21 mmol/l vs 0.0 mmol/1 (P < 0.02). The maximal reduction of LDL-cholesterol was reached after 3 months in the test group with a reduction of 0.32 mmol/1 of initial values (P < 0.001). In the placebo group a gradual fall of total- and LDL-cholesterol was observed from 1-6 months of the study. Thus, after six months the reduction of LDL-cholesterol was similar in the two groups (P = 0.95) even though the reduction was significant in both groups in relation to initial values (P < 0.05). No changes in HDL-cholesterol or triglyceride were observed during the study. There were no differences in the response between women and men. CONCLUSION: The fermented milk product resulted in a rapid reduction of LDL-cholesterol observed after one month but during long-term intake (6 months) the reduction of LDL-cholesterol was similar to the placebo product, indicating that low-fat milk or fermented milk products may have some hypocholesterolemic effects but the present tested product does not seem to be superior in that respect to the placebo milk product used in the present study.
TI  - 2-amino-4-oxo-5-substituted-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines as nonclassical antifolate  inhibitors of thymidylate synthase.
AB  - Six novel 2-amino-4-oxo-5-[(substituted phenyl)sulfanyl]pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines 7-12 were synthesized as potential inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS) and as antitumor and/or antibacterial agents. The analogues contain a 5-thio substituent with a phenyl, 4'-chlorophenyl, 3',4'-dichlorophenyl, 4'-nitrophenyl, 3',4'-dimethoxyphenyl, and 2'-naphthyl on the sulfur, and were synthesized from the key intermediate 2-(pivaloylamino)-4-oxo-6-methylpyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidine, 17. Appropriately substituted aryl thiols were appended to the 5-position of 17 via an oxidative addition reaction using iodine, ethanol, and water under conditions which also resulted in the deprotection of the 2-amino group. The compounds were evaluated against human, Lactobacillus casei, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecium, and Pneumocystis carinii (pc) TSs and against human, rat liver (rl), pc, and Toxoplasma gondii (tg) DHFRs. The nonclassical analogues with the 3',4'-dichloro and the 4'-nitro substituents in the side chain (9 and 10) were more potent than N-[4-[N-[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-N-prop- 2-ynylamino]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (PDDF, 1) and N-[5-[N-[(3,4-dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-6-quinazolinyl)methyl]-N- methylamino]-2-thenoyl]-L-glutamic acid (ZD1694,2) against human TS. Analogues with the 4'-chloro, 3',4'-dimethoxy, and naphthyl side chains (8, 11 and 12) were more potent than the unsubstituted phenyl analogue (7) but less than 2, 9, and 10 by 1 order of magnitude. They were all poor inhibitors of human, rl, and pc DHFRs (IC50 = 10(-5) M) but moderate inhibitors (IC50 = 10(-6) M) of tg DHFR. The 4-nitro analogue, 10 (EC50 1.5 microM), was comparable to PDDF in its potency as an inhibitor of the growth of the FaDu human squamous cell carcinoma cell line.

TI  - Pseudo-outbreak of Enterococcus durans infections and colonization associated with introduction of an automated identification system software update.
AB  - Enterococci are an important cause of hospital-acquired infections. Since 1989, there has been an increase in the number of nosocomial enterococcal infections caused by strains resistant to vancomycin in the United States. Although many enterococcal species can colonize humans, only Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, E. raffinosus, and E. casseliflavus have been implicated in clusters of infection. In January 1996, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention received a report of an outbreak of vancomycin-resistant enterococci in which 31 of 84 (36.9%) isolates were identified as E. durans. Twenty-nine isolates identified as E. durans were identified to the species level after the introduction of an automated identification system software update (Vitek gram-positive identification card, version R09.1) for the identification of species of gram-positive organisms. When seven isolates initially reported as E. durans were identified to the species level by alternate methods, they were found to be E. faecium. Subsequently, isolates identified as E. durans by the automated system were reidentified by using a rapid streptococcus test, and no further enterococcal isolate has been confirmed as E. durans. Automated microbial analysis is a potential source of error that is not easily recognized. When laboratory findings are discordant with expected clinical or epidemiologic patterns, confirmatory testing by alternate methods should be performed.
TI  - Serological investigation of enterococcal infections using western blot.
AB  - To assess the usefulness of Western blot in the diagnosis of enterococcal infections, a pilot study was conducted with a newly developed Western blot using sera from patients with confirmed enterococcal infections. Sera from 17 of 19 patients with enterococcal endocarditis reacted strongly to enterococcal antigens on the Western blot, and most produced specific bands at molecular weights 98 kDa and 54 kDa. Sera from patients with bacteremic cholangitis and pyelonephritis reacted frequently as well, but the pattern of bands was different from that observed with endocarditis. Eighty-five percent of 26 sera tested from patients with bacteremia and associated deep-seated infections (endocarditis, cholangitis, and pyelonephritis) were positive on Western blot, compared to 30% of sera from bacteremic patients with no clinically determined deep focus of infection (p < 0.001).
TI  - Semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotics derived from LY264826 active against vancomycin-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Certain derivatives of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826 with N-alkyl-linked substitutions on the epivancosamine sugar are active against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci. Six compounds representing our most active series were evaluated for activity against antibiotic-resistant, gram-positive pathogens. For Enterococcus faecium and E. faecalis resistant to both vancomycin and teicoplanin, the MICs of the six semisynthetic compounds for 90% of the strains tested were 1 to 4 micrograms/ml, compared with 2,048 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 256 micrograms/ml for LY264826. For E. faecium and E. faecalis resistant to vancomycin but not teicoplanin, the MICs were 0.016 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 64 to 1,024 micrograms/ml for vancomycin. The compounds were highly active against vancomycin-susceptible enterococci and against E. gallinarum and E. casseliflavus and showed some activity against isolates of highly vancomycin-resistant leuconostocs and pediococci. The MICs for 90% of the strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus tested were typically 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 microgram/ml for vancomycin. Against methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis MICs ranged from 0.25 to 2 micrograms/ml, compared with 1 to 4 micrograms/ml for vancomycin and 4 to 16 micrograms/ml for teicoplanin. The spectrum of these new compounds included activity against teicoplanin-resistant, coagulase-negative staphylococci. The compounds exhibited exceptional potency against pathogenic streptococci, with MICs of < or = 0.008 microgram/ml against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant isolates. In in vivo studies with a mouse infection model, the median effective doses against a challenge by S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes were typically 4 to 20 times lower than those of vancomycin. Overall, these new glycopeptides, such as LY307599 and LY333328, show promise for use as agents against resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci.
TI  - Quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500): an injectable streptogramin combination.
AB  - The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, activity, and potential clinical role of quinupristin-dalfopristin (RP 59500) are described. Quinupristin-dalfopristin is the first injectable formulation of the streptogramin antibiotics. Streptogramin drug products are each composed of two chemically distinct compounds, which when administered together act synergistically by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Quinupristin-dalfopristin has shown activity in vitro against many strains of streptococci and staphylococci, including methicillin- and erythromycin-resistant strains of staphylococci. The combination is more active against Enterococcus faecium than Enterococcus faecalis. It has also shown activity in vitro against certain gram-negative organisms and anaerobes. The mean maximum blood concentration at the end of a one-hour infusion ranged from 0.95 mg/L for a 1.4-mg/kg dose to 24.2 mg/L for a 29.4-mg/kg dose; there was a linear correlation between dose and mean area under the concentration-time curve. Mean half-life ranged from 1.27 to 1.53 hours. The drug is under investigation in the United States in Phase III trials. Of 60 evaluable patients with documented bacteremia involving E. faecium resistant to vancomycin, 40 (67%) had a favorable clinical response. Of 11 patients with bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 78% had a favorable response. The efficacy of quinupristin-dalfopristin in treating resistant infections has also been suggested by smaller studies and case reports. The drug may be useful in the prophylaxis of endocarditis. Adverse reactions are generally mild and transient. Quinupristin-dalfopristin may be useful in treating serious gram-positive infections, but more clinical study is needed.
TI  - Influence of lipoteichoic acid structure on recognition by the macrophage scavenger receptor.
AB  - Lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) belong to the immunostimulatory class of molecules of gram-positive bacteria (GPB). Previous investigations showed that the macrophage scavenger receptor (SR), a glycosylated trimeric transmembrane protein, binds directly to many GPB, possibly via LTA. SR binding to other ligands is dependent upon the spatial characteristics of the repeating negative charge of the ligand. We therefore investigated SR recognition of LTA species with various charge densities and distributions by determining the capacity of these LTAs to compete with the binding of metabolically labeled SR to beads coated with the known SR ligand polyguanylic acid. Staphylococcus aureus LTA, a classical LTA type (unbranched 1,3-linked polyglycerophosphate chain covalently bound to a membrane diacylglyceroglycolipid), had a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) for inhibition of SR binding of 0.84 microg/ml. When the S. aureus LTA was rendered more negatively charged by removal of ester-linked alanine from the polyglycerophosphate backbone, the IC50 dropped to 0.23 microg/ml. Other polyglycerophosphate LTAs from Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus hirae, Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria welshimeri, and Streptococcus sanguis showed IC50S of 0.5 to 2.1 microg/ml, supporting the role of negative charge in binding to SR. Accordingly, the zwitterionic LTA of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Clostridium innocuum LTA substituted with positively charged sugar residues had no binding capacity. Monoglycerophosphate branches, but not succinyl ester, affected binding of lipoglycans. The data presented above parallel the previous findings for whole organisms and support the role of surface-associated LTA as a major ligand of GPB for binding to SR. Whether binding of LTA and whole GPB to macrophages initiates uptake and degradation or results in signal transduction remains to be determined.
TI  - Rapid identification of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species using diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and artificial neural networks.
AB  - Diffuse reflectance-absorbance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to analyse 19 hospital isolates which had been identified by conventional means to one Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Streptococcus bovis, S. mitis, S. pneumoniae, or S. pyogenes. Principal components analysis of the FT-IR spectra showed that this 'unsupervised' learning method failed to form six separable clusters (one of each species) and thus could not be used to identify these bacteria base on their FT-IR spectra. By contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) could be trained by 'supervised' learning (using the back-propagation algorithm) with the principal components scores of derivatised spectra to recognise the strains from their FT-IR spectra. These results demonstrate that the combination of FT-IR and ANNs provides a rapid, novel and accurate bacterial identification technique.
TI  - In vivo activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antimicrobial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The Upjohn oxazolidinones, U-100592 and U-100766, are orally bioavailable synthetic antimicrobial agents with spectra of activity against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens. In several mouse models of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, U-100592 and U-100766 yielded oral 50% effective doses (ED50) ranging from 1.9 to 8.0 mg/kg of body weight, which compared favorably with vancomycin subcutaneous ED50 values of 1.1 to 4.4 mg/kg. Similarly, both compounds were active versus a Staphylococcus epidermidis experimental systemic infection. U-100592 and U-100766 effectively cured an Enterococcus faecalis systemic infection, with ED50 values of 1.3 and 10.0 mg/kg, and versus a vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infection in immunocompromised mice, both drugs effected cures at 12.5 and 24.0 mg/kg. Both compounds were exceptionally active in vivo against penicillin- and cephalosporin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, with ED50 values ranging from 1.2 to 11.7 mg/kg in systemic infection models. In soft tissue infection models with S. aureus and E. faecalis, both compounds exhibited acceptable curative activities in the range of 11.0 to 39.0 mg/kg. U-100766 was also very active versus the Bacteroides fragilis soft tissue infection model (ED50 = 46.3 mg/kg). In combination-therapy studies, both U-100592 and U-100766 were indifferent or additive in vivo against a monomicrobic S. aureus infection in combination with other antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria and combined as readily as vancomycin with gentamicin in the treatment of a polymicrobic S. aureus-Escherichia coli infection. U-100592 and U-100766 are potent oxazolidinones active against antibiotic-susceptible and -resistant gram-positive pathogens in experimental systemic and soft tissue infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of levofloxacin and ofloxacin against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of levofloxacin against 506 Gram-positive bacteria was compared with those of D(-)-ofloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and sparfloxacin. Levofloxacin was generally twice as active as ofloxacin against these organisms (range, 0-3 twofold dilutions). Sparfloxacin appeared to have the greatest activity overall, but for several groups of organisms minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC90s) of this compound were within one twofold dilution of those of levofloxacin. Resistance to levofloxacin (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml) was not encountered among streptococcal species, was rare in methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (1.7%), and was infrequent in vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium (8.7%). Resistance was more common among vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant staphylococci.
TI  - Direct application of Etest to gram-positive cocci from blood cultures: quick and reliable minimum inhibitory concentration data.
AB  - The Etest was applied directly to 100 Gram-positive bacterial strains from blood  cultures to measure their minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Results showed 100% concordance of MIC data between a direct Etest method and the standard Etest method for Streptococcus pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans group streptococci. In addition, direct Etest for Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis showed 83 to 100% correlation with standard Etests. These data indicate that the Etest is useful to obtain MIC data on Gram-positive cocci (especially streptococci) directly from positive blood cultures. The advantages of a direct Etest are two fold: MIC results can be obtained 24 hours earlier than standard methods and a more representative population of the bacterial isolate is tested.
TI  - In vitro activities of U-100592 and U-100766, novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agents.
AB  - Oxazolidinones make up a relatively new class of antimicrobial agents which possess a unique mechanism of bacterial protein synthesis inhibition. U-100592 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-[4-(hydroxyacetyl)-1-piperazinyl]- phenyl]-2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide and U-100766 (S)-N-[[3-[3-fluoro-4-(4-morpholinyl)phenyl]- 2-oxo-5-oxazolidinyl]methyl]-acetamide are novel oxazolidinone analogs from a directed chemical modification program. MICs were determined for a variety of bacterial clinical isolates; the respective MICs of U-100592 and U-100766 at which 90% of isolates are inhibited were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. aureus, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 and 2 micrograms/ml; methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecalis, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Enterococcus faecium, 2 and 4 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pyogenes, 1 and 2 micrograms/ml; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.50 and 1 microgram/ml; Corynebacterium spp., 0.50 and 0.50 micrograms/ml; Moraxella catarrhalis, 4 and 4 micrograms/ml; Listeria monocytogenes, 8 and 2 micrograms/ml; and Bacteroides fragilis, 16 and 4 micrograms/ml. Most strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the gram-positive anaerobes were inhibited in the range of 0.50 to 2 micrograms/ml. Enterococcal strains resistant to vancomycin (VanA, VanB, and VanC resistance phenotypes), pneumococcal strains resistant to penicillin, and M. tuberculosis strains resistant to common antitubercular agents (isoniazid, streptomycin, rifampin, ethionamide, and ethambutol) were not cross-resistant to the oxazolidinones. The presence of 10, 20, and 40% pooled human serum did not affect the antibacterial activities of the oxazolidinones. Time-kill studies demonstrated a bacteriostatic effect of the analogs against staphylococci and enterococci but a bactericidal effect against streptococci. The spontaneous mutation frequencies of S. aureus ATCC 29213 were <3.8 x 10(-10) and <8 x 10(-11) for U-100592 and U-100766, respectively. Serial transfer of three staphylococcal and two enterococcal strains on drug gradient plates produced no evidence of rapid resistance development. Thus, these new oxazolidinone analogs demonstrated in vitro antibacterial activities against a variety of clinically important human pathogens.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of a new parenteral penem, sulopenem].
AB  - Eighty percent minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC80) of sulopenem against clinically isolated 12 to 80 strains of each of different bacteria were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA): 0.20 micrograms/ml, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA): 50 micrograms/ml, coagulase-negative staphylococci: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Streptococcus pyogenes: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, Streptococcus pneumoniae: < or = 0.013 microgram/ml, beta-streptococci: 0.05 microgram/ml, Enterococcus faecalis: 12.5 micrograms/ml, Enterococcus faecium: > 100 micrograms/ml, Escherichia coli CS2(R+): 0.10 microgram/ml, Klebsiella pneumoniae: 0.05 microgram/ml, Proteus mirabilis: 0.10 microgram/ml, Proteus vulgaris: 0.20 microgram/ml, Morganella morganii: 0.39 micrograms/ml, Providencia rettgeri: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Citrobacter freundii: 0.20 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae: 0.39 microgram/ml, Serratia marcescens: 1.56 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 50 micrograms/ml, Pseudomonas cepacia: 3.13 micrograms/ml, Xanthomonas maltophilia: > 100 micrograms/ml, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus: 1.56 micrograms/ml, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae: 0.39 microgram/ml and Bacteroides fragil is: 0.20 microgram/ml, respectively. Sulopenem possesses a stronger activity than flomoxef or cefuzonam against Gram-positive bacteria, the strongest activity among the antibiotics tested against Gram-negative bacteria except P. aeruginosa. Sulopenem has stronger affinities than imipenem to all fractions of PBPs of S. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, S. marcescens, even of P. aeruginosa. Affinities of sulopenem to PBPs-1 and -3 of S. aureus, PBP-2 of E. coli were much stronger than those of imipenem (IPM). Sulopenem generally has small Ki values to all types of beta-lactamases and also has stronger permanent inactivation effect to Ia and IIb types of beta-lactamases than IPM. No synergistic bactericidal activity of sulopenem was apparent with serum complement. However, synergism of sulopenem with macrophages was prominent in bactericidal activity. The cells of E. coli were well phagocytosed and rapidly digested by cultured macrophages in the presence of a higher than 1/8 MIC of sulopenem. Moreover, sulopenem was more stable than imipenem against swine and human dehydropeptidase-Is. Sulopenem is one of the antibiotics that do not induce the appearance of subclones resistant to the drug.
TI  - Biotherapeutic agents. A neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and September 1995. Search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, Bifidobacterium, Candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. The bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. English-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. DATA SYNTHESIS: Placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (Lactobacillus caseiGG, bifidobacterium longum, B longum with L acidophilus, and Saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (Bifidobacterium bifidum with Streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile disease (S boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (Enterococcus faecium SF68, L caseiGG, and S boulardii). There is also evidence for Lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. Few adverse effects have been reported. However, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: There is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. In an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.
TI  - Two investigational glycylcyclines, DMG-DMDOT and DMG-MINO. Antimicrobial activity studies against gram-positive species.
AB  - DMG-DMDOT (CL-331,002 OR CL-331,928) and DMG-MINO (CL-329,998 or CL-344,677) are  two new semisynthetic tetracyclines called glycylcyclines, with a broad spectrum of activity and includes Enterobacteriaceae, Gram-positive cocci, JK diphtheroids, and Bacillus cereus. Potent activity was demonstrated against all Streptococcus spp. strains [minimum inhibitory concentrations] (MIC90S) 0.06-0.25 micrograms/ml) and staphylococci (oxacillin susceptible ans resistant; MIC90S 0.12-2 micrograms/ml). Both glycylcyclines (MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml) were more potent than minocycline (MIC90 8 micrograms/ml) against Enterococcus faecium, many of which were vancomycin resistant (116 strains). Organisms with minocycline MICs at > or = 8 micrograms/ml (Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and pneumococci) had glycylcycline MIC results ranging from 0.06 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (e.g., apparent use against existing tetracycline-resistance phenotypes). Drugs in this class appear promising for therapy of infections caused by Gram-positive species now testing resistant to contemporary antimicrobial agents, and further development of compounds in this class is encouraged.
TI  - [Gram-positive, catalase negative cocci isolated from clinical material--identification and drug sensitivity of strains].
AB  - 4608 clinical specimens (including 1641 samples of blood) for bacteriological examination were obtained from patients hospitalized in different wards of National Clinical Hospital No 1 in Warsaw. Strains were cultured, identified and their sensitivity to antibacterial drugs was determined during 14 months with the use of semi-automated API (ATB-plus) system (bioMerieux, France). Strains of Gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci were separated from all cultured strains. They belonged to the genera: Streptococcus, Enterococcus, Gemella, Aerococcus and Lactococcus (538 strains altogether). 238 Streptococcus spp. strains (44.2%) and 201 Enterococcus spp. strains (37.4%)were isolated from all specimens. The greatest number of catalase-negative cocci was obtained from wound smears -420 strains, which amounts to 78.2% of all strains. Among isolates dominated E. faecalis strains -104 (19.3%) and E. faecium strains - 70 (13.0% of all isolated strains). Vancomycin was the most effective antibacterial drug against gram-positive, catalase-negative cocci isolated from patients hospitalized in our hospital. Vancomycin-resistant strains constituted from 3% to 18% of strains depending on a species.
TI  - Emerging resistance in clinically important gram-positive cocci.
AB  - In the first half of the decade of the 1990s, we in the United States have seen the emergence and escalation of substantial antimicrobial resistance in medically important gram-positive cocci. The incidence of methicillin resistance of Staphylococcus aureus continues to increase (now 18%), resulting in many more isolates that are multiply resistant; all S aureus isolates are still susceptible to vancomycin. Enterococci, particularly Enterococcus faecium, have increasingly developed resistance to penicillin, gentamicin, streptomycin, and vancomycin (the last plasmid-mediated). More than a fourth of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains are now resistant to penicillin, and these strains tend to be multiply resistant, including to cephalosporins and macrolides.
TI  - Future prospects and therapeutic potential of streptogramins.
AB  - Dramatic changes in the epidemiology and susceptibility patterns of Gram-positive cocci during the last decade have mandated new approaches to the management of many bacterial infections. For example, there has been a sharp increase in the incidence of infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, particularly those resistant to methicillin (MRSA), and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly those associated with foreign bodies and indwelling medical devices. Additionally, the worldwide spread of Streptococcus pneumoniae strains resistant to penicillin and macrolides, and the emergence of enterococci (particularly Enterococcus faecium) resistant to vancomycin, teicoplanin and other antibiotics, present further therapeutic problems. New antibacterial agents are urgently required to meet the challenges posed by these epidemiological trends. The semisynthetic streptogramins, a unique class of antibacterials currently under development, offer promise in the treatment of such multiresistant infections. Possible future applications include treatment of infections caused by the following organisms: MRSA, enterococci resistant to vancomycin, macrolides or lincosamides; and beta-lactam-resistant streptococci. They may also prove useful as therapy for children with staphylococcal infection and patients with multiresistant infections who are unable to tolerate vancomycin, including patients with skin and soft tissue infections caused by Gram-positive pathogens, patients with osteomyelitis, foreign body associated infections, endocarditis and sepsis due to Gram-positive bacteria. Clinical trials are required to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of streptogramins in these settings.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in the 1990s.
AB  - Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. This chapter reviews the epidemiology of this resistance, its detection in the laboratory, the mechanisms of resistance, and the options for therapy and infection control.
TI  - Immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis caused by streptococci and enterococci.
AB  - AIM: To improve the diagnosis of culture negative endocarditis by diagnosing cases due to streptococci and enterococci. METHODS: Serum samples were immunoblotted against extracts of the commonest streptococci and enterococci. They were selected from patients with a cardiac murmur, persistent pyrexia and at least three negative blood cultures. The presence of patterns of endocarditis species specific antigenic bands was measured and correlated with clinical outcome. RESULTS: Negative serology was found in 28 patients where the diagnosis of endocarditis was rejected or, if proved, staphylococcal, yeast, Gram negative, systemic lupus erythematosus, due to Q fever or Chlamydia psittaci or nonbacterial thrombotic. Positive serology was found in 27 of the 34 patients where the response to antibiotics suggested streptococcal or enterococcal infection. In 22 of these there was objective evidence of endocarditis. Positive serology was also found in three of four further patients with vegetations at necropsy. CONCLUSION: The identification of patterns of antibody response on immunoblotting can be used to make a specific diagnosis of streptococcal or enterococcal endocarditis in the absence of positive blood cultures.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - [The end of antibiotics? Increasing bacterial resistance in global and Norwegian  perspective].
AB  - During the last 20 years there has emerged a growing world-wide problem with regard to multidrug-resistant microbes. The most serious examples so far are vancomycin-resistant strains of Enterococcus faecium, totally resistant isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and multiple-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. With the exception of some few strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, such bacteria have not been found in Norway. In this article we discuss possible ways of preventing further selection and spread of multiple-resistant microbes. We stress the importance of infection control programmes and restrictive use of antibiotics.
TI  - Activities of the semisynthetic glycopeptide LY191145 against vancomycin-resistant enterococci and other gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - LY191145 is the prototype of a series of compounds with activities against vancomycin-resistant enterococci derived by modification of the glycopeptide antibiotic LY264826. LY191145 had MICs for vancomycin- and teicoplanin-resistant enterococci of < or = 4 micrograms/ml for 50% of isolates and < or = 16 micrograms/ml for 90% of isolates. Its MICs for vancomycin-resistant, teicoplanin-susceptible enterococci were 1 to 8 micrograms/ml. LY191145 retains the potent activities of its parent compound against staphylococci and streptococci. In vivo studies in a mouse infection model confirmed these activities. This compound indicates the potential of semisynthetic glycopeptides as agents against antibiotic-resistant gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of CS-940, a new trifluorinated quinolone drug, was tested against 761 clinical isolates. CS-940 activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae was most similar to that of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, with a large range of MICs inhibiting 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 0.015 to 16 micrograms/ml (median MIC90, 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 had greater activity than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin when they were tested against Acinetobacter spp. (MIC90S, 0.03 micrograms/ml) and Stenotrophomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia (MIC90S, 2 micrograms/ml). CS-940 demonstrated a high degree of potency against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Neisseria spp. (MIC90S, < or = 0.06 micrograms/ml). CS-940 was two- to eightfold more active than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus spp. CS-940 was also very active against Streptococcus spp. and enterococci, for which MIC90S were < or = 2 micrograms/ml; for Enterococcus faecium, however, the MIC90 was 4 micrograms/ml. CS-940 was generally less active than a comparison investigational fluoroquinolone, clinafloxacin. This compound appears promising by in vitro test analysis and warrants further in vivo trials.
TI  - Antibacterial substance produced by Streptococcus faecium under anaerobic culture.
AB  - A facultative anaerobe isolated from Korean domestic soil produced an antibacterial substance under strict anaerobic conditions. Based on the morphological and biochemical tests, and cellular fatty acid profiles, the anaerobe was identified as Streptococcus faecium. An antimicrobial compound produced from the S. faecium was identified as 3,7,12-trihydroxy-24-cholanic acid methylester on the basis of its physico-chemical analysis. This substance had potent antibacterial activities against a test organism harboring multiple antibiotic resistance markers, and a variety of pathogenic bacteria. The isolated S. faecium produced lactic acid as well as the antibiotic compound under the anaerobic conditions.
TI  - Characterization of superoxide dismutase genes from gram-positive bacteria by polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers.
AB  - An internal fragment representing approximately 85% of sod genes from seven Gram-positive bacteria was amplified by using degenerate primers in a polymerase chain reaction assay. The DNA sequences of sod polymerase chain reaction products from Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactococcus lactis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes were determined. Comparisons of their deduced amino acid sequences with those of the corresponding regions of the SOD proteins from Bacillus stearothermophilus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Streptococcus mutans revealed strong relatedness. Phylogenetic analysis of SOD peptides showed that members of the genera Streptococcus and those of the genera Enterococcus constitute two well-supported monophyletic groups. The method described in this study provides a means for easy recovery of sod genes and the construction of sod mutants of various Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - Meropenem: a microbiological overview.
AB  - Meropenem is a parenteral carbapenem antibiotic which has excellent bactericidal  activity in vitro against almost all clinically significant aerobes and anaerobes. Its high activity is explained by ease of entry into bacteria combined with good affinity for essential penicillin binding proteins, including those associated with cell lysis. Breadth of spectrum is due, in part, to stability to all serine-based beta-lactamases, including those which hydrolyse third-generation cephalosporins. Meropenem has an antibacterial spectrum which is broadly similar to that of imipenem but, whilst slightly less active against staphylococci and enterococci, it is more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, all Enterobacteriaceae and Haemophilus influenzae. Amongst common human pathogens, only methicillin-resistant staphylococci and Enterococcus faecium are uniformly resistant to meropenem. The meropenem MICs for penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae are higher than for penicillin-susceptible strains but the organisms remain susceptible. Clinical susceptibility in vitro to meropenem is defined by MICs of < or = 4 mg/L, intermediate susceptibility by MICs of 8 mg/L and MICs of > or = 16 mg/L define resistance; equivalent figures for zones of growth inhibition are > or = 14 (susceptible), 12-13 (intermediate) and < or = 11 (resistant) mm. Studies in guinea pig models of systemic infection and infections localised to the lungs, urinary tract and the central nervous system, some of which used immunocompromised animals, confirm the potential of meropenem demonstrated in vitro. These factors, combined with the human plasma, tissue or urinary concentrations of meropenem which exceed modal MICs for the pathogens isolated in clinical trials for most or all of the recommended 8 h dosing interval, predict that meropenem should be efficacious in the treatment of infections at many body sites.
TI  - Native valve endocarditis due to nutritionally variant Streptococcus adjacens associated with Enterococcus faecium.
AB  
TI  - Anti-mutagenic and immuno-stimulatory properties of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Statistically significant antigenotoxic activity was exerted by six of nine strains of lactic acid bacteria tested (Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, Staphylococcus carnosus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L. rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium and En. faecalis) against nitrovin and 2-aminofluorene in Salmonella typhimurium TA100 and TA97. The mutagenic activity of both mutagens was substantially decreased by viable bacteria; cells heated to 100 degrees C for 15 min were ineffective. In vitro, En. faecium stimulated the basic metabolic activities of human neutrophils which were essential for their antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity, whereas stimulation of guinea-pig macrophages was not so effective. Similar immuno-stimulatory effects were observed with both viable and heat-inactivated bacteria.
TI  - Devitalization of bacterial and parasitic germs in sewage sludge during aerobic digestion under laboratory conditions.
AB  - The survival of 8 bacterial species (Pseudomonas sp., Salmonella sp., Enterobacteriae, Streptococcus sp., Escherichia coli) was detected in municipal sewage sludge up to 37 hours of mesophilic aerobic digestion under laboratory conditions. The model strain Enterococcus faecium CCM 4231 survived almost twice as long as the above-mentioned isolates. Similar findings, regarding the viability of the microorganisms studied, were also determined during thermophilic aerobic digestion of municipal sewage sludges. The final reduction in the total count of bacteria was not directly dependent on the temperature during aerobic digestion. It may be supposed that E. faecium CCM 4231 strain as a bacteriocin-producing strain with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, inoculated into the sludges, could inhibit the growth of microorganisms in the sludges by the way of its bacteriocin activity. Studying the effect of aerobic digestion on the viability of helminth eggs, the observed negative effect of higher temperatures was more expressive in comparison with bacterial strains. During thermophilic digestion process all helminth eggs (Ascaris suum, Toxocara canis) were devitalized. All eggs of T. canis were killed in experiments under mesophilic temperature. However, 32% of nonembryonated A. suum eggs remained viable.
TI  - Hypocholesterolaemic effect of a new fermented milk product in healthy middle-aged men.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: There are still controversies as to the potential beneficial effects of milk and fermented milk products on the level of lipoproteins. The objective of the present investigation was to test the effect of a moderate daily intake of a new fermented milk product, which was based on a bacterial culture obtained from the intestinal flora of inhabitants of Abkhasia, on the lipoprotein levels of a homogeneous group of middle-aged Danish men. DESIGN: The study was randomised, double-blind, and placebo-controlled, and the intervention was performed for a period of 6 weeks. SUBJECTS: Fifty-eight healthy, non-obese, normocholesterolaemic, male volunteers born in 1949 of Danish descent participated (i.e. all were 44 years old). INTERVENTIONS: During the intervention period the subjects' habitual diets were supplemented with 200 ml/day of either the new fermented milk product or a placebo product (chemically fermented). The biologically fermented milk product contained Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Streptococcus termophilus. Fasting blood samples were drawn initially and after 3 and 6 weeks and analysed for plasma values of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride. In addition, LDL-cholesterol was estimated. RESULTS: After these 6 weeks total cholesterol was reduced significantly in the group given biologically fermented milk (-0.37 mmol/l, confidence interval: -0.51 to -0.23) while no changes were observed in the placebo group (-0.02 mmol/l) (P < 0.01). This reduction in total cholesterol could be completely ascribed to a fall in LDL-cholesterol by 10% (i.e. -0.42 mmol/l) since HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride were unchanged in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, this short-term study (6 weeks) demonstrated an LDL-cholesterol-lowering effect (10% reduction) of a new fermented milk product in middle-aged Danish men.
TI  - Mixed meningitis: association of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var lwoffi and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - We describe mixed bacterial meningitis in a young man due to Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var lwoffi and Streptococcus faecium. The combination of A calcoaceticus var lwoffi and S faecium as aetiology of mixed bacterial meningitis has not been previously reported. The patient recovered completely without neurologic sequelae on chloramphenicol and penicillin.
TI  - Survival of streptococcus in optisol-GS medium.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Donor cornea contamination as a cause of endophthalmitis is one of the most serious complications of penetrating keratoplasty. Optisol-GS corneal storage medium with the combination of gentamicin and streptomycin was designed to provide wider antibiotic coverage, most notably against streptococcal species. However, many enterococci are resistant to streptomycin and genta micin. METHODS/RESULTS: We report a case in which Enterococcus faecium was isolated from cultures of the donor limbus prior to corneal excision and again from preoperative cultures of the donor corneal rim despite 5 days of preservation in Optisol-GS. The isolate was found to be resistant to both gentamicin and streptomycin. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the need to raise awareness that streptococcus can remain a viable contaminant of donor corneas despite storage in Optisol-GS medium.
TI  - Efficacies of ABT-719 and related 2-pyridones, members of a new class of antibacterial agents, against experimental bacterial infections.
AB  - The 2-pyridones are a new class of broad-spectrum orally bioavailable antibacterial agents. These compounds are potent bacterial DNA gyrase inhibitors which differ from fluoroquinolones by placement of the nitrogen atom in the ring juncture. ABT-719 is an S isomer and a representative 2-pyridone. ABT-719 administered orally or subcutaneously was 4- to 10-fold more effective than ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes infections in normal mice. ABT-719 was equivalent in efficacy to ciprofloxacin for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Escherichia coli. The racemate and R forms of ABT-719 produced similar results against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections. The 50% effective doses of ABT-719 were at least threefold lower than those of ciprofloxacin for therapy of intracellular infections caused by Salmonella typhimurium or Listeria monocytogenes. In immunosuppressed mice, ABT-719 was more effective than ciprofloxacin against quinolone-sensitive S. aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium. The pharmacokinetic properties of ABT-719 were consistent with its relative efficacy. The 2-pyridones are potent, orally available antibacterial agents with efficacy against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections in mice.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotics are commonly viewed as the most important advance in the history of medicine. During the six decades that followed the introduction of sulfonamides there has been a continuous supply of new agents responsive to evolving resistance of prior pathogens and emerging new pathogens. It now appears that the microbes confronting clinicians in the 1990s pose challenges that are unprecedented in the recent past. There are examples in virtually every category: malaria, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli, azole-resistant Candida species, and metronidazole-resistant Trichomonas. The two pathogens that are arguably the most important to otolaryngologists are vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae. The former is a nosocomially acquired pathogen that is especially prevalent in intensive care units and usually cannot be treated with antibiotics that have established merit. Penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae is suddenly becoming a major problem in much of the world and its frequency in the United States is escalating at an alarming rate, especially in some geographic areas. This organism will require entirely new strategies for the empiric treatment of serious infections in which S pneumoniae is a documented or suspected pathogen. It is premature to say that traditional approaches to sinusitis and otitis need to be changed, but many suspect this will happen. One important lesson from this experience is that extensive antibiotic use and abuse has had some devastating consequences and many now believe that these are inevitable given current usage rates. The second lesson is that, although resistance seems predictable, specific patterns are not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - [Nationwide survey on susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents in 1991].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical isolates to  different antibacterial agents at 123 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1991. In this study, identifications and susceptibility testings were carried out at each hospital laboratory. The susceptibility testing were performed using the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS. Staphylococcus aureus and CNS showed high or moderate resistance rates to methicillin (DMPPC). Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Proteus mirabilis were highly susceptible to many agents including beta-lactam antibiotics. Though Enterococcus faecalis was highly susceptible to ampicillin (ABPC), piperacillin (PIPC), imipenem (IPM), sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (ST) compounds, Enterococcus faecium was resistant to almost all antibacterial agents but to ST compounds. High susceptibility rates were observed for strains of Enterobacter cloacae to IPM, gentamicin (GM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) and for strains of Proteus vulgaris to latamoxef (LMOX), IPM, aztreonam (AZT), GM and OFLX. Serratia marcescens and Bacteroides fragilis group were highly susceptible only to IPM. Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime (CAZ), IPM, amikacin (AMK) and tobramycin (TOB). Pseudomonas cepacia was relatively susceptible only to CAZ. IPM showed strong antibacterial activity to many species except for S. aureus and CNS.
TI  - In vitro activity of RP 59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin) against antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci.
AB  - The activity of RP 59500 (quinupristin/dalfopristin) was evaluated in vitro against antibiotic-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (N = 15) and Enterococcus spp. (N = 43). By broth dilution MIC tests RP 59500 was highly active against penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, but showed poor activity against E. faecalis. In time-kill studies the drug was rapidly bactericidal against S. pneumoniae but failed to kill most enterococci, even in the presence of gentamicin or human serum.
TI  - [The present and future problems of resistance in staphylococci, streptococci and M. tuberculosis].
AB  - Mechanisms of resistance of strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Neisseria meningitidis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to antibiotics are presented and discussed. The resistance to methicillin-oxacillin in S. aureus and S. epidermidis is chromosomally-mediated by sequence of DNA, namely by gene mecA. This gene codes altered PBP-2A protein. Strains of S.pneumoniae contain PBP-1A, PBP-2B and PBP-2X proteins. They cause resistance to many beta-lactam antibiotics. Resistance to vankomycin, respectively to teikoplanin in strains of E. faecalis and E. faecium is coded by transferable vanA and vanB genes. Strains of N. meningitidis produce mostly the altered PBP-2 protein. The increase of resistance in strains of M. tuberculosis is also significant.
TI  - Survey of urease activity in ruminal bacteria isolated from domestic and wild ruminants.
AB  - A total of 909 strains, including Selenomonas ruminantium, Lactobacillus sp., Enterococcus sp. and Staphylococcus sp., from the rumen of 104 domestic and wild ruminants was used in tests for urease activity. Tests showed that 56.7% of S. ruminantium strains and 18.5% of lactobacilli manifested medium urease activity with mean values of 14.4 +/- 2.5 and 13.85 +/- 0.25 nkat ml-1, respectively. Most of the Enterococcus faecium (62.2%) and all of the E. faecalis isolates expressed urease activity with mean values of 3.9 +/- 0.05 and 4.1 +/- 0.06 nkat ml-1. E. malodoratus, E. solitarius, E. mundtii, Streptococcus bovis and S. uberis did not produce any urease. All the staphylococci screened were urease-producing strains, mostly with medium or low urease activity. The highest level of urease was measured in the rumen epithelial wall of isolates SE30 (19.7 +/- 2.71 nkat ml-1 of rumen content), SCU32 (29.3 +/- 1.6 nkat ml-1) and also in the rumen content isolates EF35 (19.9 +/- 0.94 nkat ml-1) and S. ruminantium 77 (25.35 nkat ml-1). This survey contributes new data to existing information relating to the ureolytic microbial ecosystem in ruminants.
TI  - Everninomicin, a new oligosaccharide antibiotic: its antimicrobial activity, post-antibiotic effect and synergistic bactericidal activity.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of everninomicin (SCH) 27899) in comparison with two glycopeptides (vancomycin, teicoplanin) and six beta-lactam agents was evaluated against recent clinical isolates of Gram-positive bacteria. Everninomicin showed the highest activity against the species tested and MICs90% of everninomicin against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Clostridium difficile were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, 0.39, 0.1 microgram/ml, respectively. MICs90% of everninomicin against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) were 0.78 microgram/ml. Laboratory induced resistance to everninomicin in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis occurred in a stepwise manner and at a very slow rate. Post-antibiotic effect against strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis were 1.8 and 2.6 h, respectively, and a little longer than that of vancomycin. Adherence to glass surface of an MRSA strain was strongly repressed by the addition of sub MIC of everninomicin in combination with fosfomycin.
TI  - Use of cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar for selective isolation of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Cephalexin-aztreonam-arabinose agar (CAA), a new selective agar, was examined in  comparison with nalidixic acid-colistin agar for the differentiation of Enterococcus faecium from other enterococci and the ability to isolate the organism from feces. Two hundred sixteen enterococcus isolates and a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative control strains were inoculated onto both media. All control strains of E. faecium were easily differentiated from Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus durans on the basis of arabinose fermentation on CAA. Differentiation of E. faecium from other enterococci or Streptococcus bovis was not possible on nalidixic acid-colistin agar. Increased isolation of E. faecium was demonstrated on CAA when both media were compared for the isolation of the organism from feces. CAA has been shown to possess excellent differential and selective features allowing the simple and effective isolation of E. faecium from heavily contaminated sites.
TI  - Characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented Greek  dry salami.
AB  - A total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. The majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus Weissella (120), which was recently proposed (Collins et al., 1993) to include Leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. Meat streptobacteria were identified as Lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and L. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable and, thus designated L. sake/curvatus. Non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as L. plantarum (34 strains), L. farciminis (10), L. coryniformis (1) and L. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). The majority of the Weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as W. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described W. hellenica (Collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled W. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. The latter group comprised strains that produced D(L)-lactate. The remaining Weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to W. minor (31) and W. halotolerans (3). Other species identified were Enterococcus faecium (10), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), L. brevis (1) and Pediococcus sp. (1). The main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.
TI  - Heterogeneric conjugal transfer of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pIP964 (IncHlyI) of Enterococcus faecalis in the apparent absence of pheromone induction.
AB  - Erythromycin-resistant derivatives of the pheromone-responsive plasmid pIP964 from Enterococcus faecalis were constructed to study its host range. This was done by inserting the integrative vector pAT112 and the related replicon pTCR1 harboring oriR of the broad host range plasmid pAM beta 1 into the hemolysin-bacteriocin operon of pIP964, to give pTCR2 and pTCR3, respectively. Plasmid pTCR2 was transferred by filter matings from E. faecalis to Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes at frequencies of 2 x 10(-7) and 5 x 10(-7) per donor, respectively, in the apparent absence of pheromone induction and cellular aggregation. In these hosts, pTCR2 remained intact as a self-replicating element and maintained its transfer capabilities. Plasmid pTCR3, but not pTCR2, was transferred at similar frequencies from E. faecalis to Lactococcus lactis and Streptococcus agalactiae. Thus, the transfer system of pIP964 possesses a broader host-range than its replication system.
TI  - Resistant gram-positive organisms.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance in Gram-positive bacteria has reemerged in the last decade as a major clinical problem. Methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and enterococci resistant to penicillin, vancomycin, and/or gentamicin have become new considerations in the selection of therapy. Both mutation and acquisition of new DNA on either the chromosome or plasmids can be responsible for resistance in Gram-positive species. Because therapies are often limited, renewed efforts are needed to understand the epidemiology in order to effect control.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity and beta-lactamase stability of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of SY5555, a new oral penem antibiotic, was compared with those of cefaclor, cefixime, and cefteram. SY5555 was more active than the comparison agents against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Clostridium spp., and Bacteroides fragilis. Against Providencia spp., Proteus spp., and Haemophilus influenzae, SY5555 was less active than cefixime or cefteram. SY5555 was inactive against methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Enterococcus faecium, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Xanthomonas maltophilia, as were the comparison agents. The bactericidal activities of SY5555, cefixime, and cefteram were at or slightly greater than the MICs for clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. SY5555 was not hydrolyzed by various types of beta-lactamases. However, SY5555 and the comparison agents were hydrolyzed by X. maltophilia (L-1) and P. aeruginosa/pMS354 beta-lactamases, two Bush group 3 beta-lactamases, SY5555 showed a high affinity, as did cefixime and cefteram, for cephalosporinases from C. freundii GN7391 and E. cloacae GN7471 strains. These results suggest that SY5555 may be more specific than existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
TI  - Prevalence of important pathogens and antimicrobial activity of parenteral drugs  at numerous medical centers in the United States, I. Study on the threat of emerging resistances: real or perceived? Fluoroquinolone Resistance Surveillance Group.
AB  - Forty-three medical centers participated in a national (United States) surveillance study of parenteral antimicrobial agents as empiric therapy of pathogens isolated from blood, skin wounds, respiratory tract, and urine (> 8500 strains, 200 per laboratory). All laboratories tested each organism by the same reagent disks and/or Etest (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) strips. Quality control results validated all laboratories for analyses. The most common isolates were Escherichia coli (1648), Staphylococcus aureus (1408), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1003), Klebsiella species (792), and the enterococci (684). Among the tested drugs the percent susceptible rates observed were ofloxacin (83.4%), ciprofloxacin (82.0%), and cefuroxime (62.9%) tested against all organisms; cefazolin (54.7%) and ceftazidime (76.7%) tested against all nonfastidious aerobes; gentamicin (91.2%), imipenem (95.3%), ticarcillin-clavulanate (78.2%), and ceftriaxone (66.2%) tested against Gram-negative organisms only; and vancomycin (97.9%) and erythromycin (49.2%) tested against Gram-positive aerobes. Several drug-resistant species appear to be emerging or increasing in the United States: (a) vancomycin-resistant enterococci (7.9%, mostly Enterococcus faecium); (b) oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (21.0%); (c) third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, including E. coli and Klebsiella species with extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (approximately 1.3%-8.6%); (d) penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (17.8%); and (e) ciprofloxacin-resistant P. aeruginosa (14.9%). Fluoroquinolone resistance among the enteric bacilli was confirmed in 60 of 66 referred strains (0.8% of total strains), and cross-resistance was high among ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin, fleroxacin, and norfloxacin (98.3%-100%). Seventeen strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant enteric bacilli (0.2% of total) also harbored an ESBL and resistance to aminoglycosides. Clonal spread within medical centers was observed with the ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. This national clinical isolate data base continues to demonstrate broad fluoroquinolone efficacy (ofloxacin > ciprofloxacin) against hospital-based pathogens and many strains of emerging resistant bacteria. Continued US surveillance studies are urged to monitor emerging antimicrobial resistance and to guide interventions to minimize its occurrence.
TI  - [Method of DNA extraction and mecA, femA and PBP2' in multi-drug resistant bacterial strains].
AB  - Recently, it has become more important to establish rapid and reliable methods for identifying bacterial species and their drug resistances because of the high incidence of nosocomial infection caused by multi-drug resistant bacteria. At first, several enzymes were tested to evaluate the efficacy of DNA extraction. N-acetylmuramidase, lysozyme and achromopeptidase were most effective to extract DNA from E. faecalis, E. faecium and S. aureus, respectively. After achromopeptidase extraction, the mecA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in clinically isolated MRSA (95 strains), MSSA (66), MRSE (methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis, 37), MSSE (methicillin-sensitive S. epidermidis, 1), S haemolyticus(5), S.hominis(1) and others (Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus, total 45). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. The positive rates were 95% (MRSA), 1.5% (MSSA), and 97% (MRSE). The mecA gene was also positive in 2/2 of methicillin-resistant S.haemolyticus and 2/3 of methicillin-sensitive S.haemolyticus and 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.hominis. The mecA gene was not detected in 45 non-Staphylococcal strains. MecA and femA gene by PCR and PBP 2' by IRMA were further detected in newly isolated MRSA (20 strains), MSSA(20), MRSE(14), MSSE(1) and S.simulans(2). Complete correlation between MPIPC susceptibility and mecA were found. The femA gene was positive in 39/40 of S. aureus, and 0/14 of S.epidermidis, 2/3 of S.simulans. PBP2' were positive in 20/20 of MRSA, 0/20 of MSSA, 14/14 of MRSE, 0/1 of MSSE, 1/1 of methicillin-resistant S.simulans, and 0/2 of methicillin-sensitive S.simulans. In conclusion, diagnoses of MRSA by simultaneous detection of mecA and femA gene as well as PBP2' are similarly useful because of their specificity and rapidity.
TI  - Identification and composition of the streptococcal and enterococcal flora of tonsils, intestines and faeces of pigs.
AB  - Streptococcus suis was the most frequent Streptococcus spp. in pig tonsils, followed by the beta-haemolytic porcine 'equisimilis' ecovar of Strep. dysgalactiae. The intestinal streptococcal flora was composed of Strep. bovis, Strep. hyointestinalis and Strep. suis. Many of these intestinal Strep. suis belonged to a beta-glucuronidase-negative biotype which is infrequent in lesions. Nearly half of the strains presumptively identified as Strep. alactolyticus produced acid from lactose. This species was not found in tonsils and intestines but was about equally prevalent as Strep. hyointestinalis in pig faeces and rectal swabs. Other streptococci were rare in this material. Enterococci were much less frequently identified than streptococci in tonsils and faeces. In intestinal samples Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Ent. hirae and Ent. cecorum were most frequently found. In faeces Ent. faecium was the most prevalent enterococcus. The characteristics of the less well known species Strep. alactolyticus and Strep. hyointestinalis are described in detail, and guidelines for their differentiation from Strep. bovis and Strep. suis given.
TI  - Gram-positive cocci isolated from slaughtered poultry.
AB  - Gram-positive cocci were found in all meat samples of poultry slaughtered and processed for retail sale, at incidence rates ranging from 10(2) CFU/ml to 1.35 x 10(6) CFU/ml and a mode between 8 x 10(5) and 9 x 10(5) CFU/ml for 75% of the samples. The 93 isolated strains were identified as belonging to the following species: Enterococcus faecalis (48 strains), E. faecium (16), E. avium (7), E. durans (4), Aerococcus viridans (10), Streptococcus morbillorum (2), S. salivarius (1), S. sanguis (1), S. "milleri" (1), S. pneumoniae (1), S. acidominimus (1), and Gemella haemolysans (1). These species, which mainly colonize the intestinal tract, but may also be found in other parts of both the human and animal body, are pathogens or potentially such. Their presence is an indication of the fecal contamination of meat processed following gutting of slaughtered chickens (endogenous contamination). A count of the Gram-positive cocci and enterobacteria detected showed that enterococci were present in a far greater number than coliform bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activities of two glycylcyclines.
AB  - The in vitro activities of two glycylcyclines, CL 329,998 and CL 331,002 (two new semisynthetic tetracyclines), were evaluated in comparison with those of tetracycline and other available oral antimicrobial agents. A total of 523 recent clinical isolates were studied, including strains resistant to tetracycline. Members of the family Enterobacteriaceae were generally > or = 16-fold more susceptible to the glycylcyclines than to tetracycline (although less difference was seen with Proteus spp.). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was modestly susceptible to both new compounds (MIC for 90% of strains tested [MIC90], 16 micrograms/ml). Tetracycline- and methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus were all susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 1 microgram/ml). Streptococci (including Streptococcus pneumoniae) and Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium displayed a bimodal distribution of susceptibility to tetracycline yet were uniformly susceptible to the glycylcyclines (MIC90 < or = 0.25 microgram/ml). The glycylcyclines were highly potent against Neisseria, Moraxella, Haemophilus, and Bacteroides spp. (MIC90 < or = 0.5 microgram/ml). Strains of Chlamydia spp. (three C. trachomatis strains and one C. pneumoniae strain) were inhibited by < or = 0.25 microgram of CL 329,998 or CL 331,002 per ml. Two strains of Mycoplasma pneumoniae were inhibited by < or = 0.12 microgram of CL 331,002 per ml and by 1 microgram of CL 329,998 per ml. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium avium were resistant to the two glycylcyclines (MIC > or = 8 micrograms/ml). These results indicate that the two glycylcyclines have potent in vitro activities against a wide range of clinically important pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Antilisterial activity by enterococci in a model predicting the temperature evolution of Taleggio, an Italian soft cheese.
AB  - Enterococcus ssp. produced broad-spectrum bacteriocins, which were active against Listeria innocua and Listeria monocytogenes. Inhibition of L. innocua in milk by different starter cultures was evaluated. Milk was inoculated with a conventional starter (Streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus mixed cultures) as a sole starter or in combination with inhibitory starter cultures (Enterococcus ssp., bacteriocin-producing strains). Tests were performed under a temperature gradient that reproduced the first 55 h of Taleggio cheese manufacturing and in the presence of rennet. Results indicated that satisfactory inhibition of L. innocua was linked to the combined synergistic antimicrobial effect of pH decrease and bacteriocin production. Overall, data suggested that a potential existed for use of the antagonistic activity from enterococci for protection of Taleggio cheese during ripening, when L. monocytogenes may often reach dangerous concentrations.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. Human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. Measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. Two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of Enterococcus faecium and Bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bif. bifidum, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). Together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). Microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. However, the test preparation containing Ent. faecium and Bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (P = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (P < 0.02). This study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
TI  - Endocarditis due to high level gentamicin resistant Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - We describe the first reported case in the literature of bacterial endocarditis caused by Enterococcus faecium that was highly resistant to gentamicin. The case is unusual in that it followed a successfully treated Streptococcus sanguis endocarditis. The micro-organism was susceptible only to the glycopeptide antibiotics, vancomycin and teicoplanin and to agents such as pristinamycin and daptomycin which are not routinely available for treatment. It illustrates the therapeutic dilemma posed by serious infections with such micro-organisms and supports previous observations that early heart valve replacement surgery may be necessary to achieve cure of endocarditis due to enterococci which are highly resistant to gentamicin. It further emphasises the importance of screening for high-level aminoglycoside resistance in enterococci in all life threatening enterococcal infections, including endocarditis, septicaemia and meningitis when aminoglycoside-penicillin synergy is required for successful treatment.
TI  - Crystallization, characterization and preliminary crystallographic studies of carbamate kinase of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Crystals of carbamate kinase (E.C.2.7.2.2) suitable for high resolution studies have been obtained, using the hanging drop vapour diffusion technique, with polyethylene glycol 8000 and NaCl as precipitants at pH 6.5 and a temperature of 4 degrees C. Crystals of about 0.3 mm x 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm in size diffract to at least 3.2 A resolution and are stable to X-radiation for more than ten hours. The space group is P2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit cell dimensions a = 84.5 A, b = 99.6 A, c = 173.3 A. Density packing considerations are consistent with the presence of four to five monomers (M(r) of the monomer = 33,000) in the asymmetric unit, two dimers or even a tetramer being favoured by the results of cross-linking experiments of the enzyme in solution.
TI  - Conjugative transfer of tetracycline resistance in rumen streptococcal strains.
AB  - In 11% of tested Streptococcus bovis strains a conjugative transfer of tetracycline resistance was observed when mating experiments were carried out on membrane filters. The recipient strain used was S. bovis BM114 with chromosomal resistance to rifampicin. In addition, in two strains tetracycline resistance was transferred also to recipient strain Enterococcus faecium AL6. The transfer frequencies were in the range of 10(-6) to 10(-3). The donor strains were screened for the presence of plasmids and one up to four bands of plasmid DNA in all tested strains were revealed. In spite of that isolation of plasmid DNA was successful only in 53/4/114 transconjugants. Transconjugant 32/114 contained amylase activity which was higher than in the donor strain.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activities of broad spectrum quinolones against clinical  bacterial isolates].
AB  - In vitro activities of broad-spectrum quinolones (sparfloxacin (SPFX), ciprofloxacin (CPFX), lomefloxacin (LFLX), fleroxacin (FLRX), and levofloxacin (LVFX) were examined against clinical bacterial isolates: Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella subgenus Branhamella catarrhalis, Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus pneumoniae). Antibacterial activities of SPFX, CPFX, and LVFX against Gram-negative bacteria such as K. pneumoniae, M. (B) catarrhalis and H. influenzae were better than those of FLRX and LFLX. SPFX showed the highest activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested in this study. However, strains showed high MIC (> or = 16 micrograms/ml) to SPFX were found among MRSA, E. faecalis, and E. faecium, whose isolation frequencies were 28.6%, 10.0%, and 6.7%, respectively. The results of this study suggest that resistant strains of Gram-positive bacteria against new quinolone might increase among clinical isolates.
TI  - Potentiation of antibiotic activity by EDTA-tromethamine against three clinically isolated gram-positive resistant bacteria. An in vitro investigation.
AB  - The in vitro synergistic effects of combinations of EDTA-tromethamine and five antimicrobial agents (ampicillin, cephalexin, oxytetracycline, streptomycin and sulphadimethoxine) on three clinically isolated Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and Streptococcus faecium) were investigated. The bacteria had been isolated from three cases of canine otitis resistant to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by measuring the minimal inhibitory concentration for the antibiotics alone or in combination with EDTA-tromethamine. EDTA-tromethamine potentiated the activity of cefalexin against S. aureus and S. hominis, of oxytetracycline against S. aureus and S. faecium and of streptomycin against S. faecium. No significant effects were noted on the activity of oxytetracycline against S. hominis. The remaining combinations gave a slight synergistic effect. As previously shown for Gram-negative resistant bacteria, these data suggest that the association of EDTA-tromethamine and appropriate antibiotic therapy may be useful to overcome persistent infections of soft tissues in domestic animals.
TI  - Chromosomally mediated high-level gentamicin resistance in Streptococcus mitis.
AB  - Four blood culture isolates of Streptococcus mitis were found to be resistant to  penicillin (MIC, 16 to 32 micrograms/ml) and gentamicin (MIC, 128 or 1,000 micrograms/ml), and the two antibiotics demonstrated a lack of in vitro synergy. As shown by polymerase chain reaction assays, the structural gene known to encode high-level gentamicin resistance in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae was also present in all four S. mitis strains. Attempts to isolate plasmids were unsuccessful, but an oligonucleotide probe derived from the gentamicin resistance gene hybridized to distinct restriction fragments of genomic DNA, suggesting that the resistance genes in these strains are integrated into the bacterial chromosome.
TI  - Study of heterogeneity of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) genes in streptococci and enterococci by polymerase chain reaction: characterization of a new CAT determinant.
AB  - An assay based on the utilization of degenerate primers that enable enzymatic amplification of an internal fragment of cat genes known to be present in gram-positive cocci was developed to identify the genes encoding chloramphenicol resistance in streptococci and enterococci. The functionality of this system was illustrated by the detection of cat genes belonging to four different hydridization classes represented by the staphylococcal genes catpC221, catpC194, catpSCS7, and the clostridial gene catP, and by the characterization of a new streptococcal cat gene designated catS. A sequence related to the clostridial catQ gene, which was present in one streptococcal strain, was not detected by this assay. These results reveal that these six cat genes account for chromosomal-borne chloramphenicol resistance in 12 group A, B, and G streptococci tested. By contrast, only three of these six cat genes (catpC221, catpC194, and catpSCS7) were detected on the 10 enterococcal plasmids studied here that encode resistance to chloramphenicol.
TI  - Effect of extracellularly generated singlet oxygen on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - In the separated surface-sensitizer system, a photosensitizer is physically separated from the substrate by a thin air layer under such conditions that only singlet oxygen can reach and oxidize the substrate, preventing the competition by type I photosensitized processes. This method has been used to study the reaction of singlet oxygen with Gram-positive (Streptococcus faecium) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) bacterial strains. Studies on cell samples exposed to singlet oxygen for different periods of time show a drastic decrease in survival for S. faecium, while E. coli becomes sensitive only when the integrity of the outer membrane is altered by treatment with CaCl2 or tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Tris-EDTA). Biochemical and ultrastructural analyses suggest that the cytoplasmic membrane and the genetic material are the main sites damaged by singlet oxygen.
TI  - [Regulation of enzymes of the first and last stage of lysine biosynthesis in Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium].
AB  - Regulation of aspartate kinase and diaminopimelate decarboxylase activities in Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium cell-free extracts was studied. The levels of synthesis of aspartate kinase and diaminopimelate decarboxylase in both microorganisms are growth-dependent. The synthesis of these enzymes is depressed by lysine, but the activity of aspartate kinase is induced by addition of this amino acid and threonine to the reaction system. Meso-diaminopimelate dehydrogenase activity was not found in the extracts of Streptococcus bovis and Enterococcus faecium. The data excludes the possibility of lysine formation via six enzyme reactions.
TI  - Multicentre survey of the comparative in-vitro activity of piperacillin/tazobactam against bacteria from hospitalized patients in the British Isles.
AB  - Twenty-nine British and Irish hospitals each collected up to 300 bacterial isolates from in-patients. The organisms were identified by an appropriate API system or, for staphylococci, by their Gram and coagulase reactions. Disc susceptibility tests were performed. Isolates that gave zones < or = 25 mm to piperacillin/tazobactam (75 micrograms + 10 micrograms) discs were sent to a central laboratory for re-examination and determination of MIC, together with a sample of the more susceptible organisms. Results were evaluated for 6724 isolates. Over 95% of the isolates of Escherichia coli, klebsiellae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus, Moraxella and Bacteriodes, spp. streptococci, pneumococci and Enterococcus faecalis were susceptible to piperacillin/tazobactam (defined as giving a zone > or = 22 mm to a 75 micrograms + 10 micrograms disc), as were 86% of Acinetobacter spp. and 82% of the Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Morganella and Serratia group. Tazobactam particularly extended the activity of piperacillin against E. coli isolates (96% susceptible cf. 61% to piperacillin alone) klebsiellae (95% cf. 70%), P. mirabilis (99% cf. 86%), and Acinetobacter spp. (86% cf. 53%). Occasional (18%) resistance in Enterobacter, Serratia and Citrobacger spp. was probably caused by stable depression of Class I beta-lactamases, which are inhibited poorly by tazobactam. High resistance frequencies (> 25%) were found for Enterococcus faecium and Xanthomonas maltophilia. Tazobactam potentiated piperacillin against beta-lactamase-producing methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, but the mode inhibition zone of piperacillin/tazobactam discs was only 26 mm, compared to 38 mm for beta-lactamase-negative isolates. Nevertheless, fewer than 5% of the enzyme producers appeared resistant to 8 + 4 mg/L piperacillin/tazobactam in MIC tests. Similar behaviour was noted for coagulase-negative staphylococci. Amongst the eleven comparator drugs, ceftazidime, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were as active as piperacillin/tazobactam against most enterobacteria. However, Acinetobacter and Bacteroides spp. and enterococci were resistant to ceftazidime, and Bacteroides spp., enterococci, pneumococci and other streptococci were inherently resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. Cefuroxime, ampicillin and co-amoxiclav had narrower spectra. Only imipenem showed a consistently wider spectrum and lower frequency of resistance than piperacillin/tazobactam.
TI  - Characterization of bacteriocins from Enterococcus faecium with activity against  Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Laboratory cultures and environmental isolates of bacteria were screened for antagonism towards Listeria monocytogenes using an agar spot test. Seven of the 163 strains that were tested, one Streptococcus bovis, one Enterococcus casseliflavus, two E. avium and three E. faecium, consistently displayed antilisterial activity. Cell-free, pH-neutralized supernatants prepared from the three E. faecium strains (JBL1061, JBL1083 and JBL1351) exhibited strong antilisterial activity against L. monocytogenes, and were subjected to more detailed analyses. The antagonistic factors produced by these three strains were sensitive to chloroform and several proteolytic enzymes, resistant to heat (121 degrees C, 20 min), and stable over a wide pH range (3.0-10.0). Moreover, they were listericidal without causing cell lysis. These data suggest that a bacteriocin(s) is involved in the inhibition of L. monocytogenes by E. faecium JBL1061, JBL1083 and JBL1351.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of CP-99433 compared with other fluoroquinolones.
AB  - CP-99433 is a new C-7 diazabicyclofluoroquinolone with a broad spectrum of activity that includes Enterobacteriaceae, Gram-positive cocci, and nonenteric Gram-negative bacilli. Potent activity was demonstrated against Pseudomonas aeruginosa [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), Xanthomonas maltophilia (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml), and all Streptococcus species (MIC90s, 0.25-1 microgram/ml). Only CP-99433 was active against Enterococcus faecium (MIC50, 2 micrograms/ml). CP-99433 also demonstrated activity against several ciprofloxacin-resistant staphylococci. Additional studies of CP-99433 activity appear indicated.
TI  - Presumptive fecal streptococci in environmental samples characterized by one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
AB  - The use of fecal streptococci as fecal indicators requires better knowledge of the ecology of these bacteria. We isolated 371 presumptive fecal streptococci from environmental samples--domestic wastewater, forest industry wastewater, contaminated surface and seawater, well water, cow dung, bird droppings, and pristine waters--and clustered them according to their protein profiles in one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Some clusters could be tentatively identified with the help of reference strains. Samples from each environment had a typical composition of streptococcus types. Enterococcus faecalis was present, but not as a dominating enterococcal species, in samples in which fecal contamination was probable. Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus hirae, and Enterococcus mundtii had protein profiles that were difficult to distinguish from each other. These bacteria were found in a variety of samples. Enterococcus casseliflavus and Enterococcus gallinarum had identical protein profiles. On the basis of the maximum temperatures for growth and pigment production, isolates of this protein profile group common in forest industry wastewaters were identified as E. casseliflavus. Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis was also found in this environment. Nearly all strains from pristine waters belonged to protein profile groups which could not be identified with the aid of known Aerococcus, Enterococcus, Lactococcus, or Streptococcus strains. The maximum temperatures for growth and the results of fatty acid analysis were in general agreement within each protein profile group.
TI  - The microbiologic aspects, including diagnosis, of beta-hemolytic streptococcal and enterococcal infections.
AB  - Basic principles concerning the collection, transport, and processing of clinical specimens for the detection of Streptococcaceae are given. Identification of beta-hemolytic streptococci (S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, Lancefield group C and G streptococci, S. anginosus) and enterococci is based on the careful observation of colony morphology and hemolytic pattern on sheep blood agar plates; subsequent genus or species confirmation is achieved by rather simple biochemical or enzymatic tests and by detection of streptococcal cell wall carbohydrate antigens (Lancefield grouping). Rapid antigen tests for the detection of group A and B streptococci directly from pharyngeal and vaginal swabs, respectively, are highly specific, thus allowing an immediate antibiotic therapy in patients with a positive test result. The reported sensitivities of these nonculture tests are too low to exclude streptococcal colonization or infection, however. The elucidation of the genetics of some major virulence factors of group A and B streptococci has contributed to knowledge of their association with disease, and molecular techniques have supplemented the traditional (mostly culture and serologic) methods for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of streptococcal infections. Recently employed examples include the M protein gene typing of group A streptococci by oligonucleotide probes and the use of PCR assays for the detection of the genes encoding for the pyrogenic exotoxins. Restriction enzyme endonuclease digestions of bacterial DNA in association with DNA fragment separation by conventional or PFGE have been applied successfully to several species of Streptococcaceae (e.g., S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae). Enterococci are important pathogens in the hospital setting, exhibiting high morbidity and mortality rates in bacteremic patients with severe underlying disease. Molecular typing methods have clearly confirmed their potential to be nosocomially transmitted. E. faecalis and E. faecium still account for the majority of human infections, but some of the newer enterococcal species (at present 19 species are recognized) have been encountered as well. The definitive species identification of enterococci requires the performance of an array of biochemical tests. The increasing antimicrobial resistance of enterococci, including high-level resistance to penicillins and aminoglycosides and occasionally also to glycopeptides, has hampered standard therapeutic regimens. All enterococci isolated from serious infections should be tested for high-level gentamicin and streptomycin resistance by one of several methods evaluated; beta-lactamase production (primarily found in E. faecalis) is reliably detected by the nitrocefin test.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Antimicrobial activities of aspoxicillin of fresh clinical isolates].
AB  - The Antimicrobial activity of aspoxicillin (ASPC) in terms of minimum inhibitory  concentration (MICs) was compared with those of other penicillin antibiotics (PCs) against clinical isolates sent to us from medical institutions throughout Japan in 1988, 1990 and 1992 and strains isolated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections. 1. The MIC80's of ASPC against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis group were almost the same as those against these isolates in 1985 to 1986. 2. A trend for increasing susceptibility to PCs including ASPC was observed in the isolates of S. aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. This trend in S. aureus was attributed to the appearance of non beta-lactamase producing strains associated with the development of highly resistant strains among the methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) as well as to a tendency toward yearly decreasing frequency of MRSA. The trend for the increased susceptibility in H. influenzae was related to the decrease in the number of beta-lactamase production strains. 3. The frequency of the strains highly resistant to PCs including ASPC increased. 4. No PCs-resistant strains were observed among the so-called beta-streptococci, while among alpha-streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae there was a trend for decreasing frequency of strains with lower susceptibility to PCs or those with resistant to PCs. These strains may be variants which were also resistant to cephems and had penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Meanwhile, a high frequency of highly PCs-resistant strains were noted among Enterococcus faecium. In view of the fact that the PCs-resistance of E. faecium is known to be related to PBPs, the pattern of the susceptibility of the recent clinical isolates to beta-lactams is considered to be multimodal.
TI  - Evaluation of new streptococcal latex grouping kit.
AB  - AIMS: To evaluate a new streptococcal latex grouping kit (Shield Diagnostics Ltd) and compare it against an established latex agglutination method (Streptex; Wellcome Diagnostics). METHODS: Two hundred and forty seven strains of streptococci and enterococci were tested with each kit by one operator and according to the manufacturer's instructions. Strains failing to group or giving discordant results were identified to species level. RESULTS: Two discrepant grouping results were observed and 13 non-beta haemolytic streptococci failed to group with either product. The Shield kit successfully identified 232 isolates at 15 minutes of enzyme extraction incubation compared with 224 and 233 on short (15 minutes) and long (1 hour) incubations, respectively, for Streptex (p > 0.23 for both comparisons). On short incubation only, the Shield kit detected significantly more strains of Enterococcus faecium (p = 0.007). The reaction strengths were similar for both kits (p > 0.16). No cross-reactions were observed but the Streptex kit produced significantly fewer tests with visible granularity (p < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Although the Shield product appeared to detect group D antigen more readily, overall no important differences in performance were observed. Prospective users of the new method should first become familiar with its characteristics.
TI  - Development and use of species-specific oligonucleotide probes for differentiation of Streptococcus uberis and Streptococcus parauberis.
AB  - Oligonucleotide probes specific for 16S rRNA and capable of differentiating Streptococcus uberis and S. parauberis from each other and other esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci were developed. Use of a mini-RNA extraction technique for gram-positive cocci associated with bovine mastitis has allowed the probes to be used for identification of esculin-hydrolyzing streptococci from two dairy herds at the Institute for Animal Health, Compton, United Kingdom. One hundred seventy-nine of 206 isolates were identified as S. uberis, 3 were identified as S. parauberis, and 24 were not identified. Isolates not identified by the probes were tested biochemically and found to be mainly Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, or S. bovis.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - [The effect of culture media on bacteriocin production in various strains of bacteria].
AB  - Some staphylococcus and enterococcus strains were used to investigate the effect  of culture medium on bacteriocin production. Staphylococcus cohnii SC7, Staphylococcus sp. ZTJ 151, S. saprophyticus SS 877, Enterococcus faecium EF1 and E. faecalis EFG2 were isolated from the rumen wall and contents of lambs, calves and fallow deer, Enterococcus gallinarum EG10 and E. avium EA12 were isolated from the caecum of Japanese quail. The tested bacteria belong to producers with a wide antimicrobial effectiveness spectrum, they have low to medium adherence and urease activity (Tab. III). These culture media were used to test the effect of culture medium on bacteriocin production: nutrient agar no. 2 and VL agar enriched with 2% of glucose and lactose (ZAG, ZAL, VLG, VLL), agar for isolation of faecal streptococci (SA) and the base for blood agar no. 4 and no. 2 (KA4, KA2). The strains Streptococcus bovis AO 24/85 and Staphylococcus aureus Oxford 209 P were used as indicator bacteria. Tables I and II show the results of these tests. The tested strains produced the widest inhibition zones (6 mm) with both indicators on SA medium, and this indicates massive bacteriocin production. On ZAG medium, the zones of enterococci with the AO 24/85 strain were larger size than those of staphylococci, but the zones were dim. All strains with the 209P indicator produced dim zones of the 2mm size. The larger inhibition zones (2-5mm) in comparison with staphylococci were observed in enterococci on the ZAL medium with the AO24/85 strain. The production of tested strains was balanced on VLG agar with respect to the use of both indicators.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Identification and composition of the tonsillar and anal enterococcal and streptococcal flora of dogs and cats.
AB  - Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently isolated enterococcal species from  anal swabs and tonsils of dogs and cats, although in the anal samples from dogs Ent. hirae was found almost as often as Ent. faecalis. Most Ent. faecium strains from dog tonsils differed from those associated with humans and other animals in that they fermented sorbitol. Typical Ent. avium as well as atypical Ent. avium-like strains were seen in dogs, while the related species Ent. raffinosus was associated with cat tonsils. Enterococcus cecorum also occurred mainly in cats. Certain atypical strains, presumptively identified as Ent. cecorum, shared characteristics with Ent. columbae. The most frequent streptococcal species in tonsils of cats and dogs were Streptococcus suis and Strep. canis. Streptococcus canis and Strep. bovis predominated in anal swabs. The canine Strep. suis differed from the common porcine strains in fermenting mannitol. Forty-seven of the 288 isolates examined could not be identified or related to known species. The characteristics of two groups of these bacteria, provisionally called 'Ton 31 group' and 'O7 group' are described.
TI  - [A comparative microbiological and pharmacokinetic activity of vancomycin and teicoplanin].
AB  - Vancomycin and teicoplanin are two commercially available glycopeptide antibiotics. They have identical spectra of activity and similar mechanisms of action, and both are complex molecules. In vitro, vancomycin is more active against coagulase-negative staphylococci, while teicoplanin is more active against enterococci and pneumococci. The activity of the two antibiotics against Staphylococcus aureus is similar. The serum pharmacokinetics of vancomycin and teicoplanin are highly different, teicoplanin having a longer elimination half-life (40 hours versus 6-8 hours for vancomycin), but a higher degree of protein binding (90% versus 55%). We compared the two antibiotics on the basis of their inhibitory quotient kinetics, using the MIC90 values for the above bacterial species as the microbiological parameters, and the total and free (non-protein bound) serum concentrations as the pharmacokinetic parameters. The inhibitory quotient kinetics of vancomycin were always more favorable in terms of the free concentrations, even against those bacteria for which the teicoplanin MIC was lower.
TI  - Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA of Streptococcus and Enterococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  - Twelve bacterial species including Streptococcus uberis, S. parauberis, S. agalactiae, S. dysgalactiae, S. bovis, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. saccharolyticus, Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, E. avium, and Aerococcus viridans were examined for their 16S ribosomal DNA fingerprint patterns. Oligonucleotide primers complementary to 16S rRNA genes were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction 16S ribosomal gene fragments from genomic DNAs. The molecular sizes of the amplified 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) fragments from the 12 species examined ranged from 1,400 to 1,500 bp. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rDNA was performed with 11 different restriction endonucleases. All 12 species examined could be differentiated on the basis of characteristic 16S rDNA fingerprint patterns by using the restriction endonucleases HhaI, RsaI, and MspI. A scheme for the differentiation of the 12 species is presented. Eleven isolates representing 11 species were obtained from cows with intramammary infections and were examined by 16S rDNA fingerprinting. All 11 species isolated from cows were differentiated by using HhaI, RsaI, and MspI restriction endonucleases. The results of this study demonstrate the potential application of 16S rDNA fingerprinting for the identification and differentiation of bacterial species.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of clarithromycin. Spanish Collaborative Group.
AB  - The activity in vitro of clarithromycin, a new macrolide, was compared to that of various antibiotics in tests using 3,880 clinical isolates. Clarithromycin was two times more active than erythromycin against Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, streptococci of groups C, G and F, Brucella melitensis, Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma spp., 16 times more active against Ureaplasma urealyticum and 2 to 4 times less active against Campylobacter spp. In general, clarithromycin showed intrinsic activity 2 to 4 times higher than that of roxithromycin and 4 to 8 times higher than that of miocamycin. Cross-resistance was found between the macrolides. Clarithromycin was bactericidal against Streptococcus spp. and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - Evaluation of the E test by using selected gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The E test (AB Biodisk NA Inc.) was compared with standard reference methods using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards's recommendations for determining the MICs of four selected antibiotics against 208 clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria. These bacteria included 32 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, 25 strains of Enterococcus faecium, 20 strains of oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (OSSA), 96 strains of oxacillin-resistant S. aureus (ORSA), and 35 strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Evaluation included MIC accuracy within 1 dilution, reproducibility testing, and cost analysis. There was 94% agreement between the E test and the reference method in testing S. pneumoniae and penicillin G. There was 92% agreement with ampicillin and 100% agreement with vancomycin in testing E. faecium isolates. Accuracy of the oxacillin E test with staphylococci was significantly improved by the use of salt-supplemented Mueller-Hinton agar, for an agreement of 100% with coagulase-negative staphylococci and oxacillin-sensitive S. aureus and that of 85% with oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, with no major discrepancies. The E test with American Type Culture Collection isolates and clinical strains gave excellent reproducibility and was less costly than microdilution panels when used to test fewer than three antibiotics. The E test is a simple, reliable, reproducible, and cost-effective method for MIC determination for gram-positive organisms.
TI  - The distribution of homologous enterococcal plasmid DNA sequences in human faecal isolates.
AB  - Hybridization was used to investigate the distribution of enterococcal plasmid sequences among 306 strains of Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp. isolated from faeces of humans of various ages. As DNA probes for the survey three plasmids, whose DNAs did not hybridize each other and designated as pMS13, pTW34 and pHK30, were selected from plasmids borne in Ent. faecalis. pTW34 DNA hybridized only with DNAs from enterococci, with high frequency in Ent. faecalis and low frequency in Ent. faecium. pMS13 DNA hybridized with DNAs of all Enterococcus spp. tested and with Strep. bovis, Strep. equinus and Strep. salivarius. Eighty-five percent of Ent. faecium isolates had sequences homologous to pMS13 but in the other species the values were less than 60%. Some enterococci had DNAs which hybridized with the pHK30 probe. The different distribution of the three DNA sequences indicates the possibility that plasmid DNAs encode advantageous phenotypes for the colonization of bacteria in the lumen of the bowel.
TI  - Characterization of enterococcal isolates by restriction enzyme analysis of genomic DNA.
AB  - A restriction enzyme analysis (REA) of chromosomal DNA for the intra-species characterization of enterococci is reported. The DNA was extracted by a rapid method and digested with the restriction enzyme Sal I to provide a characteristic 'fingerprint' consisting of 10-20 bands in the 1.6-5.0 kb range. One hundred and eighty enterococcal isolates were examined; 5 were type strains, 15 from an out-patient clinic and 160 from a geographically isolated British Antarctic Survey Base. The epidemiologically unrelated out-patient clinic isolates gave readily distinguishable patterns, whereas isolates from the geographically isolated community showed evidence of colonization. This technique provided a highly discriminatory method of isolate characterization for Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium and E. durans suitable for epidemiological studies. A sample of isolates were probed with 16 + 23 S ribosomal RNA from Escherichia coli. Discrimination between isolates was poorer than with REA, although good correlation was observed between the results of the two techniques.
TI  - Streptococcal and enterococcal bacteremia in patients with cancer.
AB  - Eighty-two episodes of bacteremia due to streptococci (including the genus Enterococcus) in 78 patients hospitalized at Institut Jules Bordet between 1986 and 1988 were reviewed. The incidence ranged from 5.5 to 7.6 per 1,000 admissions (16% of all bacteremias). Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, and Streptococcus mitis were the most prevalent isolates, followed by Streptococcus angionosus, Streptococcus salivarius, and large colony-forming beta-hemolytic species (A, B, C, and G). Twenty-one episodes were polymicrobial. One-half of the patients had solid tumors, and one-half had hematologic malignancies. Forty-two patients were neutropenic (less than 1,000 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/microL). Only 15 episodes were acquired outside the hospital, and 11 episodes were breakthrough bacteremias. Twenty patients died within 1 month of the onset of streptococcal bacteremia. Five patients, two of whom were neutropenic, had fatal adult respiratory distress syndrome. The source of bacteremia remained undetermined in 35.4% of the episodes; the oral mucous membrane and the gastrointestinal tract were the most frequently recognized associated sites of infection. No unexpected antimicrobial resistance was observed except in two penicillin-resistant strains, one S. mitis and one E. faecium. No relation between peak or trough serum bactericidal titers and outcome could be demonstrated.
TI  - Evaluation of the effect of 3 probiotics on experimental Escherichia coli enterotoxaemia in weaned piglets.
AB  - In this report the efficacy of 3 different probiotics (Bacillus cereus "toyoi", Lactobacillus spp. and Streptococcus faecium) was investigated. They were supplemented in the food of recently weaned piglets that were orally infected with E. coli O141 K85ab. Supplementation could not prevent mortality and clinical symptoms nor reduce the faecal excretion of hemolytic E. coli. The possible explanations for the unsatisfying results are various.
TI  - Identical genes confer high-level resistance to gentamicin upon Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
AB  - The structural gene coding for the bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying 6'-acetyltransferase-2''-phosphotransferase (6'AAC-2''APH) enzyme was specifically amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using template DNA of clinical isolates of enterococci (both Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium) and the single high-level gentamicin-resistant Streptococcus agalactiae strain identified thus far. The results of the present study demonstrated that the genes encoding this antibiotic resistance trait are highly homologous in these species. In dot blot hybridization assays using nonradioactively labeled oligonucleotide probes, strains with and without high-level gentamicin resistance could be discerned unequivocally. The gene segment encoding 6'-acetylating activity and the gene segment encoding 2''-phosphorylating activity were simultaneously present in all isolates exhibiting high-level gentamicin resistance.
TI  - Determination of the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus  faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used to determine the chromosomal size of three different strains of Enterococcus faecalis and one strain of Enterococcus faecium. The size determinations of OG1X, a strain of E. faecalis widely used in many laboratories for genetic studies, using Sma I, Not I, and Sfi I alone or in combination, ranged from 2,750 to 2,761 kb. Using the same enzymes as with OG1X, the size of HH-67, a plasmid-free clinical isolate of E. faecalis, was determined to be 2,170-2,288 kb and the size of JH2-2, an E. faecalis recipient strain, ranged from 2,008 to 2,135 kb. The size range generated for GE-1, a plasmid-free E. faecium strain, with the use of Sma I, Not I, and Apa I was 2,045-2,155 kb. Although OG1X differed in size from the other three enterococci, each individual enterococcal strain generated reproducible results in different experiments. However, for both E. faecalis OG1X and E. faecium GE-1, one of the enzymes used generated a considerably smaller molecular size than that generated by the other two enzymes. The discrepancy was due to visually undiscernible comigrating fragments, and serves to point out a potential source of error if fewer than two enzymes are used to size a genome. The size discrepancies were resolved by digesting individual fragments with a second enzyme. The molecular sizes of these enterococcal strains are larger than that recently reported for Campylobacter, smaller than that of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and similar (OG1X) or smaller (JH2-2, HH67, and GE-1) than the 2,819-kb reported for Streptococcus mutans.
TI  - Extracellular and cellular distribution of muramidase-2 and muramidase-1 of Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790.
AB  - A substantial portion of the second peptidoglycan hydrolase (muramidase-2) activity of Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790 (formerly Streptococcus faecium) is present in the supernatant culture medium. In contrast, nearly all muramidase-1 activity is associated with cells in the latent, proteinase-activatable form. Muramidase-2 activity is produced and secreted throughout growth, with maximal levels attained at or near the end of exponential growth in a rich organic medium. Muramidase-2 activity in the culture medium remained high even during overnight incubations in the absence of proteinase inhibitors. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of supernatant culture medium concentrated by 60% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation showed the presence of several Coomassie blue-staining bands. One intensely staining protein band, at about 71 kDa, selectively adsorbed to the insoluble peptidoglycan fraction of cell walls of E. hirae, retained muramidase-2 activity, and reacted in Western immunoblots with monoclonal antibodies to muramidase-2. The mobility of extracellular muramidase-2 in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was indistinguishable from that of muramidase-2 extracted with 6 M guanidine hydrochloride from intact bacteria. Muramidase-2 appears to have only a limited number of binding sites on the peptidoglycan of E. hirae cell walls but binds with high affinity. Although high levels of muramidase-2 activity were present in supernatants of stationary-phase cultures, the bacteria were resistant to autolysis. Thus it appears that the peptidoglycan in walls of intact cells of E. hirae is somehow protected from the hydrolytic action of extracellular muramidase-2.
TI  - [Affinities of PBPs of enterococci to cefepime and ampicillin].
AB  - The beta-lactam resistance of genus Streptococcus has been explained by the low binding affinity of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) to the drug. This study was carried out to resolve the mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in the species of genus Enterococcus by means of binding affinities of PBPs. Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus avium were employed as assay microbes. Cefepime (CFPM) and ampicillin (ABPC) were used as representatives of cephems and penicillins, respectively. All the PBP fractions of S. pyogenes manifested high binding affinities to CFPM and ABPC, whereas PBPs 1 and 4 of E. faecalis showed high binding affinities to ABPC but not to CFPM. In E. faecium, PBPs of an exceptionally penicillin-susceptible strain manifested a high binding affinity to ABPC, but PBPs 5 and 6 showed low affinities to CFPM. beta-lactam resistant strains of E. faecium possessed PBPs 5 and 6 with low binding affinities to CFPM and ABPC. All the fractions of PBPs but PBP 1 in E. avium showed low binding affinities to CFPM. Although all the PBP fractions but PBPs 3 and 6 manifested high binding affinities to ABPC, PBPs 3 and 6 showed low binding affinities to ABPC. A strain of E. avium, which is susceptible to ABPC but moderately resistant to CFPM, lacked PBP 6. In conclusion, the resistance of E. avium to CFPM is based upon low binding affinities of the many fractions to this drug, and ABPC resistance is based upon PBPs 3 and 6 with low binding affinities to ABPC.
TI  - A truncated Tn916-like element in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - A 58.7-kb nonconjugative plasmid (pKQ1) previously reported in a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium was found to contain both a tetM and an erythromycin resistance (erm) determinant. The plasmid contained a region homologous to the A, F, H, and G HincII fragments of Tn916. However, the 4.8-kb B fragment of Tn916 which contained the tetM determinant was replaced by a 7.3-kb fragment, and the 3.6-kb HincII C fragment of Tn916 was missing. An element homologous to Tn917 was juxtaposed to the truncated Tn916-like element. The Tn917-like element was similar in size to the erm transposon Tn917 as determined by a ClaI restriction digest which spanned approximately 99% of the transposon. When Bacillus subtilis or Streptococcus sanguis were transformed with pKQ1, no zygotically induced transposition of the tetM element was detected. Similarly no transposition of the Tn917-like element was detected.
TI  - Streptococcal products and leukocyte activities.
AB  - Various streptococcal species are directly responsible for udder infections which should normally be countered by polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs). In order to detect a putative inhibition of streptococcal products on the activities of bovine PMNs, we used a combination of four tests which permits an adequate evaluation of PMNs functions, e.g. PMN adherence on endothelial cells, chemotactic assay, phagocytosis of bacteria labelled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and measurement of anion superoxide production. The conclusion is that neither of the two pathogenic streptococcal species isolated from mastitis appeared to produce in vitro factors affecting PMN activities.
TI  - Differences in the formation of poles of Enterococcus and Bacillus.
AB  - The pole of Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecium) is more pointed than that  of Bacillus subtilis; i.e. the pole of the former is prolate and the latter is oblate. Both species form their poles by constructing annular additions on the inside surface. In both cases, the thick septum starts to split from the outside before the septum is complete. Physiochemical considerations dictate that the peptidoglycan must be unstretched as laid down. However, it later becomes stressed and may stretch to increase its surface area or to change its shape. Our earlier analysis for B. subtilis demonstrated that, without the addition of new peptidoglycan, the nascent wall is stretched after it is externalized to 1.51 times the original area. The wall of partially formed poles that is already exteriorized continues to deform with further development. For E. hirae, Higgins & Shockman's measurements showed that the completed pole has a surface area 2.18 times larger than a completed septal disk and the wall changes shape very little after exteriorization. A model is presented here for the streptococcus in which the septal wall does not increase its surface area on exteriorization either by expansion or by murein insertion. Instead, the septal wall as it is split and exteriorized twists to become oblique, increasing the inner radius of the incomplete septum. In consequence of this rotation, extra layers of peptidoglycan are added to the inside face of the developing septum. This additional murein forms the more pointed pole shape for E. hirae. This "split-and-splay" model thus refines and extends the surface stress theory of E. hirae developed a decade ago by proposing a source of the extra wall needed for the formation of its prolate, more pointed, pole.
TI  - Enterococcal and streptococcal species isolated from faeces of calves, young cattle and dairy cows.
AB  - Faeces from non-ruminating calves were found to contain several species of enterococci: Enterococcus avium, Ent. cecorum, Ent. durans, Ent. faecalis, Ent. faecium and Ent. hirae. Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequent. Few of these animals carried streptococci. Streptococcus bovis largely predominated in ruminating calves, young cattle and dairy cows. Other streptococci as well as enterococci were infrequent in dairy cows, but a variety of other streptococci and enterococci were found in the faeces of young ruminating animals.
TI  - [The use of totally decontaminated mice under conditions of complete gnotobiological isolation for obtaining highly adhesive strains of Streptococcus faecium].
AB  
TI  - Photosensitizing activity of water- and lipid-soluble phthalocyanines on prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbial cells.
AB  - The photosensitizing activity of lipophilic zinc-phthalocyanine (Zn-Pc) and its water-soluble sulphonated derivative (Zn-PcS) towards Streptococcus faecium and Candida albicans was studied and correlated with the amount of cell-bound photosensitizer. With both micro-organisms Zn-PcS was more tightly bound in larger amounts than Zn-Pc in the protoplasts of the cytoplasmic membrane. As a consequence, the photoinduced damage in S. faecium initially involved membrane proteins, while DNA was modified only upon prolonged irradiation. For C. albicans only Zn-PcS showed a preferential affinity for the spheroplasts and the decrease in cell survival was not accompanied by detectable modifications of the electrophoretic pattern of membrane proteins. The photoinduced ultrastructural alteration of both micro-organisms suggests damage at membrane level. This would indicate the involvement of different targets in bacteria and yeast for phthalocyanine photosensitization.
TI  - DAP-decarboxylase activity and lysine production by rumen bacteria.
AB  - The last step of pathway of lysine biosynthesis by rumen bacteria was tested. The first measurements of DAP-decarboxylase activity and of lysine production by Megasphera elsdenii, Selenomonas ruminantium, Clostridium spp., Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and Bacteroides succinogenes as well as the first attempts to increase the lysine production by ruminal streptococci by mutation are described. The highest values were measured in Selenomonas ruminantium (DAP-decarboxylase activity = 146 micrograms DAP.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 390 micrograms.mg-1 protein) and the lowest values were ascertained in Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens (DAP-decarboxylase activity = 27 micrograms DAP.min-1.mg-1 protein and lysine production was 32 micrograms.mg-1 protein). DAP-decarboxylase activity was increased by mutation especially in Streptococcus bovis, the lysine production in both of tested ruminal streptococci. The potential use of lysine-excreting mutants in calves in future is suggested.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - [In vitro bactericidal effect of temafloxacin and tosufloxacin against streptococci].
AB  - Tosufloxacin tosylate (TOSU) and temafloxacin hydrochloride (TEMA) were tested in vitro against 248 clinical isolates of various species of streptococci recovered in a hospital microbiology laboratory (Bellevue Regional Teaching Hospital). Species included S. pneumoniae (n = 20), group A streptococci (n = 22), group B streptococci (n = 30), group G streptococci (n = 17), group D S. bovis (n = 19), Enterococcus faecium (n = 45), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 28), S. sanguis (n = 21), S. milleri (n = 29) and S. mitis (n = 17). Activities of each of the two study drugs were evaluated comparatively with two other fluoroquinolones, i.e., ciprofloxacin (CIP) and pefloxacin (PEF). Activities of each of these four antibiotics, expressed as the MIC 90%, varied as follows according to the species of streptococci: TOSU, 0.25 to 1 mg/l, TEMA 0.5 to 2 mg/l, CIP, 1 to 4 mg/l and PEF 8 to 32 mgl. Overall, TOSU and TEMA exhibited the greatest activity of the various species. The size of the inoculum had no significant effect on MIC values.
TI  - Selection and application of Streptococcus bovis as a silage inoculant.
AB  - Three strains of Streptococcus bovis, a homolactic bacterium capable of utilizing starch, were evaluated for growth kinetics and ability to decrease the pH of alfalfa silage. A selected strain was evaluated for its competitiveness as an inoculant with Enterococcus faecium, an organism used in inoculants, and for its ability to enhance the effect of a commercial inoculant. Testing was completed over three studies using wilted alfalfa (28 to 34% dry matter) ensiled into laboratory silos. Treatments were control, E. faecium, E. faecium and commercial inoculant, S. bovis, and S. bovis and commercial inoculant. Replicate silos were emptied and analyzed at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 40 days for pH, fermentation products, and nitrogen fractions. S. bovis alone lowered the pH quicker and improved silage parameters early in the fermentation compared with E. faecium, the commercial inoculant, and control treatments. When combined with a commercial inoculant, S. bovis lowered pH more quickly than the commercial inoculant alone and E. faecium plus commercial inoculant. At 40 days, S. bovis combination had lower pH and ammonia nitrogen and acetate contents than the E. faecium combination. Starch in the silage was not utilized by S. bovis as had been anticipated. Results indicate that S. bovis was more effective than E. faecium as a silage inoculant and could enhance a commercial inoculant on low-dry-matter alfalfa.

TI  - Thermal susceptibility of Streptococcus faecium strains isolated from frankfurters.
AB  - The heat resistance of nine strains of Streptococcus faecium isolated from frankfurters was determined at 63 and 68 degrees C in brain heart infusion broth. Exponential-phase cultures (approximately 10(7) colonies/mL) were used as inoculants. The heat resistance of S. faecium DP2181, a moderately resistant isolate, was further examined in broth (55, 63, and 68 degrees C) and frankfurter emulsion (63 and 68 degrees C). The decimal reduction times (D values) were determined by regression. In broth, both time-temperature combinations resulted in a 3-4 log decline in bacterial numbers for the nine S. faecium strains tested. For S. faecium DP2181, the survivor curves deviated from the logarithmic order of death at all three heating temperatures. An initial slow period of death was evident at 55 degrees C and a resistant tail of organisms was observed at 55, 63, and 68 degrees C. The D55D63, and, D68 values for the logarithmic portion of the corresponding survivor curves were 105.6, 9.36, and 3.34 min, respectively. The survival of DP2181 was enhanced by the frankfurter emulsion. The results indicate that populations of S. faecium existed that were very heat resistant and could survive normal frankfurter processing if initially present in high numbers.
TI  - Enterococcus faecium with high-level resistance to gentamicin.
AB  
TI  - Composition of the enterococcal and streptococcal intestinal flora of poultry.
AB  - Identification to species level showed that Enterococcus faecalis and Ent. faecium largely dominated the enterococcal and streptococcal gut flora of 1-d-old chicks. Enterococcus faecalis was rare in 3- to 5-week-old broilers. Two species, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus alactolyticus, were isolated from nearly all broilers examined. Enterococcus hirae and Ent. durans were found in the small intestines of this category of poultry. In layers and parent stock of over 12 weeks of age, Ent. cecorum dominated with Strep. alactolyticus ranking next. Other species were isolated irregularly. Enterococcus avium and Ent. gallinarum, originally described from chickens, were rarely found. These species did not appear to belong to the normal intestinal flora of poultry.
TI  - Susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium to ampicillin.
AB  
TI  - Enumeration by a miniaturized method of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis and enterococci as indicators of the origin of faecal pollution of waters.
AB  - Counts of Escherichia coli, faecal streptococci and enterococci were made on faecal specimens from human and animal origin and urban raw sewage waters, with microtiter plates containing selective substances. Escherichia coli was more numerous than faecal streptococci and enterococci in 80% of the samples regardless of the origin. Consequently the use of the ratio E. coli/faecal streptococci to distinguish human from animal origin of faecal pollution is questionable. Enterococcus faecalis was predominant in human and poultry faeces, Streptococcus bovis was typical of the bovine faeces and to a lesser extent also of pig faeces whereas Enterococcus durans, Ent. hirae and Ent. faecium did not characterize any faecal source. Streptococcus bovis could be distinguished in the microtiter plate by its inability to reduce triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) in the medium.
TI  - Detection of enterococcal high-level aminoglycoside resistance with MicroScan freeze-dried panels containing newly modified medium and Vitek Gram-Positive Susceptibility cards.
AB  - Both conventional and modified MicroScan Type 5 panels and Vitek Gram-Positive Susceptibility cards were compared with agar dilution screen plates for their abilities to detect high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin in 235 enterococcal isolates, including 167 Enterococcus faecalis and 63 E. faecium isolates. The modified Type 5 panels contained dextrose-phosphate broth instead of Mueller-Hinton broth in their high-level-resistance screen wells. The sensitivities for detection of gentamicin and streptomycin high-level resistance were 100 and 100% (E. faecalis) and 100 and 94% (E. faecium) for the modified MicroScan panels, 100 and 89% (E. faecalis) and 100 and 98% (E. faecium) for the conventional MicroScan panels, and 81 and 86% (E. faecalis) and 85 and 94% (E. faecium) for the Vitek cards. All specificities were 100% except for the Vitek cards with streptomycin, where it was 96%. Isolates that showed resistance on the streptomycin agar screen plates were rescreened on plates containing 32,000 micrograms/ml to detect ribosomally mediated resistance. For all three systems, every failure to detect streptomycin high-level resistance occurred in isolates with enzymatic, not ribosomal, resistance. The modified MicroScan Type 5 panels are a suitable method for detecting enterococcal high-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin. The Vitek cards are too insensitive for this purpose.
TI  - The evaluation of residual antimicrobial activity on hands and its clinical relevance.
AB  - A model for evaluation of the residual activity of agents used for hygienic hand  disinfection, which relates closely to the "in-use" setting, is described. We looked for residual activity following hand disinfection by a standard method with soap and water and four skin disinfectants in common use. Two test organisms known to have caused cross-infection and having clinically-significant antibiotic resistance were used: a strain of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and one of gentamicin-multiply-resistant Enterobacter cloacae. Both organisms survived well on artificially inoculated hands. Residual activity on previously disinfected hands against both test organisms was most marked for alcoholic chlorhexidine ('Hibisol') which showed a 4 log10 reduction within 1 min of inoculation. Chlorhexidine digluconate skin cleanser ('Hibiscrub') and povidone-iodine surgical scrub ('Betadine') also had marked residual activity, but less than alcoholic chlorhexidine. 60% Isopropanol showed no residual activity and, except for marginal activity against E. cloacae, soap and water showed little residual activity. The residual activity of alcoholic chlorhexidine may be useful to control cross-infection with those multiply-resistant strains which survive well on fingers previously washed with soap and water.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance heterogeneity in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - The tetracycline (Tet) determinants, which encode resistance either to tetracyclines without minocycline (Tcr) or to tetracyclines including minocycline (Tcr-Mnr), of 30 wild-type clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium were identified and localized. The Tet determinants were transferred by conjugation into a plasmid-free Enterococcus faecalis recipient at frequencies of 10(-6) to 10(-9) transconjugants per donor, as follows: Tcr, 6 strains; Tcr-Mnr, 14 strains; both Tcr and Tcr-Mnr, 6 strains; no detectable transfer, 4 strains. Classes L (Tcr phenotype) and M and O (Tcr-Mnr phenotype) of the Tet determinants were identified by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. The Tet L determinant was plasmid-borne in 18 strains and was chromosomal in 2 strains. Tet M was chromosomal in 27 strains and plasmid-borne (pIP1534) in 1 strain; pIP1534 also carried Tet L. Tet M was located on Tn916-like elements in 22 strains and on a Tn916-modified element in 1 strain. Tet O was detected in only one strain in which it was plasmid-borne. Both Tet L and Tet M determinants were carried by 19 strains. One strain carried, in addition to chromosomal nonconjugative Tet L and Tet M determinants, a conjugative Tcr-Mnr marker which did not correspond to any Tet determinant tested in this study. These results attest to the genetic complexity of tetracycline resistance in E. faecium strains.
TI  - Genetic transformation of various species of Enterococcus by electroporation.
AB  - A transformation system for Enterococcus faecalis was developed which uses untreated (i.e., non-protoplasted) cells and the electroporation technique. The optimized protocol resulted in transformation efficiencies of up to 4 x 10(6) transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA. All strains of E. faecalis tested could be transformed by this method, albeit with differing transformation efficiencies. Using the protocol optimized for E. faecalis we successfully transformed Enterococcus faecium, E. hirae, E. malodoratus and E. mundtii.
TI  - Synergistic killing of vancomycin-resistant enterococci of classes A, B, and C by combinations of vancomycin, penicillin, and gentamicin.
AB  - Using both high and low inocula for time-kill curves, we examined the antibiotic  killing of clinical isolates of glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (Enterococcus faecium, E. faecalis, and E. gallinarum) belonging to phenotypic resistance classes A, B, and C. None were resistant to high levels (greater than 500 mg/liter) of gentamicin. Vancomycin-penicillin-gentamicin resulted in 2 or more logs of killing above that of the most effective two-antibiotic combination for all strains except two of three E. gallinarum (VanC) strains and a constitutive mutant of a VanB strain. This strategy may be useful clinically.
TI  - [Group D streptococci and enterococci: identification, sensitivity to antibiotics and a study of the high level resistance to aminosides (Charles Nicolle Hospital in Tunis)].
AB  - 197 strains of enterococcus and group D Streptococcus were isolated from human material at Charles Nicolle Hospital (Tunis) and identified by biochemical tests: 174, Enterococcus faecalis, 6 Enterococcus faecium, 2 Enterococcus durans and 15 Streptococcus bovis. The sensitivity to antibiotics was studied: all Enterococcus faecium were resistant at least to one antibiotic, 15% of Enterococcus faecalis were sensitive for all antibiotics tested the other species were frequently sensitive. High level resistance to aminoglycosides were frequent in Enterococcus faecalis 40%: among these strains high level resistance to gentamicin accounts for 12% and 18 frequently associated with resistance to kanamycin and streptomycin, this situation present therapeutic problems in case of severe infection.
TI  - Separation of the poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids of Enterococcus faecalis Kiel 27738, Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790 and Leuconostoc mesenteroides DSM 20343 into molecular species by affinity chromatography on concanavalin A.
AB  - This study shows for the first time microheterogeneity of 1,3-linked poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids. The lipoteichoic acids investigated were those of Enterococcus faecalis Kiel 27738 (I), Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecium) ATCC 9790 (II), and Leuconostoc mesenteroides DMS 20343 (III). Lipoteichoic acids II and III are partially substituted by mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl residues with (1----2) interglycosidic linkages. Lipoteichoic acid I is substituted with alpha-kojibiosyl residues only. Lipoteichoic acids I and III additionally carry D-alanine ester. Lipoteichoic acids were separated on columns of concanavalin-A-Sepharose according to their increasing number of glycosyl substituents per chain. It was evident that all molecular species are usually glycosylated and that alanine ester and glycosyl residues occur on the same chains. The chain lengths of lipoteichoic acid I and II vary between 9-40 glycerophosphate residues, whereas those of lipoteichoic acid III appear to be uniform (33 +/- 2 residues). Molecular species differ in the extent of glycosylation but their content of alanyl residues is fairly constant. All lipoteichoic acids contain a small fraction (5-15%) different in composition from the bulk and most likely reflecting an early stage of biosynthesis. Two procedures for chain length determination of poly(glycerophosphate) lipoteichoic acids are described.
TI  - The bactericidal activity of ampicillin, daptomycin, and vancomycin against ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Ampicillin, daptomycin, and vancomycin, alone and in combination with gentamicin, were examined for bactericidal effects on ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium using broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and time-kill studies. We tested 12 ampicillin-resistant isolates and demonstrated the following MICs and MBCs, respectively: ampicillin, greater than or equal to 32 micrograms/ml and greater than 256 micrograms/ml; daptomycin, less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml; and vancomycin, less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml and greater than 64 micrograms/ml. Time-kill studies demonstrated that daptomycin alone had marked activity against the ampicillin-resistant E. faecium and that the addition of gentamicin resulted in synergistic killing. In addition, ampicillin and vancomycin were not bactericidal for the ampicillin-resistant isolates without the addition of gentamicin. The present study supports the consideration of daptomycin alone or in combination with an aminoglycoside as an alternative therapy for ampicillin-resistant enterococci, although additional clinical experience is now necessary.
TI  - Identification of vancomycin resistance protein VanA as a D-alanine:D-alanine ligase of altered substrate specificity.
AB  - High-level glycopeptide resistance in Enterococcus faecium BM4147 is mediated by  a 38-kDa protein VanA, whose amino acid sequence is related to Gram-negative D-alanine:D-alanine (D-Ala-D-Ala) ligases [Dutka-Malen, S., Molinas, C., Arthur, M., & Courvalin, P. (1990) Mol. Gen. Genet. 224, 364-372]. We report purification of VanA and demonstrate that it has D-Ala-D-Ala ligase activity but has substantially modified substrate specificity, compared with Gram-negative D-Ala-D-Ala ligases. VanA preferentially condenses D-Ala with D-Met or D-Phe, raising the possibility that its cellular role is to synthesize a modified cell-wall component, which is subsequently not recognized by vancomycin.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of Vitek gram-positive identification system and API Rapid Strep system for identification of Streptococcus species of bovine origin.
AB  - The Vitek Gram-positive identification system (GPI, Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, MO) and the API Rapid Strep system (Analytab Products, Plainview, NY) were evaluated for species identification of streptococci isolated from bovine mammary glands and compared to conventional biochemical methods. A total of 144 strains including Streptococcus uberis (60), S. dysgalactiae (32), S. agalactiae (15), S. bovis (15), Enterococcus faecium (10) and Ent. faecalis (12) were evaluated. All reference strains were identified correctly by both systems. Vitek GPI card system identified 94.4% of strains, including 95% of S. uberis, 93.8% of S. dygalactiae, 93.3% of S. agalactiae and S. bovis II, 90% of Ent. faecium and 100% of Ent. faecalis. Majority of strains were identified with a 90-99% level of confidence, with an average of 8 h needed for identification. The API Rapid Strep system identified 96.5% of strains correctly, including 95% of S. 96.9% of S. dysgalactiae, 93.3% of S. agalactiae, and 100% of S. bovis II, Ent. faecium, and Ent. faecalis. Majority of strains were identified with excellent level of identification. With the exception of S. uberis, most strains were identified at 4 h of incubation.
TI  - Effects of combinations of beta-lactams, daptomycin, gentamicin, and glycopeptides against glycopeptide-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Activities of combinations of beta-lactams, daptomycin, gentamicin, teicoplanin,  and vancomycin against 11 clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium highly resistant to glycopeptides, three plasmid-cured derivatives, eight E. faecalis and E. faecium transconjugants, and two susceptible recipient strains were tested. A marked synergy between penicillins or imipenem and glycopeptides against the glycopeptide-resistant strains but not against the glycopeptide-susceptible strains was observed by the double-disk agar diffusion assay. The synergy of combinations of amoxicillin, imipenem, penicillin G, or piperacillin with vancomycin or teicoplanin against resistant strains was confirmed by the checkerboard technique. The fractional inhibitory concentration indexes were generally below 0.25, except for one strain of E. faecium resistant to high levels of penicillin G. However, the combinations were not bactericidal as tested by time-killing experiments, and high concentrations (64 micrograms/ml) of amoxicillin, penicillin G, or piperacillin combined with 8 micrograms of vancomycin or teicoplanin per ml tended to be antagonistic. Addition of 4 micrograms of gentamicin per ml to these combinations enhanced their bactericidal effect, but they occasionally remained slightly less effective than beta-lactams associated with gentamicin. The combination of 10 micrograms of daptomycin per ml with gentamicin was bactericidal after 6 h against 11 glycopeptide-resistant strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of flomoxef and cefazolin in combination with vancomycin.
AB  - 207 clinical isolates from strains of patients from the University Children's Hospital of Kiel were investigated for their in vitro activity with the agar dilution method against flomoxef and cefazolin (alone and partially in combination with vancomycin). Staphylococci were also tested with other cephalosporins (cefoxitin, cefamandole, cefotaxime, cefotetan and latamoxef). Flomoxef and cefazolin always acted more vigorously on staphylococci than the other cephalosporins. Resistance of Staphylococcus aureus strains against flomoxef and cefazolin did not occur but was found in 15 and 5 of 98 Staphylococcus epidermidis strains, respectively. Enterococcus faecalis strains were always resistant against both drugs; Streptococcus faecium strains were only moderately sensitive. Combined testing of flomoxef or cefazolin with vancomycin showed synergism in almost all staphylococcal strains. Synergism was stronger when S. epidermidis strains were only weakly sensitive to or resistant against flomoxef and cefazolin in comparison to highly sensitive strains. Flomoxef (or cefazolin) acted synergistically in combination with vancomycin on E. faecalis and S. faecium with the exception of two strains of E. faecalis which showed an additive effect of both drugs.
TI  - Intrageneric relationships of Enterococci as determined by reverse transcriptase  sequencing of small-subunit rRNA.
AB  - The 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequences of eleven Enterococcus species were determined by reverse transcription in an attempt to clarify their intrageneric relationships. Comparative analysis of the sequence data revealed the presence of several species groups within the genus. The species E. avium, E. malodoratus, E. pseudoavium and E. raffinosus formed a distinct group as did E. durans, E. faecium, E. hirae and E. mundtii and the pair of species E. casseliflavus and E. gallinarum. Of the remaining species, E. cecorum, E. columbae, E. faecalis and E. saccharolyticus formed distinct lines of descent within the genus, whereas E. solitarius displayed a closer affinity with Tetragenococcus halophilus than with other enterococcal species.
TI  - Histamine formation by enterococci in goat cheese.
AB  - Cheeses were made of heat-treated goat milk inoculated with large numbers of a histamine-producing strain of Streptococcus faecium or a non-histamine-producing strain of S. faecalis. Every second week during ripening (91 days) the cheeses were sampled for histamine analyses and bacteriological analyses. The numbers of enterococci remained high throughout the whole period of investigation and the maximum amount of histamine detected was 8.2 micrograms/g in one of the cheeses. The enterococci seem to have no relevance from a histamine intoxication point of view in cheeses of this kind.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. A study mainly focused on imipenem. Reported by the Research Group for Testing Imipenem Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - This study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (IPM) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout Japan from September to December of 1988. In this study, identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by NCCLS in which susceptibilities are classified into "S", "MS", "I" and "R". IPM showed markedly high in vitro activities against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Enterococcus faecalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Salmonella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia rettgeri, Providencia stuartii, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, Alcaligenes spp., Peptococcus spp./Peptostreptococcus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Bacteroides spp. IPM also had strong activities against Achromobacter xylosoxidans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against Flavobacterium spp., E. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas cepacia. In a study in which activities of IPM against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among S. aureus, CNS, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, H. influenzae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, C. freundii, S. marcescens or P. mirabilis.
TI  - Modification of penicillin-binding proteins of penicillin-resistant mutants of different species of enterococci.
AB  - Mutants resistant to penicillin G were selected in a stepwise manner from nine different species of enterococci. Mutants with the highest level of resistance showed cross-resistance to all beta-lactams tested. For eight of the nine species, resistance correlated with increased production of a low molecular weight penicillin-binding protein (PBP). Two of these species produced a new PBP of low molecular weight, while two other species produced an additional PBP of high molecular weight. With the exception of Enterococcus faecium, no difference was observed in terms of lysis or bactericidal effect when the sensitive strains and their resistant mutants were tested at ten times their respective MICs of penicillin G. With E. faecium an increased lytic and bactericidal effect was observed for the resistant mutant.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of vancomycin, daptomycin, ampicillin and aminoglycosides against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Daptomycin, vancomycin, ampicillin and aminoglycosides, alone or in combination,  were tested for their bactericidal activity against 15 isolates of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium from immunocompromised children. The kill-kinetic studies at clinically achievable concentrations demonstrated that daptomycin alone or in combination with ampicillin had the greatest bactericidal activity.
TI  - Identification of lactococci and enterococci by colony hybridization with 23S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes.
AB  - Specific sequences of 23S rRNA of Lactococcus lactis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccus faecium, and Enterococcus malodoratus/Enterococcus avium were identified, and complementary oligonucleotide probes were synthesized. The specificity of the probes was evaluated by dot blot and colony hybridizations. The probes can be used for the specific detection and identification of colonies of the corresponding species in mixed cultures.
TI  - Emergence of 4',4"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase in enterococci.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BM4102 was resistant to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin  B-type (MLS) antibiotics; tetracycline-minocycline; and high levels of kanamycin, neomycin, tobramycin, and dibekacin but not gentamicin. This aminoglycoside resistance phenotype is new in enterococci. The genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides and MLS antibiotics in this strain were carried on a plasmid, pIP810, that was self-transferable to to other Enterococcus strains. Resistance to tobramycin and structurally related aminoglycosides, kanamycin, neomycin, and dibekacin, was due to synthesis of a 4',4"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase. Homology was detected by hybridization between pIP810 DNA and a probe specific for a gene encoding an enzyme with identical site specificity in staphylococci. The bacteriostatic activity of amikacin apparently was not affected by the presence of the enzyme, although it was modified in vitro. However, the bactericidal activity of amikacin and the synergism of this aminoglycoside with penicillin were abolished.
TI  - Properties of cell wall-associated DD-carboxypeptidase of Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecium) ATCC 9790 extracted with alkali.
AB  - DD-Carboxypeptidase (DD-CPase) activity of Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecium) ATCC 9790 was extracted from intact bacteria and from the insoluble residue (crude cell wall fraction) of mechanically disrupted bacteria by a brief treatment at pH 10.0 (10 mM glycine-NaOH) at 0 degrees C or by extraction with any of several detergents. Extractions with high salt concentrations failed to remove DD-CPase activity from the crude wall fraction. In contrast to N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase (both muramidase 2 and muramidase 1) activities, DD-CPase activity failed to bind to insoluble cell walls or peptidoglycan matrices. Thus, whereas muramidase 1 and muramidase 2 activities can be considered to be cell wall proteins, the bulk of the data are consistent with the interpretation that the DD-CPase of this species is a membrane protein that is sometimes found in the cell wall fraction, presumably because of hydrophobic interactions with other proteins and cell wall polymers. The binding of [14C]penicillin to penicillin-binding protein 6 (43 kilodaltons) was proportional to DD-CPase activity. Kinetic parameters were also consistent with the presence of only one DD-CPase (penicillin-binding protein 6) in E. hirae.
TI  - Induction of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium by inhibition of transglycosylation.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance has recently been recognized among clinical isolates of enterococci. Resistance is inducible, and associated with production of a novel 39 kDa membrane protein. The mechanism by which exposure to vancomycin, which does not penetrate the cell membrane, induces resistance is unknown. In the vancomycin resistant strain Enterococcus faecium 228, resistance was also inducible by moenomycin, suggesting that inhibition of the transglycosylation step in peptidoglycan synthesis may be required for induction of resistance. Cytoplasmic pools of peptidoglycan precursors were increased after exposure to vancomycin or moenomycin, representing a potential means for regulation of induction.
TI  - Comparison of vancomycin-inducible proteins from four strains of Enterococci.
AB  - Vancomycin-inducible proteins of 39.5 and 39 kDa from respectively, low-level and high-level resistant Enterococci were compared. Electrophoretic, immunoblot and peptide analysis revealed three types of protein, one in a low-level resistant strain of E. faecium, one in 2 high-level-resistant strains of E. faecium, and one in a high-level resistant strain of E. faecalis. The inducible proteins of E. faecium and E. faecalis, of 39.5 and 39 kDa respectively, which may function in a similar fashion (Al-Obeid et al. (1990) Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 34, 252-256), are not related immunologically.
TI  - Technologically important characteristics of Enterococcus isolates from milk and  dairy products.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium (54 strains), E. faecalis (40 strains), and E. durans (14) were isolated from various dairy products (raw milk, cream, butter and fermented milk products) during a previous study (Wessels et al., 1988). In this article various characteristics of these isolates, which may have a bearing on their significance in dairy products, have been studied. A large percentage of the identified strains of all three species were able to grow at 7 degrees C. Seventy-six percent of the E. faecium strains, 62% E. faecalis and 50% E. durans strains also showed proteolytic activity at psychrotrophic temperatures. The fact that proteolytic activity could be detected within 2 days at 7 degrees C is significant, since bulk cooled milk is normally held for 3 to 4 days at temperatures between 4 and 7 degrees C at farms or factories prior to processing. This examination confirmed that enterococci are proteolytic rather than lipolytic.
TI  - Cloning and heterospecific expression of the resistance determinant vanA encoding high-level resistance to glycopeptides in Enterococcus faecium BM4147.
AB  - Fragments of plasmid pIP816, which confers high-level glycopeptide resistance in  Enterococcus faecium BM4147, were cloned into a conjugative gram-negative-gram-positive shuttle vector. The resulting hybrids were transferred by conjugation from Escherichia coli to Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus thuringiensis. A 4-kilobase EcoRI fragment from pIP816 was found to confer vancomycin resistance in these hosts but not in E. coli or Bacillus subtilis.
TI  - The activity in vitro of trospectomycin sulphate (U-63366F) against aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci.
AB  - Trospectomycin (U-63366F), a 6'-propyl analogue of spectinomycin, was tested against aminoglycoside-resistant enterococci. The MIC90 for Enterococcus faecalis was 4 mg/l and that for E. faecium was 8 mg/l. Trospectomycin alone was not bactericidal for enterococci, with MBC90 4096 mg/l for both E. faecalis and E. faecium. The addition of commercially available polyvalent immunoglobulin decreased significantly both the MICs and the MBCs and the rendered trospectomycin bactericidal for enterococci. Chequerboard titration of a combination of trospectomycin with ampicillin revealed an FIC index of 1.0 for all the isolates tested. Time-kill curves also did not show any enhancement of bactericidal activity of ampicillin when combined with trospectomycin. A combination of ampicillin and gentamicin was synergistic for enterococci under similar experimental conditions. Trospectomycin can be used as a safe alternative to aminoglycosides or beta-lactam antibiotics in enterococcal infection where bactericidal activity is not required, or in the event of serious side effects from these two classes of antibiotics.
TI  - Biological characterization of a new radioactive labeling reagent for bacterial penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - Radiolabeled penicillin G is widely used as the imaging agent in penicillin-binding protein (PBP) assays. The disadvantages of most forms of labeled penicillin G are instability on storage and the long exposure times usually required for autoradiography or fluorography of electrophoretic gels. We investigated the utility of radioiodinated penicillin V as an alternative reagent. Radioiodination of p-(trimethylstannyl)penicillin V with [125I]Na, using a modification of the chloramine-T method, is simple, high yielding, and site specific. We demonstrated the general equivalence of commercially obtained [3H]penicillin G and locally synthesized [125I]penicillin V (IPV) in their recognition of bacterial PBPs. Profiles of PBPs in membranes from Bacteroides fragilis, Escherichia coli, Providencia rettgeri, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, and Enterococcus faecium labeled with IPV or [3H]penicillin G were virtually identical. Use of IPV as the imaging agent in competition experiments for determination of the affinities of various beta-lactam antibiotics for the PBPs of E. coli yielded results similar to those obtained in experiments with [3H]penicillin G. Dried electrophoretic gels from typical PBP experiments, using IPV at 37.3 Ci/mmol and 30 micrograms/ml, exposed X-ray film in 8 to 24 h. The stability of IPV on storage at 4 degrees C was inversely proportional to specific activity. At 37.3 Ci/mmol and 60 micrograms/ml, IPV retained useful activity for at least 60 days at 4 degrees C. IPV represents a practical and stable reagent for rapid PBP assays.
TI  - The survival of streptococci and enterococci in animal feed and on straw with particular reference to Streptococcus uberis.
AB  - The survival of Streptococcus uberis, Strep. bovis, Enterococcus faecalis spp. faecalis and Ent. faecium in animal feed and on wheat straw was studied for one month. Streptococcus bovis survived the best in feed and Strep. uberis the worst while on straw Ent. faecium was the most resilient species and there was little to choose between the other three. The recovery of all species, excepting Strep. bovis, on selective and non-selective agar was comparable. The growth of Strep. bovis, on the other hand, was inhibited on both Edward's medium and inulin agar.
TI  - Species identities of enterococci isolated from clinical specimens.
AB  - Conventional tests and commercially available systems were used to determine the  species identities of clinical isolates of enterococci. Strict adherence to the conventional test scheme of Facklam and Collins (R. R. Facklam and M. D. Collins, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:731-734, 1989) resulted in the misidentification of lactose-negative Enterococcus faecalis isolates as Enterococcus solitarius, but this problem was overcome by the application of additional tests. The commercially available systems tested were unable to recognize some of the more recently described enterococcal species. E. faecalis accounted for 87.1% of 302 consecutive isolates. Enterococcus faecium (8.6%), Enterococcus avium (0.7%), Enterococcus durans (0.3%), Enterococcus gallinarum (1.0%), Enterococcus casseliflavus (1.0%), Enterococcus hirae (0.3%), and Enterococcus raffinosus (0.3%) isolates were also identified. None of the isolates produced beta-lactamase, but 15.4% of 235 isolates tested, including 1 strain of E. gallinarum, displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin.
TI  - Vancomycin resistance is encoded on a pheromone response plasmid in Enterococcus  faecium 228.
AB  - In Enterococcus faecium 228, vancomycin resistance is encoded on a 55-kilobase conjugative plasmid, pHKK100. This plasmid was transferred with high frequency into susceptible strains of Enterococcus faecalis and conferred responses to pheromones produced by E. faecalis and Streptococcus sanguis. pHKK100 is the first plasmid described that mediates both vancomycin resistance and pheromone response.
TI  - Enterococcal resistance to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics.
AB  - Enterococci belonging to various species resistant to vancomycin and related cyclic glycopeptide antibiotics have been isolated from hospitalized patients in France, the UK and the USA. All such strains examined display inducible synthesis of a membrane protein associated with resistance. The mechanism by which the membrane protein acts has not been definitively established, but it may block the access of the antibiotic to its peptidoglycan target. That the protein could be a bypass enzyme has not been ruled out. Transfer of glycopeptide resistance by conjugation to either Enterococcus faecium or Enterococcus faecalis and by transformation of Streptococcus sanguis Challis has been reported. The structural and regulatory genes encoding this resistance can be localized on plasmid and, apparently, chromosomal DNA. The plasmids encoding this resistance appear to differ from each other and have variable host ranges, but share at least some DNA sequence homology.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of Lactobacillus products used for colonization of  the vagina.
AB  - Lactobacilli have long been considered to be the protective flora in the vagina.  Women with vaginal infections have used various non-prescription products in an attempt to restore their normal vaginal flora. Products that contain lactobacilli include dairy products (yogurt, acidophilus milk) and commercially available Lactobacillus powders and tablets. Recently, Lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been associated with normal vaginal flora. In this study, we compared 16 non-prescription products containing lactobacilli for H2O2 production, purity, and identifiable contaminants. All 16 products contained lactobacilli, of which ten (62%) produced H2O2. At least one contaminant was detected in 11 of 16 (69%) of the products: Enterococcus faecium (ten), Clostridium sporogenes (one), Streptococcus mitis (one), and Pseudomonas species (one). Although all of the products tested contained lactobacilli, only four of the products contained Lactobacillus acidophilus. Most of the lactobacilli-containing products currently available either do not contain the Lactobacillus species advertised and/or contain other bacteria of questionable benefit. We conclude that commercially available products may not be appropriate for recolonization of the vagina.
TI  - Mechanism of resistance to vancomycin in Enterococcus faecium D366 and Enterococcus faecalis A256.
AB  - The role of the glycopeptide-inducible proteins of Enterococcus faecium D366 (39.5 kilodaltons) and Enterococcus faecalis A256 (39 kilodaltons) in the mechanism of resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin was examined. Crude cell walls from noninduced cells or from induced cells treated with sodium dodecyl sulfate to remove the inducible proteins were shown to bind vancomycin, in contrast to cell walls containing the cytoplasmic membrane-associated induced proteins, which did not bind vancomycin. Cytoplasmic membranes from vancomycin-induced cells did not inactivate (bind) vancomycin or teicoplanin, but they could protect the glycopeptides from being bound to the synthetic pentapeptide. This protection could be competitively abolished by D-alanyl-D-alanine. A decrease in glycopeptide binding to the pentapeptide was observed in a time-dependent fashion after treatment of the pentapeptide with the cytoplasmic membranes from induced cells. We hypothesize that the inducible proteins are responsible for glycopeptide resistance due to the binding to, and subsequent enzymatic modification of, the pentapeptide precursor of peptidoglycan, which is considered to be the natural target of glycopeptides.
TI  - The life and times of the Enterococcus.
AB  - Enterococci are important human pathogens that are increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. These organisms were previously considered part of the genus Streptococcus but have recently been reclassified into their own genus, called Enterococcus. To date, 12 species pathogenic for humans have been described, including the most common human isolates, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. Enterococci cause between 5 and 15% of cases of endocarditis, which is best treated by the combination of a cell wall-active agent (such as penicillin or vancomycin, neither of which alone is usually bactericidal) and an aminoglycoside to which the organism is not highly resistant; this characteristically results in a synergistic bactericidal effect. High-level resistance (MIC, greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) to the aminoglycoside eliminates the expected bactericidal effect, and such resistance has now been described for all aminoglycosides. Enterococci can also cause urinary tract infections; intraabdominal, pelvic, and wound infections; superinfections (particularly in patients receiving expanded-spectrum cephalosporins); and bacteremias (often together with other organisms). They are now the third most common organism seen in nosocomial infections. For most of these infections, single-drug therapy, most often with penicillin, ampicillin, or vancomycin, is adequate. Enterococci have a large number of both inherent and acquired resistance traits, including resistance to cephalosporins, clindamycin, tetracycline, and penicillinase-resistant penicillins such as oxacillin, among others. The most recent resistance traits reported are penicillinase resistance (apparently acquired from staphylococci) and vancomycin resistance, both of which can be transferred to other enterococci. It appears likely that we will soon be faced with increasing numbers of enterococci for which there is no adequate therapy.
TI  - [A case report of meningitis and sepsis due to Enterococcus faecium complicated with strongyloidiasis].
AB  - A 80 year-old male was transferred to our department on 18th Aug. 1988, for high  fever and clouding of the consciousness. He had been treated with steroid hormone (betamethasone 3.0 mg/day for 15 days) for his uveitis. Enterococcus faecium was isolated from both blood and spinal fluid, and then Strongyloides sterocoralis was revealed both in the sputum and stool. Anti-Human T-cell leukemia virus 1 (HTLV-1) antibody was also positive serologically. At first, beta-lactam antibiotics were used for the treatment of purulent meningitis and sepsis, but after performing sensitivity tests for E. faecium, the antibiotics were changed to rifampicin (RFP), fosfomycin (FOM) and ofloxacin (OFLX) for their excellent activity against the organism. After the clinical symptoms, subsided, thiabendazole was used for disseminated strongyloidiasis in daily doses of 2,500 mg for six days initially. The drug was used three times with two week intervals. Both bacterial and parasite infections subsided and no recurrence has been noticed until now. This is the first case of meningitis caused by E. facium complicated with strongyloidiasis.
TI  - Few-minutes tests for the identification of group A streptococci and enterococci  with chromogenic substrates.
AB  - The usefulness of paper strip tests for rapid identification of Streptococcus pyogenes and enterococci cultured on blood agar plates was investigated. The paper strips used contain dried chromogenic substrates for pyrrolidonyl peptidase (PYRase) and beta-glucosidase (beta-Gluc). Material from only a few colonies needed to be applied to the test strips. The reactions could be read after two min (PYRase) and 5-7 min (beta-Gluc), respectively. Results from testing 503 streptococcal strains were evaluated. The reactions proved very useful for rapid differentiation of S. pyogenes and enterococci from human sources. Nearly all strains of these streptococcal species showed positive reactions in the PYRase test whereas only the enterococci (E. faecalis and E. faecium) were positive for both enzymes.
TI  - Transposon-916-like elements in clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Tetracycline (Tc) resistance was found in nine out of ten clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium. Conjugative transposons, designated Tn5031, Tn5032 and Tn5033, were present in the chromosome of three isolates. The transposons were similar both structurally and functionally to Tn916 containing the tetM determinant. A large non-conjugative plasmid found in a fourth isolate contained an element homologous to Tn916. The four isolates containing the element showing homology to Tn916 exhibited a substantially higher level of Tc resistance than the remaining five Tc-resistant isolates. Tc-resistance genes which have not been identified are apparently responsible for the low-level Tc resistance in five clinical isolates.
TI  - Serological identification of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus.
AB  - Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (Str. thermophilus) has no group-specific antigen. HCl extracts of 551 strains of streptococci isolated from cheese or yogurt (123 Str. thermophilus and 428 Enterococcus faecalis - Ent. faecium spp.) were examined with three type-specific antisera prepared against representatives of Str. thermophilus and also with Lancefield group D antisera. All typical (80) or atypical (43) strains of Str. thermophilus reacted with at least one type-specific antiserum and none of the enterococci reacted. Only two strains reacted with both type-specific and group antisera.
TI  - Active-site and membrane topology of the DD-peptidase/penicillin-binding protein  no. 6 of Enterococcus hirae (Streptococcus faecium) A.T.C.C. 9790.
AB  - The membrane-bound 43,000-Mr penicillin-binding protein no. 6 (PBP6) of Enterococcus hirae consists of a 30,000-Mr DD-peptidase/penicillin-binding domain and a approximately 130-residue C-terminal appendage. Removal of this appendage by trypsin proteolysis has no marked effect on the catalytic activity and penicillin-binding capacity of the PBP. Anchorage of the PBP in the membrane appears to be mediated by a short 15-20-residue stretch at the C-terminal end of the appendage. The sequence of the 50-residue N-terminal region of the PBP shows high degree of homology with the sequences of the corresponding regions of the PBPs5 of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. On this basis the active-site serine residue occurs at position 35 in the enterococcal PBP.
TI  - Enterococci highly resistant to penicillin and ampicillin: an emerging clinical problem?
AB  - Sixteen clinical isolates of ampicillin-resistant enterococci (ARE) were recovered from the microbiology laboratory of a 450-bed rehabilitation medical center from January 1981 to September 1987. These isolates were detected when a disk diffusion test using 10 micrograms of ampicillin on a blood agar plate revealed no zones of inhibition. Tube macrodilution tests yielded an MIC of greater than or equal to 16 micrograms of ampicillin per ml. None of the isolates were penicillinase producers by the chromogenic cephalosporin disk test. Ten isolates were Enterococcus faecium, four isolates were E. raffinosus, one isolate was E. gallinarum, and one isolate was not identified (lost). There were 6 male and 10 female patients. The sources of isolates were urine (n = 7), wound (n = 5), ascitic fluid (n = 2), blood (n = 2), peritoneal catheter tip (n = 1), Bartholin's cyst abscess (n = 1), rectal swab (n = 2), and pancreatic abscess (n = 1). The organism was isolated from multiple sites in 4 patients, was a pure culture isolate in 5 patients, and was part of a polymicrobial flora in 11 patients. Six patients were diabetic, and four had liver cirrhosis. All but four patients had received at least one antibiotic within 3 weeks of ARE isolation. The MICs (micrograms per milliliter) for 50 and 90% of isolates tested, respectively, were as follows: ampicillin, 64 and 64; penicillin, 128 and greater than 128; vancomycin, 1 and 2; gentamicin, 4 and 16; ciprofloxacin, 1.6 and 3.2; imipenem, 128 and greater than 128; and daptomycin (LY146032), 1.6 and 6.4. ARE may be an emerging pathogen in the hospitalized patient population.
TI  - Emergence of isolates resistant to ampicillin.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecium demonstrating ampicillin resistance were recovered from eight pediatric patients. Sites of isolation included blood, surgical wound, bile drainage, urine, burns, and peritoneal fluid. Seven patients had prolonged hospitalization, and all had been treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics prior to isolation of the resistant enterococcus. One isolate was from an ill, bacteremic patient; the others were in mixed culture and were not considered causes of disease. The isolates were not epidemiologically related. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for various antibiotics included ampicillin (16 to 32 mg/L), penicillin (128 mg/L), gentamicin (16 mg/L), and vancomycin (2 mg/L). Three isolates demonstrated high-level resistance (greater than 2000 mg/L) to streptomycin; none did so to gentamicin. In vitro synergy testing performed on seven available isolates for ampicillin and gentamicin demonstrated no synergy to this combination. None produced beta-lactamase. Combined antibiogram and plasmid data showed at least five distinct patterns. These strains present a new clinical problem in their high level of resistance to ampicillin and to the combination of ampicillin and gentamicin.
TI  - A protein of unusual composition from Enterococcus faecium.
AB  
TI  - The second peptidoglycan hydrolase of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 covalently  binds penicillin.
AB  - A second peptidoglycan hydrolase (muramidase-2) of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 (Enterococcus hirae) has been purified to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme has been shown to be a beta-1,4-N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase (muramidase; EC 3.2.1.17) and to differ in substrate specificity from a previously isolated muramidase. Purified enzyme appears as two protein staining bands with molecular masses of 125 and 75 kilodaltons (kDa) on polyacrylamide gels after sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. Elution and renaturation of protein bands from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels showed that both proteins have muramidase-2 activity. Both proteins have been shown to bind radioactive benzylpenicillin and have the same electrophoretic mobilities as penicillin-binding proteins 1 and 5 present in membrane preparations of this organism, respectively. Incubation of a [14C]penicillin G-labeled 125-kDa form of the enzyme with crude alkaline extracts from S. faecium (which did not contain added proteinase inhibitors) showed the endogenous conversion of the radiolabeled 125-kDa form to the radiolabeled 75-kDa form of the enzyme.
TI  - Resistance studies with ofloxacin.
AB  
TI  - Characterization of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis.
AB  - Vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium 180, a clinical isolate from England, was studied. Resistance to vancomycin was transferable by conjugation to other enterococci. Expression of resistance was inducible and coincided with the appearance of a new membrane protein.
TI  - Inducible resistance to vancomycin in Enterococcus faecium D366.
AB  - Strain D366, a clinical isolate of Enterococcus faecium, is resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] 32 mg/L) to vancomycin. When exponential-phase cultures were exposed to half the MIC of vancomycin, a lag of 3-4 h occurred before growth resumed. Cells preexposed to 1/2 MICs of vancomycin did not show any lag. Pregrowth of D366 with vancomycin caused resistance to all glycopeptides tested. Pregrowth in vancomycin resulted in synthesis of a 3.95-kDa cytoplasmic-membrane-associated protein. This protein was correlated with resistance in mutants with high-level resistance, in the presence of NaCl, which inhibited the activity of vancomycin, and when several glycopeptides with varying activities were tested. Vancomycin-grown cells appeared abnormal and lysed at a much slower rate than did normal cells. We conclude that (1) vancomycin resistance in D366 is inducible; (2) resistance is correlated with the synthesis of 39.5-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein; and (3) this protein play an additional role in the inhibition of normal lytic functions.

TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - [The effect of roxithromycin on the aerobic fecal flora in children].
AB  - To evaluate the effect of roxithromycin on aerobic flora in 14 children treated orally (5 mg/kg/day during 5 to 7 days) quantitative stool cultures were performed using selective media. Enterobacteriaceae (EB), streptococci D (STR D), Staphylococcus aureus, Candida were counted at days 0, 2 and 5 days, and 2 days after treatment. The MIC of each strain was determined for roxithromycin, erythromycin and spiramycin. Ten infants in a nursery had already received antibiotics. A moderate albeit significant (p less than 0.01) decrease was observed for EB, falling from 7.2 log 10 (range 5-9) to 4.9 (range 2-8) per gram of stools, rising to 5.8 after treatment. There was no significant effect for STR D. The MIC of roxithromycin for EB increased from 244 mg/l (range 0.03-512) to 340 (range 0.03-512). For STR. D, it increased from 138 (range 1-1024) to 427 (range 1-1024). The bacteria with low MIC (less than or equal to 64 mg/l for EB and less than or equal to 4 mg/l for STR. D) are Escherichia coli and Streptococcus faecium. The MIC increased for the three macrolides tested.
TI  - High-level penicillin resistance among isolates of enterococci. Implications for  treatment of enterococcal infections.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent and clinical significance of high-level  penicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium at our institution. DESIGN: Surveillance of clinical enterococcal isolates, in-vitro susceptibility and timed survival studies, and determination of antibiotic efficacy in an experimental model of enterococcal endocarditis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: For a 6-month period, 14% of enterococcal isolates (30 of 212) were identified as E. faecium. One third of the isolates were highly resistant to penicillin G (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC], greater than or equal to 200 micrograms/mL) but did not produce beta-lactamase. The findings from in-vitro survival studies showed that this high-level resistance resulted in the loss of bactericidal activity normally observed when an aminoglycoside antibiotic agent is combined with penicillin. An experimental rat model of endocarditis provided in-vivo data that confirmed our in-vitro observations. After the rats received therapy for 72 hours, penicillin G either alone or in combination with gentamicin did not significantly decrease the numbers of enterococci in vegetations on heart valves compared with untreated controls (P = 0.62 and P = 0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Enterococcus faecium accounts for a notable proportion of clinical enterococcal isolates. Many strains from patients at our institution, as well as from patients at other institutions throughout the country, are highly resistant to penicillin. Because high-level penicillin resistance has important therapeutic implications, periodic surveillance and MIC testing of significant enterococcal isolates, especially E. faecium, are suggested.
TI  - The enterococci: evidence of species-specific clinical and microbiologic heterogeneity.
AB  - Investigations of the clinical role of enterococci have been limited largely to enterococcal bacteremia and endocarditis and have not distinguished between the various species of enterococci. To characterize the full spectrum of enterococcal disease and to determine whether clinically important differences exist among infections and/or instances of colonization (infections/colonizations) by the various enterococcal species, cases of enterococcal infection/colonization diagnosed at the Dallas Veterans Administration Medical Center (DVAMC) in 1986 were reviewed. During this period, 220 Enterococcus faecalis, 21 Enterococcus faecium, 12 Enterococcus avium, and no Enterococcus durans isolates were identified in clinical specimens (other than stool) submitted to the DVAMC microbiology laboratory. Clinical characteristics of cases of infection/colonization by the three species of enterococci were similar and did not vary significantly when blood stream invasion occurred. Nevertheless, mortality data and therapeutic response rates suggested differences in virulence of the three enterococcal species. Enterococcal infections/colonizations (including bacteremia) frequently were polymicrobial. Although Enterobacteriaceae were the most common copathogens identified overall, Staphylococcus aureus was the most common copathogen in bloodstream infections. E. avium was more resistant than E. faecalis or E. faecium to penicillin G and ampicillin and less resistant to most other antimicrobial agents. The results of this investigation suggest that enterococci are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that should not be treated as a single entity in clinical investigations.
TI  - Effect of cell cycle stages on the central density of Enterococcus faecium ATCC 9790.
AB  - Cultures of Enterococcus faecium growing at various rates were examined for timing of cell division cycle events by using the method of residual divisions and a morphological analysis. Both methods gave essentially the same timing for the onset of D1 (completion of chromosome replication) and of D2 (completion of septation). Frequencies of cells exhibiting a phase-reversed center in bovine serum albumin at various growth rates were determined. The data fit a model in which rapidly growing cells increase in refractive index (which is assumed to represent central density) at completion of the chromosome replication cycle involved in the ongoing division, whereas slowly growing cultures increase in central density at the time of completion of septation. There was no correlation between the timing of increase in central density and the timing of initiation of new sites of surface growth.
TI  - Regulation of the cytoplasmic pH by a proton-translocating ATPase in Streptococcus faecalis (faecium). A computer simulation.
AB  - Earlier work from this laboratory led to the proposal that the cytoplasmic pH of  streptococcal cells is regulated solely by changes in the amount and activity of a proton-translocating ATPase, F1F0 complex [Kobayashi, H., Suzuki, T. & Unemoto, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 627-630]. We have now examined the proposal with the aid of computer simulation. We find that an increase in the amount of the H+-ATPase is necessary for pH regulation and is sufficient to maintain a constant steady-state cytoplasmic pH. An increase in H+-ATPase activity is insufficient by itself to maintain a constant cytoplasmic pH, but suppresses the initial fluctuation of the pH. When both variations were allowed, the simulated cytoplasmic pH remained constant despite large perturbations, suggesting that this regulatory system has ample capacity to compensate for pH changes. The present work shows that a computer simulation is a useful way to examine a model for biological regulatory system; application of the simulation to other regulatory systems is discussed.
TI  - Penicillin-aminoglycoside synergy and post-antibiotic effect for enterococci.
AB  - The post-antibiotic effect (PAE) on seven strains of enterococci was studied using a novel ATP method and conventional viable counting. There was a good correlation between the results of the two techniques. In strains exhibiting low-level resistance to penicillin and streptomycin, PAEs of 1 to 2.4 h (mean 1.8 h) resulted from exposure to penicillin; shorter PAEs were induced by streptomycin (0.2-0.3 h; mean 0.2 h). Addition of streptomycin to pencillin increased the duration of penicillin-induced PAEs by two-fold to three-fold. Enterococci exhibiting high-level streptomycin resistance but low-level penicillin resistance did not exhibit a PAE with streptomycin but exhibited a short PAE with gentamicin (0.3-0.6 h). For these strains, the addition of gentamicin, but not streptomycin, to penicillin increased the penicillin-induced PAEs. Penicillin alone or in combination with streptomycin or gentamicin did not induce PAEs for a single strain of Enterococcus faecium which exhibited high-level resistance to both penicillin and streptomycin. During penicillin-induced PAEs, extracellular ATP was detectable and only during this time period were enterococci susceptible to the action of gentamicin. The addition of aminoglycosides to penicillin not only extended the PAE for enterococci but also the periods when organisms leaked ATP and were susceptible to growth inhibition by gentamicin.
TI  - DNA probe for identification of Streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB  - A total of 287 clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. The test was positive for all but one isolate, strain DOC-1. This autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of S. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lytA gene. We used lytA as a DNA probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of S. pneumoniae. In dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the DNA of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate DOC-1. No hybridization occurred when strains of Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecalis, Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus bovis were tested. The lytA gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a DNA probe for the identification of S. pneumoniae.
TI  - Transferable vancomycin and teicoplanin resistance in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Enterococcus faecium BM4165 and BM4178, isolated from immunocompromised patients, one treated with vancomycin, were inducibly resistant to high levels of the glycopeptide antibiotics vancomycin and teicoplanin but susceptible to the new lipopeptide daptomycin (LY146032). Strain BM4165 was also resistant to macrolidelincosamide-streptogramin B-type (MLS) antibiotics. The genes conferring resistance to glycopeptides and to MLS antibiotics in strain BM4165 were carried on plasmids pIP819 and pIP821, respectively; pIP819 also carried genes that encoded resistance to MLS antibiotics. The two plasmids, which were distinct although related, were self-transferable to other E. faecium strains. Plasmid pIP819 could also conjugate to E. faecalis, Streptococcus sanguis, S. pyogenes, S. lactis, and Listeria monocytogenes, in which it conferred inducible glycopeptide resistance, but not to S. aureus. Glycopeptide-inactivating activity was not detected, and the biochemical mechanism of resistance remains unknown. Based on this first report of transferable resistance to glycopeptides, we anticipate dissemination of resistance to these antibiotics in gram-positive cocci and bacilli in which it can be phenotypically expressed.
TI  - In vitro activity of ampicillin/sulbactam against enterococci determined by the time-kill method.
AB  - Time-kill studies demonstrated that at clinically achievable serum concentrations, ampicillin/sulbactam was equivalent in activity to ampicillin alone against non-beta-lactamase producing isolates of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium. Sulbactam possessed no antibacterial activity against these organisms. It is not yet known if the activity of ampicillin will be increased with the addition of sulbactam when tested against beta-lactamase-producing enterococci.
TI  - Laboratory detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in Enterococcus spp.
AB  - Methods for detection of high-level resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics were evaluated using 104 blood isolates of enterococci (97 Enterococcus faecalis and 7 Enterococcus faecium). Kanamycin was used to predict resistance to amikacin. Discrepancies between methods were resolved by time-kill studies. Four methods (MicroScan, macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion) for detecting resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin were compared, using 51 consecutive strains. There were 13 gentamicin-resistant strains, all of which were detected by macrotube, microtiter, and disk diffusion. MicroScan detected 2 (15%) of the 13. Of the 18 streptomycin-resistant strains, 17 (93%) were detected by disk diffusion, 16 (89%) by microtiter, 9 (50%) by macrotube, and 6 (33%) by MicroScan. An additional 53 consecutive strains were examined only by disk diffusion and microtiter for resistance to gentamicin, streptomycin, and kanamycin. The entire population of 104 strains contained 35 gentamicin-, 22 streptomycin-, and 54 kanamycin-resistant enterococcal isolates. All 35 gentamicin-resistant strains were detected by both methods. Of the 22 streptomycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 19 by both methods. Of the 54 kanamycin-resistant strains, 1 was detected only by microtiter, 2 only by disk diffusion, and 51 by both methods. One additional strain which was resistant only by disk diffusion was susceptible to amikacin plus penicillin by time-kill studies. Disk diffusion is a suitable method for detection of high-level aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol resistance in E. faecalis and is well suited for sporadic testing. Additional data are necessary to determine the suitability of these tests for E. faecium.
TI  - Histamine formation by enterococci isolated from home-made goat cheeses.
AB  - A survey was made of the histamine-producing capability of enterococci isolated from goat cheeses. The strains, 130 Streptococcus faecium and 106 S. faecalis, were grown in Trypticase Soy Broth Histidine medium (TSBH) at 35 degrees C for 24 h and the histamine formed was determined by fluorometry. Forty-one (31.5%) of the S. faecium strains and 2 (1.9%) of the S. faecalis strains produced histamine. The largest amount detected was 4.0 micrograms histamine/ml TSBH. Compared with the amounts of histamine produced by some Gram-negative bacteria, the histamine production by enterococci seems to be low. Under the present conditions the enterococci seem to have no relevance from a histamine intoxication point of view.
TI  - Differential methotrexate sensitivity: a test to distinguish Enterococcus faecalis from Enterococcus faecium.
AB  
TI  - High-level resistance to gentamicin in clinical isolates of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium.
AB  - During a 14-month period beginning in July 1986, three distinct clinical isolates of Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium demonstrating high-level resistance (MIC, greater than 2,000 micrograms/ml) to gentamicin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and streptomycin were recovered from individual patients at one institution. Combinations of ampicillin with any of these agents failed to show bactericidal synergism. By filter-mating techniques, high-level gentamicin resistance could be transferred into a susceptible recipient of the same species at frequencies as high as 1 x 10(-4); transfer into Streptococcus faecalis JH2-7 occurred at lower frequencies (less than 2 x 10(-7). Aminoglycoside substrate profile analysis of clinical isolates as well as of laboratory-derived cured strains and transconjugants revealed 2"-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (III) phosphorylating enzymes, AAC-6' acetylating activity above that attributable to the intrinsic activity characteristic of S. faecium, and a streptomycin adenylylating enzyme. All three isolates carried a 51-megadalton plasmid. Curing of this plasmid or conjugative transfer into susceptible recipients was associated with the loss or acquisition of high-level gentamicin resistance, respectively. Loss of high-level gentamicin resistance was also observed when curing techniques resulted in a decrease in the size of this plasmid equivalent to a 10-megadalton deletion. Transferable, high-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides, which was previously recognized in S. faecalis, has now emerged in clinical isolates of S. faecium, with the attendant concerns for possible spread.
TI  - Novel streptococcal mutants defective in the regulation of H+-ATPase biosynthesis and in F0 complex.
AB  - In Streptococcus faecalis (faecium), the cytoplasmic pH is regulated by proton extrusion via a proton translocating F1F0-ATPase; the level of this enzyme increases in response to cytoplasmic acidification (Kobayashi, H., Suzuki, T., and Unemoto, T. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 627-630). We describe here two novel acid-sensitive mutants, designated AS8 and AS17, that contain ATPase activity but fail to grow on acid media. Our data suggested that in mutant AS17, acidification of the cytoplasm stimulates synthesis of the F0 sector of the ATPase but not the F1 sector. The accumulation in the plasma membrane of F0 sectors devoid of F1 results in enhanced proton permeability, and as a consequence mutant AS17 is unable to regulate the cytoplasmic pH in acid media. The genetic defect may reside in a gene that regulates expression of the F1F0-ATPase. Mutant AS8 does not generate a proton motive force. Our results suggest that the F1F0-ATPase can hydrolyze ATP but fails to translocate protons due to a defect in one of the subunits of the F0 sector.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated resistance to vancomycin and teicoplanin in Enterococcus faecium.
AB  
TI  - [The degree of DNA homology in enterococci].
AB  - Studies carried out by the method of DNA-DNA hybridization have confirmed that Enterococcus faecalis, S. faecium and S. durans are independent species. As revealed in these studies, S. faecalis are homogeneous, genetically related and form an independent, sharply defined species, while S. faecium form a heterogeneous species. Mobile enterococci with yellow pigmentation must not be classified with both S. faecalis and S. faecium.
TI  - Synergistic effect of ampicillin or vancomycin in combination with decreasing concentrations of streptomycin against enterococci.
AB  - The extent of synergistic killing and duration of the post-antibiotic effect (PAE) was evaluated in streptomycin-susceptible strains of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium with 20 mcg/ml of ampicillin or 10 mcg/ml of vancomycin in combination with decreasing concentrations of streptomycin (20, 10, 5, 2, 1, 0.5 mcg/ml). The bactericidal activity or duration in recovery period declined progressively in a linear pattern with decreasing concentrations of streptomycin. One log10 or greater reduction in viable counts was seen with streptomycin concentrations of 2 mcg/ml or higher with both ampicillin and vancomycin. A synergistic increase in recovery period (PAE greater than or equal to 0.5 h) of ampicillin or vancomycin was observed with concentrations of streptomycin in excess of 2 mcg/ml and 1 mcg/ml, respectively. These results suggest that lower dosage of streptomycin in the therapy of enterococcal infections will probably result in a higher relapse rate.
TI  - Vancomycin-resistant Streptococcaceae from clinical material.
AB  - Three strains of vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, belonging to the family Streptococcaceae, were isolated from patient samples. Two were identified as Leuconostoc species, the other one as Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecium. The clinical significance of vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive bacteria is discussed.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin.
AB  - We have studied the in-vitro activity of erythromycin, vancomycin and pristinamycin against 1,006 clinical isolates comprising streptococci, staphylococci, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus influenzae and anaerobes. In-vitro studies show pristinamycin to inhibit staphylococci and streptococci, including erythromycin highly-resistant organisms, at a concentration of less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. Although pristinamycin's mean MIC for streptococci is higher than that of erythromycin, pristinamycin is bactericidal, whereas erythromycin is bacteristatic against Streptococcus agalactiae and oral streptococci. Enterococci were less uniformly susceptible to pristinamycin: 58 of the 94 Enterococcus faecalis tested were resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 3.12 mg/l). 14 of the 15 isolates of Enterococcus faecium were inhibited by less than or equal to 1.56 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin showed poor activity against Haemophilus influenzae (mode MIC 1.56 and MIC90 of 3.12 mg/l) but all except two of the 100 Neisseria gonorrhoeae tested were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l pristinamycin. Pristinamycin inhibited all nine Clostridium spp. at less than or equal to 0.39 mg/l and 38 of 40 strains of anaerobic gram-positive cocci at less than or equal to 0.78 mg/l. It was less effective against the Bacteroides fragilis group: (MIC90 3.12 mg/l). Pristinamycin had poor bactericidal activity against the anaerobes tested.
TI  - Comparative killing activity and postantibiotic effect of streptomycin combined with ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin or vancomycin against strains of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Nine strains of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium were studied with respect to ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin, vancomycin and streptomycin. Two strains were highly resistant (MIC greater than or equal to 2,000 micrograms/ml) to streptomycin. Evaluation and comparison of the killing activity with killing curves, and duration of the postantibiotic effect (PAE) after exposure for 1 h with regrowth curves was done with combinations of antibiotics or alone. The overall killing effect of ciprofloxacin with streptomycin was antagonistic, whereas synergism (greater than or equal to one log10 decrease in viable counts) was observed in streptomycin-susceptible strains with combinations of streptomycin and ampicillin, imipenem, piperacillin or vancomycin. In addition, prolongation of PAE (greater than or equal to 0.5 h) was seen only in streptomycin-susceptible strains. Thus, seven (100%) strains showed a synergistic increase in PAE to combinations with ampicillin and vancomycin, three (43%) to imipenem, four (57%) to piperacillin, but none to the combination of streptomycin and ciprofloxacin. A significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of increased killing and the extent of increase in recovery period with combinations of streptomycin with either ampicillin or vancomycin.
TI  - Impact of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone on the bowel and vaginal flora after single-dose prophylaxis in vaginal hysterectomy.
AB  - The aim of this randomised controlled study was to investigate the effect of a preoperative, single dose, intravenous injection of ceftriaxone 2g and cefotaxime 2g in 2 groups of 30 patients who underwent vaginal hysterectomy. The parameters were: efficacy and tolerance; impact on the aerobic bowel and vaginal flora; and serum concentrations. There were no significant differences in efficacy, haematology or clinical chemistry parameters. In the ceftriaxone group 2 patients had exanthemas, 2 had diarrhoea. In the cefotaxime group no such side effects occurred. Serum concentrations were 9.75 and 0.07 mg/L for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime, respectively, after 24 and 12 hours, respectively. Ceftriaxone had a pronounced and continuous effect on the bowel flora: Streptococcus faecium and Candida spp. increased, reaching counts of 10(8) and 10(7) organisms/g faeces, respectively, at day 10. Under cefotaxime no dramatic alteration was determined and growth of Candida spp. was not influenced. Growth of Escherichia coli and other bacteria of the vaginal flora was not influenced by either drug. Overgrowth of Candida spp. under ceftriaxone was significant (p less than 0.05) compared with that under cefotaxime. The results of this study indicate that the high biliary excretion of ceftriaxone (45%) and its long acting properties are responsible for the high selection pressure and overgrowth of Candida. Cefotaxime, a drug with low biliary excretion (5%) and shorter action, had only a negligible effect on the microflora with quick normalisation. The observed overgrowth of Candida spp., even after a single injection of ceftriaxone, could cause problems when this drug is being used for surgical prophylaxis or treatment. This applies especially to immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Establishment of a typing system for group D streptococci.
AB  - Group D streptococci (n = 971, 4037 samples, 139 patients) were isolated from two intensive care units. Differentiation and typing revealed 6 species, 25 phage types, and 85 enterococcinotypes. Distribution of species showed strong differences especially concerning Enterococcus faecium which was rarely isolated from extraintestinal sites (5.9%). Phage typing was species specific and discriminated Enterococcus faecalis (n = 703 typable isolates, 19 phage types) and the other group D streptococci (n = 63 typable isolates, 6 phage types). Based on the production of enterococcines (15 indicator strains used) the isolates could be classified into 6 groups, one of which was further subdivided into 3 subgroups. Enterococcus faecalis ssp. liquefaciens (n = 618), phage type V6b (n = 596), and enterococcine group IVc (n = 568) were most common. The combined use of markers resulted in 187 combinations, which demonstrated the valuable properties of the system.
TI  - The effect of growth-promoting antibiotics on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  - Small groups of chickens were given feed containing either avoparcin, nitrovin, virginiamycin or zinc bacitracin from the day of their purchase as day-olds. Differences between the birds receiving growth promoters and the untreated controls were observed during the last third of the 23 d survey period. The enterococcal population of the 'dosed' birds contained a greater proportion of Enterococcus faecium than did that of the control birds while the converse was true for Ent. gallinarum. This apparent selection of Ent. faecium by the growth-promoting antibiotics had an influence on the incidence of resistance to therapeutic antibiotics among the enterococcal population as a whole. This was because this species was generally more resistant than Ent. gallinarum to cephalothin, the MLS antibiotics (erythromycin, lincomycin and tylosin) and tetracycline.
TI  - In vitro selection of bacteria resistant to LY146032, a new cyclic lipopeptide.
AB  - Isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and coagulase-positive and -negative staphylococci were investigated for their abilities, in vitro, to develop resistance to LY146032. Exposure of the organisms to incremental concentrations of LY146032 resulted in MICs 8- to 32-fold higher than those for the original isolates. After three passages on antibiotic-free medium, the high MICs were maintained for the coagulase-negative staphylococci and pneumococci, with a twofold decrease observed for the enterococci and a fourfold decrease observed for Staphylococcus aureus. The frequency of spontaneous emergence of resistance was highest with S. pneumoniae (1.2 X 10(-6) at 16 times the original MIC) and lowest with S. aureus (7.0 X 10(-10) at 8 times the original MIC). For bacteria For bacteria surviving time-kill studies MICs were also higher than were those for the original isolates. Exposure to LY146032 in vitro selected for strains with decreased susceptibilities to the antimicrobial agent. However, the emergence of resistance in vivo is unpredictable and can be evaluated only after prolonged clinical use of the drug.
TI  - Comparison of the post-antibiotic effect of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium with ampicillin alone or combined with streptomycin: studies on a novel type of antimicrobial interaction.
AB  - Determination of post-antibiotic effect (PAE) and time-kill studies were made with twelve strains of Streptococcus faecalis and nine strains of Streptococcus faecium, comparing the effect of ampicillin alone with a combination of ampicillin and streptomycin at achievable serum concentrations. Bactericidal synergism (greater than or equal to one log10 decrease in viable counts) and prolongation in PAE (greater than or equal to 0.5 h) were demonstrated in all streptomycin-susceptible strains (Minimum inhibitory Concentration less than 2000 mcg/ml), whereas only one of five highly streptomycin-resistant strains exhibited a synergistic effect. A significant correlation between the magnitude of increased killing and the increase in recovery period by the combinations of ampicillin and streptomycin was demonstrated.
TI  - Bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities of beta-lactams against Streptococcus  (Enterococcus) faecium are associated with saturation of different penicillin-binding proteins.
AB  - The MICs and MBCs of benzylpenicillin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, and methicillin were evaluated against a Streptococcus (Enterococcus) faecium wild-type strain and against three mutants hyperproducing PBP 5 in cells incubated at both optimal and suboptimal temperatures. In the wild-type strain grown at optimal temperature, the MBCs of all beta-lactams were significantly greater than the MICs (bacteriostatic effect). As opposed to this, in the same cells grown at suboptimal temperature and in the mutants hyperproducing PBP 5 at all temperatures, the MICs of all antibiotics coincided with the MBCs (bactericidal effect). Under all conditions in which the MIC and MBC were the same, with all antibiotics, growth inhibition occurred only at the minimal concentration saturating all penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) (or at higher concentrations). On the contrary, under conditions in which the MIC was lower than the MBC, only some of the PBPs were saturated (or bound) at both the MIC and the MBC, PBP 5 in no case being either saturated or bound. Under all conditions in which saturation of all PBPs was needed for growth inhibition, cells died at all antibiotic MBCs with kinetics which were much faster than those with which they died at the MBCs under conditions in which not all PBPs were saturated (or bound). In addition, under the former conditions, antibiotic concentrations above the MBCs did not significantly accelerate cell death kinetics, while under the latter conditions there was an acceleration in kinetics with increasing antibiotic concentrations up to full saturation of PBPs. It is suggested that the killing that occurs when all PBPs are saturated is a direct consequence of inactivation of PBP functions, while killing occurring when only some of them are saturated or bound is also (or mainly) an indirect consequence of inability of cells to grow and that, in S. faecium, the targets for growth inhibition and cell killing reside in different PBPs: for the latter effect, inactivation of one (or more) of the high-molecular-weight PBPs is sufficient, whereas in the former case inactivation of PBP 5 is necessary (after saturation of all other PBPs).
TI  - Role of immunoblotting in the diagnosis of culture negative and enterococcal endocarditis.
AB  - Serum samples from patients with endocarditis and septicaemia due to Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus bovis, and Streptococcus sanguis were immunoblotted against antigenic extracts from all four species. In E faecalis endocarditis there was a strong IgM response to E faecalis antigenic bands of 112, 88-90, and 45-47 Kd and a strong IgG response to 88-90 and 45-47 Kd bands. In E faecium endocarditis there was a pronounced IgG response to an E faecium band of 82-90 Kd. For S bovis endocarditis, there was a strong IgG response to several components of S bovis including bands of 66, 58, 52 and 4 Kd. For S sanguis, there was a strong IgG response to bands of 80-82, 76, 60 and 45 Kd. These patterns of antibody production were absent in patients with uncomplicated septicaemia and in controls. The delineation of these patterns enabled confirmation of the final diagnosis in seven patients initially suspected of having culture negative endocarditis.
TI  - Effect of acidity and antimicrobial agent-like compounds on viability of Plesiomonas shigelloides.
AB  - Nineteen Plesiomonas shigelloides strains were evaluated for their stability at acidic and slightly alkaline pHs and for their susceptibility to antimicrobial agent-like compounds produced by enteric flora. Most P. shigelloides isolates were rapidly inactivated under high-acid (pH 4 or less) conditions. Screening of enteric bacteria for elaboration of factors active against P. shigelloides revealed two organisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Streptococcus [Enterococcus] faecium) capable of secreting such inhibitory substances. The results of this study suggest some factors potentially important in regulating gastrointestinal colonization by P. shigelloides from environmental sources.
TI  - Comparative survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive fecal indicator bacteria in estuarine water.
AB  - The survival of antibiotic-resistant and -sensitive strains of Escherichia coli,  Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus equinus, and two environmental isolates, AP17 and AQ62, was examined in estuarine water. Each strain was rendered resistant to a combination of two antibiotics by serial passage in increasing concentrations of antibiotics. Cultures were incubated in filter-sterilized estuarine water for up to 7 days. Recovery was assessed by examining colony-forming ability on media with and without antibiotics. None of the antibiotic-resistant forms survived longer than its antibiotic-sensitive counterpart in estuarine water. Three of the resistant strains died off more rapidly than the antibiotic-sensitive wild type. Survival of the test bacteria in estuarine water was as follows: sensitive and resistant AQ62, resistant Escherichia coli less than sensitive Escherichia coli less than resistant AP17 less than resistant Enterococcus faecium less than sensitive AP17, sensitive and resistant S. equinus less than sensitive and resistant Enterococcus faecalis, sensitive Enterococcus faecium. The results supported the suggestion that fecal entercocci may serve as better indicators of fecal pollution than Escherichia coli in marine ecosystems. Moreover, the results indicated that the use of antibiotic-resistant mutants to follow the fate of bacteria in the environment is inappropriate without adequate studies to ensure that resistant and wild-type strains react similarly to environmental stressors.
TI  - The effect of ampicillin and tylosin on the faecal enterococci of healthy young chickens.
AB  - Enterococcal isolates from young chickens were differentiated into one of three species, namely Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Ent. gallinarum. The proportion of each species among the enterococcal population changed with time in birds not dosed with antibiotics. This pattern of change was modified in birds dosed with either tylosin or ampicillin even though ampicillin did not select for ampicillin resistance among the enterococcal population. A gradual increase in tylosin resistance was recorded with time among the enterococci of the 'undosed' control birds. This was associated with an increase in the proportion of Ent. faecium, a species commonly resistant to tylosin, among the enterococci of the birds as they grew older.
TI  - Identification of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium and susceptibility studies with newly developed antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Identification and susceptibility studies were performed on 301 blood and urine Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium isolates. Strep Trio-Tubes S4, S5, and S3 (Carr-Scarborough Microbiologicals, Inc.) were compared with conventional methods for accuracy and rapidity. Of 282 isolates identified as S. faecalis, 98% were identified by species in 4 h with Trio-Tubes; the same percentage of isolates analyzed by conventional methods were identified in 24 h. All 14 S. faecium isolates (approximately 5% of the total number of isolates) were identified by Trio-Tubes in 24 h. In vitro MIC susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed by the Dynatech 2000 microdilution technique (Dynatech Laboratories, Inc.). Several newly developed antimicrobial agents, including imipenem (a carbapenem) and some of the quinolone drugs, i.e., CI-934, ciprofloxacin, A-56619, A-56620, amifloxacin, norfloxacin, and enoxacin, were tested, as were ampicillin, erythromycin, and vancomycin. Both ampicillin and vancomycin showed good activity against S. faecalis, with MICs for 90% of isolates tested (MIC90S) of 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively; with S. faecium, ampicillin exhibited an MIC90 of 16 micrograms/ml and vancomycin exhibited an MIC90 of 2 micrograms/ml. Of the newer antimicrobial agents, imipenem and CI-934 exhibited the greatest activity against S. faecalis strains, with MIC90S of 2 and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. MBCs against the isolates were determined with CI-934, with 90% of S. faecalis strains showing MBCs of 1 microgram/ml or less.
TI  - Intergeneric protoplast fusion between Fusobacterium varium and Enterococcus faecium for enhancing dehydrodivanillin degradation.
AB  - Intergeneric protoplast fusion between Fusobacterium varium (Pcs Glu+) and Enterococcus faecium (Pcr Glu-) was performed under strictly anaerobic conditions to improve dehydrodivanillin (DDV) degradation. The fusion frequency obtained from the selective medium (Pc+ Glu-) was about 0.9 X 10(-5) to 1.3 X 10(-5). The seven fusants isolated were all gram-negative anaerobes with rod shapes like that of F. varium and with main phenotypical properties of cocci like those of E. faecium such as esculin and starch hydrolysis, milk clotting, and lactate production. Five fusants showed enhanced DDV degradation activities that were 2 to 4 times higher than those of parental strains. Genetic relatedness between a fusant (FE7) and the parents was estimated by DNA-DNA Southern blot hybridization with 32P-labeled chromosomal DNA fragments of F. varium and E. faecium as respective probes. The fusant FE7 presented a very high cross-hybridization with both probes, indicating a high DNA homology between the fusant and both parental strains. Almost all the fusants obtained here have stably kept the properties described above for about 2 years. These results suggest that intergeneric gene transfer takes place through protoplast fusion and that the fusants that were obtained are stable recombinants.
TI  - Penicillin-binding proteins in Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium.
AB  - Penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of Streptococcus faecalis NCTC 775, S. faecium NCTC 7171 and an isolate of S. faecium (strain 37) highly resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics were visualised by autoradiography. Five PBPs were detected in S. faecalis NCTC 775 and six in S. faecium NCTC 7171. Additional PBPs could not be found in the resistant isolate of S. faecium. The PBP affinities of beta lactams were compared with MIC values. The affinities of PBPs 3 and 4 of S. faecalis NCTC 775 for penicillin G, ampicillin, cefathiamidine, cephaloridine and cephazolin were related to the sensitivity of the strain to these antibiotics as were the affinities of PBPs 4 and 5 in each S. faecium strain for the beta lactams. It is postulated that PBPs 3 and 4 of S. faecalis NCTC 775 and PBPs 4 and 5 of S. faecium are the relevant target enzymes of the test antibiotics. PBPs 4 and 5 of the highly beta-lactam-resistant S. faecium strain 37 showed proportionally low affinities for the five beta lactams compared to that of the less resistant strain S. faecium NCTC 7171. Decreased affinities of PBPs 4 and 5 may account for the resistance in S. faecium strain 37 to beta lactams. The affinities for PBP 1, 2 and 5 in S. faecalis NCTC 775 and PBPs 1, 2, 3 and 6 in S. faecium were not related to the antibiotic sensitivities.
TI  - [A case of septicemia due to Enterococcus faecium in an infant].
AB  
TI  - Biotyping, serotyping and phage typing of Streptococcus faecalis isolated from dental plaque in the human mouth.
AB  - Thirty Streptococcus faecalis isolates from mixed dental plaque samples were classified into four groups on the basis of biotype, tetracycline susceptibility, phage type and serotype combinations. The organisms were from patients on haemodialysis, from staff of the dialysis unit, and from controls. Three biotypes were distinguished by seven biochemical tests: production of acid from inositol, sucrose and xylose; rapid or delayed production of acid from sorbitol; gelatin liquefaction; and production of alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase. With a set of eight typing antisera for S. faecalis, 15 strains were non-typable, 12 were serotype 1 and three were serotype 19. With a set of 17 bacteriophages specific for S. faecalis, all of the oral isolates were typable; 40% were lysotype I1 and the remainder lysotype V6b. On the basis of biotype-serotype-phage-type combinations, indications of possible spread of strains between haemodialysis patients and dialysis unit staff were obtained. Biotyping and serotyping of 13 German isolates of S. faecalis of phage type I1 from four clinical sources and tripartite typing of three control strains provided additional evidence for the potential of biotyping in distinguishing between strains of identical serotype and phage type. One oral isolate of S. faecium was of phage type XX. None of the oral isolates of S. faecalis, of which 14 exhibited delayed sorbitol fermentation, reacted with group-G streptococcal grouping reagents or antiserum. Slow sorbitol fermentation does not appear to be a definitive phenotypic marker for S. faecalis strains possessing antigens that react with both group-D and group-G grouping reagents.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against gram-positive cocci.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY146032 was compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents against gram-positive cocci. MICs of LY146032 were lowest for Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (0.25 mg/l). For methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus the MICs were 1 mg/l, for Enterococcus faecalis 2 mg/l and for Enterococcus faecium 4 mg/l. The activity of LY146032 was in general higher than that of vancomycin. Time-kill studies showed LY146032 had higher bactericidal activity than vancomycin against a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain, and bactericidal activity against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY146032 (daptomycin) against selected aerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new lipopeptide antibiotic LY146032 was generally four-fold greater (MIC 90 less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml) than that of vancomycin against methicillin-susceptible or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative species of Staphylococcus. Enterococci, Streptococcus bovis, group B and viridans streptococci, and Corynebacterium group J-K isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml of LY146032, which represented activity equivalent to or greater than that of vancomycin. Unlike vancomycin, LY146032 was bactericidal for Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Listeria monocytogenes. Due to its bactericidal properties LY146032 appeared to represent an improvement over vancomycin and teicoplanin.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cAD1) response: evidence that the peptide inhibitor excreted by pAD1-containing cells may be plasmid determined.
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis strains harboring the conjugative plasmid pAD1 excrete a small peptide, iAD1, which inhibits the sex pheromone cAD1. Studies making use of the host strain Streptococcus faecium 9790, which normally does not excrete peptide pheromones, suggest that iAD1 may be determined directly by pAD1.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of teicoplanin and other antimicrobials against streptococci  group D bacteria.
AB  - In vitro activities of teicoplanin were compared with those of ampicillin, imipenem, rifampicin, coumermycin and vancomycin against clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecalis (n = 100) and Streptococcus faecium (n = 30). Against Str. faecalis, ampicillin and imipenem had an MIC90 and MBC90 of 3.9 micrograms/ml. Coumermycin and rifampicin had poor bactericidal activity with MBC90 values of 31.2 and 62.5 micrograms/ml. Teicoplanin was extremely active with an MIC90 of 0.95 microgram/ml and an MBC90 of 1.86 micrograms/ml.
TI  - Dispersal of a plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance gene in streptococcal and enterococcal plasmids.
AB  - Plasmids coding for chloramphenicol resistance, five isolated from streptococci of groups A, B, and G, ten from enterococci (Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium), and two from staphylococci, were tested for sequence homology with the chloramphenicol resistance gene of pIP501, a 30-kb plasmid originally isolated from a group B Streptococcus. The 6.3-kb HindIII fragment of pIP501, known to carry the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was cloned into pBR322. A 1.6-kb portion of the cloned fragment, which included most of the chloramphenicol resistance gene, was used as probe in DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. Sequence homology was detected between the probe and four of the streptococcal, seven of the enterococcal, and one of the staphylococcal plasmids. The absence of hybridization between this probe and one plasmid isolated from a group B Streptococcus, as well as three isolated from E. faecalis, indicated that there are at least two different plasmid-borne chloramphenicol resistance determinants in the streptococci and in the enterococci.
TI  - In vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone antimicrobial, against gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of CI-934, a new quinolone antimicrobial, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin against selected gram-positive bacteria. Concentrations of CI-934 required to inhibit 90% of strains (MIC90) were twofold to eightfold lower than those of ciprofloxacin. With the exception of Streptococcus faecium, all isolates were inhibited by CI-934 at concentrations less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml.
TI  - Protoplast formation and regeneration of dehydrodivanillin-degrading strains of Fusobacterium varium and Enterococcus faecium.
AB  - Two strains of rumen anaerobes isolated from dehydrodivanillin-degrading cultures were identified as Fusobacterium varium and Enterococcus faecium. These organisms degraded dehydrodivanillin synergistically to 5-carboxymethylvanillin and vanillic acid. Specific conditions for protoplast formation and cell wall regeneration for both bacteria were determined, under strictly anaerobic conditions, to be as follows. The cell wall of each bacterium in yeast extract medium was loosened by adding penicillin G during early log-phase growth. The cell wall of F. varium was lysed by lysozyme (1 mg/ml) in glycerol (0.2 M)-phosphate buffer (0.05 M; pH 7.0). The addition of NaCl (0.08 M) with lysozyme was necessary for lysis of E. faecium in this solution. Almost all cells were converted to protoplasts after 2 h of incubation at 37 degrees C. Regeneration of both protoplasts was 20 to 30% on an agar-containing yeast extract medium.
TI  - Susceptibility of enterococci. II. Inhibitory and bactericidal activity of drugs  in combination against Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - The microbiological utility of antibiotic combinations against Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium strains was studied. The drugs used were netilmicin + amoxicillin (20 strains); netilmicin + piperacillin (20 strains); netilmicin- + vancomycin (20 strains); netilmicin + rifampicin (20 strains). Netilmicin used in combination with the penicillins was advantageous against Streptococcus faecalis, but not uniformly against Streptococcus faecium. The combinations of netilmicin with vancomycin or rifampicin were no more effective than the single drugs in most cases, although the response varied for the different strains of the two species.
TI  - Susceptibility of enterococci. I. Inhibitory and bactericidal activity of several chemoantibiotics against Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - The authors present a microbiological study of 100 strains of Enterococcus (70 strains of Streptococcus faecalis and 30 strains of Streptococcus faecium) tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics, amoxicillin, ampicillin + flucloxacillin, piperacillin, rifampicin, vancomycin, netilmicin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. The assessment of minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations of these substances indicates that all have good inhibitory activity except netilmicin, which is active at higher concentrations; with rifampicin and vancomycin showing very poor bactericidal activity. The bactericidal activity of penicillins was hard to assess because of tolerance and paradoxical effect phenomena. The quinolones showed good inhibitory and bactericidal activity.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of netilmicin compared with gentamicin and streptomycin, alone and in combination with penicillin, against penicillin tolerant viridans streptococci and enterococci.
AB  - Netilmicin was compared with gentamicin and streptomycin for in-vitro activity against 30 strains of penicillin-tolerant streptococci including 16 strains of enterococci. Both netilmicin and gentamicin tested alone at 4 mg/l caused 99.9% kill of more than half of the 13 strains of viridans streptococci tested, whereas streptomycin, 4 mg/l, had no bactericidal effect against these strains. Netilmicin, gentamicin and streptomycin tested alone at 8.0 mg/l against 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis resulted in 99.9% kill of six, one and zero strains respectively. Combinations of penicillin with 2 mg/l of either netilmicin or gentamicin resulted in bactericidal synergy against 12 of 13 strains of viridans streptococci and all 10 strains of S. faecalis after 18 to 24 h incubation. Parallel experiments showed that higher concentration of penicillin were required to obtain 99.9% kill of 10 streptococcal strains when 4 mg/l streptomycin was compared with 2 mg/l of the other aminoglycosides. Killing curves showed similar bactericidal synergy for netilmicin-penicillin and gentamicin-penicillin combinations against most streptococci tested after 24 h incubation but there was sometimes a greater bactericidal effect noted with netilmicin after only 6 h incubation of the broth or after 48 h incubation. The results of this in-vitro study suggest that netilmicin is at least as effective as gentamicin as a bactericidal synergic agent with penicillin against penicillin-tolerant viridans streptococci and S. faecalis strains isolated from patients with endocarditis. Neither gentamicin or netilmicin were effective as bactericidal synergic agents with penicillin against 4 of 6 strains of S. faecium tested.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of LY 146032, a new cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic.
AB  - The in vitro activity of LY 146032, a cyclic lipopeptide antibiotic belonging to  the class of agents designated A21978C, was compared with those of vancomycin, cefpirome, cefotaxime, and clindamycin against selected gram-positive bacteria. The new drug inhibited all staphylococcal isolates, including methicillin-resistant strains, at concentrations of less than or equal to 1.0 microgram/ml. The activity of LY 146032 was comparable to that of vancomycin against most streptococci, but the latter demonstrated greater potency against Streptococcus faecium and penicillin-resistant strains of pneumococci and viridans group streptococci. LY 146032 was markedly less active than vancomycin against Listeria monocytogenes (MICs for 90% of strains tested, 16 and 1.0 microgram/ml, respectively). The activity of LY 146032 was enhanced as the concentration of calcium in the test medium was increased. MBCs were within eightfold of the MIC for each of 12 strains tested. In a rat model of enterococcal endocarditis, the administration of LY 146032 resulted in increased survival and a reduction in the bacterial titer within cardiac vegetations compared with untreated control animals.
TI  - Use of penicillin-binding proteins for the identification of enterococci.
AB  - The results of 20 physiological and fermentation tests and examination of the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of 85 enterococcal strains demonstrated that the genus Enterococcus could be divided into at least nine distinct species: E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. durans, E. hirae, E. avium, E. gallinarum, E. casseliflavus, E. malodoratus and E. mundtii. Each species had a specific pattern of at least five PBPs, with molecular masses in the range of about 40-130 kDa. The pattern of PBPs may be useful for identification purposes, since some strains with unusual fermentation characteristics were assigned to species by this technique.
TI  - Cell surface hydrophobicity of group D and viridans streptococci isolated from patients with septicaemia.
AB  - Sixty-three strains of Group D streptococci and viridans streptococci isolated from blood cultures during a two year period were typed to the species level with conventional biochemical tests and API Strep. Streptococcus faecalis was the most common species isolated followed by S. sanguis, S. mitis and S. constellatus (S. milleri). One of the two isolates of S. faecium was a contamination. The reported increasing frequency of this organism and other Group D and viridans streptococci as well as the association of S. bovis with malignant bowel disease indicate the need for full identification of streptococcal isolates from blood cultures. Pronounced surface hydrophobicity as measured with the salt aggregation test (SAT) was expressed by 59/63 (94%) of the blood culture isolates whereas strains isolated from commercial fermentation products and strains passaged several times were hydrophilic. In the presence of human serum albumin which binds to lipoteichoic acid only one strain decreased in surface hydrophobicity. The surface hydrophobicity of two strains even slightly increased indicating that lipoteichoic acid but marginally contributes to surface hydrophobicity of streptococcal cells from these species.
TI  - [Typing of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium strains with bacteriophages].
AB  - With a set of 17 bacteriophages specific for Streptococcus faecalis and a set of  7 bacteriophages specific for Streptococcus faecium 441 strains of S. faecalis and 53 strains of S. faecium were typed. The species identification was done by means of the API 20 STREP system. For S. faecalis 22 and for S. faecium 12 lysotypes were found. Among S. faecalis strains lysotype V6b was most common (27%), followed by the lysotypes XV (9,5%), XIII1 (7%), II1 (5,7%), and I1 (4,3%). These 5 lysotypes comprised 54% of all 441 strains. 21% of the strains of S. faecalis and 6 from 53 strains of S. faecium were untypable. Strains of S. faecium were most frequently isolated from faeces and in rare cases from urine. To the contrary 50% of the S. faecalis strains were isolated from urine. There was no correlation between special lysotypes and age of the patients or the source of specimen. The results of phage typing of several strains from one patient, and especially of strains from mothers and their newborns suggest the usefulness of the typing system to clarify epidemiological questions.
TI  - Transferable resistance and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in enterococci.
AB  - Ten isolates of Streptococcus faecalis and two isolates of S. faecium were studied together with an NCTC strain of each species. Antibiotic susceptibility tests showed different patterns of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides. Three S. faecalis strains were highly resistant to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides. By means of a filter membrane technique, transfer of high-level resistance to aminoglycosides was demonstrated from S. faecalis to S. faecalis, from S. faecium to S. faecalis and from S. faecalis to S. faecium, the last of which has not previously been described. Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were assayed with radiolabelled cofactors. High-level resistance to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides could be attributed to the production of 2''-O-phosphotransferases, 3'-O-phosphotransferases, 6-O-adenylyltransferases and 6'-N-acetyltransferases. Other resistance mechanisms accounted for resistance in two strains of S. faecalis and one strain of S. faecium that were highly resistant only to streptomycin and one S. faecalis strain that was moderately resistant to all aminoglycosides. A low level of 6'-N-acetyltransferases was detected in the three strains of S. faecium but this did not confer high-level resistance to aminoglycosides and this trait could not be transferred.
TI  - Screening for new antifolates of microbial origin and a new antifolate AM-8402.
AB  - A screening method was established for new specific inhibitors of folate metabolism. Culture broths of soil isolates were selected based on relative microbial activity. A culture, to be retained, must be active against Enterococcus faecium grown in a medium which contains a limited amount of pteroic acid but lacks activity against the microorganism grown in a medium supplemented with thymidine. By this screening method, three new antibiotics, diazaquinomycins A and B and AM-8402 were selected from eight thousand soil isolates. The isolation and structures of diazaquinomycins have been reported. AM-8402 is a new antifolate active against Gram-positive bacteria and mycoplasmas. It consists of a nanaomycin D moiety as chromophore and a deoxysugar and is structurally related to medermycin.
TI  - One or two low affinity penicillin-binding proteins may be responsible for the range of susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium to benzylpenicillin.
AB  - Three benzylpenicillin-resistant, clinical isolates of Enterococcus faecium (MIC  values 16-64 micrograms ml-1) contained six penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), of which PBP5 was the most abundant and had the lowest affinity for the antibiotic. Four benzylpenicillin-susceptible strains (MIC values 0.031-0.5 microgram ml-1) were obtained as spontaneous derivatives from these above organisms. There were significant decreases in the amounts of PBP5 in each of the derivatives, with the concomitant appearance of a new, higher affinity PBP (5*) in three strains. Increased amounts of PBP5, with no changes in PBP5*, were found in several mutants with intermediate-level benzylpenicillin-resistance (MIC values 1-8 micrograms ml-1) selected from two of the susceptible strains. Examination of 18 other clinical isolates, with a wide range of susceptibilities to benzylpenicillin (MIC values 0.062-128 micrograms ml-1), showed that PBP5* was present in 13 strains, and PBP5 in all of them, but in differing amounts. The results concerning the relative amounts and relative affinities of PBPs 5* and 5 allowed the categorization of the various strains into six groups, within which organisms had somewhat similar susceptibilities to benzylpenicillin.
TI  - Diazaquinomycin A, a new antifolate antibiotic, inhibits thymidylate synthase.
AB  - The inhibitory effect of diazaquinomycin A (DQM) on the growth of Enterococcus faecium was completely reversed by thymidine. Relatively large amounts of folate, dihydrofolate or leucovorin also reversed the activity of DQM. DQM showed cytotoxicity against Vero and Raji cells and the cytotoxicity was partially reversed by leucovorin or thymidine. With enzyme experiments, it was found that DQM inhibits TMP synthases from E. faecium and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma competitively with 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, one of the substrates for the enzyme reaction.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpirome (HR 810), teicoplanin and four other antimicrobials against enterococci.
AB  - In-vitro activities of cefpirome (HR 810), a fourth generation cephalosporin, and teicoplanin were compared with those of ampicillin, piperacillin, and vancomycin against 56 clinical isolates of enterococci. Cefpirome had good activity with the MIC90 and MBC90 being 4 and 16 mg/l. Ampicillin and piperacillin had MBC90 of 4 and 16 mg/l. Teicoplanin was extremely active with the MIC90 being 1.6 mg/l while vancomycin had poor cidal activity with the MBC90 being 16 mg/l. A decrease in activity of cefpirome was noted when the inoculum size was increased from 10(3) to 10(7) organisms per ml. Synergy was demonstrated against most Streptococcus faecium isolates with a combination of cefpirome and gentamicin or piperacillin. Against Str. faecalis, with a similar combination, synergy was seen in less than 50% isolates. No antagonism was noted with any of the antibiotic combinations.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis sex pheromone (cAM373) also produced by Staphylococcus aureus and identification of a conjugative transposon (Tn918).
AB  - Streptococcus faecalis RC73 was found to harbor a conjugative plasmid (pAM373) which confers a mating response to a sex pheromone (cAM373) excreted by plasmid-free members of the same species. The pheromone was also detected in culture filtrates of all of 23 Staphylococcus aureus strains but in only 2 of 22 coagulase negative staphylococcus strains. Streptococcus sanguis Challis and G9B also produced the activity, but 10 other Streptococcus sanguis strains did not. The activity was also produced by Streptococcus faecium 9790. A tetracycline resistance (Tc) determinant present in S. faecalis RC73 was not associated with pAM373 but served as a useful marker in efforts to identify pAM373 among other plasmids present in the strain. Analyses of the Tc determinant showed that it was located on a conjugative transposon very similar to Tn916. Designated Tn918, the transposon could insert into pAM373 as well as into two other hemolysin plasmids. Whereas pAM373 derivatives transferred very well between strains of Streptococcus faecalis, the plasmid would not establish in Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus sanguis. However, a derivative of pAM373 carrying Tn918 proved to be a useful delivery vehicle for generating transposon insertions into multiple sites on the staphylococcal chromosome.
TI  - Susceptibility of enterococci to trimethoprim and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
AB  - The in vitro activities of trimethoprim (TMP), alone and in combination with sulfamethoxazole (SMX), against 131 clinical isolates of enterococci, 126 Streptococcus faecalis isolates, and 5 Streptococcus faecium isolates were determined by a broth microdilution method with Mueller-Hinton broth that was substantially free of inhibitory substances. The geometric mean MIC of TMP for strains of S. faecalis was 0.164 micrograms/ml (range, 0.03 to 8 micrograms/ml), with a geometric mean MBC of 0.298 micrograms/ml (range, 0.063 to 8 micrograms/ml). Although all strains were resistant to the sulfonamide alone, the inhibitory and bactericidal activities of TMP against strains of S. faecalis were markedly potentiated when TMP was combined in a fixed ratio of 1:19 with SMX; the geometric mean MIC of TMP was reduced to 0.016 micrograms/ml (range, 0.002 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), with a geometric mean MBC of 0.031 micrograms/ml (range, 0.004 to 0.25 micrograms/ml). The combination had no synergistic effect against strains of S. faecium; the geometric mean MICs and MBCs of both agents were ca. 0.06 micrograms/ml. The MBC/MIC ratios for TMP and TMP-SMX were less than or equal to 16 for all 131 strains. MICs and MBCs for TMP-SMX were unchanged, and for TMP they decreased when performed in broth supplemented with 50% heat-inactivated pooled human serum. For TMP and TMP-SMX, the susceptibilities of isolates with high-level resistance to gentamicin or streptomycin were the same as those of isolates susceptible to less than or equal to 2,000 micrograms of aminoglycoside per ml. These results suggest that TMP-SMX and TMP alone could prove useful in the treatment of serious enterococcal infections, including infections by strains with high-level resistance to aminoglycosides.
TI  - Gram-positive superinfections following beta-lactam chemotherapy: the significance of the enterococcus.
AB  - The recent literature was reviewed with regard to the risks of superinfection following beta-lactam chemotherapy. The summary publications for the pseudomonas-active penicillins (azlocillin, carbenicillin, mezlocillin, piperacillin and ticarcillin), cefoperazone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem and moxalactam show marked variations. Moxalactam was most likely to produce both gram-negative (5-38%) and enterococcal (2.2-12%) superinfections. Ceftazidime or moxalactam therapy was more often associated with anaerobic superinfections, usually by Clostridium spp., than the other beta-lactams. Comparable and lower incidences of superinfections were cited for cefoperazone, ceftazidime, mezlocillin and imipenem. The most common pathogens for the above drugs were the fungi (Candida spp.), Pseudomonas spp. and some beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Staphylococcal, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp. secondary infections were more common in patients receiving the newer penicillins. Cefotaxime had a very low incidence of superinfections (1.1%), especially caused by gram-positive organisms such as enterococci. The reasons for this favorable feature seem to be: excellent inhibitory activity and beta-lactamase stability against a wide variety of bacterial pathogens, synergistic interactions of cefotaxime and its desacetyl metabolite, enhanced anti-enterococcal activity of cefotaxime in the presence of a human serum factor and interactions of cefotaxime and desacetyl cefotaxime to suppress the development of antimicrobial resistance. The most common superinfections following cefotaxime treatment were with Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacter spp. and fungi. Cefotaxime appears to possess physical-chemical characteristics that react favorably with bacteria and the host to minimize gram-positive superinfections, especially with most enteric Streptococcus spp. (Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium).
TI  - Interaction of anti-kojibiose antibody with the lipoteichoic acids from Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Antisera prepared in rabbits by immunization with p-aminophenyl beta-kojibioside  conjugated to bovine serum albumin (antikojibiose sera), readily agglutinated whole cells of Streptococcus faecalis or Streptococcus faecium, and showed specific reactions with the lipoteichoic acids (LTAs) of these streptococci by passive hemagglutination, microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. The interaction of the antikojibiose sera with the LTAs was inhibited best by kojibiose [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----2)-D-glucose], somewhat less by the dextran from which the kojibiose was prepared, and not measurably by maltose [alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1----4)-D-glucose]. The sera reacted only minimally in only the most sensitive assay (microscale enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) with LTA from group A streptococci (this LTA contains a single kojibiosyl residue as part of the glycolipid moiety of the molecule and failed to react with the Lactobacillus fermentum LTA which is substituted with alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-(1----2)-D -glucosyl units.
TI  - Drug resistance in Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and Staphylococcus epidermidis isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - A total of 1,278 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 688 of Str. faecium and 796 of Staphylococcus epidermidis were collected from laboratory animals of 20 colonies in 1980, and tested for their resistance to 20 drugs. Thirteen percent of Str. faecalis, 12% of Str. faecium and 25% of Staph. epidermidis were drug resistant. Multiple drug resistant organisms were frequently detected in laboratory animal colonies where antibiotic treatment had been undertaken. TC-resistant streptococci and EM-resistant Staph. epidermidis were distributed in about half of the colonies regardless of the history of antibiotic usage.
TI  - Rutin-induced beta-glucosidase activity in Streptococcus faecium VGH-1 and Streptococcus sp. strain FRP-17 isolated from human feces: formation of the mutagen, quercetin, from rutin.
AB  - A fecal isolate, Streptococcus sp. strain FRP-17, and strain VGH-1 of Streptococcus faecium were shown to contain beta-glucosidases which converted rutin (quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucose-alpha-L-rhamnose) to quercetin and were active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucose. The activity against rutin could be measured by increased mutagenicity in the Ames assay or visualized on thin-layer chromatography plates. In both organisms, the beta-glucosidase activities were inducible by the addition of rutin to the growth media. Several closely related strains of Streptococcus spp. lacked any beta-glucosidase activity. In cell preparations of the active organisms, activities with rutin and o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucose were optimal at pH 6.8 and could be enhanced by increasing the ionic strength of the assay system. At low ionic strengths, both quercetin and a new product (intermediate between the polarities of rutin and quercetin) were formed by the incubation of rutin with cell preparations of either active organism. This product disappeared with increased ionic strength, suggesting that it may be a reaction intermediate, quercetin-3-O-beta-D-glucose. These results suggest that the beta-glucosidase active against rutin and that active against o-nitrophenyl-beta-D-glucose are the same.
TI  - Comparative activity of imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin) on enterococci and its interactions with aminoglycosides.
AB  - Activity of imipenem (N-formimidoyl thienamycin, ampicillin and vancomycin against 27 Streptococcus faecalis and 5 Str. faecium was determined. Also evaluated were the interactions of imipenem, ampicillin and vancomycin with streptomycin or amikacin or sissomicin. Imipenem showed the most inhibitory activity against Str. faecalis with MIC50 and MIC90 values 0.5 and 2 mg/l respectively, Str. faecium strains were less susceptible to imipenem with MIC50/MIC90 values of 2/16 mg/l. Imipenem showed good bactericidal activity against both groups of strains with MBC50/MBC90 values of 1/4 and 4/16 mg/l respectively. The most favourable interactions (synergy and addition) of imipenem were with streptomycin (72.2%) and sissomicin (53.2%). Combinations containing amikacin were the least favourable. Similar results were obtained with these combinations against Str. faecium.
TI  - Incubation temperature and faecal streptococci recovery from marine sediments.
AB  - A comparative work was carried out on two different incubation temperatures that  may be used for faecal streptococci recovery. Analyses were made on sediments samples collected in the bay of Naples in a larger survey of environmental pollution detection. Results showed a selective effect of 44 degrees C temperature on the isolation of the Streptococcus faecalis, Streptococcus faecium and Streptococcus durans species that may be considered properly faecal streptococci.
TI  - Acquisition of K:1-like antigen during terminal sepsis.
AB  - This report describes a patient whose own and transfused K:-1 red cell populations became strongly K:1 during a terminal episode of sepsis due to a group D streptococcus organism, Streptococcus faecium. Subsequent in vitro studies using normal K:-1 red cells inoculated with that organism showed that it could render the red cells agglutinable by reagents containing IgG anti-K1. In addition, disrupted S. faecium organisms rendered Jkb-negative red cells agglutinable by those reagents.
TI  - Division blocks in temperature-sensitive mutants of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790).
AB  - Two hundred nine temperature-sensitive growth or division (or both) mutants of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 were isolated. These strains were examined for timing of the division block in the cell division cycle. About 42% of the isolates were blocked at terminal stages of cell division. A second large group appeared to be blocked at various stages of septation. Only five of the temperature-sensitive isolates were blocked at a stage before the completion of chromosome replication. Thirty temperature-sensitive isolates lysed after one or more doublings at the nonpermissive temperature.
TI  - Enumeration and speciation of group D streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall, their susceptibilities to six antibiotics and a comparison with clinical isolates.
AB  - Isolates of group D streptococci from above and below a sewer outfall and a series of clinical isolates have been speciated to sub-species level. From below the sewer outfall, Streptococcus faecalis var. faecalis predominates whereas above the outfall, S. faecium var. casseliflavus predominates. S. faecalis var. faecalis, S. faecalis var. liquefaciens and S. faecalis var. zymogenes were the predominant sub-species in the clinical isolates where S. faecium var. casseliflavus was virtually absent. S. faecalis var. liquefaciens and S. faecalis var. zymogenes were uncommon in the environmental isolates. S. faecium and S. durans were more abundant in the environmental than in the clinical isolates. The use of group D streptococci as indicators of faecal pollution would seem more suited to higher, rather than lower, levels of pollution. A statistically significant increase in resistance to antibiotics (ampicillin, penicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin and tetracycline) was seen in isolates from below the outfall compared with those from above and a further significant increase was seen in the clinical isolates compared with the former. Resistance to tetracycline was most common and ampicillin was the only antibiotic tested to which no resistance was detected. Multiple antibiotic resistance was rare in the environmental isolates. Even in moderately polluted water, there is not a large pool of antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Medium-dependent zone size discrepancies associated with susceptibility testing of group D streptococci against various cephalosporins.
AB  - Mueller-Hinton (MH) agar media from various commercial sources, either supplemented or not supplemented with 5% sheep blood, were studied to determine their effect on disk diffusion susceptibility testing results obtained with 90 strains of group D streptococci and four cephalosporins. The cephalosporins investigated included cephalothin, cefamandole, moxalactam, and cefotaxime. Results showed that a number of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium strains were susceptible to cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefotaxime, but the number varied with both the commercial source and blood content of the MH medium used. Regardless of the MH medium used, none of the S. faecalis or S. faecium strains were found to be susceptible to moxalactam. The apparently medium-associated variations in the number of strains susceptible to cephalothin, cefamandole, and cefotaxime were largely due to minor discrepancies (one result being intermediate) among the various types of MH media used. However, major discrepancies (one result being resistant and the other susceptible or vice versa) were observed when S. faecalis strains were tested against cefotaxime. These major discrepancies were associated with both the commercial source of the MH medium and the blood content of the medium.
TI  - Identification of a streptococcal penicillin-binding protein that reacts very slowly with penicillin.
AB  - Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 5 of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 9790 has an unusually low affinity for penicillin (50% binding occurred at a penicillin level of 8 micrograms/ml after 60 min of incubation, and the protein only became labeled after 20 min of incubation with high concentrations of radioactive penicillin). PBPs with similar properties are carried by strains of Streptococcus durans, Streptococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus lactis but not by strains of groups A, B, C, and G streptococci or Streptococcus pneumoniae. The strains carrying the slow-reacting PBP demonstrated a sensitivity to penicillin that was several hundred times lower than that of strains not carrying it. Spontaneous mutants with minimal inhibitory concentrations of penicillin of 20, 40, and 80 micrograms/ml were isolated from S. faecium ATCC 9790. They all showed a dramatic increase in the amount of slow-reacting PBP produced. Mutants with increased penicillin resistance were also isolated from wild-type strains of S. durans, S. faecalis, and S. faecium. All of them carried a greater amount of the slow-reacting PBP than that carried by the parent. Finally, it was found that resistant S. faecium ATCC 9790 mutants grew normally in the presence of penicillin concentrations that were far above that saturating all PBPs except PBP 5. Cell growth was, on the contrary, inhibited by a penicillin concentration that saturated the slow-reacting PBP by 90%. This penicillin dose was equal to the minimal inhibitory concentration.
TI  - Folate analogues. 22. Synthesis and biological evaluation of two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system.
AB  - Two analogues of dihydrofolic acid possessing a 7,8-dihydro-8-oxapterin ring system have been synthesized and evaluated for their antifolate activities. These compounds, N-[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl)benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (3) and N-[[(2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydro-8-oxa-6-pteridinyl) methyl]benzoyl]-L-glutamic acid (4), were synthesized by reacting the appropriately substituted alpha-halo ketones with 2,5-diamino-4,6-dihydroxypyrimidine (2). Elaboration of p-carbomethoxybenzaldehyde (5) to p-carbomethoxyphenacyl bromide (7) was accomplished by its oxidation with Jones reagent and the successive treatment of the oxidation product with SOCl2, CH2N2, and HBr. Commercially available p-vinylbenzoic acid (11) was converted to its glutamate conjugate 12 and was further converted to the bromo ketone, diethyl N-[p-(1-bromo-2-oxopropyl)benzoyl]-L-glutamate (17), by a series of reactions involving epoxidation, oxirane ring opening with HBr, Jones oxidation, Zn/HOAc reduction, and successive treatment of the reduction product 16 with SOCl2, CH2N2, and HBr. These bromo ketones, 7 and 17, upon reaction with pyrimidine 2, gave the diethyl esters of the target compounds, which were hydrolyzed to 3 and 4 with NaOH. Compound 4 underwent an interesting acid-catalyzed isomerization where the double bond of 4 was shifted from the 5,6-position to the 6,9-position to give the isomer 19. Both compounds 3 and 4 were inactive against Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 7469) and did not serve as synthetic substrates of L. casei dihydrofolate reductase. Compound 4 showed activity against Streptococcus faecium (ATCC 8043), but 3 was inactive against this organism.
TI  - The killing effects of cefathiamidine or ampicillin alone and in combination with gentamicin against enterococci.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of cefathiamidine against Streptococcus faecalis and Str. faecium were studied in comparison with other beta-lactams. All the 56 strains of Str. faecalis tested were inhibited by 2 mg/l of cefathiamidine. MICs of ampicillin were twofold higher than those of cefathiamidine and MICs of cephaloridine and cephazolin were 8-16-fold higher. No significant inoculum effect on MICs of cefathiamidine could be seen. Two isolates of Str. faecium showed resistance to the four antibiotics. The MBCs of cefathiamidine and ampicillin for ten strains of Str. faecalis showed that the ratios of MBC/MIC were greater than 64. The rates of killing of Str. faecalis were reduced at concentrations of cefathiamidine and ampicillin greater than the MIC. The most rapid killing was obtained at 2 mg/l cefathiamidine or 4 mg/l of ampicillin. With the addition of 1 mg/l gentamicin this paradoxical bacteriocidal effect was eliminated. Time killing studies showed 99.9% of the cells were killed within 6 h by a combination of aminoglycoside and beta-lactam. The paradoxical bacteriocidal effect of cefathiamidine and ampicillin was also demonstrated on solid media.
TI  - Taxonomic studies on some group D streptococci.
AB  - Biochemical, menaquinone, fatty acid and DNA analyses were conducted on a number  of streptococci of serological group D. The results indicate that S. faecalis, S. faeclum, S. casseliflavus and taxa previously designated 'S. avium', 'S. durans' and "S. faecalis var. malodoratus' are distinct species. Strains previously labelled 'S. faecium var. mobilis' were shown to be identical with S. casseliflavus. The results also indicate that some group D streptococci recently isolated from chickens constitute a new species.
TI  - Studies on the mechanism of intrinsic resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in group D streptococci.
AB  - Six penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) were detected in clinical isolates of each one of three group D streptococci: Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis and S. faecium. When examined in whole organisms, the PBPs of S. faecium, the most penicillin-resistant species of group D streptococci, generally had lower affinities for the antibiotic than those of S. faecalis (intermediate penicillin resistance), which in turn were of lower affinity than those of S. bovis (penicillin-sensitive). On the other hand, no quantitative correlation could be established between the binding of penicillin to any one PBP or group of PBPs, and the penicillin MIC value for the corresponding micro-organism. Examination of the amounts of antibiotic bound and the rates of binding to PBPs of equal numbers of protoplasts and whole bacteria of S. faecalis and S. faecium, indicated that there was no permeability barrier to benzylpenicillin in the cell walls of these species. The lower antibacterial effectiveness of cephalothin compared with ampicillin in group D streptococci was paralleled by the higher concentrations of cephalothin needed in competition assays to inhibit the lower molecular size PBPs of these bacteria.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of Streptococcus.
AB  - A numerical taxonomic study of strains of Streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. The major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (S. faecalis, S. faecium, 'S. avium' and a proposed new species 'S. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (S. bovis, S. equinus, S. salivarius, 'S. casseliflavus', S. mutans, S. raffinolactis and an unidentified Oral Group I); (c) lactic species group (S. lactis including S. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (S. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (S. mitis, S. sanguis, a proposed new species 'S. oralis' and 'S. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (S. agalactiae, S. pyogenes, S. equi, 'S. equisimilis' including 'S. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of Lancefield Group B strains of human origin); (g) parapyogenic species group (S. uberis, 'S. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of Lancefield Groups R, S and T). Species of Aerococcus, Gemella, Leuconostoc and Pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.
TI  - [Numerical classification of enterococci].
AB  - The taxonomic analysis of enterococci by a mathematical method has revealed that  these organisms are subdivided, according to their properties, into three taxons; of these, two taxons correspond to the species known as Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium, while the third taxon, sharply different from the rest, comprises mobile enterococci which can be probably regarded as a separate species and differentiated from the other two species by a number of characteristics.
TI  - [Experimental study on synergism between cefotaxime and ampicillin against Streptococcus D group].
AB  - Cefotaxime (CTX) disks and ampicillin (ABPC) disks exhibited synergism against 24 strains of Streptococcus D group isolated from various sources in our hospital. We were interested in these synergism effects and compared them with the combination index. Twenty-two out of the 24 strains examined exhibited synergism, and were identified as Streptococcus faecalis by the API strep system. We divided them into 4 groups (combination index: 19, 15, 11, 9) according to the degree of synergism. Another 2 strains showed additive effects (combination index: 1), and were identified as Streptococcus faecium. Among these 24 strains, beta-lactamases were produced by only 1. There was no direct connection between beta-lactamase production and synergism. The mechanism of synergism between CTX and ABPC has not yet been studied.
TI  - [Higher fatty acid composition of enterococci].
AB  - The content of unsaturated fatty acids in enterococcal cells has been found to have no essential relation to the composition of the culture medium. When cultivated in the same media, S. faecium had the degree of lipid unsaturation 1.5-2 times higher than S. faecalis. Mobile enterococci are sharply differentiated from immobile species by the content of cyclopropanic acid with 19 carbon atoms, constitute a heterogenous group and consist of at least 2 taxons, differing in the content of acids with 18 carbon atoms and the degree of lipid unsaturation.
TI  - Resistance to macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin antibiotics in enterococci from the intestines of animals.
AB  - Macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin group B (MLS) resistant strains were found among enterococci isolated from caeca of poultry, pigs and cattle. The percentage of MLS resistance among the poultry strains was 70 per cent. The Streptococcus faecium strains were more susceptible than the other enterococcal strains to virginiamycin, a member of the streptogramin class of antibiotics. This was due to higher susceptibility of the S faecium strains to the virginiamycin component M which belongs to the streptogramin group A antibiotics. Ability to inactivate clindamycin, an antibiotic of the lincosamide class of antibiotics, was noted in an unclassified group D streptococcus strain isolated from a pig.
TI  - [Faecal streptococci as indicator organisms of drinking water].
AB  - The rules of the European Economic Community to harmonize the hygienic quality of drinking water write out the faecal streptococci as indicator organisms. This operating definition of the faecal streptococci prohibits its taxonomic limitation to enterococci or group D streptococci. Therefore, we have undertaken studies concerning the methods for routine examinations. Comparative investigations of selective enrichment broths showed no significant differences of the end concentration of glucose in the range of 0.5-1.0% and of sodium azide in the range of 0.02-0.05%. 36 degrees C was a better incubation temperature than 44 degrees C and the results were better after 24 h than after 48 h. Comparative investigations of selective plating media showed less selectivity of the bile-aesculin agar and gentamicinthallous-carbonate agar than that on the one hand of citrate-azide-tween-carbonate agar, KF streptococcal agar or Slanetz-Bartley enterococcal agar, and on the other hand of kanamycin-aesculin-azide agar. All together the kanamycin-aesculin-azide agar seems to be a little better than the other media (Table 2) 356 strains of faecal streptococci were isolated from the studied media. More than 20 characteristics were investigated and, there upon, the strains were differentiated (Table 3). S. faecalis predominates in human materials, i.e. urine, S. faecium and S. durans were isolated specially from sewage and waste water (Table 4). The single species of faecal streptococci grow specificly on the different selective media, and therefore, each agar specimen prefers the one or other species more or less selectively (Table 5).
TI  - Identification of group D streptococci by SeroSTAT.
AB  - Clinical isolates of group D streptococci presumptively identified by biochemical methods were grouped by latex agglutination using a commercially prepared reagent specifically sensitized with group D antiserum (SeroSTAT; Scott Laboratories, Inc., Fiskeville, R.I.). Streptococcus species tested included S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. durans, S. avium, S. bovis, and S. equinus. Colonies of the organism to be tested were picked from agar plates, emulsified in a drop of glycine-buffered saline on a slide, and mixed with a drop of the latex reagent. Macroscopic agglutination occurred within 60 s. A total of 115 isolates of group D streptococci were tested; 103 (89.6%) gave positive reactions with SeroSTAT. Twelve strains failed to react with the latex reagent; these 12 strains also gave negative results with group D antiserum when tested by the Lancefield method. Two of 14 group A streptococci also reacted with the SeroSTAT group D reagent; after trypsinization, the cross-reaction was eliminated. Group B streptococci, viridans group streptococci, anaerobic streptococci, and staphylococci all gave negative reactions with the SeroSTAT reagent. The SeroSTAT reagent is a useful diagnostic tool for the prompt identification of enterococcal and non-enterococcal group D streptococci.
TI  - [Results from the Central Laboratory for Streptococci Research in Kiel from 1965  to 1980 - group D-streptococci (enterococci) (author's transl)].
AB  - In accordance with previous papers published within a series of publications which describe the results obtained from the Central Laboratory for Streptococcal Research in Kiel (1. Survey, 2. Mastitis-Streptococci) the group of Enterococci is discussed herewith. On the basis of more than 6000 strains which are stored in our databank including all biological characteristics, the distribution of the cultural, biochemical and serological parameters is listed in percentages, and the usefulness and reliability for the identification of the enterococcal group and also the differentiation of particular species is discussed. The results are tabulated for every single species and additionally, for serologic-positive and negative strains. For example, it can be shown that a third of all Str. faecium strains are motile, that lack of growth at 45 degrees C varies between 1.1% and 31.3% and that lack of serological reaction with group D-serum between 0.9% and 70%. In a comprehensive table and flow diagram these figures result in a proposal for a simple but sufficient identification procedure on different stages (enterococci, faecalis- or faecium-group, single species) depending on the individual requirements. With regard to the incidence of enterococci in man and animals, which was presented in the first paper, the organ sources of the different species are compared now. Apart from some interesting findings it can be stated that a typical predominance of the faecalis and faecium-group resp. in man or animals cannot be confirmed. But there seems to be a relation between the species and the organ source. For example, in humans the faecium-group predominates in the respiratory tract, but in the urogenital tract the presence of Str. faecalis is seven times higher than the faecium-group. The above results may also be of interest for ecological reasons and may be important for the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this streptococcal group.
TI  - Susceptibility of enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes to N-Formimidoyl thienamycin alone and in combination with an aminoglycoside.
AB  - The susceptibilities of 12 strains of enterococci and 10 stains of Listeria monocytogenes to N-formimidoyl thienamycin were determined by a standard broth dilution method. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for L. monocytogenes strains were less than 0.25 micrograms/ml. As a group, strains of Streptococcus faecium were less susceptible than Streptococcus faecalis strains, but even for the latter, the minimal inhibitory concentrations were slightly greater than those previously reported. Minimal bactericidal concentrations against all organisms were many-fold higher than the corresponding inhibitory concentrations. In time-kill studies, combinations of N-formimidoyl thienamycin with gentamicin were synergistic against (or they completely sterilized cultures of) all the enterococcal strains and nine to 10 strains of L. monocytogenes. The magnitude of killing by the combinations was comparable to that previously observed with penicillin-gentamicin combinations. N-Formimidoyl thienamycin-tobramycin combinations were synergistic against those strains of S. faecalis and L. monocytogenes tested, but not against those of S. faecium.
TI  - [Observations on the fecal streptococcal flora in carnivorous domestic animals (author's transl)].
AB  - From 1200 feces-samples streaks of carnivorous domestic animals (1027 from dogs,  173 from cats) 744 streptococci-strains were isolated and differentiated. 87% proved their, self to be streptococcus group D/enterococcus, 13% falled to 11 others species, much-numerous represented streptococci of Viridans-group (Sc. MG, Sc. milleri, Sc. salivarius, Sc. viridans), Sc. group G (beta-hemolytic biotypes) and Sc. lactis (group N). Among the group D-spezies the most showed species at dogs was Sc. bovis (35%), retinued by Sc. faecium and Sc. durans (ever about 18%) and the both Sc.-faecalis-sub-spezies var. liquefaciens and var. faecalis (ever about 8%). At cats, the relation respecting to group D-shares, especially of Sc. bovis, were strong varying. All together an interesting survey on the qualitative composition of the streptococcal flora in dog- and cat-intestine was obtained.
TI  - [Reducing activity and differential thermal analysis of enterococci].
AB  - The reducing activity of 100 Streptococcus faecalis strains, 100 Streptococcus faecium strains and 100 enterococcal strains were studied by the quantitative method. The study revealed that all mobile enterococci, in contrast to S. faecium, reduce 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride with the formation of triphenylformasan. Differential thermal analysis also indicated that S. faecalis, S. faecium and mobile enterococci had thermograms with definite mathematical characteristics and could be best differentiated by the indices of their form and the size of S3 areas. The quantitative methods of the investigation of reducing activity and differential thermal analysis can be used for the differentiation of enterococcal species. Mobile enterococci have definite characteristics allowing one to sharply differentiate them from S. faecium and S. faecalis.
TI  - Ornithine transcarbamylases. Ordering of S-cyano peptides and location of characteristically reactive cysteinyl residues within the sequence.
AB  - The peptides produced by cleavage of the S-cyano derivatives of the ornithine transcarbamylases (ornithine carbamoyltransferase, 2.1.3.3) from bovine liver, Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 11,420, and Streptococcus faecium ATCC 8043 have been isolated and aligned. Their amino acid compositions and COOH-terminal sequences are reported. The COOH-terminal peptide (51 residues in the bovine enzyme; 66 residues in the bacterial enzymes) contains the essential sulfhydryl group.
TI  - The biosynthesis of nascent membrane lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) from phosphatidylkojibiosyl diacylglycerol and phosphatidylglycerol.
AB  - Phosphatidylkojibiosyl diacylglycerol functions as the acceptor of sn-glycerol 1-phosphate moieties from phosphatidylglycerol in the in vitro synthesis of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790). The enzyme catalyzing this polymer-forming reaction is membrane-bound. The majority of the product is water-soluble, is excluded from Sepharose 6B, and, after longer incubations, changes to a form that co-precipitates with protein upon exposure to a denaturing agent. These properties are shared by the polyglycerol phosphate-containing membrane lipoteichoic acid isolated from whole cells of S. faecium. However, unlike the lipoteichoic acid generated in vivo, the glycerol phosphate polymer portion of the product synthesized in vitro is not substituted and, therefore, is considered a nascent lipoteichoic acid intermediate.
TI  - Microbiological properties of Streptococcus faecium SF 68 strain and its relationships with other microorganisms.
AB  
TI  - Drug resistance of organisms isolated from feces of laboratory mice and rats.
AB  - A total of 248 strains of EScherichia coli, 132 of Staphylococcus epidermidis, 137 of Streptococcus faecalis and 89 of STr. faecium were collected from feces of 40 mice and 36 rats of 8 colonies in 1978, and drug resistance were examined by an agar dieution method using 23 antibiotics. The results indicated a positive relation between use of antibiotics and appearance of multiple drug resistant organisms.
TI  - Survival of faecal streptococci in raw and pasteurised egg products.
AB  - 1. The ability of Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium strains to survive in egg albumen and liquid whole egg before and after laboratory pasteurisation was studied. 2. Pasteurisation of egg albumen caused a decrease in viable cells of less than 10-fold, while pasteurisation of whole egg caused decreases of more than 100-fold in only two of the eight strains studied. After growth in whole egg, some strains were more resistant to pasteurisation in whole egg. 3. Strep. faecalis multiplied in raw and pasteurised whole egg but not in egg albumen. 4. Strep. faecium multiplied in raw and pasteurised whole egg only after an initial decline in viability which was not shown by cells adapted to whole egg. Together with storage temperature this affected the number of viable cells after a storage period of 5 d. 5. In raw and pasteurised egg albumen Strep. faecium strains lost viability; this was maximal at 37 degrees C and more cells survived as the storage temperature decreased.
TI  - Effects of cerulenin on antibiotic-induced lysis of streptococcus faecalis (S. faecium).
AB  - Addition of the antibiotic cerulenin to cultures lowered the minimal effective concentration of penicillin G or methicillin required to produce bacterial lysis and killing. This effect was most pronounced at subinhibitory antibiotic concentrations. Cerulenin had no significant effects on lysis or killing induced in the presence of D-cycloserine, fosfomycin, bacitracin, or vancomycin.
TI  - Effect of growth rate on lipid and lipoteichoic acid composition in Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - The lipid composition of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) was analyzed at various growth rates. Diphosphatidylglycerol and the non-ionic lipid fraction containing diacylglycerols and neutral glycolipids appeared to accumulate relative to cellular mass as the culture mass doubling time increased from 30 to 80 min. Within the same range of doubling times the non-ionic lipid fraction appeared to become substantially enriched with diacylglycerols. All lipid species and cellular lipoteichoic acid accumulated relative to the cellular mass at doubling times exceeding 80 min, although diacylglycerol accumulation exceeded that of all other compounds studied.
TI  - The distribution of isoprenoid quinones in streptococci of serological groups D and N.
AB  - The isoprenoid quinone contents of streptococci of serological groups D and N were investigated. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens and S. faecalis subsp. zymogenes strains contained demethylmenaquinones with nine isoprene units as their major isoprenologues. Menaquinones with eight isoprene units predominated in S. faecium subsp. casseliflavus and S. faecium subsp. mobilis whereas menaquinones with nine isoprene units constituted the major components in strains of S. cremoris, S. cremoris subsp. alactosus, S. lactis and S. lactis subsp. diacetylactis. Strains of S. avium, S. bovis, S. durans, S. equinus, S. faecium, S. raffinolactis and S. suis contained neither menaquinones nor ubiquinones. The isoprenoid quinone data correlate well with other kinds of data on these organisms and are of value in the classification of these bacteria.
TI  - Species-specific resistance to antimocrobial synergism in Streptococcus faecium and Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Combinations of penicillin with various aminoglycosidic aminocyclitols were tested against a collection of clinical isolates of Streptococcus faecium in vitro and were used to treat endocarditis caused by S. faecium in the rabbit model. S. faecium proved more resistant to penicillin than Streptococcus faecalis. Even more striking, however, was the resistance to in vitro synergism by combinations of penicillin and various aminoglycosides. At clinically achievable concentrations, penicillin-gentamicin was the only combination that was synergistic against all strains that were tested. Combinations of penicillin and streptomycin and penicillin and amikacin were synergistic only against those strains that were not highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin, respectively. Combinations of penicillin with kanamycin, tobramycin, sisomicin, or netilmicin failed to produce synergism against any of these strains. The possible clinical significance of these findings was verified by use of the rabbit model of endocarditis. Combinations of penicillin with gentamicin or streptomycin were synergistic in the therapy of endocarditis that was produced by a strain of S. faecium that did not have a high level of resistance to aminoglycosides. However, the combination of penicillin and netilmicin was no more effective than penicillin alone.
TI  - Release of autolytic enzyme from Streptococcus, faecium cell walls by treatment with dilute alkali.
AB  - The autolytic enzyme (endo-beta-1,4-N-acetylmuramoylhydrolase) of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) was released in a soluble form from insoluble cell wall-autolytic enzyme complexes by treatment with dilute NaOH at 0 degree C. Treatment of cell wall-enzyme complexes, obtained from either exponential- or stationary-phase cells, with 0.008 to 0.01 N NaOH gave maximum yields of autolytic enzyme activity. At a fixed concentration of NaOH, the yield of autolysin increased with increasing wall densities and was accompanied by the release of methylpentose and phosphorus in amounts proportional to the autolysin. Since extraction of wall-enzyme complexes with 4.5 M LiCl at 0 degree C also removed methylpentose and phosphorus, release of enzyme with NaOH did not appear to result from hydrolysis of covalent linkages. The autolytic enzyme activity released from intact cells, or cell walls, was predominantly in the later (proteinase activable) form which could be activated by trypsin or a proteinase present in commerical bovine plasma albumin.
TI  - Morphological and physiological study of autolytic-defective Streptococcus faecium strains.
AB  - Three autolytic-defective mutants of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) were isolated. All three autolytic-defective mutants exhibited the following properties relative to the parental strain: (i) slower growth rates, especially in chemically defined medium; (ii) decreased rates of cellular autolysis and increased survival after exposure to antibiotics which block cell wall biosynthesis; (iii) decreased rates of cellular autolysis when treated with detergents, suspended in autolysis buffers, or grown in medium lacking essential cell wall precursors; (iv) a reduction in the total level of cellular autolytic enzyme (active plus latent forms of the enzyme); (v) an increased ratio of latent to active forms of autolysin; and (vi) increased levels of both cellular lipoteichoic acid and lipids.
TI  - Enzymatic deacylation of lipoteichoic acid by protoplasts of Streptococcus faecium (Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790).
AB  - High-molecular-weight, micellar lipoteichoic acid (LTA) was converted to a lower-molecular-weight, apparently deacylated polymer when the former was incubated in the presence of growing protoplasts of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790), but not when incubated in fresh or spent protoplast medium. The mobility of the low-molecular-weight polymer upon agarose gel electrophoresis was indistinguishable from that of native extracellular lipoteichoic acid LTA(X) from this organism or from chemically deacylated LTA. Native LTA(X) was shown to contain less than one fatty acid equivalent per 18 LTA(X) molecules, in contrast to the 4:1 ratio of fatty acids to polyglycerolphosphate chains in micellar LTA.
TI  - [Lactic acid bacteria and streptococci of the human stomach normally and in pathological processes].
AB  - Lactic acid bacteria were either absent or present in negligent quantities in the stomach of apparently healthy man. But in case of various pathological processes in the stomach and duodenum lactic acid bacteria accumulated (up to a million cells per 1 ml of gastric contents). Under these conditions coccal forms sharply prevailed over the bacillary ones. In patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer of the stomach the most frequent were Streptococcus faecalis and its variants; in oncological patients--Str. faecium, strains affiliated to Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and sometimes Str. durans.
TI  - Precursor-product relationship of intracellular and extracellular lipoteichoic acids of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Exponential biosynthesis and excretion of lipoteichoic acid (LTA) during the exponential phase of growth, and continued synthesis and excretion during valine starvation of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790), were shown. During exponential growth, extracellular LTA (LTAx) accounted for approximately 13% of the total LTA in cultures, whereas during valine starvation, this percentage increased to approximately 60% within 4 h. LTAx was present in a low-molecular-weight, apparently deacylated form, whereas intracellular (LTAi) was present primarily in an apparently high-molecular-weight, acylated and micellar form. Experiments utilizing chases of either fully equilibrated or short pulses of [14C]- or [3H]glycerol were used to demonstrate that LTAx was derived directly from LTAi.
TI  - Untyped forms of faecal streptococci in Egyptian sewage and Nile water.
AB  - When the thallous-azide agar medium was used a higher incidence of pure faecal streptococci recovery was recorded especially from slightly polluted vehicles such as river water than on the standard M-enterococcus agar medium. In addition, a thallous-azide combination at pH 6.5 was used successfully for the primary isolation of Str. faecalis and its two variants. Results of biochemical tests of 274 faecal streptococci isolates showed that 20% belonged to Str. faecalis and its two variants as well as Str. durans, Str. faecium and Str. equinus. Thirty-eight percent of the isolated strains were classified as atypical I, II, III, and V previously designated by COOPER and RAMADAN (1955) as well as the unclassified group of RAMADAN et al. (1972). While the remaining 42% were found to belong to seven different categories (SALEH 1976 and 1977). The correlation between four differential tests used for defining the source of faecal streptococci isolates was discussed.
TI  - Carriage of group D streptococci in the human bowel.
AB  - Sixty faecal samples, 39 from adults and 21 from neonates, were investigated by means of a simple scheme to isolate and identify any group D streptococci present. A number of differences were found between the two groups. Group D streptococci were absent from 43% of the neonates compared with only 13% of the adults; Streptococcus bovis was commoner in the neonates (23.8%) than in the adults (5%), and Streptococcus faecium was not isolated from any of the infant samples although it was common in the adult samples (25%). The viable counts of Strep. faecium were found to be, on average, 100-fold lower than those of Streptococcus faecalis. The methods and results are discussed with reference to the clinical significance of group D streptococci, especially in bacterial endocarditis and carcinoma of the colon.
TI  - Incidence and relationship of group D streptococci with other indicator organisms in meats.
AB  - Raw and processed meats were analyzed for presumptive group D streptococci using  KF streptococcus agar. Counts were compared with coliform, presumptive Escherichia coli, and Enterobacteriaceae counts but no meaningful relationships were observed. Results indicated that group D streptococci and E. coli type I were principally contaminants from the packing plant, rather than at retail level. The predominating group D streptococcus in both beef and pork cuts was Streptococcus faecalis, while in processed meat (bologna), the predominating group D streptococci were Streptococcus faecium var. durans and Streptococcus faecium. Streptococcus bovis was not detected among the isolates from any meat samples. Marked differences were noted in numbers of group D streptococci in processed meat from different manufacturers. The results did not support the use of group D streptococci as alternative indicator organisms for meats. However, the association of group D streptococci with packing plant contamination may prove to be of value.
TI  - Characterization of plasmids in bacteriocin producing strains of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Four bacteriocin (enterocin) producing strains of Streptococcus faecium were examined for extrachromosomal DNA. Three strains proved to harbor minicircular plasmid DNA of uniform length as evidenced by CsCl ethidium bromide density centrifugation and electron microscopy. Molecular weight determination obtained through contour length measurements showed 2.4 X 10(6) dalton for S. faecium 25, 3.4 X 10(6) dalton for S. faecium 3 and 3.8 X 10(6) dalton for S. faecium 59. Elimination experiments for bacteriocin production with intercalating dyes proved sterile. The role of these plasmids remains for the time being unknown.
TI  - [The etiology of foul brood].
AB  - Five hundred and thirty-six samples of honeycombs were examined in a laboratory in the years 1971-1974. In all the samples clinically determined as the foul brood, B. alvei was isolated as a pure culture, and enterococci, or both microorganisms were isolated in mixed form. Twenty-five strains of the isolated streptococci were analyzed microbiologically and biochemically; on the basis of their culture and biochemical characteristics five strains were designated as Streptococcus faecalis, 14 strains as Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens, five strains as Streptococcus faecium and one strain as Streptococcus durans. After checking the used taxonomic key of the culture and biochemical classification of B. alvei it may be stated that the culture and biochemical characteristics are stable. The strains of B. alvei (very dried strains), which persisted in the dried slant meat-peptone agar, were viable under the laboratory conditions, which proves the high resistance of the spores to the environment.
TI  - Use of pyruvate fermentation compared with tetrazolium reduction in the differentiation of group D streptococci.
AB  - The reduction of 2, 3, 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride in the original medium of  Barnes (Journal of General Microbiology, 14, 57, 1956), and in a modified medium, was compared with the ability to ferment pyruvate as a means of separating Streptococcus faecalis from all other group D streptococci. The tetrazolium reduction test gave an occasional negative reaction with Str. faecalis strains. In addition, a number of strains gave a weakly positive reaction in the test, as did some strains of Str. faecium and Str. bovis. With some batches of tetrazolium, these weak reactions with Str. faecalis were so frequent that interpretation of the results was difficult. On the other hand, all Str. faecalis strains, and no other group D streptococci, gave a positive pyruvate-fermentation reaction in 48 hours.
TI  - Approximation of the cell cycle in synchronized populations of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Slowly growing populations (TD = 70 to 80 min) of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) were synchronized by selection after sucrose gradient fractionation. The cell cycle was approximated by correlating the patterns of DNA accumulation and cell division. More specifically, the beginning of cell cycle was equated with the beginning of a rapid linear increase in DNA accumulation. The DNA content of the culture approximately doubled during the period of accumulation, which lasted about 51 min. The period of rapid DNA accumulation, was followed by a period of reduced accumulation that lasted about 24 min. During synchronized growth, cell numbers increased rapidly in coordination with the period of rapid DNA accumulation and exhibited a plateau during the period of reduced DNA accumulation. In contrast, RNA and protein appeared to accumulate exponentially throughout the cell cycle at the same rate as culture mass.
TI  - Relationship between cellular autolytic activity, peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and the cell cycle in synchronized populations of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Synchronized, slowly growing (TD = 70 to 80 min) cultures were used to study several wall-associated parameters during the cell cycle: rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, septation, and cellular autolytic activity. The rate of peptidoglycan synthesis per cell declined during most of the period of chromosome replication (C), but increased during the latter part of C and into the period between chromosome termination and cell division (D). An increase in cellular septation was correlated with the increased rate of peptidoglycan synthesis. Cellular autolytic capacity increased during the early portion of C, reached a maximum late in C or early in D, and declined during D. Inhibition of DNA synthesis during C prevented the decline in autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle, caused a slight reduction in the rate of peptidoglycan synthesis, delayed but did not prevent septation, and prevented the impending cell division by inhibiting cell separation. Inhibition of DNA synthesis during D did not prevent the increase in autolytic capacity during the next C phase, but, once again, prevented the decline at the end of the subsequent cycle. Thus, increased autolytic capacity at the beginning of the cell cycle did not seem to be related to chromosome initiation, whereas decreased autolytic capacity at the end of the cell cycle seemed to be related to chromosome termination. The data presented are consistent with the role of autolytic enzyme activity in the previously proposed model for cell division of S. faecium (G.D. Shockman et al., Ann. N.Y Acad. Sci. 235:161-197, 1974).
TI  - Plasmid-mediated mechanisms of resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics and to chloramphenicol in group D streptococci.
AB  - Genes conferring resistance to aminoglycoside-aminocyclitol antibiotics in three  group D streptococcal strains, Streptococcus faecalis JH1 and JH6 and S. faecium JH7, and to chloramphenicol in JH6 are carried by plasmids that can transfer to other S. faecalis cells. The aminoglycoside resistance is mediated by constitutively synthesized phosphotransferase enzymes that have substrate profiles very similar to those of aminoglycoside phosphotransferases found in gram-negative bacteria. Phosphorylation probably occurs at the aminoglycoside 3'-hydroxyl group. Plasmid-borne streptomycin resistance is due to production of the enzyme streptomycin adenylyltransferase, which, as in staphylococci and in contrast to that detected in gram-negative bacteria, is less effective against spectinomycin as substrate. Resistance to chloramphenicol is by enzymatic acetylation. The chloramphenicol acetyltransferase is inducible and bears a close resemblance to the type D chloramphenicol acetyltransferase variant from staphylococci.
TI  - Cellular autolytic activity in synchronized populations of Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - The autolytic capacity of Streptococcus faecium (S. faecalis ATCC 9790) varied during synchronous cell division. This phenomenon was initially observed in rapidly dividing populations (TD=30 to 33 min) synchronized by a combination of induction and size selection techniques. To minimize the problems inherent in studies of cells containing overlapping chromosome cycles and possible artifacts generated by induction techniques, the autolytic capacities of slowly dividing populations (TD=60 to 110 min) synchronized by selection only were examined. Although the overall level of cellular autolytic capacity was observed to decline with decreasing growth rate, sharp, periodic fluctuations in cellular autolytic capacity were seen during synchronous growth at all growth rates examined. On the basis of similar patterns of cyclic fluctuations in autolytic capacity of cultures synchronized by (i) selection, (ii) amino acid starvation followed by size selection, and (iii) amino acid starvation followed by inhibition of DNA synthesis, a link of such fluctuations with the cell division cycle has been postulated.
TI  - Generation rates of faecal streptococci in various vehicles.
AB  - Potassium tellurite media gave the highest detrimental effects on the generation  number of all tested faecal streptococci species. This applies to all investigated vehicles. However, drastic tellurite effects became more conspicuous with certain vehicles than with others. This is particularly true with acid and alkaline foods and water, especially with strains like Streptococcus bovis, Str. faecium, and Str. durans. Again, tellurite becomes more influencial with regard to old cells rather than young cells in the logarithmic phase. On the other hand, the use of thallous acetate as a concentration agent secured better results than either the tellurite or azide almost with all tested vehicles. Yet, sodium azide may be regarded as holding an intermediate position between tellurite and thallous acetate in terms of vehicles, Streptococcus species, and age of pollution. A lower number of generation resulted with all tested faecal streptococci species, using liquid media bearing more than one concentrating agent. This applied to water and milk examination.
TI  - [Changes in the number of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium stored in physiological solution at a temperature of 20 degrees C].
AB  
TI  - Inhibition of different serotypes of Listeria monocytogenes by enterocins in solid and liquid media.
AB  - Twenty-one enterocinogenic strains of enterococci were examined for their ability to inhibit 51 strains of Listeria monocytogenes belonging to eight different serotypes; 50 strains of L. monocytogenes were uniformly inhibited on solid media and in broth cultures by strains of Streptococcus faecium. However, only four strains of L. monocytogenes were inhibited by strains of Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis v. zymogenes or S. faecalis v. liquefaciens. Enterocin E1A prepared from the supernant fluid of S. faecium strain E1 rapidly killed sensitive cells of L. monocytogenes but did not lyse them.
TI  - Teichoic acids of group D streptococci with special reference to strains from pig meningitis (Streptococcus suis).
AB  - Immunoelectrophoresis revealed in phenol extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium a mixture of free and lipid-bound teichoic acids, both reactive with Group D antisera. In phenol extracts from S. suis only lipid-bound teichoic acid, also reactive with Group D antiserum, was seen. This difference probably accounts for the low yield of Group D antigen from S. suis as compared with S. faecalis and S. faecium when heating at pH 2 is used for extraction. When phenol is used good yields are obtained from S. suis as well as from S. faecalis and S. faecium. Lipoteichoic acids from S. faecalis and S. faecium have a backbone structure the same as or similar to that of Group A streptococcal teichoic acid. Lipoteichoic acid from S. suis has a structure differing from that of S. faecalis and S. faecium, e.g., possibly in the attachment of its glucosyl substituents. Precipitation reactions between S. suis lipoteichoic acid and Group D antisera were specifically inhibited by glucose. Reactions between S. bovis phenol extracts and some Group D antisera were also specifically inhibited by glucose, but extracts from S. faecalis and S. faecium were not. This may indicate a monosaccharide glucosyl substituent in teichoic acid from S. suis and S. bovis instead of the di- or trisaccharide previously postulated as the glucosyl substituent in the teichoic acid of S. faecalis.
TI  - Sorption of Streptococci to glass: Effects of macromolecular solutes.
AB  - Macromolecular solutes (albumin, concanavalin A, whole saliva, serum) caused impaired sorption of Streptococcus faecium and Streptococcus sanguis to glass. The inhibitory effect resided chiefly with interactions of the solutes with the glass surface. In the case of sorption of S. sanguis to glass in the presence of parotid fluid, the inhibitory effect was counteracted by a specific attachment of S. sanguis cells mediated by some component(s) of the parotid fluid. Agglutination of the test organisms was in general accompanied by inhibition of sorption. However, when small or unstable aggregates were formed, the number of cells adhering on the glass surface was increased. The findings are discussed with reference to the colonization of teeth by oral bacteria.
TI  - Sorption of Streptococcus faecium to glass.
AB  - A method has been developed by which to study the sorption of Streptococcus faecium to soda-lime cover glasses. Conditions were chosen to minimize the influence on sorption of bacterial polymer production, passive sorption being studied rather than attachment mediated by metabolic activities. Sorption of S. faecium increased with increasing temperature (to 50 degrees C), time, and cell concentration, but equilibrium apparently was not reached even after incubation for 8 hours or at a cell concentration of 3 X 10(10) per ml. Sorption increased with solute molarity up to 0.1 M concentration of NaCl and KCl, indicating an effect of the electrical double layers on the apposition of cells to the glass surface. Desorption of bacteria could be obtained after multiple washings of the glasses in buffer or by the action of Tween 80, but not if sorbed bacteria were left in distilled water, various salt solutions, urea, or in suspensions of unlabelled bacteria. It was concluded that sorption occurred as a result of chemical interactions between the glass and the cell surface. Tween 80 at a concentration of 1 per cent inhibited sorption to 26 per cent of buffer controls, 2 M urea was less effective, and 1 M NaCl was without effect. It is suggested that hydrophobic interactions may be of importance in the binding of S. faecium to glass.
TI  - Acid production from Lycasin, maltitol, sorbitol and xylitol by oral streptococci and lactobacilli.
AB  - The acid production from maltitol was compared with the acid production from hydrogenated starch hydrolysate (Lycasin), sorbitol and xylitol by a number of oral strains and reference strains of Streptococcus mutans, S. sanguis, S. salivarius, S. mitior, S. milleri, S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. avium, Lactobacillus casei and L. salivarius. The polyols were added to a final concentration of 1.0% to two different basal media. Incubation was performed at 37 degrees C for 7 days after which the pH was recorded. Maltitol was fermented only by the lactobacilli (about two thirds of the strains). Lycasin was fermented by all strains of S. faecalis, more than 90% of the lactobacilli, about half of the S. sanguis strains, about one third of the S. mutans strains, and by a few other streptococcal strains. Acid production from sorbitol was observed among more than 80% of the S. mutans strains and the S. faecalis strains and most of the lactobacilli strains. Sorbitol-fermenting strains of S. sanguis and of S. mitior, all isolated from sorbitol-consumers, were observed. No other sorbitol-fermenting streptococci were found. Only the reference strains L. salivarius subsp. salivarius ATCC 11741 and S. avium ATCC 14025 fermented xylitol.
TI  - Inhibition of wall autolysis in Streptococcus faecalis by lipoteichoic acid and lipids.
AB  - Fully acylated lipoteichoic acid (LTA) isolated from Streptococcus faecalis ATCC9790 (S. faecium) inhibited autolysis of walls from the same organism at concentrations (1.0 to 1.5 nmol of LTA per mg of wall) comparable to those found in intact cells. Partially deacylated LTA isolated from S. faecalis or chemically deacylated LTA failed to inhibit significantly in the same concentration range. Beef heart cardiolipin and commercially obtained dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl glycerol were also found to inhibit wall autolysis in S. faecalis. Chemical deacylation of beef heart cardiolipin also removed the inhibitory activity of this molecule. Lipid fractions isolated from S. faecalis that inhibited wall autolysis were: diphosphatidyl glycerol (cardiolipin), phosphatidyl glycerol, aminoacyl phosphatidyl glycerol, and a neutral lipid fraction. Glycolipids were not found to be effective inhibitors. The possible role of LTA and/or certain lipids as regulators of cellular autolytic activity is discussed.
TI  - Distribution of group D streptococci in rivers and streams.
AB  - A study was undertaken to determine sources of bacteriological contamination of rivers as well as the ecology of faecal streptococci in natural and contaminated waters. Media used to characterize and speciate group D streptococci were also evaluated using isolates from the water and sediment. Due to the low concentrations of faecal coliforms (FC) and faecal streptococci (FS) in river water samples, the FC/FS ratio was shown to be of little value in determining sources of contamination. High concentrations of FC and FS from sediment samples gave more credible FC/FS ratios. The actual distribution of group D streptococcal species in rivers and streams was also shown. High concentrations of all division II species (S. faecium, S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and S. faecium var. durans) were found in the water and sediment samples, with S. faecium var. durans comprising 50% of the total number of isolates. Low concentrations of division I group D streptococci (S. faecalis and varieties) were found, while only one isolation of division III group D streptococci (S. bovis and S. equinus) was made.
TI  - [Studies on the growth requirements of enterococci (author's transl)].
AB  - The growth requirements of biochemically defined strains of the enterococcus species Streptococcus faecium, S. faecalis, S. faecalis var. zymogenes and S. faecalis var. liquefaciens were compared. Arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, leucine, methionine and valine were essential and isoleucine, tryptophan, adenine and uracil were stimulatory to growth for all testes strains. Variation in the specific requirements occur for alanine, glycine, and serine representing strains differences. Threonine was essential for S. faecium strains but had no effect on the growth of strains of other species of enterococci.
TI  - Quinazolines as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase. 3. Analogs of pteroic and  isopteroic acids.
AB  - A series of 19 quinazoline analogs of pteroic and isopteroic acid was prepared with particular emphasis being placed upon carboxylic acid esters. Each compound was evaluated as an inhibitor of the dihydrofolate reductases from rat liver as well as from Streptococcus faecium. Several of the more potent inhibitors were found to be inactive against L1210 leukemia in mice at low dose levels and were lethal to mice at 100 mg/kg. Six compounds were also evaluated for antimalarial activity against Plasmodium berghei in mice. Three of these were found to be curative at higher levels, while the remaining compounds were found to be toxic.
TI  - Phage typing scheme for group D streptococci isolated from human urogenital tract.
AB  - Streptococci of Lancefield group D were isolated from 52.2% of pharyngeal, 55.5%  of urethral, 56.6% of endocervical, and 75.4% of ano-rectal specimens. Seventeen phages isolated from sewage and urogenital specimens were selected for phage typing. Four of these lysed only the strains of Streptococcus faecalis and its variety liquefaciens. Another six phages lysed only the strains of Streptococcus faecium and its variety durans. With the help of seven bacteriophages, 346 of 384 (90.1%) strains of S. faecalis and its variety liquefaciens could be classified into 27 types. Similarly, with the help of 10 other bacteriophages, 97 of 117 (82.9%) strains of S. faecium and its variety durans could be grouped into 22 types. In 72 of 87 (82.7%) cases, similar phage types were obtained at different culture sites of the same individual.
TI  - Methotrexate analogs. 6. Replacement of glutamic acid by various amino acid esters and amines.
AB  - A series of methotrexate (MTX) analogs was prepared in which the glutamic acid moiety is replaced by various amino acid esters and amines. The synthetic method consisted of the reaction of 4-amino-4-deoxy-N10-methylpteroic acid with various reagents to form intermediate mixed anhydrides, which then reacted with amino acid esters or amines to give the MTX analogs. These compounds were tested for antibacterial activity against Streptococcus faecium and for antitumor activity against L1210 leukemia in mice. Several compounds showed significant antibacterial activity; the MTX homocysteinethiolactone and MTX aspartate analogs showed marginal in vivo antitumor activity.
TI  - Synthesis and excretion of glycerol teichoic acid during growth of two streptococcal species.
AB  - Examination of both supernatant culture medium and cell pellets after exponential- and stationary-phase growth of Streptococcus mutans strain FA-1 and Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 (S. faecium) showed the presence of [-3H]glycerol-labeled material that possessed several of the properties of glycerol teichoic acid. In the supernatant medium of S. mutans FA-1, an apparently large-molecular-size material, which eluted from agarose columns with the Kd value expected of a lipoteichoic acid, was observed. Large amounts of this material were present in supernatants during the stationary phase. In contrast, with S. faecalis only an apparently lower-molecular-weight form, with a Kd consistent with deacylated glycerol teichoic acid, was found in the growth medium. Both organisms had high-molecular-weight lipoteichoic acid in the cells along with the deacylated glycerol teichoic acid. The presence of relatively large amounts of glycerol teichoic acids in the medium was considered to be a result of excretion of these compounds rather than a result of cellular lysis.
TI  - Membrane filter technique for enumeration of enterococci in marine waters.
AB  - A membrane filter procedure is described for the enumeration of enterococci in marine waters. The procedure utilizes a highly selective and somewhat differential primary isolation medium followed by an in situ substrate test for identifying colonies of those organisms capable of hydrolyzing esculin. The procedure (mE) was evaluated with known streptococci strains and field samples with regard to its accuracy, sensitivity, selectivity, precision, and comparability to existing methods. Essentially quantitative recovery was obtained with seawater-stressed cells of Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium. Neither S. bovis, S. equinus, S. mitis, nor S. salivarius grew on the medium. The selectivity of the medium was such that a 10,000-fold reduction in background organisms was obtained relative to a medium which contained no inhibitors and was incubated at 35 C. About 90% of those typical colonies designated as enterococci confirmed as such and about 12% of the colonies not so designated were, in fact, identified as enterococci. Plate to plate variability across samples approximated that expected by chance alone. Verified recoveries of enterococci from natural samples by the mE procedure, on the average, exceeded those by the KF method by one order of magnitude.
TI  - Phosphatidylkojibiosyl Diglyceride: metabolism and function as an anchor in bacterial cell membrane.
AB  - The recently discovered phosphoglycolipid, phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride (PKD), was first observed as a biosynthetic by-product of glycosyl diglyceride metabolism in Streptococcus faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790. Its structure is 1, 2-diacyl-3-O-alpha-Dglucopyranosyl-6'-O-phosphoryl- [1'', 2''-diacyl-3''-O-sn-glycerol]-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-sn-glycerol. The biosynthesis of phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride occurs by a novel transphosphatidylation reaction in which a phosphatidyl glycerol to the primary alcohol function at the 6 position of the internal glucose of kojibiosyl diglyceride. The reaction is catalyzed by a membrane-derived enzyme. Phosphatidyl-kojibiosyl diglyceride is bound covalently through a phosphodiester bond to the polyglycerol phosphate moiety of membrane lipoteichoic acid from S. faecalis. Phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride has four nonpolar long chain fatty acyl groups and appears to have the necessary physico-chemical properties to anchor the long hydrophilic glycerol phosphate polymer of lipoteichoic acid to the hydrophobic enviroment of the membrane of S. faecalis and probably other gram-positive bacteria as well.
TI  - The structure of dihydrofolate reductase. Identification of methionine residues carboxymethylated by iodoacetate with loss of catalytic activity.
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase from the amethopterin-resistant mutant (strain A) of Streptococcus faecium var. Durans was reacted with iodo[14C]acetate according to three procedures; (a) in the absence of an inhibitor, (b) in the presence of aminopterin, and (c) in absence of inhibitor, but after treatment with unlabeled iodoacetate in presence of aminopterin. The first and last procedures resulted in the loss of approximately 90% of the catalytic activity, whereas in the presence of aminopterin essentially no activity was lost. Peptides were produced from all three labeled proteins by tryptic digestion after citraconylation of the lysine residues. From the amino acid compositions and partial amino acid sequences of these peptides the position of all modified methionines in the sequence was determined. The extent of labeling at each methionine, in enzyme labeled in the different procedures, indicated that methionines 28 and 50 may be at the binding site for inhibitors and that residue 50 is less accessible to iodoacetate than is residue 28. It is likely that carboxymethylation of residue 28 is responsible for the loss of enzyme activity.
TI  - Purification and Characterization of two bacteriocins from Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Two bacteriocins were found in the supernatant fluid and in an extract of Streptococcus faecium strain EI. The small soluble enterocin EIA represented more than 90% of the total activity in the supernatant fluid, and was purified 400-fold by ammonium sulphate fractionation, gel filtration on Sephadex G-75 and chromatography on DEAE-cellulose. Enterocin EIB, with a particle weight greater than 4 x 10(6), was the predominant type in the extract. It was released in appreciable quantities after breakage of the bacteria and was purified 100-fold by differential centrifugation, chromatography on Sepharose 4B and density gradient ultracentrifugation. Enterocin EIA, a basic substance with a molecular weight of about 10000, was resistant to heat and was attacked by trypsin, whereas enterocin EIB was less thermostable and insensitive to proteolytic enzymes. The activity of enterocin EIB was unchanged by treatment with DNAase. Sensitivity to enterocin action was confined to certain strains of various enterococcus species, Streptococcus salivarius and Listeria monocytogenes; all the other Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria tested for sensitivity were unaffected by either enterocin.
TI  - Synthesis of N-10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid and related compounds.
AB  - Compound 21 (N10-methyl-4-thiofolic acid) and related compounds were prepared as  potential inhibitors of the cofactor forms of tetrahydrofolate. The preparation of 2-acetylamino-4-(benzylthio)-6-chloro-5-nitropyrimidine (4) provided an intermediate that was allowed to react with methyl p-[(3-aminoacetonyl)methylamino]benzoate oxime (16). The oxime function of the resulting 6-substituted aminopyrimidine 6 was hydrolyzed to give the corresponding acetonylaminopyrimidine 7, which on reductive cyclization gave methyl p-[[[2-amino-4-(benzylthio)-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl]methyl]methylamino]benzoate (9). This dihydropteridine was oxidized with potassium permanganate, and the product was treated successively with sodium hydrosulfide to replace the benzylthio group and with aqueous sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the ester function to give p-[[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-thioxo-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoic acid (N10-methyl-4-thiopteroic acid, 12). Another route to 12 involved the interaction of 2,5-diamino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (15) with 16 to give methyl p-[[(2-amino-4-chloro-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoate (13). Displacement of the chloro group of 13 with sodium hydrosulfide followed by the simultaneous air oxidation of the dihydropteridine ring and saponification of the ester group gave 12. After protection of the 2-amino and 4-thioxo moieties of 12, the resulting intermediate benzoic acid was coupled with diethyl L-glutamate. The product of this reaction was deblocked to give 21. Methylation of 21 gave the corresponding 4-(methylthio) derivative 22, which on reaction with hydrazine gave the 4-hydrazino analog 23 of methotrexate. Reduction of 12 and 21 with sodium hydrosulfite gave the dihydropteridines 24 and 25, respectively. The title compound was an excellent inhibitor of the growth of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 8043. However, this and related compounds were ineffective inhibitors of dihydrofolic reductase and showed no significant activity in either the KB cell culture screen or against L1210 leukemia cells in mice.
TI  - Studies of cephalothin: aminoglycoside synergism against enterococci.
AB  - Combinations of cephalothin and aminoglycoside antibiotics are not currently used in the therapy of serious enterococcal infections, because clinical trials of these combinations have been unsuccessful. Studies of 28 enterococci isolated from patients with enterococcal bacteremia suggested three possible mechanisms for this in vivo antibiotic failure: (i) a relatively high level of resistance to cephalothin among all enterococci and especially those characterized as Streptococcus faecium, (ii) a significant incidence of high-level resistance to the aminoglycosides among certain strains of enterococci, and (iii) a failure of synergism to occur when cephalothin concentrations fall below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the enterococcus, as occurs during the in vivo metabolism and excretion of this antibiotic when given in standard doses for endocarditis.
TI  - Phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride. The covalently linked lipid constituent of the membrane lipoteichoic acid from Streptococcus faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790.
AB  - Water-soluble [14C]glycerol-labeled lipoteichoic acid isolated from the membrane  preparations of Streptococcus faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790 released chloroform-soluble radioactivity upon mild acid hydrolysis. Chromatography of the radioactive, chloroform-extractable material revealed the presence of a very polar lipid (lipid I). Depending upon the conditions of acid hydrolysis, lipid I accounted for as much as 92% of the total 14C-labeled lipids released. More stringent conditions of acid hydrolysis reduced the amount of lipid I and increased the quantity of the other lipids. Lipid I on further mild acid hydrolysis yielded phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride almost quantitively. The other lipids released from the lipoteichoic acid were kojibiosyl diglyceride, monoglucosyl diglyceride, monoglyceride, diglyceride, and phosphatidylmonoglucosyl diglyceride. These lipids are most likely the degradation products of phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride because they are all simpler, structural derivatives of the phosphoglucolipid and they increase in concentration with increasing acid hydrolysis. These and other data demonstrate that the glycerol phosphate polymer of the membrane lipoteichoic acid of S. faecalis (faecium) ATCC 9790 is covalently linked through a phosphodiester bond to phosphatidylkojibiosyl diglyceride.
TI  - [Study of enterococci in milk].
AB  - Studied were a total of 270 samples of raw and pasteurized milk taken during the  various technologic states of pasteurized mild produced for consumption at the State Economic Enterprise "Serdica", establishing the enterococcus and coli titers. It was found that the enterococcus titer of the raw milk varies from 10(-3) up to 10(-6), and the titer of the pasteurized milk at the enterprise and upon delivery through its commercial channels is from 1 up to 10(-3). The enterococcus titer of milk that was pasteurized and was kept for 24 hours at 4-5 degrees C was found to range from 1 to 10(-3), and of milk kept at 18-22 degrees C --from (0(-1) to 10(-6). Full coincidence of the enterococcus titer with the values of the coli titer was found only for pasteurized milk kept under refrigerator conditions. Along with the coli titer the enterococcus one may be used as a subsidiary means in a more strict bacteriologic control, however, it may not be referred to as the only criterion replacing the coli values in the hygiene evaluation of milk. All species of enterococci in varying counts are established in both raw and pasteurized milk. Prevailing are the strains of the Str. faecium group -- 43.2 per cent, and those of the Str. faecalis group -- 24.6 per cent.
TI  - Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium in infected dental root canals at filling and their susceptibility to azidocillin and some comparable antibiotics.
AB  - The study was performed on 612 routine cultures of material obtained from root canals of teeth at the time of filling (r-cultures) by students at the Department of Endodontics during a continuous period of one year. Twenty-nine isolates from 27 (29.3%) of the 92 positive cultures filled the criteria of enterococci (Sherman, 1937) and had demonstrable group D-antigen. With a set of tests these isolates were identified as follows: Strep. faecalis subsp. faecalis (10), Strep. faecalis subsp. zymogenes (3), Strep. faecalis subsp. liquefaciens (8), atypical variants of Strep. faecalis (6), Strep. faecium var. faecium (1) and Strep. faecium var. durans (1). Five tests in the present study clearly differentiated Strep. faecalis from Strep. faecium i.e. fermentation of sorbitol, glycerol (anaerobic) and melezitose, tolerance to potassium tellurite (0.1%) (positive for Strep. faecalis) and production of hydrogen peroxide (positive for Strep. faecium). In the inocula 10(3) or more colony forming units of enterococci were found more often of other identified microorganisms. This means that enterococci are of special interest in studies on the influence of infection at the time of filling of root canals on the prognosis of root canal therapy. The isolates were also tested for susceptibility to azidocillin, ampicillin, penicillin-G, penicillin-V and erythromycin with the paper disc method. All the isolates were susceptible to azidocillin and ampicillin (sensitivity group I), while the majority of the isolates showed a lower susceptibility to the other three antibiotics (sensitivity group II). The significance of these findings in the choice of prophylactic antibiotic to prevent bacterial endocarditis in patients with a history of rheumatic or congenital heart disease are discussed, when bacteremia from dental procedures may be expected.
TI  - Improved isolation and differentiation of enterococci in cheese.
AB  - Further documentation of an enterococcus selective differential (ESD) medium was  obtained in isolations from eight different cheeses. An improved differentiation of tetrazolium salt (2, 3, 5-triphenyl tetrazolium hydrochloride [TTC])-reducing strains of Streptococcus faecalis from TTC-nonreducing or TTC-faintly-reducing Streptococcus faecium was attained. The sensitivity of the medium was evaluated in comparison with that of KF streptococcal, Pfizer selective enterococcus (PSE), the medium of Reinbold, Swern, and Hussong (RSH), and the medium of Saraswat, Clark, and Reinbold (SCR). Selective counts, rate of colony formation, and ease of isolation and differentiation of colonies were examined. The specificity of the medium was also investigated. ESD supported the fastest rate of growth and the maximum size of colonies; counts in this medium were in most cases possible with 17 h of incubation, whereas the other media required 24 to 48 h. A presumptive identification of 1,077 isolates by four biochemical tests disclosed that SCR, RSH, and ESD selected high, comparable percentages of strains that approximated most closely the typical description of enterococci (66, 60.1, and 58%, respectively). Low percentages (21.1 and 30.7%) were yielded by KF and PSE. The utility of ESD for a rapid, presumptive identification of enterococci was confirmed by serological and biochemical testing of color TTC-differentiated colonies isolated from 18 cheeses.
TI  - Development of a selective enterococcus medium based on manganese ion deficiency, sodium azide, and alkaline pH.
AB  - Rogosa broth, without its salt supplement and dissolved in deionized water, was adapted for the selective isolation and enumeration of enterococci. This medium supported good growth of enterococci, but it suppressed growth of other lactic acid bacteria. The sensitivity and specificity of the medium were tested after addition of various increasing concentrations of NaN(3) against known strains of enterococci and other bacteria. Many strains of Streptococcus faecium showed low azide tolerance; optimal growth was obtained at a concentration of 0.01% NaN(3), which totally or partially inhibited unrelated species of lactic acid bacteria. The selectivity of the medium was further increased by pH adjustment to 9.6. Carbonate and Tween 80 were added to overcome partial inhibition of enterococcal growth by the new combination of selective conditions. The final medium was evaluated in agar form in isolations from human and animal feces, polluted water, meat, and dairy products. Counts were obtained after 16 to 17 h of incubation at 37 C. The isolates satisfactorily conformed to the group characteristics of enterococci.
TI  - Triterpenoid carotenoids and related lipids. Triterpenoid monohydroxy- and monoglucosyloxy-carotenoids from Streptococcus faecium UNH 564P.
AB  - 1. The characterization of two novel triterpenoid xanthophylls occurring in Streptococcus faecium UNH 564P is described. 2. Both are derived formally, and probably biosynthetically, from the C(30) analogue of neurosporene and have been identified as 4-hydroxy-4,4'-diaponeurosporene and its glucoside, 4-d-glucopyranosyloxy-4,4'-diaponeurosporene. 3. Problems associated with the use of specific glucosidases in defining the anomerism of carotenoid glucosides are discussed.
TI  - Triterpenoid carotenoids and related lipids. The triterpenoid carotenes of Streptococcus faecium UNH 564P.
AB  - 1. The occurrence of a novel series of triterpenoid carotenes in Streptococcus faecium UNH 564P is reported. 2. This series, which comprises the C(30) analogues of phytoene, phytofluene, zeta-carotene, 7,8,11,12-tetrahydrolycopene and neurosporene, appears to be analogous to the C(40) Porter-Lincoln series and a pathway of triterpenoid carotene dehydrogenation is proposed to account for the formation of these compounds. 3. Two cis isomers of the C(30) analogue of neurosporene are described. 4. An appropriate system of nomenclature for these novel compounds is proposed.
TI  - Inactivation of dried bacteria and bacterial spores by means of gamma irradiation at high temperatures.
AB  - Dried preparations with Streptococcus faecium, strain A(2)1, and spores of Bacillus sphaericus, strain C(I)A, normally used for control of the microbiological efficiency of radiation sterilization plants and preparations with spores of Bacillus subtilis, normally used for control of sterilization by dry heat, formalin, and ethylene oxide, as well as similar preparations with Micrococcus radiodurans, strain R(1), and spores of Bacillus globigii (B. subtilis, var. niger) were gamma irradiated with dose rates from 16 to 70 krad/h at temperatures from 60 to 100 C. At 80 C the radiation response of the spore preparations was the same as at room temperature, whereas the radiation resistance of the preparations with the two vegetative strains was reduced. At 100 C the radiation response of preparations with spores of B. subtilis was unaffected by the high temperature, whereas at 16 and and 25 krad/h the radiation resistance of the radiation-resistant sporeformer B. sphaericus, strain C(I)A, was reduced to the level of radiation resistance of preparations with spores of B. subtilis. It is concluded that combinations of heat and gamma irradiation at the temperatures and dose rates tested may have very few practical applications in sterilization of medical equipment.
TI  - Penicillin-tobramycin synergism against enterococci: a comparison with penicillin and gentamicin.
AB  - Combinations of penicillin plus tobramycin have been compared with penicillin plus gentamicin against 27 strains of enterococci isolated from blood cultures. Penicillin plus gentamicin was synergistic against all strains. The combination of penicillin plus tobramycin was equally effective against strains of Streptococcus facalis, but was ineffective against all four strains of S. faecium tested.
TI  - Differentiation of some enterococci by gas chromatography.
AB  - Relative fatty acid compositions of 37 enterococci were examined by gas chromatography. Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, and S. faecium var. durans yielded similar fatty acid patterns. Strains of S. faecium var. casseliflavus, and a motile yellow-pigmented streptococcus, contained very low levels of C(19:0) cyclopropane fatty acid and four unidentified components, compared to the other strains of enterococci examined. There were no significant differences in the fatty acid patterns of enterococci grouped according to plant, animal, or human source.
TI  - Enterococci in insects.
AB  - Enterococci were obtained from 213 of 403 insects cultured during a 14-month period, in numbers from 10(3) to 3 x 10(7)/g of insect. Insects were taken only from nonurban, wild, and cultivated fields and woods. In species of insects carrying them, enterococci were not always present in every individual cultured, and often more than one species of enterococcus occurred within a species. Enterococci were obtained from certain insects taken in the field during the dormant season, suggesting their role as overwintering agents. They were generally present in species feeding on nectar, succulent plant parts, and on and ir forest litter, but not from insects feeding on less succulent leaves and stems. Streptococcus faecalis was recovered from 32%, Streptococcus faecium from 22.4%, and Streptococcus faecium var. casseliflavus from 43.5% of members of the 37 taxa of insects. S. faecalis and S. faecium var. casseliflavus exhibit a high percent of conformity to the properties published for them. The heterogeneity in properties of S. faecium is similar to that found for the species taken from plants. Many fail to grow in broth at 45 C or in broth containing 6.5% NaCl; 50% of the cultures ferment both melezitose and melibiose, and a few ferment neither sugar. The remainder ferment melibiose only. Failure to reduce methylene blue in milk by S. faecalis and S. faecium is correlated with the inability to ferment lactose. More than 93% of the cultures of S. faecalis digest casein in milk from the top downward, following the production of a soft, flowing curd. Because this property is not characteristic of S. faecalis taken from humans, the reaction in litmus milk is suggested as a means of differentiation between cultures of remote and innocent origin in nature and recent, human pollution.
TI  - Growth of Streptococcus faecium in the presence of lysozyme.
AB  - Streptococcus faecium can grow normally in the presence of lysozyme, despite the  observation that cell suspensions of the organism are lysed readily by the enzyme. Growth in the presence of lysozyme is not due to resistant cells, and the culture is lysed after growth if the pH of the medium is not allowed to drop too low for lysozyme activity. Growth followed by lysis in the presence of lysozyme was not exhibited by other organisms tested which were either significantly more resistant or more sensitive to lysozyme than S. faecium. Lysozyme was active on the cell wall of S. faecium during growth in the presence of 200 mug of the enzyme per ml in a complex medium. It appears that, when actively metabolizing, S. faecium can synthesize the cell wall at a greater rate than lysozyme can hydrolyze it. Thus, the organism is capable of growth in the presence of the enzyme. A large variation in the lytic responses of enterococcal cell suspensions to lysozyme was dependent on the strain used, the growth phase from which the culture was harvested, and the medium in which the culture was grown.
TI  - Some properties of two autolytic-defective mutants of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790.
AB  - The isolation and some properties of two mutants of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 (S. faecium) which autolyze at a much slower rate than the wild type are described. Compared with the wild type, mutant E71 autolyzed more slowly, contained less active but more latent autolysin in the isolated wall fraction, and possessed a wall of very similar chemical composition and degree of cross-bridging. Ultrastructural studies of exponential phase cells showed that cells of E71 were on the average slightly longer and had slightly thickened walls compared to the wild type. Mutant E81 autolyzed much more slowly, grew exponentially in long chains (8 to 40 cells compared with mainly diplococci), contained much less active and latent autolysin in the wall, and possessed a wall of very similar chemical composition but with about twice the content of N-terminal groups. Mutant E81 walls were more susceptible to isolated autolysin but possessed an autolysin of the same specificity as the wild type. Ultrastructurally E81 cells were, on the average, significantly longer and had thicker walls than the wild type. Mutant E71 may be partially blocked at either transport of autolysin to the wall or in conversion of latent to active autolysin. The pleitropic effects noted in mutant E81 have been taken to suggest a possible membrane defect and to support the role of the autolysin in cell separation.

TI  - Induction of enterococcal L-forms by the action of lysozyme.
AB  - Suspensions of enterococci were treated with lysozyme in the presence of osmotic  stabilizers. The resulting osmotically fragile bodies prepared from Streptococcus faecium strain F24 and S. faecalis strain E1 gave rise to L-forms under optimal osmotic and nutritional conditions for treatment and subsequent growth. The most critical component of the growth medium, to obtain maximum yields, was the nature and concentration of the added salt. The two most effective salts were sodium chloride and ammonium chloride in the range of 2 to 3% (w/v) added to a suitable agar base. Ammonium chloride was more versatile, because it could be used with either sucrose or polyethylene glycol 4000 as the osmotic stabilizer for preparation and dilution of the osmotically fragile bodies. Sodium chloride would not consistently support growth of S. faecium F24 as L-forms when polyethylene glycol 4000 was used as the osmotic stabilizer during lysozyme treatment. Time-course studies of concurrent cell wall removal and L-form induction suggested that maximal induction required only cell wall damage rather than complete wall removal. This method for induction of L-forms from a suspension of enterococci is a significant improvement over other presently known methods.

AB  - The amino acid composition of the murein (peptidoglycan) of 75 strains of enterococci was investigated. All strains designated Streptococcus faecalis according to their physiological properties contained the lysine-alanine type of murein; all strains classified as S. faecium contained the lysine-aspartic acid type of murein.
TI  - Activities of arginine dihydrolase and phosphatase in Streptococcus faecalis and  Streptococcus faecium.
AB  - Strains of Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium are known to produce ammonia from arginine, but only S. faecalis couples the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) produced through the arginine dihydrolase pathway to growth processes. The specific activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes were found to be much lower in S. faecium (0.01 to 0.10) than in S. faecalis (0.24 to 1.60). Phosphatase activities in both strains were similar (up to 0.11), but equaled or exceeded the activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes in S. faecium. The failure of S. faecium to show increased growth in arginine media is explained on the basis of low activities of the arginine dihydrolase enzymes coupled with sufficient phosphatase activity to negate any benefit from ATP formed.

TI  - Group Q streptococci. II. Nutritional characteristics and growth relationship to  thymine, folate, and folinate.
AB  - The vitamin requirements of the group Q streptococci (Streptococcus avium) and the established enterococcal species (S. faecalis and S. faecium) paralleled one another, although S. avium did not characteristically require riboflavine or pyridoxal. S. avium was further differentiated in that it required thymine for growth initiation whether or not folate was present. Folate was stimulatory in the presence of sub-optimal concentrations of thymine, as well as during the early growth period with optimal thymine concentrations. Folinate completely replaced the thymine requirement, and the S. avium strains required significantly higher concentrations than did Pediococcus cerevisiae 8081. The requirement pattern for folate and related compounds was compared, and marked differences were observed in the requirements of S. faecalis, S. faecium, S. avium, and P. cerevisiae.

X-ray diffraction studies on metal deposition in group D streptococci. J. Bacteriol. 92:1311-1314. 1966.-Streptococcus faecalis N83 and S. faecium K6A reduced several compounds of Group VI elements to the elemental form, but reduced none of several compounds tested containing elements of other groups. The elemental tellurium deposited by S. faecium K6A was in general of a larger particle size than that deposited by S. faecalis N83 as judged from X-ray diffraction analysis. The particle size of the deposited tellurium was correlated with the blackness of the precipitate produced by cells growing in the presence of tellurite. A black and gray variation was observed in S. faecium K6A which was considered to be due to particle size, the amount of tellurium present, and the location of the deposited tellurium. The gray color of S. faecium K6A was not due to the presence of any oxidized tellurium products.

TI  - Effect of lactic acid bacteria on growth of Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of Staphylococcus aureus in Trypticase Soy Broth (BBL). Some of the effectors, e.g., Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecium, Lactobacillus lactis, L. brevis, and Leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of S. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most cultures were inhibitory, and some (S. faecium and L. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the Staphylococcus. Low-temperature meat lactobacilli and Leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited S. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 C throughout its growth. Streptococcus faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 C, as well. When the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat Lactobacillus, and L. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 C, and all but the meat Lactobacillus did so at 22 C. A ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 C, except that S. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by S. faecalis. A ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. In general, the more effector bacteria there were in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of S. aureus. Inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 C, less so at 20 or 25 C, and least at 30 or 37 C, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. Results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of S. aureus were similar, for the most part.

TI  - ISOLATION AND IDENTIFICATION OF ENTEROCOCCI FROM THE INTESTINAL TRACT OF THE RAT.
AB  - Rogers, C. G. (Department of National Health and Welfare, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada), and W. B. Sarles. Isolation and identification of enterococci from the intestinal tract of the rat. J. Bacteriol. 88:965-973. 1964.-Surface inoculation was employed in a comparison of three selective media, M-enterococcus (M) agar, thallium acetate-glucose (TITG) agar, and KF-streptococcus (KF) agar, for enumeration and isolation of enterococci from contents of the digestive tract of the rat. Similar yields of enterococcus colonies were obtained with M, TITG, and KF agar. When cecal contents were examined, species identification of 120 isolates, 40 from each medium, revealed only minor differences in selective activity. Streptococcus faecalis and its variety zymogenes represented 55 to 63% of the isolates from each medium; the remaining strains resembled S. durans or S. faecium. More than 99% of the isolates failed to survive the heat-tellurite tolerance test. Periodic analyses of intestinal contents from young rats indicated that enterococci became established in the gut from 10 to 14 days after birth. The species isolated most frequently on M agar was S. faecalis var. zymogenes. When rats were fed a purified diet with casein as the source of nitrogen, S. faecalis var. zymogenes predominated among isolates from contents of the small intestine plated on M agar. This species was largely replaced by others resembling S. durans or S. faecium when mixtures of l-amino acids provided the dietary nitrogen. Nineteen enterococcus isolates, representing all that met the Sherman criteria, required arginine, glutamic acid, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, tryptophan, and valine; of these, two strains required in addition threonine, glycine, and lysine; four required threonine and glycine; two, threonine and lysine; and one, threonine.
TI  - FUMARATE REDUCTION AND ITS ROLE IN THE DIVERSION OF GLUCOSE FERMENTATION BY STREPTOCOCCUS FAECALIS.
AB  - Deibel, R. H. (American Meat Institute Foundation, Chicago, Ill.), and M. J. Kvetkas. Fumarate reduction and its role in the diversion of glucose fermentation by Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 88:858-864. 1964.-Fumarate diverts the normal fermentation of glucose by Streptococcus faecalis FB82, as shown by the production of increased amounts of CO(2), formate, acetate, and acetoin, and decreased formation of lactate and ethanol. Experiments with d-glucose-1-C(14), in which low levels of labeled CO(2) were recovered, indicated that C-1 cleavage of the glucose molecule was not involved. The presence of fumarate afforded consistently larger cell crops in growth studies with glucose and other energy sources. On a molar growth-yield basis, anaerobically grown, glucose-fumarate cultures were equivalent to aerobically grown, glucose cultures. The reduction of fumarate by cell suspensions indicated that glucose, gluconate, and, to a lesser extent, glycerol and mannitol could serve as hydrogen donors. Several common metabolic inhibitors had no effect upon the fumarate reductase system in cell suspensions, although some sensitivity to acidic pH was noted. Significant levels of succinate oxidation activity were not detected. Fumarate reductase activity was demonstrated in all five S. faecalis strains tested. Distribution of this ability in S. faecium strains was variable, ranging from activity comparable with that of S. faecalis to total inactivity. The observations support the conclusion that fumarate functions as an alternate hydrogen acceptor, thus allowing pyruvate to participate in the energy-yielding phosphoroclastic and dismutation pathways.
TI  - PYRUVATE FERMENTATION BY STREPTOCOCCUS FAECALIS.
AB  - Deibel, R. H. (American Meat Institute Foundation, Chicago, Ill.), and C. F. Niven, Jr. Pyruvate fermentation by Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 88:4-10. 1964.-Streptococcus faecalis, as opposed to S. faecium, utilizes pyruvate as an energy source for growth. The fermentation is adaptive, as demonstrated by growth experiments in a casein-hydrolysate medium and the fermentation of pyruvate by cell suspensions. The principal products of pyruvate catabolism were acetoin, CO(2), and lactic, acetic, and formic acids, although carbon recoveries were low due to the formation of slime. End-product analyses suggested that both the phosphoroclastic and dismutation systems were active in pyruvate breakdown. Studies with cell-free extracts indicated a thiamine diphosphate requirement for active pyruvate catabolism. The involvement of lipoic acid in the phosphoroclastic system was investigated, and, although inconclusive results were obtained, no association of this cofactor with phosphoroclastic activity could be made.
TI  - HOST RANGE OF CERTAIN VIRULENT AND TEMPERATE BACTERIOPHAGES ATTACKING GROUP D STREPTOCOCCI.
AB  - Brock, Thomas D. (Indiana University, Bloomington). Host range of certain virulent and temperate bacteriophages attacking group D streptococci. J. Bacteriol. 88:165-171. 1964.-Host range studies with five bacteriophages isolated from sewage showed that a high degree of strain specificity occurred among the species Streptococcus faecalis, S. faecalis var. zymogenes, and S. faecalis var. liquefaciens. Certain phages were able to attack various members of these subgroups but not other members. A high degree of strain specificity was also found with respect to eight phages attacking strains of S. faecium. Many strains of this latter group were resistant to all the phages available. The only firm conclusion was that no phage attacked both S. faecium and S. faecalis strains. In several selected strains of the S. faecalis-liquefaciens-zymogenes group, resistance to several virulent phages seemed to be related to the presence of certain prophages in these strains. A search for transduction with the temperate phages was unsuccessful. Mutants of S. faecium 8043 resistant to certain growth-factor analogues showed unpredictable changes in resistance and sensitivity to two virulent phages.
TI  - Utilization of arginine as an energy source for the growth of Streptococcus faecalis.
AB  - Deibel, R. H. (American Meat Institute Foundation, Chicago, Ill.). Utilization of arginine as an energy source for the growth of Streptococcus faecalis. J. Bacteriol. 87:988-992. 1964.-Although both Streptococcus faecalis and S. faecium (and its variety durans) hydrolyze arginine, the utilization of this amino acid as an energy source appears to have taxonomic utility, as only S. faecalis and its varieties can couple the resultant energy with growth processes. Utilization of arginine by S. faecalis in a semisynthetic, casein-hydrolysate medium requires small concentrations of a fermentable carbohydrate (0.05%), presumably for synthetic reactions. The arginine analogue, agmatine, is utilized as an energy source by S. faecalis but not by S. faecium, and only approxinately 50% of the latter strains hydrolyzed this compound. Other ureido- and guanido-containing compounds tested were neither utilized as an energy source nor deaminated.
TI  - PHYSIOLOGY OF THE ENTEROCOCCI AS RELATED TO THEIR TAXONOMY.
AB  - Deibel, R. H. (American Meat Institute Foundation, Chicago, Ill.), Donald E. Lake, and C. F. Niven, Jr. Physiology of the enterococci as related to their taxonomy. J. Bacteriol. 86:1275-1282. 1963-Studies on a collection of enterococci isolated from diverse sources have confirmed the existence of two distinct species, namely, Streptococcus faecalis and Streptococcus faecium. In contrast with S. faecium, S. faecalis characteristically ferments melezitose, sorbitol, glycerol (anaerobically), citrate, and gluconate; fails to ferment arabinose and melibiose; has strong reducing capacities as demonstrated by prompt reduction of litmus in milk or tetrazolium in an agar medium; initiates growth on an agar medium containing 0.04% potassium tellurite; does not require folic acid for growth; and does not produce strong greening in blood agar. S. liquefaciens and S. zymogenes differ from S. faecalis only in their proteolytic capacities and, therefore, deserve only varietal status. Some S. faecalis and S. faecium strains are proteolytic when tested on agar media. S. durans differs from S. faecium only in its inability to ferment arabinose and mannitol, and the failure of most strains to ferment sucrose. Therefore, it should be considered as a variety of S. faecium. It is recommended that the term "enterococcus" be used only when referring to S. faecalis and S. faecium, and their respective varieties.
TI  - SURVEY OF THE BACTERIOCINES OF ENTEROCOCCI.
AB  - Brock, Thomas D. (Indiana University, Bloomington), Barbara Peacher, and Deborah  Pierson. A survey of the bacteriocines of enterococci. J. Bacteriol. 86:702-707. 1963.-A survey has been made of bacteriocine production by a wide variety of well-characterized strains of group D streptococci. On the basis of spectrums and sensitivity to chloroform, heat, and proteolytic enzymes, five distinct bacteriocines can be defined. Type 1 is produced by all Streptococcus zymogenes (S. faecalis var. zymogenes) strains, is active against a wide variety of gram-positive bacteria, and is also a hemolysin. Type 2 is produced by some S. liquefaciens (S. faecalis var. liquefaciens) strains, and acts on many enterococci as well as on certain other lactic acid bacteria. Type 3 is produced by certain strains of both S. faecalis and S. faecium, and inhibits a wide variety of group D streptococci, but is inactive against all other lactic acid bacteria tested except Leuconostoc citrovorum. Type 4 is produced by certain S. faecium strains and resembles in certain ways the type 3 activity, but differs from it in other ways. Type 5 has been found to be produced by only one proteolytic strain of S. zymogenes, and this bacteriocine has a very narrow spectrum. The strain that produces this bacteriocine also produces type 1 activity. No strain is sensitive to a bacteriocine of the type it produces.
TI  - Occurrence of enterococci on plants in a wild environment.
AB  - Enterococci were obtained from 14% of nearly 2,200 flowers, 3.4% of non-floral structures of angiosperms, and from 8.3% of samples of soil, water, and lesser plants of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, an area little influenced by the presence of man. The enterococci were recovered from one or more flowers or flower clusters of 1,515 samples in 47 taxa, but not from flowers of 67 taxa with 654 samples. The per cent of recovery was influenced adversely by dense forest cover and by increase in elevation, as compared with recovery from flowers in sunny locations in the lower elevations. The per cent recovery increased directly with rising seasonal temperature, with the maximal per cent of recovery occurring in September. In no instance did all samples of a species of flower or plant yield enterococci on culture, and with only three genera, Cacalia, Delphinium, and Mitchella, were the bacteria obtained from more than 50% of the samples. Approximately 11% of the cultures isolated were identified as Streptococcus faecalis, 64% as the soft curd producing, caseolytic variant of S. faecalis, 4% as S. faecalis var. zymogenes, and 20% as S. faecium. The per cent distribution of these species on plants was reasonably similar to the distribution within wild animals in the same environment. It was concluded that the enterococci occurring on plants arise commonly from the wild animals, and that they do not represent plant-specific species or variants of the enterococci.
TI  - Occurrence of enterococci in animals in a wild environment.
AB  - Enterococci were obtained from the feces of 71% of 216 mammals, 86% of 70 reptiles, and 32% of 22 birds sampled in a truly wild environment, the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Patterns of food dependence and also of species dependence were observed. Among the lower classes of the primarily herbivorous mammals, the enterococci occurred sporadically; however, of the six species of Sciuridae, the gray squirrel, and of four species of Cricetidae, the red-backed mouse, the enterococci appear to be natural hosts. The enterococci were not obtained from most specimens of moles, shrews, or rabbits but they were obtained from most specimens of bats and from the carnivorous mammals, such as fox, bear, raccon, skunk, and boar. Streptococcus faecalis was obtained from 12 reptiles, and a caseolytic variant was obtained from 37 specimens of the reptiles. The strongly reducing, tellurite-tolerant species, S. faecalis, its caseolytic variant, and S. faecalis var. zymogenes were isolated from 127 or 41% of 308 specimens cultured. S. faecium was recovered from 87 or 28% of the animals, chiefly from the wild boar (60 of 64 trials) and the black bear. S. zymogenes was obtained from 1 of 31 bats, 3 of 12 raccoons, and 1 of 3 owls.
